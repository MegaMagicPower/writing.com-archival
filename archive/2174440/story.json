We're done, My boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank You, Grandma.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm glad you found that old tome and brought it to me, your parents didn't like that you entered into the arcane arts.\" Said a kindly old woman as she sat down on the old, rocky chair, you bowed to her holding an old book, you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not here, aren't they.\" The old woman chuckled on that response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they're not.\" She says and sighed \"Your mother has such a promising potential but she discarded it all for meaningless material gain.\" She says in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to prove you that I'm not like her.\" You said to her, you were an average guy, with an average family or so you though, turns out that your family from your mother side has been mages from the longest of time and frankly you were skeptical until you found the tome and saw its content, you started doing what its written out of pure boredom and you saw how each practice began to get genuine effects on you and your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou show it to your grandmother, she implied to be a witch in the past but originally thought to be a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was serious about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe taught you more than just what its told in the book, she thought you how to mold reality around you, to become invisible, shrink, grows and Teleports and even planewalking and mass alteration. But warned you that using all those things at once may tire you as you didn't have the mana pools required to do those things, so far, she gave you the \"basics.\" to experiment with it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm too, too bad that this is far I can teach you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Arcane School encourage the apprentices to create their own spells and experiment with potions to branch out their own type of style, there are guides on how so written in that book but you're in your own.\" She says \"My spells are too complex for you to learn, built and made with extra steps to follow with utmost perfection, not fit for trial and error unless you wanna lose some part of your body or don't mind scarring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched in the thought of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry sweetie, creating spells may sound like a chore but its quite practical to sharpen your abilities and knowledge. Alternatively, you could try just planewalking and pick a power from that dimension and work on a spell from it.\" The old lady says \"I did it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You ask in disbelief \"Is really that easy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, you still had to create the basis of the spell, sorcery and managed the mana required from it.\" She says \"But you'll jump many steps doing it this way, besides, the travels themselves are reward enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, so go to a different plane and see, seems easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it is. sometimes it is more productive than it advertised by the school.\" She confessed, \"sometimes, mages take vacations to the multiverse at large, sometimes, even get new lives traveling.\" She then turns grim \"But many either get lost traveling or lose their lives on worlds they aren't prepared for. This is the reason why it is a good idea to create spells before going into travels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped a bit nervous, the old woman chuckled \"I think I scared you enough, be sure to go into universes you know before thinking on travel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Think of a Universe?\" You asked in curiosity, your grandmother nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my boy, you see, all those works of fiction? they're real, my boy.\"  She reveals with a fond smile \"The Multiverse is big and ever expanding, for every work fiction, every idea, every story told or even a concept, its real somewhere in the everlasting multiverse and our craft allows us to explore it all, All we have to do... is to think about it the moment we leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That's it? I thought it would involve a very complicated ritual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no.\" The old woman chuckled as she shakes her head \"Those are television cliches, there is not ritual only the right incantations and even then, its short one that takes like four words, the right mana output and the thought of the world you wanna go in.\" That's sound amazing, imagine go to different worlds like Naruto, Smash Bros or<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... that's sound really easy, Too easy, Any universe I can think of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear.\" She confirmed \"Oh, I remember when I went in my first travel, I tought on my favorite book series, it was my ideal fantasy world and the idea of going to it made it a dream come true, I even met my heroes... it was then I noticed something was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I forgot to tell you this... you see, the multiverse is big, we go to a universe that we believe we know but upon seeing it for the very first time in our own eyes, we start to see details that don't add up from what we know, it can range from smaller, barely noticeable things but then are times we see things completely different that make no sense with the information we know. It is then we truly come to understand that not all what we know can be applied to the real universe we visit.\" She paused. \"My heroes were the same, spiritually but they were different, as in different genders.\" Your eyes widen on this <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Main Heroine I used to idolize was, in reality, a hunk of a man and he was... really good with his <i>hands</i>\" She chuckled, you cringe, trying to not think of your elderly grandmother getting all frisky with an Adonis. \"We dated even, the love interest was still a man and he didn't bend that way but our relationship didn't make it.\" She then looked grim \"Just like in the story, he died in a heroic fashion, I tried my best to make the ending different, to let him share the same fate as the heroine from the book but as the chosen one, that type of sacrifice was needed for the world to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, grandma...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's fine, dear, I moved on. But yes, remember what I've told you and you'll be a splendid Sorcerer by then and now please, can you help me bake some Cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts been months since that talk, Your grandmother went missing days after that, giving you a letter that she went on vacation and to visit some \"friends\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what that means, it was time for you to do the same to complete your training and besides, you may as well enjoy your time as you go through the multiverse, before making the portal, you began to start by placing a runic beacon to an object of yours, this beacon was to help you return back to your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, you began the incantation of the portal, the recited the words as your mana flared up, a purple vortex appeared right in front of you, swirling with arcane energy. You had a world in mind and grinned<br>\r\nas you walked straight into the vortex and onto the new world, one thta could help you progress or just to observe and interact with the locals, to see characters of fiction made real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world you thought was...</span></div></div>",

With Pegasus being similar to ancient Greeks or Romans, a set of pegasus towns unified into a mini kingdom by the iron hoof of Ponious Ceasar, they were the more warlike and expansionist minded of all the other tribes. They conquered and enslaved ground dwellers for food, riches and were the owners of the skies, they were on odds with Gryphons and Dragons for this aerial control<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth Ponies has parallels with the Portuguese, Spaniards, Russians and Frenchs during the Renaissance era and unlike the warlike pegasus, they were farmers, miners and traders their goods to the Pegasus so they get the weather conditions needed for their farms and livelihood. It was also a way to prevent the pegasus or unicorns to enslave them by enabling necessary trade. They grew resentful of the two tribes because of their demanding nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorns had parallels with Medieval England, France, and Germany and were the most magical minded of the group as noted for their horns, it was also made them believe to be superior to the other tribes because of this trait. With their power combined, they could move the sun and the moon at will and were rightfully feared of this trait alone which only helped in feeding their egos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tribes depended on each other despite the apparent hostility they have with each other. The Unicorns believed the Earth Ponies and Pegasus being Primitives and Brutes, Pegasis believed the two tribes to be spineless cowards and Earth Ponies disliked the arrogance or warlike nature of the two other species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you didn't find much difference to the show, they united after seeing that fighting over a land big enough for the three tribes weren't worth it and the cold conditions of their old land, Equinian, were following over thanks to the wendigos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, all seems normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a fourth tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne that had a kingdom rooted in Equestria long before the other tribes arrived<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><b>The Alicorn Kingdom. It has no real-world parallel but found in Fantasy and Pop Culture, Elves. Living in spirally cities or none by having a perfect communion with the forests, like the Everfree, It is said that they have much more power than all the other tribes but how they lived or what happened to them is a total mystery, they simply disappeared once the tribes settled in Equestria alongside several races that used to call them home, Like Pixies, Fairies and... Humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans were here too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily began searching for more info of humans in Equestria with your lexicon but it's scarce and limited but found inscriptions coming from a book called the \"The Last of the Alicorn's legacy\" and has a page dedicated to the \"Kingdom of Men\".<br>\r\n</b></div><br>\r\nThat was the information of your lexicon can provide, resuming the lengthy manuscript<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><b>\"Enemy of Dragons, Rivals of Griffins, And Stelward Ally to the Alicorn Kingdom, Led by the Lord King Karl Gwyn, Relying on Metal, Stone, Faith and strong will\" a Prose of the last known Alicorn Queen, Solaria Dawn</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt taled a time before Equestrian's foundation, in how the Human Kingdom defended the Alicorns from total annihilation caused by the expansionist Dragons Warlords. In return, The Alicorns though Humans their form of magic and the two Kingdoms pushed back the Dragon Onslaught from their lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything else beyond that was a complete mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are theories such a war of mutual destruction to grand exodus but nothing really conclusive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven known Alicorns such as Luna and Celestia are relatively young that only appeared after ten thousand years of the civilizations' disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFascinating, so You're not the only human in Equestria... well, they might think you hail from an ancient kingdom that used to exist BEFORE the ponies. And the Alicorns? You know that Celestia and Luna were created by the Tree of Harmony, maybe they were created based on the real alicorns that somehow went... extinct?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might have to continue to go to the library for more books for more knowledge to the topic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext!</span></div></div>",

Equestria has an ever-evolving culture but one that remained the same was the understanding of their friends through intimate means. This movement is what saved early Equestrian from a secured extinction and what helped the colonization, expansion, and foundation far easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the early days, Equestria's stallion population was far less numerous than it is today and with the threat of extinction looming, the tribes begrudgingly began breeding with one another, creating herds around the Stallions with Mares of different tribes, the result ended favorably. What initiated like an obligation to preserve the pony species ended in a positive experience for all those involved, creating interracial friendship and family units, over time, the predijuce between tribes began to subside rapidly and thus making a unified species moved to a single goal on living together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, Sex is more common than in other cultures and sometimes used as a recreational enjoyinment rather than just reproductive porpuse although for both isn't uncommon among herds, adventurous singles or married. Ever passing centuries clothes found more useful to display status, in a social gathering or for exposition and fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis behavoir isn't just limited to just ponies, Due to the friendly Equestrian nature, mating between other species such as Dragons, Changelings, Kirin, and Griffins are noted as well even foals born from said breeding are recorded, Most children born are ponies but gryphon cubs, changelings nymph and dragon whelpling birth and hatching are known. Changeling shares this kind of libidious nature as it as a great source of love and lust to feed on. Griffins, mostly singles, often take treks and vacations in Equestria. Dragons-Pony breeding are extremely rare due to size difference but it is rumored that Thestrals has Dragon Origins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Sexually open Equestria, eh?

To have colt today is considered a blessing from the stars themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is estimated that Equestria has a male-female population ratio of 10 to 90, favoring mares. Because of this, Herds and Polygamy has turned more popular while monogamy has been declining steadily. Due to the gender disparity, Stallions are considered as the fair gender and are coddle from colthood to stallionhood, making them seem frail and sometimes, inept; they're expected to have passive jobs as creators, farmers, traders, shapers, builders and caretakers while mares take the more active roles such as pioneers, adventurers, and explorers although males taking more active role isn't discouraged either, Many of those stallions are in the \"royal guards\" doing their duty to protect the capital city and the princesses with military training but in reality they're protected by the real Equestrian Guard conformed by half the Mares population in Canterlot and the Princesses themselves they're sworn to protect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquestria is entering through a hard time now with a declining population that other species and kingdoms are eyeing the land closely, more likely for an easy conquest in the future.

You gazed down at the filly in surprise.<br>\r\n\"You want to know about...me?\" you asked uncertainly.<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara nodded back and cheerfully replied. \"Uh-huh! I want to know all there is to know about you, what your home life was like, are you ruled by a queen, and most importantly...\"<br>\r\nShe then tilted her head to the side and gave you a queer look, \".. why do you wear those ugly robes all the time?\"<br>\r\nThis was quite a twist. You certainly hadn't expected Diamond Tiara of all ponies to be the one to approach you with questions about your culture<br>\r\nThis could be a problem. A filly had identified you from a race of long dead human analogues and possibly mistaken you for one of their number. <br>\r\n\tAll you really wished to do was quietly observe from afar and not get directly involved in pony affairs, but it seems fate had other things in store for you.<br>\r\n\tWhat were you supposed to say? You knew just about as much of this \"Kingdom of Man\" as they did, and even then your knowledge was limited to a couple sentences from a dusty old book. You didn't want to lie to the filly or make it look like you have something to hide, but you also weren't sure exactly how much you wanted to reveal about yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll of the sudden, you became acutely aware of several sets of eyes watching you.<br>\r\nWhile you had been engaged in conversation with Tiara, out of the corner of your eye you spotted a small group of ponies gathering nearby,while still keeping a respectable distance away from you and Tiara. They seemed to be only only watchful and weren't agitated by your proximity to the lone filly, thank God. You didn't want the local populace thinking of you as some kind of creepy pedophile or something. Still, it would be best to be on your best behavior as to avoid an incident.<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and searched yourself for the best answer to give to the filly's question that won't insult her intelligence.<br>\r\n\tDiamond Tiara's wide glittering eyes gazed up at you like you were just the paragon of human knowledge and you were about to pass down some of your greatest secrets.<br>\r\n You gulped and made a show of tugging at the collar of your robe.  \"Well... you see, where I come from, we wear clothes to protect our bodies from the elements while outdoors, with the type and amount of clothing varying depending on the situation. It's considered immodest and indecent to expose yourself completely to other people in public, so humans have to wear clothes constantly.  Not only that, but in most places it's also illegal to walk around in the nude and if you're caught you can get arrested and fined for indecent exposure.\"<br>\r\n\tDiamond Tiara narrowed her eyes, wrinkled her nose and her cute little muzzle scrunched up in confusion. \"Illegal? You mean you can get thrown in jail for not wearing any clothes? That sounds like an awful place to live. I can't even imagine being forced to wear some stuffy dress every day.\"<br>\r\nYou helplessly spread your hands and replied, \"Trust me, it's a lot more complicated than I make it sound. There's a lot of. factors stemming from traditional and religious sources guiding our society. It's not all bad, technology has made the production of clothing pretty cheap and there's a large variety of fashions to choose from.\"<br>\r\n\tTiara didn't seem too convinced by your explanation, however. In fact she seemed even more skeptical than before. Her ears drooped and her eyes were covered in a wet sheen. \"Still, having to cover yourself like that is just so sad. How can anypony ever know what your special talent is if they can't see your cutie mark? It's like living in a Saddle Arabian harem...\"<br>\r\nYou were about to reply that humans didn't have any cutie marks to show when her mood suddenly brightened and she said \"Oh, I'just had  a great idea! Why don't you...\"</span></div></div>",

You quickly decide that you don't want to get on her bad side, not that would be an easy task. She seems to be the quiet and gentle type if appearances are accurate and probably won't cause you too much trouble.<br>\r\nShe blushes as she notices your stating and shyly looks away with a smile while pawing the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave to the group and say, \"Hi girls, it's nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm showing Anon the ropes of Ponyville and thought that he might feel more welcome if I took him to meet some of the ponies who already live here and show him a good time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'th tho <i>big</i>, breaths Twist, \"He'th like a tree trunk that grew out of control.\"<br>\r\n\"Why is he under all those clothes? Isn't he hot? \" asks sweet little Dinky, who gazes at you with a sense of curiosity and wonder.<br>\r\n\"He said that in his culture all of the humans wear clothes all the time because they're not allowed to take them off for most reasons,\" Diamond Tiara explains helpfully.<br>\r\nYou want to tell her that she's grossly oversimplifying the issue but decides to just let it slide this time. These are kids after all and you don't expect them to understand everything right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this news all of the fillies ears droop in concert and they all look at you with sadness and pity similar to Diamond Tiara, which makes you scratch your head in discomfort. Geeze, they're making such a big fuss over something that's not really big a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver Spoon takes the initiative and boldly steps forward before announcing, \"Well, I say that any friend of Diamond Tiara's is a friend of mine, and Anon's welcome in Ponyville anytime.\"<br>\r\nAll of the other foals happily squeal their assent and eagerly rush forward to crowd around you seeking pets and head pats while furiously wagging their tails. You chuckle heartily and reach down and do your best to fulfill their requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while the human is distracted Silver Spoon pulls her friend off to the side, and softly whispers into Tiara's ear, \"Ok so you found the human and managed to lead him here.

Let's play that game for a little while. In fact, I would happy to be 'it' first, if you all don't mind.\" You suddenly became acutely aware that the crowd of children are much closer to you than before, and are all looking at you with bedroom eyes uncharacteristic of a foal.<br>\r\nYou're not here to play an innocent foals game are you?<br>\r\nYou try to back up slightly but immediately run into a foal who was pressed into your back. \"Um, ladies, can we talk about this?\"<br>\r\n The foal from behind suddenly snaked her forelegs around you and locked your legs in a death grip that you could not escape. Whoever was holding you was insanely strong, probably that freakishly strong pink filly. You looked down at Diamond Tiara in alarm.<br>\r\n \"W-What are you girls are you doing?\" You said in equal alarm but Diamond and her friends giggled as they approached you with lustful intention, simply, what's going on? How come that from innocent-looking fillies became rapists, how come that this filly is so* strong to hold you *in place? \"This is not something you should do to your seniors.\" You try to act like an authoritative figure but they seem to no even care some giggled.<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara, who seemed to be the ringleader in all this, instead of answering you directly lifted a hoof to signal the others. \"Ok, girls, let's lower him down, nice and gentle.\" You were about to ask her what she meant when Silver Spoon and Peppermint Twist each reared up and grabbed you around the waist, gazing at you with the most sultry expressions. You gave a little cry of panic as you felt your feet being physically lifted from the ground and Silver Spoon and Twist began to push you down. They were only about half strong as Lily, who was moving up your back to support your body as you slowly fell. Eventually your head hit the soft ground and Lily moved from beneath you to pin your legs once again while Spoon and Twist restrained your upper body. You felt a small pool of warm liquid collecting on your chest and soaking into your clothes.<br>\r\n Not to be forgotten, the two unicorns present pulled your book from underneath your clothes and began to closely examine it. You tried to shout for them to stop, but your voice was quickly silenced by a grey muzzle forcing your mouth open.<br>\r\n Silver Spoon kisses you, invading your mouth with her tongue and twisting and savoring yours and your mouth. You were unable to speak, tasting her girlish saliva while you feel your pants being unbuttoned, you struggled to move but you were still held on by the strong grip, the majority being earth ponies might likely be the case for being more considerably stronger and now they were using that physical strength to hold you and rape you.<br>\r\n Silver Spoon continued to kiss you deeply and passionately, raking her tongue against your teeth and letting no part of your mouth go untouched. On reflex your arms reached around the bottoms of the two fillies perched on your chest pulling them tighter, which only served to excite them more as Silver Spoon leaned even closer. Your hands gripped their plump little filly rumps and squeezed, which caused both of them to sigh in pleasure. Soon, Silver Spoon had her fill and it was time for Twist's turn to rape your mouth with her tongue. You felt your pants and underwear being tugged down by what felt like teeth until your cock sprung out into the cool air. You heard a small gasp come from down near your legs and whispering, but it barely registered in your mind for what was right in front of you: Spoon and Twist's moist little pussy lips within easy reach of your grasping fingers.<br>\r\n It was then you felt something, like lips kissing down your lengths and seedpods with almost untold devotion likely Diamond Tiara uttering words 'So big' 'must be a breeding stud' and whatever other fillies that was next to her. meanwhile, some of your fingers found a way to their humid and soft virgin folds, you were a bit horrified thinking that you were molesting them, thinking of whatever crime you're committing only then to quickly remember that they're molesting you and that your finger entering to their pussies simply added their pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Another pair of lips joined the ones already molesting your dong, and then another until you felt four mouths hungrily sucking and slurping at your scrotum, kissing and licking up and down your length almost reverently. If you weren't hard before all of this kissing and sucking were getting you there!<br>\r\n You heard an \"Ohhhh!\" Blood flowed to your member as was risen as an answer to the stimulation then more giggling, You heard far more comments such as \"He is really big!\" \"Very different from other stallions\" 'Told you that he was a Breeding stud.' How did they know any of this? They don't look to be on age to know of sex! Let alone those terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped, feeling your rob penetrating something tight and a girlish cry was followed soon after.<br>\r\nThe very tip of your penis pressed into what could only be described as a wet fleshy sock that also seemed to be alive, twisting and pulling at your member to pull you deeper. You heard Diamond Tiara's distinctive moan pierce the air, \"Ohhh, it's so big, girls. He's stretching me, unf, to my limit!\" She tried to plunge deeper, to pull you into her deepest core, but of course she met some initial resistance. After all, fitting a grown adult into a filly's snatch isn't going to be an easy task. The hungry mouths on your scrotum quickly switched from licking your nutsack to lubricating your dick to make the ascent easier. You were so distracted by this that you didn't notice that Twist had already cleared off your chest and Silver was now waggling her rump in your face. The silver filly shyly asked, \"Um... could you please...? Could you maybe let me take a seat here? If you don't mind?\" Funny how she was asking permission to sit on your face when you were in the middle of getting raped.<br>\r\n But before you could say anything, she simply sat on your face anyway, bathing you with her small-ish vulva's juices as you heard Diamond Tiara moans and mewl as she moves or attempts to move which was working, you felt her very tight snatch getting even more humid and wet, making your cock entering a bit deeper into her, she felt her flesh convulse and constrict as your dick pushed against her petite womb's gates, there was a noticeable bulge on her belly, The fillies that notice it stopped molesting your length and stared at awe.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can do a great many things by pulling spells from my Lexicon, including warping space and time, creating pocket dimensions and even altering my size and appearance.

Open a portal to another world, I mean?\u201d<br>\r\nYou took your hands and stuffed them into your coat pockets before giving Tiara an apologetic look. \"Yes, one of the first things you learn in your magical training is the ability to open up doors to alternate dimensions, and yes, I'm completely capable of opening up a portal right here and now, but...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut.. what?\u201d Diamond Tiara pressed. \u201cWhat would happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would extremely irresponsible of me to do so.\" You mean, you could but in doing so it was possible to be lost in the multiverse without proper ways to return or get back and you weren't keen in opening a portal to her much less fillies with innate curiosity and wanderlust, Who know what would happen? The moment you open one, she could get the impulse and wish to go around wandering in worlds that would be too dangerous for her. Not to mention that the town, especially her parents would pin all the blame on you for her disappearance. \"I\u2019d rather not get in trouble with your parents or the whole town and be accused of kidnapping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh. I see. I hadn\u2019t really thought about that. I would hate for them to worry about my being gone.\" Her ears drooped. \u201cTell you what I can do though,\u201d Tiara looked up at you, eyes shining with hope. \u201cWhat I can do open an aperture and look inside, just to take a peek. That way there would be little risk of something going awry and you getting lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pensively scratched at your cheek and under your neck. \"I think we can start with an alternate version of Equestria, to gain some knowledge on what other ponies' lives are like. Who knows, we might even see an alternate version of you, though the chances of that happening would be pretty slim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Why so?\" Diamond Tiara asked curiously wondering why seeing another version of her would be slim, call it narcissism but she wanted to see herself, if just for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a matter of probability, really. Though I can control the position of the portal to some degree if I have no foreknowledge of what's on the other side it'll usually just open up in a random spot. You're just one little filly among hundreds of Ponyvillians, so it's safe to say you would be easy to miss.\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, I guess that makes sense.\" the filly agreed with a slow nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, get back a little bit. I'm going to need some room.\" <br>\r\nThe filly did as you asked and retreated a few steps as you began chanting. Your eyes and hands began glowing as a small swirl of colors with landscape appeared in its center showing before the filly's very own eyes, opening up like a window into another world. it was fairly small, too small for her to enter but big enough to see through. \"Alright.\" You ceased chanting and glowing and looked down a the filly as well the window to the other world. <br>\r\nShe seemed to be caught up in whatever other universe she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least her version of the CMC did. Was she looking at a time far back in the past? More importantly, if she stared long enough, would she eventually see an anthrofied version of herself and Silver Spoon? These were all questions she wanted the answers to.<br>\r\n You chuckled seeing her adorable face trying to process such amount of information on this new dimension. \"Are you alright? You could make questions about it\" You thought a bit \"Just to clarify, Tree Houses need some constant attention just for the structure to no fall down from the tree, especially when adding new space.\"<br>\r\n \"Oh.\" So they were just rebuilding it, then to add more space. That made a lot more sense.<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara was intrigued and wanted to see more of these weird pony creatures, so she then asked, \"Do you think you could move the portal somewhere else, and maybe make it wider? I'm having trouble seeing through it.\"<br>\r\nNot an unreasonable request, sure, why not? \"I'll see what I can do\", you told her.<br>\r\nYou moved the other end's portal and made it a bit wider, soon it was visible two other anthro ponies.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, where is she again?\"<br>\r\n\"I think she lost her stuff, probably looking beneath the school... again.\"<br>\r\nThere She was! with Silver Spoon!<br>\r\n Indeed, standing not even a few feet away was Diamond Tiara's doppelganger, blissfully unaware of her existence.<br>\r\n Standing alongside was a facsimile of her good friend Silver Spoon, except this one stood on two legs just had a pair of hands, just like the human.<br>\r\n \"I hope she isn't going to make us go looking for her\", the other Tiara complained, then flippantly tossed her hair back and irritably sighed.<br>\r\n The other Silver nodded in agreement. \"I don't know why we let her tag along if she keeps doing stuff like this. You agree to meet at a time and place, and then you be there. It's not that hard.\"<br>\r\n \"I know, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Who they're talking about?\" You asked the main Tiara, you got the idea who was, anyway but you kept the illusion of not knowing.<br>\r\n \"I think they're talking about one of my friends, Lily Longsocks. She's kind of clumsy and tends to forget stuff but she's super nice,\" Diamond whispered back.<br>\r\n \"Ah.\"<br>\r\n \"So... what are you calling us for this?\" Anthro Silver.<br>\r\n\"It's not that obvious? This is an emergency!\"<br>\r\nSilver's eyes widen in alarm. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes! This is an emergency! A chest related emergency!\"<br>\r\nSilver's alarmed look deflated into one of disbelief.<br>\r\n\"Really... Tiara, I think you're getting envious.\" She says.<br>\r\n The other Diamond Tiara balked at this. \"What? Me, jealous? Noooo. It's just...\"<br>\r\n She sighed. \"Yours is getting so big, and mine is still so little, and I thought that if we compared breast sizes  I'll be able to see how much mine has grown, especially with Lily around. She's so big I could barely put my hands around them.\"<br>\r\n Silver raised an eyebrow. \"You dragged me all the way out here just so we can compare whose is bigger?\"<br>\r\n Diamond Tiara bit her lip and nodded.<br>\r\n \"Sigh, fine. Come here.\"<br>\r\n \"Breasts?\" Main Tiara \"What are those?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, they're teats but on the chest.\" You clarified. She looked incredulously at you.<br>\r\n\"Really?\" She was in disbelief on why her other self is so envious about it. \"I don't get it.\"<br>\r\n\"But I do... Well, it's complicated to explain in full details but you see, bipeds or humanoids females have their teats on the chest rather than on the lower abdomen and well, Males can be attracted to them, especially if they're bigger enough, it is also a symbol of female fertility in some places, those that are on the smaller side tend to get envious of those bigger then them.\"<br>\r\n Silver Spoon pulled her friend close and took her hands into her own. \"Alright, we feel each other's breasts and that'll be it, okay?\" Diamond Tiara, the other Diamond Tiara that is, nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n \"Ok, here goes.\"<br>\r\n Silver placed Diamond's hands on her own boobs while she put her own hands-on Tiara's and gently squeezed.<br>\r\n \"This is weird.\" Main Tiara commented.<br>\r\nWhile they were starting, however, a newcomer bounces her way to the group.<br>\r\n\"Ahh, You two started already?\" It was Lily Longsocks and-<br>\r\n\"Holy-! She looks like she has a pair of melons in her chest!\" Main Tiara gasped, you chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Instead of getting angry with their late friend's arrival spoiling the moment, the two of them smiled and each placed a hand on Lily's breasts,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily wasn't perturbed of her breasts being touched, and rather was happy about it until she noticed something on the corner of her eye <br>\r\n Lily looked past her two friends and pointed. \"Hey, do you girls see that?\"<br>\r\n Diamond and Silver looked at each other in confusion. \"See what, Luly?\" Diamond asked in concern.<br>\r\n \"That, over there, there's a shimmery spot on the air.\"<br>\r\n The Girls looked on where she was pointing and fail to notice the portal that shrunk considerably, Lily gasped on seeing it shrinking but her friends instead saw barely anything.<br>\r\n \"Ok, that was a close one,\" You say and sighed in relief. You didn't want people or ponies from the other side coming over accidentally.<br>\r\n Unfortunately, one has complete attention.<br>\r\n She then walked on to the spot, getting close.<br>\r\n You were unaware of this but Diamond Tiara, pony, that's it, noticed her coming close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt conflicted. On the one hoof, she wanted so badly to meet the denizens of that other world, and on the other...<br>\r\n \"I'm sure I saw something over here,\" Lily said firmly as she walked closer to the portal.<br>\r\n\"Hey Lily, wait up!\" Diamond called out and began to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was then Lily notice the identical face of Tiara as well some weird looking guy, looking quite panicked \"What is this...\" She brought a hand toward the portal as it began shrinking, Pony Diamond offered a hoof and... Lily felt her hand being pulled strongly toward the portal, almost like sucking her in, surprising her, she released a panicked shriek.<br>\r\n \"Lily!\" The other Diamond Tiara shouted in a panicked voice and quickly grabbed onto her hand.<br>\r\n\"Heeeelp meeee,\" Lily wailed as she got sucked further into the portal.<br>\r\n \"Hold on, Lily, we'll pull you out!\" shouted Silver as she grabbed hold of Diamond Tiara hand and started to tug.<br>\r\n But it was futile, instead, they were pulled in as well, soon they were sucked into the closing portal as well.<br>\r\n On the other side, however, Three humanoid bodies fell on you two. Pony Tiara shrieked as Anthro Diamond fell on her but Silver and Lily fell on you, especially your head which was buried between Lily blooming bosoms.<br>\r\n SIlver meanwhile landed with her face right smack dab in the middle of your crotch, which was now sporting a small chub due to being buried in a pair of oversized air cushions.</span></div></div>",

I can't take this anymore, \" She pleaded, moans with hot breath as you continue feeling her jiggling flanks \"Please...\" She whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't wanna take this to the bed first? maybe some foreplay.\" You kneeled down, being only on your knees, your face close to her needy slit, you caught the smell, her scent of coffee with milk. You gave her winking clit a lick causing her shudder and yelp again, Even her juices taste like coffee with milk. You started to lick and even suck her clit, causing her to moan more, she shake and tremble as you continue sucking the clit even let out more pre-cum landing to your face with more of her nectar when you perked on her clit, She screams feeling your gentle bite and felt her shake while squirting out more of her mare juice, then her legs collapse, making her fall to the floor, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh.. Did she orgasm already? she was panting, exhausted, even a few neighs escaped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you weren't done. You grab her hind legs and pulled her juicy plot close to your lap, you unbuttoned your pants and released your excited prick to the air and then touched tentatively her moisty slit with it, you hissed feeling the searing hot needy flesh, you move back and forth on it lubricating your dick with her slimy mare cum but stopped when seeing the Mayor looking at you with a flushed face, a bit surprised but also expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want me to stop, we can stop right now.\" You said but you really didn't want to stop, no after this now but you were about to do with the mayor of the town. She gulped but you felt her rear move up and down slightly until you felt with your penis an orifice in her vulva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" She says \"Put it in, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... she pretty much wants it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou align your dick with her pussy's opening and pushed yourself into her depth as you hold her hips.</span></div></div>",

They flexed against your tool, simulating the action of kissing and drooling all over your glans. She was as primed and ready for you as she was going to get, thanks in no small part to the foreplay you provided earlier. <br>\r\nThe Mayor let out a sound that was halfway between a moan and a whinny as you pushed even deeper into her.  Your initial plan was to prolong the feeling by slowly sinking your member into her and dragging against her walls, like submerging into a luxurious steaming hot bath, but the Mayor had other ideas. .<br>\r\n You suppressed a little scream of surprise as without any kind of warning the Mayor forcefully bucked against you, and with astonishing strength, pulled your entire length inside at once.<br>\r\n \"Ahhh-!\" You groaned as you felt going all the way into her searing, wet tunnel, receiving you like an eager lover, gripping and constricting you, you felt something at the end of her tunnel, something round and spongy \"kissing\" your glans. You grasped feeling such suction force coming from a pony. She mewled, looking up to you with a pleading look. You kind of guessed that going gentle is something she doesn't want, despite wanting to get a proper feel of the pony's pussy.<br>\r\n \"Kind of.. Ung~! fast and surprising. At least, let me enjoy it, it's my first time doing it with a pony.\" You hissed as you placed your palms on her waists and getting a feel those cushiony and plump flanks of her.<br>\r\n Every single fiber of the slick arousal soaked ribbed tunnel worked in overdrive pulling and massaging as they rippled down your length. Mayor Mare sighed in contentment as she contracted around you, forming a perfect fit.\"I-I'm sorry, it's just... it's been so long, I couldn't help myself.\"<br>\r\n She leaned forward and put her hooves around your back, pulling you into a tight embrace.<br>\r\n Even just by hugging you, you could feel a gentle but extraordinary strength in her limbs.<br>\r\n She could simply pin you here and ravish you if she really wanted.<br>\r\n It was quite noticeable her natural strength despite looking not that tough and mostly unassuming, fortunately, you had a stronger magical ability in case thing go... bad. You groaned feeling her muscles and walls working on your length. You started to move now, surprising her \"R-right... Sorry if I'm not  of your preference, me no being a stallion pony but a human man or for most here, a weird looking ape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She giggled. \"Oh dear, it doesn't matter what you look like to a mare in heat, all that matters os that thick mushroom and low hanging fruits between your legs.\"<br>\r\n She then licked her lips, \"And the sweet cream that lies within.\"<br>\r\n The mayor's tail wrapped around your legs as she picked up the pace. You had to hold her steady and move your hands from her flanks to the barrel as she pumped your hips, dragging her overactive muscles up and down your length.<br>\r\n \"I suppose I'll have to marry you when you put a foal in me. It would be the honorable thing to do, after barging into your house like this. A nice stallion like you deserves a mare to look after you.\"<br>\r\nYou looked at her with sheer surprise, Foal, Marriage?! You did expect some sort of compensation although the sex was amazing you have to confess but in case of a foal, marriage? What did she mean when she said \"you deserve a mare to look after you\"? \"Marriage and foals? I-I don't know, we're not sure if we're  cross-species compatible.\"<br>\r\nIt was then that you remembered..<br>\r\n You're not the first human to have ever stepped foot in Equestria.<br>\r\n There must've been some record of humans producing fertile offspring in the distant past, or she would not have brought it up.<br>\r\nUh oh.<br>\r\n Mayor Mare gave you a sultry, sizzling look that made your heart skip a beat. \"Oh, I know we are.\"<br>\r\n It was then, she was the one moving hips, your entire length was fully inserted, balls deep, said balls were now beneath on her plushy rear. She wen on now in a grinding motion, moving her hips around now, you groaned, she was good, really good and you were close to your limit, she was too but she held the expression well enough, giving you a sultry grin. She felt your penis twitch and throbs within her folds.<br>\r\n \"Ah, I'm close,\" she suddenly cried out, then cinched herself around you in a vice grip, not allowing a single drop to escape.<br>\r\n You felt the top of your cock pierce into her very core, and with a single masculine grunt, you let loose, pouring a hefty load into her womb, filling the organ up like a balloon and even reaching all the way up to her ovaries.<br>\r\n She gasped, feeling your rather generous donation going all the way into her core, there was no doubt that she was going have more than just one foal with this huge amount, she felt more your cock still throbbing still depositing a few smaller loads into her. she came herself, shrieking as her walls tighten around your pulsing rod, you hissed as she squirted her mare juice on your crotch.<br>\r\n \"Sorry, I came without warning.\" You grunt as you embraced the pony \"Kind of impossible now to get out here without a foal or... multiple.\" You gulped, the though of paternity this early kind of scared you. Major Mare noticed your nervousness.<br>\r\n She gave you a kiss on the lips. \"What do you have to be sorry about? I wanted this. I came in here specifically asking here to help stop the heat, and you did just that. We're two consenting adults, aren't we? If anything I should be apologizing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why so?\" Well, she did come to you to warn you at first but... come to think about it, it was her that wanted to have sex and sex was nice, the idea of being a father and marriage was no something you were looking forward, she was the one that wanted it so bad and imposed it to you.<br>\r\n In a sense, yes, she has to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her ears flopped to the side and her eyes took on a watery look. \"...I did push you into this. I could've easily turned tail and walked out the door but I didn't, and for that, I take full responsibility. In the end, even if throw me out of your home for what I've done, I just want you to know I'm glad it was you.\"<br>\r\n She sighed and leaned against your chest, her innards still gently rippling trying to pull just a little bit more semen out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You grunted a bit feeling her muscle but you gave it a bit of more thought on her words, she looked up to you waiting for your judgment you simply  pulled her into a tight hug, surprising her \"I'm not going to throw you away, you're going to be the mother of my children!\" You chuckled \"Sure, You could have walked away but I also wanted it, otherwise, I could have cast a spell to lessen your heat away and didn't have this moment with you. I too have to take a great deal of the responsibility but despite your words I am scared, The idea of becoming a father was not part of my plans.\" You confess.<br>\r\nHer ears perked up upon hearing you say that, and her eyes teared up. \"Oh, thank you! You don't know how much ot means to me to hear you say that.I promise I'll be a good mother to your children.\"<br>\r\n She fulled embraced you now, gently, and began to mutter the word \"thank you!\" on your chest, repeatedly. You simply smiled warmly at her and scratches her head but the sighed to yourself and began to think.. What have you gotten yourself into?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days passed after that fateful rendevous in your home and you were now laying in the Mayor's bed.<br>\r\n After you had rutted her silly and stuffed her with your seed you both had a long discussion about the future and your new relationship and what it entailed.<br>\r\n Over your protests, she insisted that you move into her home and live with her despite having the ability to provide forever need and want, and so you begrudgingly packed your huge multi-room mansion into a bag for later use.<br>\r\n She also insisted that she was going to court you in the traditional earth pony way. and eventually, marry you. which melted your heart a little bit and soothed the pain of having to lose the mansion.<br>\r\n On the other hand, marriage was no something you had in mind, this was something you had stressed before and while you acceded, she told you that understood much to your surprise. Her real goal was to have foals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That was one thing you could provide, thankfully, and provide often. You tried not to think about it being tied down by foals, but rather think of it as living in a new home base. You could still easily travel to other universes and return any time you want while also enjoying the benefits of a grounded relationship. There are multiple doorways to alternate Equestria that are just itching to be explored.<br>\r\n Meanwhile, however, you were now on a relationship with the Mayor. Originally: She came to you to warn you about heat season but her heat started way sooner but it reminded her most strong wish for foals. Ever since Chiffon or Cup Cake got hers, it reminded her how lonely she was. Cup offered a spot within her marriage-herd for her but she felt it was to advance her business's influence. Spoiled and Cookie did the same but their Stallions were away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you came. The seemly only human male in the entire world. She simply saw an opportunity and she got it<br>\r\n Speaking of which, she was lying in bed right next to you.<br>\r\n You held her closely in your arms and slowly stroked your hands down her back as she slept. running her fingers through her silky soft tail.<br>\r\n She looked so peaceful and adorable sleeping, it was a contrast to her usually workaholic self when she was working as the Mayor or the usual lovemaking, this time between lovers rather than doing it like animals like that fateful day. Yesterday, you ran a diagnostic spell on her and confirmed something that it was sure to make her cry of pure joy.<br>\r\nShe was pregnant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was official, you were going to be a father. The very idea terrified and excited you at the same time. Your mind constantly wandered tot he future, imagining scenarios in your head of what your life would be like.<br>\r\n You were thinking, anxiety started to bubble up within you again, this however made the mare stir awake, somehow sensing your distress.<br>\r\n The mayor smiled upon seeing your face and nuzzled at your chin. \"Good morning.\"<br>\r\n You returned the gesture by scratching behind her ears, drawing out a pleased moan. \"Good morning. Did you have a nice dream?\"<br>\r\n She nodded and butted her head into your chest while you gently squeezed her supple flanks. This was a morning ritual you could get used to.<br>\r\n She giggles feeling the squeeze, she always tells you in sheer modesty that she wasn't the biggest around, but you'll think that she was going to be in the future. Her smile, however, deflated seeing your anxiety.<br>\r\n \"What's wrong,\" she asked.<br>\r\n You tried to avoid meeting her gaze but that proved to be difficult since her eyes were so big.<br>\r\n You sighed. \"I'm scared. Scared of being a father, scared of settling down and forming a family. I... I never planned for any of this. I keep thinking about the future, what my children will think of me, how my life will play out, and that terrifies me.\"<br>\r\n \"You know you don't have to face this alone. I'm nervous too, you know. I've never been a mother before, I've only ever watched my friends get pregnant and start families while I continue working day in and day out. It takes two to make a foal and we're both deep in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You chuckled. She was right, she also was deep in it, you opted to embrace her close to you, you two were entering into unknown territory, she was, however, excited as well horrible, given that this is a world where gender roles are reversed, she feels far more awful and responsible for what she has done, she did initially believed that she doesn't deserve you. You might as well, tell her the news. This will end all those doubts. \"Well.. I ran a diagnostic spell on you.\" You smiled as you had a hand on her barrel, just above her teats. \"Congratulations.\"<br>\r\n You sighed \"There is not going back now.\"<br>\r\n The Mayor's eye's widened and she gave the biggest, happiest grin she could muster. \"Truly? Oh, that's wonderful news. I never really had any doubts, but for you to tell me that...\" She squealed and hugged you around the torso while giving you kisses all over your face.<br>\r\n You embraced her closely while she did this and stroked behind her ears. Despite your misgivings, it did your heart good to see her so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was then, you hear a loud \"You tell me that there is  a new pony or someone here and nopony hadn't told me?!\"<br>\r\nYou blinked \"What was that?\" The voice sounds familiar.<br>\r\n\"That's Pinkie Pie.\" She says with a bit of a smile \"She and her friends are back\"<br>\r\n \"I can't wait to tell my friends!\" Mayor says in a giddy and excited tone.<br>\r\n Oh geez, and she's going to want to throw a baby shower when she finds out. You're not going anywhere near that. Sull, it would be nice to meet the Mane 6 properly since you arrived during their absence.<br>\r\n They've been out of the loop for a while so they'd probably be shocked to see a real live human walking among them.<br>\r\n In part you were exactly excited to meet them but wanted for them to come for you, If anything Twilight will be the one coming for you the most, a real human in Equestria and not one from the Equestria Girl variety is going to be a surprise for her. Rarity is going to faint on the sight of you, you weren't exactly fashionable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, out of your daydreaming, you come here for a spell and you gained a family in the making.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, You decided to take a stroll around the town, the ponies had grown used to seeing you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ponyville river glittered in the morning light as you walked along, your destination the market square in the middle to check out what the produce vendors were selling. The Mayor's residence was in the town center not too far from Town Hall, so that's where you took your initial stroll. You saw several ponies pass close by and when you stopped to wave each one would take one whiff of the air around them, give a small smile, and then walk away.<br>\r\n You were quite confused on the sudden behavior, you hope you don't smell bad, you had two showers a day. Does it have to do with the rumor that involves you and the Mayor? there used to have a rumor going on but it stopped as soon you moved to the Mayor's home, it kind of confirmed being hitched with her. then came the congratulations from some ponies and such, you neither her confirmed anything to the public or the paparazzi, either way. It was that and... the rather flirtatious comment if your 'herd' were open.<br>\r\n But you demised them too, making yourself appear ignorant to the very word even, you know what it means but you didn't know much it entails. Anyway, you entered to the Market area, it was a hub of activity with ponies of every shape, tribe and color were around, buying and selling wares.<br>\r\nYou looked around, selling from food, fruits, miscellaneous stuff among many other things.<br>\r\nThe very minute you stepped into the square all eyes, customer and seller alike, were on you.<br>\r\nSome were lidded, a few were narrowed in suspicion,  and many were filled with what you can only describe as a deep sense of longing and envy.<br>\r\n All this attention unnerved you a little when there wasn't that much before.<br>\r\n You approached the strawberry cart and saw Strawberry Sunrise there manning, (mareing?) the stand.<br>\r\n She quickly fluffed up her wings to make herself look presentable and pushed a hoof through her mane right before you approached. She gave you her brightest grin and gesticulated with her right wing. \"Why hello there, sir. Is there any way I can interest you in some succulent, juicy strawberries? Only 5 bits a bag.\"<br>\r\n You slowly nod \"...I think I take two bags, gonna bake a Strawberry Cake. Today is a... special day.\" You blush slightly but smile with fondness apparent on your face.<br>\r\n Sunrise gave you a half-lidded stare as she began scooping the strawberries into two paper bags.' Mhmm, I bet it is. So how are you enjoying your stay in Ponyville so far? I do hope that there weren't any rotten mares who tried to take advantage of you.\"<br>\r\n You shrugged. \"Well, pretty good so far. If anything my stay has been peaceful if a bit... strange, I'm quite new when coming with Pony courtship but so far, there is only one Mare and she isn't rotten or taking advantage\" if anything, You feel you were the one taking advantage of her, given how good she is been treating to you. You say but then decided to jump to a different topic \"This might sound weird but... do I smell bad? I didn't initially notice it, but human's sense of smell isn't as developed as ponies' and before, Ponies, especially Mares, were acting like trying to get to my pants... now it's strange. some were suspicious of me, some staring with longing or envy.\"<br>\r\n Sunrise crooked a wing under her chin and leaned into it with a smug-looking grin. \"Hmm, nope! I think you smell like a daisy in spring.\"<br>\r\n 'Then why are they avoid ing me now?\" you pressed.<br>\r\n \"It might have to do that you have the scent of another Mare,  especially the one you recently mated which is the Mayor,\" she explains, Making you blush, so they do know! \"The suspicious might not even be aimed on you but on the Mayor, The news that you are the last human alive may have caused them to think that she is hoarding you like a precious sexual pet.\" You frowned deeply but... you can see why they had reached to that conclusion. \"As for the longing and envy, the scent also means that you had been claimed.\"<br>\r\n Your cheeks color with a luminescent blush. \"Thank you, this conversation has been most... illuminating.\"<br>\r\n Strawberry Sunrise gave you a sympathetic look and dropped a few more strawberries into your bag. \"Here, take some extra, they're on the house.\"<br>\r\n You thanked her and turned around to leave and when you were a good distance away you heard her shout. \"If you're ever looking to expand your herd, I'm on the market!\"<br>\r\n You tucked the strawberries into your bag and let them be transported to your mansion, where they'll keep indefinitely.<br>\r\n Now, you ponder what to buy although on what she had told you were more in your mind than on the ingredients. If what she told you is a good indication, that means that maintaining the relationship hidden is not possible, then again, moving into the Mayor's home was never subtle and apparently, you had her scent all over you which was another dead giveaway, she did say she was going to tell her friends, she never wanted to maintain the secrecy. <br>\r\nOh well...<br>\r\nJust when you were about to get near to another stand, you hear snorts and (a bit crazy) giggling, very familiar ones close nearby.</span></div></div>",

Aside from the female ponies you expected from both Ponyville and Canterlot, you saw Gilda the griffin, Ember the dragon, several other ones that were clearly female, and what appeared to be a female Discord. You guessed that the last one was probably the fanmade Eris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were tied to the bed, the bandana was removed. You tried to speak and discovered that a mute spell had been placed on you. Looking around, all you could see were lustful eyes staring at your magically-enhanced dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayor Mare produced a bowl of paper slips and said, \"And now we'll see who goes first!

Humans are distant relatives of apes just like you ponies are of equines.\" You explained then took a sip of your own tea. \"I'm surprised you know about humans.

Lyra Heartstring, one of our resident musicians and human enthusiast had been... vocal after recognizing you on being a member of the supposed extinct race.

It spread like wildfire until the entire town began murmuring about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh great, you didn't think about Lyra. It seems that the fanon of her being Human Enthusiast is true in this universe and with humans being from an ancient race that somehow went extinct would catch more traction than with being more of a parallel of Bigfoot, the Yeti, Mothman or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, It is true that Humans are Sex Gods and has unlimited stamina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What</i> You almost choke on your drink but managed to swallow it, it hit hard on your stomach. <i>What she meant with that?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She tilted her head and blushed lightly and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just... Earth Pony legends had certain texts depicting humans being incredible partners in bed, a kind of sex gods with extreme and almost seemly endless stamina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of writing is that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... yes we kind of are but forgive me.. if I switch the topic.\" You though on a different topic until you found one and spoke: \"You mentioned that you were married and with children but I don't see your husband and foals around.\" She smiles but the scent had become far stronger on the mention, it heightened back when she mentioned that little info about humans. It wasn't bad, it smelled like <i>Blueberry</i> but you can certainly guess that isn't from the cupcake since it was <i>Strawberry</i> flavored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrot and Pound Cake, both stallion and colt, are out to the town in this heat season while Pumpkin Cake, the filly, is with me and correctly sleeping in her room.\" Ok... that's weird, why the Cake Twins were separated? It makes sense the heat season since it turns the mares into sexual deviants, but they're still babies, it doesn't make sense at all on that regard... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice something odd on Mrs. Cake, she looked a bit ditzy, glazed even and she was staring at you with... slight amount of want, her cheeks were on a pale shade of pink and her eyes turns half-open, seductive even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Mrs. Cake?\" Your voice seems to snap out of her trance, her eyes widen and looked awkward and ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stars, I'm sorry. I... It just... I might be sane unlike other mares but I'm still heat and mares in heat can smell pheromones of compatible stallions far more strongly and you... You got a strong manly musk and it's turning hard to concentrate and stay focus\" She says a bit guilty and awkwardly, You looked at her a bit alarmed with a faint blush on your cheeks. You might like her, she was one of your favorite ponies in the show but she was still a married mare and with kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not going to go that far...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Would you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. see.

Since this was supposed to be taking place at the beginning of season 6, she no longer wore a diaper and was most likely potty trained by now. Pumpkin gazed at you curiously with dazzlingly blue eyes, clearly not sure what to make of you yet.

A lot of the events she described matched what happened in the show more or less, but there were quite a few missing parts in between that fascinated you immensely.<br>\r\nLike how Pinkie Pie once dug up a mystical tablet that causes the ponies near it to immediately seek out the thing that they most desired at the moment when exposed to sunlight (which caused a few couples to begin copulating on the streets) and so they had to rebury it at the end of the episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the time that the Mane 6 had to infiltrate and break up a band of bandit mares who were involved in a rash of train robberies and were also in the business of kidnapping, smuggling and then reselling colts for profit, and then Twilight engaging and defeating the bandit headmare in a magical duel (back when she was still a unicorn no less!). That would've made quite the interesting two-parter if it weren't for that pesky TV-Y rating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned over the table, taking small bites of food sparingly as you hung onto every word.<br>\r\nIn your distracted state, you didn't notice the scent of blueberries steadily increase in intensity <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake was about to launch into another story when you suddenly felt an intense pressure in your groin and a sharp stab of pain, You visibly winced in discomfort and looked down  You reached down to touch at the affected spot and quickly realized that while you had been enthralled by Cup Cake's story, your erection had been growing in size and hardness until it was pressing up against the underside of the table.<br>\r\nYou abruptly got up from your chair, trying desperately to hide your boner while your hostess looked at you with concern.<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright dear? You seem to have become agitated for some reason.\"<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" you said through clenched teeth, then took a deep breath to compose yourself. \"Could you please point the way to the bathroom? There's uh, 'something' I need to take care of real quick.\"<br>\r\nMrs. Cake gave you a confused look but inclined her head towards the rear of the store. \"There's one adjacent to the master bedroom, down the hall, the last door on the right.\"<br>\r\nYou rushed out a breathless thank you and quickly left the scene, following the directions she prescribed.<br>\r\nOnce in there you ripped down your pants and began to desperately jack off, aiming your load into the toilet.<br>\r\nWhile you were busy polishing your knob you heard the distinctive sound of clopping hooves approach and a loud sniffing sound coming from underneath the door. You stood stock still for a moment, mortified that Mrs. Cake might suspect what it is your doing before the sniffing stopped and the sound hooves began to retreat into another room,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a sigh of relief with the noises gone and focused completely on your task of getting yourself off.<br>\r\nA small stream of white liquid burst from the tip of your member and impacted the toilet which you quickly flushed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou washed your hands thoroughly and spent a bit of time cleaning off your dick as well, before opening up the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This one has wings, since her regular counterpart turned into an alicorn during the main show.<br>\r\n2 The one in the hat resembles Applejack, the honest orange earth pony farmer, and is in a similar outfit from the head down to her human counterpart.<br>\r\n3 There is one who resembles Pinkie, the merry pink earth pony, and has a similar outfit to her human counterpart.<br>\r\n4 There is one resembling Rarity, the generous white unicorn fashionista, and has a similar outfit to her human counterpart.<br>\r\n5 There is one resembling Rainbow, the ever-loyal blue pegasus with super speed and weather-controlling powers, and has a similar outfit to her human counterpart.<br>\r\n6 Finally, the one who looks the shyest resembles Fluttershy, the kind butter-colored pegasus who can communicate with animals, and has a similar outfit to her human counterpart.\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the six approach, you see that they are accompanied by a small purple reptile, who you notice looks like an anthro dragon. Specifically, this being, dressed in what looks like a hoodie, t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms, has the head, crest, legs and tail of Spike, Twilight\u2019s dragon companion! You find this weird since Spike (A) does not have a human counterpart in <i>Equestria Girls</i> (capable of speech or not, dogs are not humans) and (B) is already a biped on the main show, but similar to how the ponies regarded your presence earlier, you shrug it off. What you find less unusual is the size of him - the regular Spike, being a very young child for most of the show, is smaller than his mare-friends, as is this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself approaching the seven, ready to introduce yourself. Better hope they\u2019re not evil changelings in disguise!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moondancer liked sitting in her dusty library reading her old dusty books all day. She liked the solitude,  being surrounded by her favorite books, and getting lost in the works of her favorite authors, even before her broken and then mended friendship with Twilight Sparkle. That's what she kept telling herself at least. It's not like she was lonely, her friends came over every week to \"hang out\" which Moondancer found herself enjoying it despite herself. Sometimes they would roleplay with OnO, an activity that they all shared a passion for.  Still... she was a mare, and despite her stubborn refusal to admit it out loud she didn't actually mind having some male company around, so long as he wouldn't be insufferable about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single stallion her friends have set her up with so far had forcibly tried to change something about her or was only doing it as a favor for a friend. One of them had even tried to make off with an extremely rare book before Moondancer brought it to a stop. She believed that there was right stallion for her out there <i>somewhere</i> but for her terrible luck none had come forward so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would lie awake at night imagining what such a stallion might be like. Sometimes she even masturbated to the thought of what it would be like to be split open by a giant stallion cock. That last part may or may not have been influenced by her heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, like many days before it, Moondancer sat in her trusty cushioned chair reading some old wizard's thesis on multi-dimensional travel. She was apparently considered fringe back then and wasn't taken seriously by any of her peers. It still made for an entertaining read though, especially when most of her theories are hilariously wrong. Moondancer had more than a few chuckles at the poor wizard's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway through the book a slow arousal began to build in her upper body that spread down to her nethers, distracting her in the worst way. She tried her best to ignore it, she tried to focus on her reading but her vision became clouded with lust.<br>\r\nShe gasped as a sharp spike of pleasure from her nipples completely broke her concentration, causing her to drop her book on the floor.<br>\r\n\"C'mon really? Right now?\"  Moondancer moaned, \"I was just getting to the good part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was her heat flaring up it came at the worst possible time. Nothing's worse than losing your concentration and then having to find your place again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pulse of pleasure came from her breasts, forcing her to catch her breath.<br>\r\nShe leaned back and relaxed in her chair, slipping a hand inside her panties and softly stroking herself. <br>\r\nHer panties were already getting pretty damp, getting ready for a stallion that was not there.<br>\r\nMoondancer's horn glowed a light yellow color as she used her magic to tweak at her boobs. A wave of pleasure washed over her and her panties quickly went from damp to soaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoondancer was officially horny, and she was about ready to fuck anything that moved</span></div></div>",

You decided to oblige her by directing your magic into her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was probably the biggest mistake you've ever made. The one thing you never could've known is that when two or more unicorns use their magic to complete a common task their combined power grows exponentially. <br>\r\nYour magic pushed against Moondancer's just as she pressed against yours, feeding it, making it grow in an endless feedback loop until the yellow glow enveloped her entire body. White streaks shot out of her the origin point on her nipple and wrapped around before making contact with the tip of her horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the pressure around you gave way, thrusting you into an entirely new and alien experience. You... <i>pushed</i> through into Moondancer's magic like a diamond bit drill.<br>\r\nThe feeling of being surrounded felt almost sexual, like you were penetrating her very being. The waves rippled and oscillated around you much like a vagina would, slowly drawing you in. It actually felt pretty nice. <br>\r\nToo curious for your own good, you pressed further inwards, not realizing that you had already doomed yourself. <br>\r\nDeeper and deeper you went, feeling the path open ever more as you trudged along. The tunnel seemed to go on forever without end. You were almost worried that you were trapped in a loop until you felt... something ahead, a blob of light in the mental darkness. You pressed against it with your mind and felt a firm resistance there, you could go no further. As you tried to leave you felt a wave of emotion overwhelm you stopping you in your tracks. Pleasure and... happiness? Through the mental link images began to surface, memories that were not your own. You felt anger for being abandoned by your closest friend, bitterness, sadness and loneliness too. You felt a small seed of hope when your old friend returned that burst into a beautiful flower when you two finally reconciled. You felt loneliness again when that friend left but hope that she would return in the future.<br>\r\nThrough the rush of images and emotions it took you moment for you realize exactly what was going on.<br>\r\nYou were literally mindfucking her. You tried desperately to escape, to end the spell, but like a snake swallows its prey she had a deep hold on you. You couldn't stop it, you were literally and metaphorically fucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\nMoondancer was in heaven. It felt like all of her nerves were firing at once, especially the ones around her arms, legs and shoulder blades. All of her thaumetic pathways were wide open, blasting out an unreal amount of magic to feed the spell. This was far beyond sexual pleasure, she had never felt so alive in her life. <br>\r\nShe floated up in the air, limbs fully extended as her eyes glowed white...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You reflexively closed your eyes and began to hear the clear sound of voices and peals of laughter coming from somewhere close by.<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes and nearly recoiled in shock at what you found.You were standing in some kind of classroom setting with rows and rows of long tables filling the space. All around you a large group of unicorn foals no older than 8 or 9 filled the seats, eagerly conversing with their classmates about this and that and giggling like schoolchildren are wont to do. You recognized Lyra Heartstrings, Lemon Hearts, Twinkleshine and Minuette all sitting together in a close cluster, meanwhile not too far away sitting all by herself was a familiar looking cream colored filly with her face almost completely obscured by the open book she was reading. Your jaw slowly dropped and you stared at the scene slack-jawed in sheer disbelief.  This was what looked to be an exact replica of the classroom of Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns first  seen in <i>Amending Fences</i>, and that little filly reading the book had to be Moondancer.

You waited patiently for her to put down the book and interact with anypony, but she seemed to be off in her own little world. <br>\r\n...<br>\r\nThis was actually getting frustrating.<br>\r\nWhat are you supposed to do now?

Before you knew it the already open, heat ridden cervix approached, which you easily and quickly passed through, bringing you into the womb proper. Upon entering you sent out a wave of magic to scan the womb for any signs of life, and you got it in the form of a small egg floating in the ether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your magic you instantly teleported to where they were and caught them in a web of white tendrils, pulling them close together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere.

Ok, step one complete.. Now would come the hard part. A wave of nausea washed over you as you began to pour your very being into the spell, connecting your soul to the egg and marking it as yours, Now there will be no doubt as to who the father will be. You blasted wave after wave of magic into the soft shell slowly eroding them so your seed would be able to take hold doing the work of millions of sperm and draining your mana. After this you wouldn't be able to leave for some time so it might be best to set up camp around here somewhere in the meantime. After ten consecutive pulses of magic you finally felt some give: the egg had been breached! You reached down and frantically pulled at your member, not needing much encouragement to produce enough semen for the job. You almost immediately shot your goo, nearly blacking out from sheer exhaustion. Your infallible magic transported the spunk to where it was needed, and then the deed was done. You gently floated down to the soft ground, breathing heavily. Before you faded into unconsciousness you released the tethers and the eggs began to float down to the uterine floor. You softly gave Moondancer a goodnight kiss and fell into a deep sleep, letting your magic do the work while you were out.</span></div></div>",

What seems to be the problem?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The no-nonsense voice on the other end of the radio is short and to the point.\"There's been reports of a possible harmful pathogen in your area, please be advised and keep an eye out for anything or anyone that looks suspicious. We'll keep you updated as the status changes.\"<br>\r\n\"Copy, we'll begin begin scanning the region and neutralize the threat. Unit 54, over and out.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lead antibody releases the button and gives you an apologetic look. \"Looks like it's back to germ hunting for us. Sorry to cut our conversation short but we're on the clock. A pony cell's work is never done, you know.\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't we take him with us?\" one of the antibody ponies suggests, \"He wanted to learn about what goes on in the body and this would be a prime opportunity to show him, firsthoof.\"<br>\r\nThe lead antibody considers this carefully and soon comes to a decision.</span></div></div>",

You gonna explain yourself of what and who are you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right.\" You said as you get inside, you guesses that they won't trust you for being an unknown, well, better to dissuade them from any doubt they might have on you..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And that's pretty much it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Intriguing. Never in my cell years I would be meeting a human, and from another dimension who decided to pay a visit to Carrot Cake's insides, much surprising, the privates first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you do certainly have some odd tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, want me gone now? Also, I though it was interesting and not be odvious if I had chosen Cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. I don't know if you had made the right choice for coming here.\" The owner of the yacht, which was a yellow unicorn, says and sipped from his cup with a risen eyebrown to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for several things. First off, While I hereby welcome you here in Carrot's body in good faith, Carrot himself is not as welcoming as me. You see, Carrot does know about his inner civilizations, about us. Both Cakes knows but Carrot doesn't see the same as Cup Cake in the open their bodies for tourism. Carrot really dislike the idea of folks coming into his body for multiple unsaid reasons. His-herd wife, Cup, however, offer her body for tourism to regulars that come to the shop. She is popular choice among colts and stallions, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. \"Yeah, I can imagine why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pony cells chuckled, the owner \"Yeah.. She and Pinkie Pie. Anyway, that being all said, you don't seem like a virus or a harmful bacteria which the worst can happen to you is being deported from the body and good thing you came here through the Phallus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You stated confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any other place in the body cells would have deported you through the bladder, intestines or sweat glands. Here, however, we are good cell folks and I, Mayor of TestiTown, welcome you to Carrot's body... at least, on this part of the body. You aren't allowed to wander off to anywhere else, You're our first and possibly only visitor in a long time and I won't like you expulsed but I also like having my eyes on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I'm trustworthy, I promise not to be a bad guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't not because of trust issue, but because of the other cells apart from TestiTown would notify you to be deported and if Carrot himself came to know, I would, sadly, deport you without much a though and glance. In order for you to stay, you have to remain secret and within this side of the body, you shall become our secret until you decide to leave, until then, you have free reign to our facilities.\" The Mayor Stallion grins <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The testicles are <i>huge</i> and to move around you have either have a ship like this or go through the outer layer of the twin organs, I say you'll have plenty of time and space to stay.\" He says as he looked on his watch \"Now with all explanations done, We can now fully depart from the Phallus and we should go with haste. Carrot is having those wet dreams again, So the Cowper's Lake and the prostate will go into an overflow soon and is likely won't stop until he wakes up and I won't like to be here went that happen.\"</span></div></div>",

After all That's where Twilight used to live. That's all you need to look for her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, that would be an odd choice but there is something you were really curious about was the fact that they both conceived two famous unicorns and powerful spellcasters and if anything that's it's worth investigating, it's them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you went flying above the tower-like buildings and edification until you saw a multicolored line that goes to a familiar tower - observatorium, you curiosity caught out on you and flew near to the line of some mares.

Let's begin with some questions!\" Twilight Velvet stated as she was a risen podium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on a bookshelf as you stared on the meeting, the place itself was huge for a library, there was also an observatory-grade telescope sounded by rows and rows of shelfs filled with books of all kinds, a trove of knowledge for any mage and traveller of all kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this Twilight's debut from the first episode, this is where she used to live? Now it makes sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Velvet, What made you write this book? I mean, I won't deny it's good but it's contents are also bit... controversial for the objectivism on Stallions as well touching some dark tones such as rape or forced breeding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's Mother nodded looking unfazed by the question and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I must confess that this book touches some controversial themes but it's something I've been trying to explore as a writer, how one can impulse the reader's emotion with each sentence and strong actions and I can't do that without breaking some boundaries. I felt I was stagnating with each new book and this one was... an experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hoof was raised \"Despite the success, how did you handled the  criticism over the strong content of the book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me or no, my daughter, Princess Twilight Sparkles, was the first to criticize me heavily after sending her a copy of the book, accusing me for objectivism and sexism but... here is the funny part. She kept the book.\" Velvet chuckles, some members of the audience chuckles and giggles as well \"I dare to say its Twily's favorites...\" She added \"While I understand the concern and criticism to the books contents and my type of writing, It's one of the points I like to make and hopefully future books as well. Now... let's focus on the topic of the books plot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is going to take long..

As someone mentioned over being an Adult Drama Thrille.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou idly found weird that Velvet would have made a novel about rape of a mare (You assume that, of course). Then again Twilight Velvet seems to be the Stephen King of this world when coming stories, breaking boundaries to create a compelling story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes turns to hours. It seems that the reunion was finally ending and the mares were retreating from the library with happy smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Velvet the come to the door and closed it and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Then she sighed and groaned, muttering a tired 'finally'. Moondancer, the only one that didn't left, came to her with a cautious expression.

An snack would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cream colored unicorn with glasses nodded and left the grey-white mare. She again sighed \"... Not really, I'm <i>that</i> kind of hungry.\" She sighed \"How I ended publishing my own wishes into a official book?\" She asked and groaned \"Was Twily right and I'm just a hopelessly desperated mare? ... No. No at the slightest, she doesn't have any foals, she won't understand this <i>need</i>.\" She muttered begrudgingly as she walked to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprise by the sudden mood swing on that mare as she held an grumpy expression. An Blue Stallion came in with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey honey, How it went?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare in question gave Twilight's Father, Night Light, an deadpan look. He cringes and squirms as his ears flatten and went behind his skull, looking uneasy under such look. Uh.. You actually didn't think there was something wrong on their marriage and this sudden change of mood from Twilight Velvet was abit surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like they gonna enter into an argument and given to your micro size, you could listen it all without being awkward  while looking points of entry about it but it wasn't proper and of bad education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Options -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 - Wait up a bit more and don't hear it, Isn't your place to do it<br>\r\n2 - Hear their conversation as you fly around them and look for point for entries.<br>\r\n3 - Look for Moondancer instead.</span></div></div>",

Trainers simply thought of them as animals and probably had no problems changing or being naked right in front of them. Of course, you could just shrink or be invisible but that's boring and being a pokemon would also give you a super cool experience, the experience of battling. Thankfully, you had control over every single element fully, allowing you to make their shape and power however you like. This would allow you to simulate pokemon moves like Thunderbolt or Iron Tail without actually being limited to those moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had taken a lot of consideration before choosing what pokemon to become. In the end, you decided to be Pikachu for one simple reason, girls tended to find Pikachu's really cute which increased your chances of being sought after by a female trainer. Upon entering the pokemon dimension you found yourself in a forest. You looked around to make sure no one was watching you and transformed into a Pikachu. Thankfully, you had a passive spell that allowed you to understand all speech which would allow you to even understand other pokemon despite not actually being one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking on all fours took a little getting used to but eventually, you could run at full speed and reliably fire off moves while moving. You had also worked on your stealthiness. No reason to risk getting caught by a prepubescent boy barely starting puberty. Of course, a prepubescent girl was a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like days of waiting by the road and summoning food from your personal storage you saw a girl walking by.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your thought of changing into something strong and mighty, but then you thought the best way to get along with other mobians is to be something more friendly looking. You thought being a rabbit was the best way to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you made you decision, you were about to begin using your magic tablet until you noticed the gateway that brought you here. You decided to close it so not to risk any random mobian to come across it and you didn\u2019t need to worry as you can open the gateway again easily, provided you have plenty of mana to use at that moment. You then used the magic tablet and and a magical aura enveloped your entire body. You couldn\u2019t see it but you can feel your transformation starting. Your body started to shrink a bit matching the same size of any average size teenage mobian. Your ears disappeared and then you felt something growing on the top of your head. It was a pair of rabbit ears that rose up and in mid length bent forward a bit thus completing the formation of the ears. Then your feet started to change by growing bursting through your shoes then you saw them looking more animal like growing fur on them and behind you a fluffy tail was forming. Once the transformation was finished the magic aura disappeared and you wondered how you look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the magic tablet, you conjured something like a mirror to see your reflection. The first thing that caught your eye was that your fur color which was a light blue which could have been a side effect of the magic which you thought was weird. But then the more you thought of it you realize this might be considered normal. After all there are animals like a \u201cblue\u201d hedgehog and \u201cpurple\u201d cat which you knew wouldn\u2019t be normal fur color for those animals from your universe. You looked some more and saw that your rabbit ears looked fine, you had a white muzzle growing around your mouth, and your eyes were quite large compared to your human eyes. Your clothes changed as well since the robe you wore changed into a nice vest that covers most of your back and sides only leaving the front exposed where you can see a white oval of fur in the center of your front. You also saw white gloves now over your rabbit paws.You were expecting this since you saw the shows and comics, the lower part of you that made you a male was hidden but you can still feel that it was still there. You turned around to see you fluffy tail and gave it a way to show you can move it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final thing to observe was your legs and feet. Your legs were long and somehow you can feel that they were powerful. Your feet were slightly big and they managed to ruin your shoes so you thought of making new shoes, but maybe being barefoot would be beneficial instead of being cramped and weighed down by footwear of any kind. \u201cLet\u2019s try this lower half out\u201d. You did a small hop letting your feet touch the ground then squatted to feel the strength build up in your legs then hopped once more and you You travel forward quickly at a kind distance before touching the ground again. You then got near a tree and started squatting to once again build strength in your legs and did a hop straight up and you got high up to almost to the top of the tree. You had powerful legs to jump high and hop long distances while your big feet would help cushion each jump you made. You heard rabbits were fast so you ran to see how fast you can run. You were faster than human form, but no way in being Sonic fast. There was one last test to try using both your legs, feet, and the tree you used to test your jumping capabilities. You made one powerful hop launching you towards the tree and once you made contact with your feet you put all the force in your feet towards the tree and bounced off it before landing on the ground again. You take a look at the tree to see there was a crater where you made impact with your feet showing your feet and legs were quite powerful. Overall, you were pretty satisfied with your transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you considered was your magic tablet since even though it shrunk when it became tablet size it was still large and you didn\u2019t want to carry it all the time as someone might notice it. You then came up with an idea and focused your magic. The tablet glowed and then disappears for moment and in the next it appeared around your neck as a necklace. Now it looks like an accessory out of sight and can be reverted back to its original form when needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now ready to explore this different universe, but where will you start? You did see a town in the distance but you chose to not go there, at least not yet. You then decided to travel through portal as you held the necklace in one hand and focused your magic and a portal appeared. The only problem was that the portal works well when you knew the location of where you wanted to go, but since you didn\u2019t the portal will send you anywhere randomly. You decided to let luck guide you as you closed your eyes and walked into the portal. Once you felt you went through you opened your eyes and was amazed by a beautiful sight. When looking up you see a beautiful clear blue sky that stretched out for miles not being obstructed by any trees. When you look down you see a field filled with many beautiful flowers of many colors in which you thought a rainbow was spread on the floor. A light breeze blows through and you see all the flowers move and even petals fly in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you thought this felt peaceful and nice where you were able to view a beautiful scene, you wondered why the portal would send you here of all places. Did your necklace send you there for a reason?You decided to brush it off and enjoy the scenery a bit more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being curious you decided to go there yourself and see who it is. After a minute of walking, you started hearing a gentle humming and by the sound of  it seems to be female the closer you got. You were now a few feet away from the mobian and the first thing you saw was the long ears laying behind her head giving you the clue she is a rabbit. You then saw the  orange clothes she was wearing and it gave you an idea who that might to be. The girl mobian finally heard your footsteps and turns around and gives you a good view of her face. \u201cOh, hello mister. What are you doing here?\u201d. It was Cream, one the youngest of Sonic\u2019s friends, except she did look a little different as she looked a bit older like she is in her preteens. Her outfit was different as well having an orange top with the blue ribbon paired with an orange skirt. You decided to hide the fact you knew her and answer her question. \u201cI was walking along when I saw this beautiful field of flowers and then saw you in the middle. May I ask what you are doing here?\u201d. She then shows you flowers tied together in a circle and she made many of them. \u201cI\u2019m making flower crowns for my mama and the rest of my friends to give\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought that was nice and ask if you can help. She nodded yes and you went straight ahead and picked flowers and tied them together to make a crown. After a few minutes, you seem to make enough crowns that helped Cream a lot. You gave a sigh of relief and then you felt something pass over your rabbit ears and land on your head. It was a flower crown that Cream made as you look at her with a smile on her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s this for? I thought these were for your friends\u201d. She then replies to you with, \u201cI always like giving them to new friends too\u201d. You have a warm, fuzzy feeling after hearing that. \u201cI\u2019m Cream. What\u2019s your name mister?\u201d. You reply, \u201cAnon. Nice to meet you Cream\u201d. You both smiled at each other until you heard a voice in the distance, \u201cCream dreary. Are you done out here with the flowers. You looked to the direction of the voice and saw a thing of beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a older mature looking rabbit woman who had an hourglass figure. This must be her mother Vanilla as you have seen her appear in comics and the show. \u201cOh and who is this Cream?\u201d Vanilla asks. You then reply, \u201cYou can call me Anon ma\u2019am. Or you can call me the King of Flowers\u201d. All you heard was silence at first until you heard a bit of chuckling from both of them to laughter. \u201cAren\u2019t you a funny one. Nice to meet you Anon. I hope you had fun with Mr. Anon, Cream\u201d. Cream replies, \u201cI sure did mom. Anon even helped me make flower crowns for you and my friends\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m glad but we have to go sweetie. We need to buy groceries for the house before they close\u201d. Cream says ok and she waves goodbye to you while you do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought to yourself what you should do next while you watch the rabbits walk away. You then see them stop with Cream talking to her mother. Vanilla looks at you then looks at her daughter who was holding her hands together like she was pleading. You then hear Vanilla shout out, \u201cMr. Anon, would you like to accompany us into town. Seems my little Creamy enjoys your company. You gave it some thought and decided...</span></div></div>",

Then you heard Vanilla\u2019s voice as she wanted to get to know you. \u201cSo Mr. Anon, do you live around here?\u201d. This made you a little nervous to answer but you reply with, \u201cUm... not really. At least not yet. I\u2019m not from around here and just arrived today to look and plan to live here after I find the right home. Decided to look around for a bit until I met you two\u201d. Technically the was the truth as you weren\u2019t from around here and this whole dimension is new to you. You then see Vanilla looking at your chest or more specifically the thing hanging of your neck. \u201cThat necklace of yours looks interesting. Is it important?\u201d asks Vanilla. You held the necklace and explain, \u201cYeah... this was a gift from my grandma. It is all I had of her before she left. She even gave me the confidence to go on my own and now start my new life here\u201d. It looked like Vanilla understood when she says, \u201cI see... well I hope you enjoy living here and Cream and I hope to see you often in the future\u201d. You nodded as you appreciate the fact they enjoy your company and want to see you more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you made it to the town where the two rabbits were in front of you and you see Cream holding Vanilla\u2019s hand. A few minutes later, you then see Cream looking in a certain direction. You decided to look at that same direction and you see an ice cream vendor. \u201cMama, can we get some ice cream?\u201d Cream asks while tugging on Vanilla\u2019s dress. \u201cSorry sweetie. I only have enough money to buy groceries so we can have any treats\u201d. You see Cream with that sad expression and it just hurts you wishing you could do something and then you thought maybe you can. Your necklace/tome can make anything as long as you have enough mana. You moved away from the two of them and with one hand held tightly your necklace and focused. You thought of this world\u2019s currency wanting a lot of it and something materialized in your hand. It looks to be a large pouch filled with a ton of golden rings which meant the spell was a success. You walk to toward the ice cream vendor and ask for two ice cream cones with all the fixings. The female ice cream hands you the cones while you hand over some rings where she then says, \u201cThank you for your business\u201d. You started walking with both cones in hand toward Cream and Vanilla. \u201cWould you girls like some ice cream?\u201d. Cream\u2019s eyes lit up where she grabs one from your hands while saying, \u201cThanks Anon\u201d while she starts licking away at the ice cream. Vanilla still surprised says, \u201cGoodness Anon. You didn\u2019t have to do that for us\u201d. With a smile on your face, you hand the other cone to her while saying, \u201cI\u2019m happy to do it. Just think it as a way of thanks from me for letting me tag along with you\u201d. She gives up and takes your kind gesture as you all head to the grocery store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you made it to the grocery store and you all proceeded to enter. While you watched as the two rabbits pick out their foods you thought you should get some as well as you still had plenty of rings in the pouch you materialized. Seeing as you\u2019re a rabbit you probably have to eat as one so you picked out carrots and other fruits and vegetables along with some beverages. You, Cream, and Vanilla left with all your purchased items and Vanilla says, \u201cWould you mind seeing us home?\u201d. You oblige and walk them home while carrying some bags. After a while of walking, Vanilla let\u2019s you know they were close. That was then that you noticed something. All of you were near the field of flowers where you met the two. Must be nice to live somewhere so beautiful and calm. You finally come across their house and you see them open the door. \u201cThank you for a wonderful day Anon and thanks for carrying some of the bags\u201d. \u201cNo problem Ms. Vanilla. I had fun being with the two of you. Well I should get going check my new home\u201d. You left while Cream waves goodbye and says, \u201cGoodbye Anon. We should spend time tomorrow as well\u201d. You don\u2019t know if you might but signaled yes to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith bag of groceries in hand, you decide what to do next. You could...</span></div></div>",

That field was peaceful and calm so you should build it somewhere nearby here, especially if it\u2019s near those lovely rabbits. You went a little far from Vanilla and Cream\u2019s home to prevent them to hear any noise as your house appeared. Once you were far enough from them and found a good spot you grabbed your necklace and started changing it back to a magical tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tablet began to glow and was creating a projection or to be more specific schematics. This will help you on help creating your home. You designed it so it would have a large enough bedroom, a functioning kitchen, a bathroom with toilet and shower that can change to bathtub, a big enough living area, and finally a room to practice and making spells. With your idea of your home etched into your magic tablet you focused your magic and a large circle formed in the land in front of you. Then what seemed to be the roof of your home started rising from the ground along with the rest of your house. The last thing to form was the steps of your house leading to the front door and it was complete. Once it was complete you felt completely drained as the process took almost all the magic out of you. You felt so tired that you couldn\u2019t admire your handiwork and just went inside the house. With enough strength left you made it to the kitchen and placed all the groceries in their respective places. Then you stumbled your way through the entire house until you found the door that led to your bedroom. You went inside and the first thing that caught your weary eyes was the large bed in front of you. Once you got close enough you fell on top of the bed. You thought with your last bits of consciousness you told yourself you will check out your new house in the morning as you then drifted off to sleep to regain your mana.</span></div></div>",

He remembered that you immediately went to sleep once you created your new home so now the best time to see how you did making your home. The bedroom had a nice, soft bed to sleep in as you can prove with the pleasant rest you had last night and the room was pretty spacious where you can add things in here if you ever wanted to. You exited and now we\u2019re in the living room where it was quite large with a large couch and small table. You were immediately relieved to know there was a bathroom with a large shower and toilet that were both functioning. Then you explored the large training room you made in order to practice known spells and make new ones. You can see that the walls were pretty thick meaning they can take any disaster that might happen like maybe a spell that causes an explosion. Everything seemed in order to be living in this house and if anything comes up you could always make modifications to it later. Your stomach growls telling you it\u2019s breakfast time and to check the final room of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped in the kitchen to see it had a fridge and cupboards to store your foods and it was a good thing you were still conscious enough to place your groceries in the right places last night. You then saw a stove and oven to cook your foods making you glad that just because your diet will change doesn\u2019t mean you have to eat them cold from now on. Off to the side inside the kitchen was a table where you could enjoy your prepared meals and there was enough tables for a group of four to dine with others. You immediately went to one of the cupboards and grabbed a box of cereal along with milk from the fridge and put them into a bowl that your magic provided when creating the house. While enjoying your bowl of cereal you thought to see the rabbits again so then once you were done you put everything in the sink and head out the door. You walked a bit until you reached Vanilla and Cream's house and proceeded with knocking on the front door. The door opens and Cream was the one who greeted you by shouting, \u201cAnon!\u201d before making a hop towards you. Thanks to your reflexes you opened your arms and caught her once her body collided with yours. \u201cHey Cream, good morning. Good morning to you as well Ms. Vanilla\u201d. Vanilla replies, \u201cGood morning Anon. Did you just wake up as well?\u201d. You nod and continue with, \u201cYeah, just came over to see if you wanted some company\u201d. \u201cWell isn\u2019t that sweet. Unfortunately, I\u2019ll be busy cleaning the house today\u201d Vanilla says disappointingly. Though you know you couldn\u2019t spend time with Vanilla, you could probably spend time with Cream which you realized you were still holding in your arms. You look at her and see a sparkle in her eyes unsure what that could mean. You then hear her say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hang out with me and my friends, Anon\u201d. Her friends must mean many of the other the female Sonic friends. Though feeling that you might be the only guy at the meeting place you were curious of how they looked and see if they are similar to that of the comics and shows. \u201cSure, why not. Sounds like fun\u201d. Cream has a smile on her face as you put her down and she immediately grabs your hand and leads you to their meeting place. While running off, Cream shouts, \u201cBye mom! Love you. I\u2019ll be back later\u201d. Vanilla replies, \u201cOkay dearie. You two have fun\u201d while she waves goodbye to the both of you. Even though she looked older she still looked pretty small and you thought she would be average speed but you were wrong when she was pulling your arm and you felt you needed to run a bit to keep the same pace as her. While keeping up with her you were thinking to yourself what would happen next once you got to the place she was taking you.</span></div></div>",

You two were heading to a big clearing and in the distance you can see a couple of figures which you assumed were her friends and based on your Sonic knowledge you had s good idea who they might be. Once you got closer with Cream you were able to discern what animal they were and who they are. You saw a pink hedgehog with a large red dress which you knew was Amy, a light purple cat in very elegant attire who you knew as Blaze, a brown chipmunk sporting red long hair and a blue vest with boots to match you knew as Sally, and finally the white bat with the most mature look, especially the skin tight suit, that everyone in your world couldn\u2019t forget, Rouge the Bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both made it to the girls and both were a little out of breath from running but Cream manage to at least say in shortness of breath, \u201cHello everyone. Sorry I\u2019m late\u201d. All the girls were confused looking at you and Amy asks Cream, \u201cCream, who is this?\u201d. You still see Cream out of breath so you try to not make it sound like you knew them and introduce yourself. \u201cThe name\u2019s Anon the Rabbit. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you all\u201d then giving a bow to them. \u201cSuch a gentleman. I like his attitude\u201d Blaze says impressed by your greetings. After your bow you got another look at the ladies and just like how you saw with Cream they did look a little more mature and womanly and did look bigger on parts of their bodies so you decided not to stare for too long. Another thing you notice was with Sally here the characters from the comics must be here as well, but didn\u2019t feel as chaotic and dangerous as the comics. So you assume this world must be a blend of both the comic world and tv world but more peaceful at the same time.

Thankfully, you were on a sperm that did made it inside, and you could see the bat's egg getting mercilessly attacked from all sides thanks to the never ending barrage of fox sperm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was of no surprise to you that the egg conceded to one of the sperm, as enhancing your vision lets you see the precise moment Tails' DNA began to bond and fuse with Rouge's. Whether she liked it or not, Rouge was now pregnant with Fox boy's baby. The only thing left to do was to oversee its development.</span></div></div>",

Using your magic tablet and an incantation the tunnel you were in was now being lit up by a magic aura. You can clearly see the passage was now getting larger. Outside, while Tails was still sleeping his member was beginning to grow getting bigger and longer to the point where it looked like he had a third leg making him well hung and filling space between his thighs. Tails remained asleep with only giving out a few moans. You finished the spell and the passage looked longer and more spacious. This would mean that the time to reach your destination has extended but you didn\u2019t mind as long as Tails doesn\u2019t wake up and after all you were doing this for him. You continued on your way traveling through the urethra until you came to another entrance which must have been Tails\u2019 prostate. You forced your way through and inside causing another moan from Tails. With the help of your magic tablet it displays Tails\u2019 entire body for you down to each organ in every system and it shows you were now exiting the prostate and traveling through the vans deferens which was like the urethra but further in meaning you were getting close. You traveled a bit more and tablet displays you are getting close to the gonads soon. You know come at a fork as the vans deferens splits into two. Now the question is, will you enter the enter the right or the left testicle. As for some thought you thought right would be the \u201cright\u201d choice and continued that way. We you were then led into the epididymis. You continued traveling through the long coil where you finally met the final entrance. The inner space of the testicle was right behind that entrance. You squeezed your way through making it inside with Tails feeling your squirming as he let out another moan while still asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside you marveled at the large space within, which made sense that it would be that big due to your current size. You then can see the little white soldiers swimming inside as they travel all over inside the oval containment. Just as you thought though, even though there was a small number present there was not as plentiful as you thought it would be. There should be hundreds of them swimming in here like an aquarium filled with large quantities of fish to the point the aquarium was filled with too many. Tails since he was still young his body wasn\u2019t producing enough yet. You then thought to yourself that you could change that. With the remaining mana you had left you cast a spell where a magic aura was enveloping the the entire testicle and the left one as well. You focused all your power on the testes and after some time the magic aura disappeared. Immediately you saw the result of your spell as sperm cells were appearing out of nowhere and filling the vast space inside. More and more started being produced to where there would be a point where some cells collided with another due to the large number occupying the organ now. There are too many now as you felt like it was getting cramped in here. But not to worry as your spell continued to take effect As you saw the fleshy walls around you stretch out and expand making more space while at the same time producing more sperm. Back outside, right below Tails\u2019 large member his family jewels began to grow and pulse and even started stretching the scrotum. Tails was making some noises sounding like he was enjoying the feeling of his gonads growing. They finally stopped growing and were now quite large that any adult male would envy and was taking some space as well between the fox boy\u2019s thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt accomplished as you completed your goal to help someone you knew but at the same time you felt exhausted. You looked at your tablet and saw you were almost completely drained. You also saw that your mana recovery was increasing quicker inside Tails. You thought maybe being inside a living creature they give you some of their energy to produce mana in your body. You decided to take a quick rest inside Tails\u2019 balls to recover mana.

Though she also had a soft spot in her heart for Tails since she thought he was cute plus sweet and maybe if things don\u2019t work out with Sonic she can always fall back to him. \u201cTails... where are you?\u201d Amy says hoping she would get a reply from her twin tailed friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she started to hear snoring coming from somewhere in the workshop. She followed the noise and found out it was coming from the plane. She climbs the ladder to reach the seats and when she looks at the pilot seat she sees Tails sound asleep and covered in oil and grease.. \u201cOh Tails, you look so cute. Even if you are covered in filth\u201d. She sees a clean rag in the passenger seat and grabs it putting some saliva on it and starts cleaning off Tails\u2019 face. She does it gently not to disturb him until his face was clean. \u201cThere you go Tails. Nice and clean\u201d. It was then she took a single moment to look down and got a big surprise. She saw Tails\u2019  erect member which was large, throbbing, and pulsing and right under it she can see his family jewels the size of grapefruits that were pulsing as well. \u201cOh my god. Tails is huge. He could be bigger than Sonic. Heck he just might be bigger than Big\u201d. Amy then wondered why did he have an erect cock anyways. It was then she heard Tails say in his erotic dream, \u201cOh Amy. You feel so good inside. Don\u2019t stop\u201d. She then thought, \u201cIs he dreaming about me and him having sex?\u201d. She didn\u2019t know why but knowing she was in his fantasy was turning her on. Plus she thought it would be really risqu\u00e9 to have sex inside a plane. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Tails. I can make your dream a reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to strip removing her red dress, white bra, and panties that matched. Once she was completely naked she examined the pilot seat and saw that was enough room for two. She climbed aboard and stood right above Tails where she then grabbed his shaft and guided it to her pussy. She then lowered herself where the tip of his penis started passing through her vaginal lips before she started putting his whole shaft into her hole. Once her body has grasp of his member she began moving her body up and down feeling the throbbing of his cock making her insides all tingly and making her very wet inside her. She found it difficult to focus but she keep moving her body more and faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside, you are resting and when Amy started riding Tails everything started to shake and you could have sworn you saw something pressing against your resting place. You came to the conclusion that some girl was having sex with him while he was sleeping and that was their butt pressing over Tails\u2019 balls. Now the question you were thinking of was who was mating with Tails. \u201cOh my god Tails. This feels so good. Who knew you were good even if you are asleep\u201d. You recognized that voice from the Sonic X tv show and knew that it was Amy. You thought she had a thing for Sonic but maybe since this a different universe from your own there might be some differences. You thought not to interrupt and let her do her thing. After a few minutes you did see that a large swarm of sperm cells started making their way towards the exit and will be shot out of Tails\u2019 penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then had a decision to make. You could go with the little soldiers and travel through Tails\u2019 reproductive system and then enter the womb of Amy Rose. Your magic tablet lit up to tell you some important information. A side effect of using the spell to grow Tails\u2019 testicles and increase production of sperm cells was that it made all the sperm cells inside super fertile. Meaning you will get a chance to see the creation of a hedgefox and maybe multiple hedgefoxes growing inside Amy. Or you could stay in Tails to see who he gets to have sex with and possibly impregnate. You imagine Tails going after Sally, Mina, Bunnie, and the rest of the girls. After some thought you decided... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see all the sperm cells swimming in this cozy large area as you know they are in search of an egg cell they can fertilize. You looked around some more and did see some eggs released in to the womb but you thought that wasn\u2019t enough and there needed to be more as you wanted to see lots of foxes, hedgehogs, and what you wanted most hedgefoxes to be born in here. You decided to fly up and enter through the fallopian tube that is suppose to take you to the left ovary. You continued furthered until you saw an opening in which you entered. Once inside you can see these sacs that were holding the egg cells.Some were ruptured and that is why you saw some eggs in the womb but there needed to be more. You began using your magic where it enveloped the entire ovary. After an incantation and the aura disappeared you now saw multiple follicles rupture and release them where they all started heading through the Fallopian tube to make it to the womb. Once all the eggs left the ovary, the follicles were repaired and you saw them quickly produce more eggs that will be released again soon. You now made Amy into a proper egg provider and one step closer to becoming a productive baby factory. Since you worked on the left you might as well travel to the right and do the same in having that ovary release multiple eggs as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter both ovaries was altered, you made it back to the uterus to see how things are progressing. You immediately saw multiple sperm attacking the multiple egg cells provided. And with the magic spell you used to increase the production and storage of Tails\u2019 testicles made his seed super fertile, they had no problem entering the egg cells. The eggs were now fertilized and made their way to plant themselves against the walls of the uterus. You were amazed of how many of them were sticking to the uterine walls and how they were already dividing and started in producing a form slowly. Seeing that, you thought you should do something about the womb. You had enough mana to do what you had in mind. You focused and now your magical aura focused on the womb. You began to create the space inside the womb larger while still making it unnoticeable outside of the womb so Amy\u2019s belly won\u2019t be noticed yet and she would look like her belly is growing normally as time passes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave almost the last of your mana to make that last modification and now Amy\u2019s womb had its own space just like her hammer. With the last of your magic depleted you collapsed and had no choice to rest to recover some or all your mana. During that time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You just loved the warmth resonating within the testicles while listening the beating of Tails\u2019 heart as it felt soothing. You thought you should make a home and place of operations inside for a place to rest in. With your magic and the help of your magic tablet you can make anything out of nothing. You began focusing and visualize what you want to appear and after a few seconds *poof*. A large house, based on your size at least, appeared in front of you and you decided to look inside. Before going inside, you saw that the bottom of the house was magically latched onto the fleshy floor of the testicle. You made it to the entrance of the house and looked inside. You were able to see a room with a large bed you can rest to quickly recover your mana. There was a dining area and kitchen to make food but you didn\u2019t have to worry as there was a spell in the kitchen that if Tails gets near anything outside that was a consumable item will disappear and appear in that kitchen of yours so you don\u2019t die of starvation or thirst. No worries of bathroom use as you found a spell that allows your body to fully absorb any food consumed getting rid of the need to use the bathroom. The final area of the house was a large training area where you can practice the rest of the spells in your magic tablet you discover. You not only made the testicle into a highly productive reproductive organ but also into a home away from your original home in another universe. You saw as there was a link between your new home meaning you could teleport back to the home/base. So if you left Tails to explore the bodies of his other friends you could always come back to rest or see how Tails was doing. Not that you had to leave since you probably decided to stay in Tails to help him with his love and sex life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one testicle being a home, you had another interesting plan you had in mind for the other. After a little rest you flew off toward the testicular sphincter and squeezed yourself through. You traveled through the epididymis and the vans deferens to reach that split in path you encountered before and went through the second path going through another epididymis and reached the entrance to the left testicle. You pushed through and just like the right teste you can see large quantities of sperm cells swimming inside with still having plenty of space to swim around in. Since you were inside you went ahead and begin your plan. You found an interesting spell that you wanted to try out. You needed to give your magic tablet a piece of your DNA. You did have a pin that you pricked your finger with and let a drop of blood fall onto your tablet. It looked like the magic tablet absorbed your blood as the drop disappeared and the tablet was glowing. It then let out a magic pulse which made you believe you did something wrong and failed the spell. Suddenly, the whole left testicle was beginning to rumble and even some of the sperm cells inside were glowing. Tails was making grunts of pain in his sleep while below his left testicle was pulsing faster and not in sync with the pulsing of the right gonad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, you continue to see the left testicle pulse rapidly for a few minutes until the pulse rate was steady and in sync with the right. You then watch as it continues to produce more sperm cells. Using your magic you grabbed one sperm cell bringing it closer to you and using your tablet to scan it. What you did was success as you were filled with joy. You made the left testicle produce sperm that had a blend of Tails\u2019 and your genes. You didn\u2019t want the females Tails mates to give birth to humans and freak out so you made it that the sperm will create foxes like Tails but the kit will not only have Tails\u2019 traits thanks to right but will have your other features like eyes and hair color for fur. You will now have children born in this universe with the help of Tails and any female he mates with. You felt tired almost using all your magic for that last transformation. With the last remaining inside you, you teleport to your new home because of the link established earlier. You then slowly walk toward the bedroom and once inside near the bed you lay on top of it and started drifting to sleep to recover your mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when...</span></div></div>",

In fact why should he be complaining. He wasn\u2019t in pain at all so whatever happened to him wasn\u2019t life threatening. Now he was well hung and his testicles were huge where if he shook them around he can hear sloshing sounds coming from within them. Now he can prove to all her female friends that he wasn\u2019t a little kid anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though now he thought of his recent transformation as a blessing, he did feel a bit sore which must have been caused by them growing. \u201cAlthough having a little soreness, I should be fine. Maybe soaking them in a bath should them. Need one anyways to clean up the mess all over me from fixing up the Tornado\u201d. He then made his way into his house and headed upstairs to enter the bathroom near his room to take a bath. He starts the water to fill in the tub while he removes his oil and grease stained gloves and shoes. Once the tub was fully filled Tails entered the tub and then submerged his body under the warm water. He enjoyed the water caressing his body and he was right as the water felt good on his balls and dick. He felt so relaxed that he closed his eyes and had no care in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water might have worked a little too well as the heat was stimulating his testicles causing them to pulse while his member was beginning to throb and pulse as well. Tails opened his eyes as he can feel this stimulation and looked to where his balls are. Tails watched his member rise from the water and then became fully erect where it was pointing toward the ceiling. Tails then felt pressure deep within his testicles as the quantity of his sperm cells within was too many. His testicles started to pulse even harder where Tails then asks himself, \u201cWhat is this feeling inside my balls? I think I need to let one out\u201d. He then grabs ahold of his member with both hands and started stroking himself up and down. Even though he was doing it himself he imagined Amy, Sally or any of the other girls giving him a handjob and that increases the pleasure he was feeling. After a few more times stroking, he felt the time of release was near so he prepared himself. A few moments later, Tails was at his limit and he had no choice to release where ropes of cum was shot out of Tails\u2019 testicles that got some distance before landing somewhere on the bathroom floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh... that\u2019s much better\u201d Tails says feeling relief where he then enjoyed soaking in the bath. After some time, Tails became really clean free from oil, sweat, and even that liquid that he believes came from Amy. He then went ahead and drained the water and starts drying himself off. He did notice that he did have a problem. Normally he would be able to recede his cock and testes into his body so he can walk freely without getting a few stares. It seems that they became too large that it seems impossible to hide them. He then thought screw it as he liked the feeling of them hanging between his thighs making him feel more like an adult. He can think of how to conceal them later but for now he decided to let it all hang out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis later became a mistake when he then heard knocking at his front door. He thought to himself what is he going to do and the best thing he can come up with at short notice was to open the door slightly and talk to whoever is on the other side and avoid them seeing his grown sex organs. He heads downstairs toward the front door and slightly opens the door and sees...</span></div></div>",

I got you right where I want you\u201d Mina says with bedroom eyes and an almost evil grin on her face. Tails then remembers something else and asks, \u201cWait... where are the other girls?\u201d. \u201cOh... there over there\u201d. Mina points toward the room opposite of the bed and there stood the rest of the girls also completely naked where they all say in unison, \u201cHi Tails\u201d. Tails turns his focus to Mina and asks, \u201cWhy are you all doing this?\u201d. Mina was very happy to explain as she strokes Tails\u2019 enormous cock, \u201cEver since Amy told us about the fun she had and getting the ride of her of her life, we all wanted wanted a feel of this \u201cbeast\u201d inside us as well\u201d. Tails trying to focus while making a few moans asks, \u201cThen... why aren\u2019t they doing anything?\u201d. \u201cWe all wanted to have our own alone time before doing it together. So we all played a game of rock, paper, scissors. And seeing who\u2019s right next you, you can guess who won. Tails looks at the other girls to see them have faces of disappointment and defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina continued to stroke Tails until his cock was throbbing and pulsing like crazy. \u201cSeems like you\u2019re ready to go. Time for the real fun to start now.\u201d Mina stands on the bed and places herself over Tails and his excited member. She aligns the tip into her pussy and descends for it to enter before she takes a plunge and letting the whole shaft enter her tunnel and the tip pressed against her cervix. Mina yells out in pleasure while Tails moans from the pleasure of his rod entering somewhere tight and warm. Mina pants for a bit before she starts moving her hips up and down letting his dick slide against her inner soaked muscles. Blaze, Sally and Amy we\u2019re getting turned on by this as they started rubbing their clits, inserting their fingers in their vaginas, and feeling up their breasts. \u201cHow does that feel, our little fox?\u201d. He moans even louder but still manages to say, \u201cIt feels so good. Keep going. Please\u201d. She obliges by speeding up the pace of her bouncing on his cock. During that Tails can see Mina\u2019s breasts bouncing above him and he couldn\u2019t help but use the free movement of his neck and reach for and suck on one of her nipples. This Mina stop for a bit and moan from that surprise move but then continued to move her body up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the testes, you have recovered enough to be awake where you were able to feel everyone around your home was shaking. You look outside your home and up to see some shape was forming and bouncing on Tails\u2019 testicles which can only mean one thing. \u201cWait to go Tails. Already banging a girl already. Glad I was able to help\u201d. Back outside, Tails continued to suck on Mina\u2019s breast until he felt pressure building up within his balls. \u201cMina... I\u2019m getting pretty close. Don\u2019t know how much I can hold it in any longer\u201d. Mina immediately replies, \u201cDo it inside. Make me pregnant and give me your babies. I don\u2019t care\u201d. You back inside can see multiple sperm waiting at the sphincter of the testicle which you assumed was happening in the other that had sperm of your DNA mixed with Tails. \u201cI wonder who\u2019s the lucky one whose going to have our kids\u201d. You still felt tired so you rested some more to recover more mana. Mina took one final plunge forcing the tip of Tails\u2019 member to pass her cervix and forced Tails to cum releasing in bursts into her womb. All the girls are ovulating and in heat so there were many eggs present inside the womb. Since the sperm were super fertile, they had no problem entering the eggs fertilizing them and then stuck to the walls of the uterus making Mina officially pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina was panting feeling every last bit of baby batter enter her womb with Tails doing the same feeling every bit of it leaving his shaft. She starts rising from the bed and slowly removes his cock from her hole and once she did splooge started leaking out. \u201cYou naughty fox. Look how much you put in me. There is almost no doubt you made me pregnant. Hope you take responsibility\u201d. She then went close to his face and gave him a lingering kiss. After they parted lips, Tails spoke and all he could make out while panting, \u201cMore. I need more. Please give me more. I\u2019ll do whatever you want\u201d. Hearing that a mischievous smile appears on Mina\u2019s face as she looks at the other girls and says, \u201cI think we got him girls\u201d. She then proceeded to remove his bounds in which Sally exclaims, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d. Mina immediately replies, \u201cIt\u2019s fine Sally. He\u2019s not gonna run. I think he wants to stay, don\u2019t you Tails?\u201d. Everyone sees Tails sitting on the bed nodding with that look of lust in his eyes and when looking down can see his gigantic cock plus his enormous testicles all pulsing. \u201cAlright, who\u2019s next?\u201d ask Mina as she was rubbing the bulge in her belly that held the fox boy\u2019s  plentiful seed. </span></div></div>",

Sonic goes running around while she gets on waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she has a true man here, she isn't going to let him go until getting her fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lust starved fox looked at Sally but was pushed back to the bed by her, snapping him out a little of his lustful trance \"Aunt Sally..?\" He says as Sally prepare to ride him but going to give him a special show while at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails merely observed Sally as he saw her large round ass bouncing as the chipmunk align his dick, already lubricated by remnants of his cum and Mina's love juice and his dick, despite being long and girthy, it slides in easily into her tight cunt, all the way until pressing the gates of her royal womb. making her moans loudly then giggled pervertedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is a \"funny kiss\".\" Sally chuckles on her joke as she places a hand toward her lower abdomen feeling the hard meat penetrating her folds and the warm it emanates \"It's so big and it's filling me completely! I want more!\" She says as she begins to move up and down, Tails grunted as he comes to witness Sally legendary ass gobble up his prick only for her to move to make that great ass of her bounce, feeling her muscles and flesh clamping down on him, feeling his dick \"kissing\" the princess' cervix and groans as the Princess of Acorn rides him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Tails groaned feeling his about to cum \"I going to-- Agh! Aunt Sally! Please Remove-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove!?\" Sally says with a smirk as she stops moving, with his dick hilting completely into her, she began grinding her hips causing him to groan \"Oh no Tails, you're going to release that cream of yours into me and give me your heirs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Heirs but Sonic-?! Ugnn!\" Tails' words died on his mouth when walls of Sally's pussy began clamping him as she pushes the last of his cock deep into her until her cervix was penetrated making to moan loudly feeling his dick throbbing and ready for a clear shot into her very defenseless womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic? He barely is around to satisfy me and he isn't as big as you now.\" She says as she had her hands now massaging his large pulsing teste, causing him to groan. \"Mom and Dad wanted me to get heirs to the throne and sonic doesn't want children and goodness! You're the best alternative, no, the much better solution!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just cum in me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust without any more fanfare, Tails let out a grunt as his dick throbs and burst into Sally's womb, letting millions upon millions of Tails and Human swimmers into her body looking for her eggs to fertilize and give the heirs she so long desired to have. Sally gasped as she saw her belly began to grow considerably and moaned feeling her womb getting filled, she orgasmed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly continues to grow until she looked pregnant with twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails gasped as he stopped cumming, Sally panted as well then smiled and caresses her pregnant-looking belly, she whistles. \"You let out a lot.\" she giggles looking at Tails with bedroom eyes, Tails looked dazed but feeling his penis still lodged inside of her, she notices he was still really hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really wanted to get me pregnant, didn't you? uh!?\" Sally gasped feeling his dick throbs and looked down, past her belly, she notices his balls pulse with renewed vigor. She then realized what was happening \"No way... you have a pregnancy fetish?\" her grin turned sly \"So you have a pregnancy fetish! You want to fill me with until-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh? oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess of Acorn looked at the impatient stares of Amy and Blaze who were really wet and tired of waiting, she chuckles nervously as she removes herself from Tails' revived dick pulsating for new attention, begging for another cunt and womb to fill and breed.

Tails hearing that looks at Blaze and imagines her with a nine month pregnant belly with kicking coming from inside it causing his member to throb even more and his testes to pulse faster. \u201cLooks like he agrees\u201d Blaze says with bedroom eyes and a smile on her face. \u201cAwww... Come on!\u201d Amy yells out a little annoyed. \u201cNow... now Amy. Remember you already had your turn with Tails so if you want a turn again you need to go last\u201d says Sally as she was rubbing her round belly filled with seed. Amy just pouts while Blaze continues towards Tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hops onto the bed but instead of going on top of Tails and riding him she decided to lay next to him with her legs spread and says, \u201cTails, if you wouldn\u2019t mind\u201d. Tails got the hint and get off the bed and stood in front of it. He then brought Blaze closer to the edge and then brings his member over the bed getting closer to her entrance she was presenting. He got a good look at Blaze and saw she had a nice toned body with average size breasts and butt. Maybe with a baby in her belly her body will grow even nicer and sexier her thought. He then immediately plunges into her pussy reaching inside as deep as he can. Immediately Tails can feel her inner muscles hugging his member while at the same time feeling inside her was a lot hotter compared to the rest of the girls. He thought maybe it could be the flames coursing through her body. He was enjoying it and started rocking his hips back and forth sliding his cock deeper into her body with his tip kissing her cervix. With each movement he made his enormous engorged testes were swaying back and forth as well where the other girls got a nice view and even hear the sloshing within as well. Tails got a view as well watching Blaze\u2019s breasts bounce up and down while her face was of pure enjoyment showing he was doing great with her. He continued until he felt like he was ready to burst. \u201cBlaze I\u2019m about to...\u201d. Before he could finish, Blaze locks her legs behind him bringing him closer and so he couldn\u2019t  move away he locks her arms around his neck putting his face closer to her. She then locks her lips with his while continues moving his hips even faster. Finally, he made his final plunge penetrating her cervix and releases his load into her womb. Trillions of his fox and fox/human swimmers started invading and look for any egg cells and once they did fertilize them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, as Tails was releasing his load in bursts Blaze\u2019s belly was getting filled causing it to expand making her look pregnant already to even where her belly was pressing against Tails\u2019 stomach. During all this Blaze was making purring noises as she was getting more inside her womb. After the last bit left Tails and entered Blaze, Blaze was rubbing her belly to feel how big she got. She then looks at Tails and asks, \u201cSo, how does it feel to make four girls pregnant and giving two princesses heirs?\u201d. He then replies, \u201cIt was scary at first, but now I don\u2019t mind because it feels so good. I want to make you all really pregnant. I don\u2019t care if my secret is out\u201d.

Amy then started walking toward Tails and the bed saying, \u201cFinally! About time it was my turn again. After all, I was the one who told you girls about Tails\u2019 new package so I think I deserve to enjoy him some more\u201d. Once she got close to Tails she gave him a kiss on the cheek then climbing on the bed. Tails was distracted for a moment from that kiss but then looks toward Amy and sees her presenting her vagina and butt hole to him while shaking her butt around. \u201cCome on Tails. You have one more left to satisfy. Don\u2019t you want to make me pregnant as well?\u201d. He then imagines her holding and rubbing her own large pregnant belly filled with his kits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to make that a reality as he got on the bed as well and positions himself right behind her while she prepares herself and puts her hands on the frame of the bed. He then aligns his cock to her entrance but this time inserts it slowly so she can feel every bit of his rod enter and fill her tunnel then his tip touching her cervix. Then he once again moving his hips back and forth sliding in and out of Amy\u2019s tunnel. He could tell that Amy was craving him as he felt her inner muscles squeezing his member tight and can feel how wet she is inside as it help lubricated his dick making him move inside faster. He began moving his hips faster making Amy pant heavily with her tongue sticking out of her mouth. It was only a matter of time before Tails was at his limit and he needed release. \u201cI\u2019m so close Amy. Get ready to take my seed and bear my kids like the rest\u201d. He then did another final thrust having his tip go past her cervix and started shooting bursts of cum into Amy\u2019s womb. His super fertile swimmers started moving around the womb until they found eggs floating in the womb and easily entered them fertilizing them which they then attached to the uterine walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, Tails was still pumping splooge into Amy\u2019s womb causing her belly to expand making her have the appearance of being pregnant with triplets. Once she received the last of Tails\u2019 seed Tails pulls out while she falls on the bed. She was breathing heavily but still managed to say, \u201cI know you\u2019ll take responsibility and take care of all of us \u201cdaddy\u201d\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Tails\u2019 testes. You were amazed at how much sperm has left inside where your home is and still the gonads were already quick to make more. You were pretty sure that your \u201chost\u201d has definitely made those girls pregnant. You then thought of what you could do next. You could wait until the girl\u2019s belly has grown large enough and explore their wombs to see how their kids are growing. You could also exit and enter the body of another male and have them mate with other female characters and if you ever felt tired you could always return to your home inside Tails.

Tails needed to satisfy four women now and with that he needed help from the inside and you were happy to oblige as you were living inside him. Besides, it was too early to check our to check out the unborn children in each girl so like you said you gave it a month at least before you did any exploration. The next few days the girls found out and told Tails they were pregnant with his kits, but then that became a problem as they became hornier than ever while the kids were growing inside them meaning Tails needed to help and you were happy to oblige and satisfy the needs of Tails\u2019 lovers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome wanted to be fully loaded \u201ccream pies\u201d so you used your magic to increase the storage capacity and production of sperm  in both testes causing them to grow twice their size. Their constant need for sex was another problem and even though Tails stamina was enough from the last change, you thought an extra boost wouldn\u2019t hurt as you hated to see your host exhausted after doing the deed multiple times to make them happy. At least now he will have enough energy to move around after their hump sessions. Every so often you would check to see the rest of his body and organs to see they were in perfect health making Tails healthy. There was one last change to consider. Not knowing how many babies the ladies would have, one thing was for sure and that was each of them was going to get big. With their constant need for sex that would mean Tails would have to perform with their enlarged states. Using your magic you focused on the muscles on his arms and legs tightening them and making them stronger. Now Tails would be able to lift things five times his size while still keeping his average frame. You even did something special in the muscles of Tails\u2019 member for the ladies. Now whenever he lodges his member inside their vaginal tunnel, it would immediately began to throb and pulse causing this pleasure feeling for Tails\u2019 lovers. After all that you felt a little tired but you should be fine if you rested a bit. Today should be the perfect day to explore their wombs and unborn children so you needed to be aware. That was then that the teste your home is inside began to move and later you were hearing sucking and licking noises. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, it was morning and there was Tails laying in a bed large enough to hold five to six people. Tails just started to wake up rubbing his eyes and letting out a loud yawn. He looks to his sides and sees none of his lovers sleeping beside him. Suddenly he let out a grunt of pleasure and looks in front of him. He saw a large form under his blanket where his nether regions are and can see movement under it. He can feel his member and even scrotum was getting moist while at the same time hearing those licking and sucking sounds and even some panting. He had a good idea what it was and pulls back the blanket. What he saw was what any guy who wants to be in a harem would dream. He saw both Amy and Sally working on him by licking the shaft coating it in their saliva and then take turns giving him a blowjob while Blaze and Mina both worked on a large testicle each licking them coating in saliva as well and even being playful by nibbling on the scrotum. During that time Tails got marvel at their extended stomachs and even though it\u2019s been a month they had large pregnant bellies. He still couldn\u2019t believe this was reality as he was with four of the hottest girls on Mobius and he was going to start a family with all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Tails\u201d Amy says stopping her service in which he greets back. \u201cSorry Tails, but we just couldn\u2019t wait anymore\u201d Sally says very apologetically. \u201cWe saw you resting so we decided to help ourselves\u201d Blaze says calmly. \u201cWell it is morning and both ourselves and our babies are gonna need that protein you have to offer\u201d Mina says energetically before going back to work on one of his testes. Soon they all followed in pleasuring Tails but took it one step further. Amy and Sally both had their pregnant bellies sandwich his member while using their enlarged, milk-filled breasts and started rubbing them higher on the shaft and finally still using their mouth to lick the tip in which they see the whole member was twitching from all the stimulation. Blaze and Mina went further as well as they made their enlarged breasts sandwich a gonad each and started rubbing them making them bounce between their breasts. They all can hear Tails moan continuously loudly until they heard a grunt. \u201cAlright girls. It\u2019s almost time\u201d Sally says to the others. Blaze and Mina then joined Sally and Amy where they started licking Tails\u2019 member as well. It was too much for Tails and he needed release and this one felt like it was almost drain him dry. He did a small thrust and cum was about come out into the air except at the last minute Amy slams her mouth on Tails\u2019 tip. She felt bursts of warm seed fill her mouth where she then swallows and feel it travel down her throat and enter her stomach. This lasted for a few seconds causing her stomach to extend slightly until she stopped gasping for air where then Sally took in Tails\u2019 milk into her mouth and stomach. Soon Sally needed to gasp for air as well and Blaze took the opportunity to get some baby batter as well. Finally it was Mina\u2019s turn and Tails still had plenty to offer as the splooge entered her mouth traveling down her gullet and fall into her stomach filling it and causing her belly to expand until she felt the last few drops enter her mouth making one last swallow to have the last of it join the rest. They all licked their lips to the \u201cmeal\u201d they just had and saw the Tails\u2019 family jewels were half the size they were earlier, but were shocked when they saw the testes were immediately growing back in size even hearing the sloshing noises as they were being filled in which the girls all smiled at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, you personally saw the new sperm form and fill up the space around your home which was empty a few moments ago. You then heard voices beyond the flesh and they were female in which you thought the girls were planning something. \u201cI think the babies will be satisfied for a while. Now I think he should satisfy us now\u201d Amy says in a seductive voice. This was just the opportunity you were waiting for. Tails will have sex with each girl in which you will stealthy exit him and enter their wombs to examine the unborn children. You grabbed your magic tablet and left your home and now all you had to do was wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was happy to have morning sex with all of them as even though the last thing they did felt draining he still had an endless vigor and strength that he can do so much more. Now the question is, who will he choose to mate with first. He decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He went with the one with the biggest pregnant belly so far which was Amy. During that one moment a month ago she got twice as much seed compared to the rest being the beginning and the end of that one  wonderful sex filled day. Tails can see that besides the large pregnant belly her breasts grew and gotten swollen as they were being filled with milk. Her hips expanded as well once her children grew inside not to mention her butt got bigger as well. Tails pointed at her and she got excited. \u201cHow do you want to do it?\u201d Amy asks. He replies, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you show me that new sexy butt of yours?\u201d. She then went with her back facing him and went down on all fours presenting her butt hole and pussy to him. Tails stood up and immediately placed himself behind her and started shoving his large erect member into her pussy. The further he went in caused Amy to moan loudly. Once reaching the entrance to her womb he started moving his hips back and forth feeling the muscles of her wet tunnel grab ahold his cock almost like not wanting to let go enjoying the throbs and pulses resonating from it. During that time Amy can feel the multiple kicks of her babies inside her belly. \u201cOh god. This feels so good. Looks like the babies know that daddy is right outside their room\u201d. Tails wanted a feel so he presses his body on top hers while still rutting her placing his hands in her pregnant belly feeling all the kicks his children were making. This turned him on more and he felt like he couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was your cue knowing at any moment you will enter another body to check on the young that some could be yours. With one last effort involving her, Tails gave one final powerful thrust penetrating her cervix and letting out his seed coating the inside her womb and his unborn children. That was when you left the testicle with your home/base and traveled in the muscles and through the fox\u2019s prostate until traveling through the urethra and shot out the penis and enter the womb or Amy Rose. Once inside you looked around and were amazed by the fetuses residing inside. From the looks of it there were going to be two hedgehogs and three foxes, one having the same fur color as your hair, being born in the future. You continue to watch them fidget and move and even sometimes kick until you got your fill of the growing life inside Amy Rose. You began making a symbol inside the womb that formed into a portal where now Tails\u2019 testicle and Amy\u2019s womb were linked and able to travel easier. You stepped through the portal and were now at \u201chome\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Tails and the girls, Tails was just finishing up letting out the last of his load for Amy. She just kept letting out multiple moans feeling her belly expand from the large amounts of baby batter. Tails then pulled out letting some leak out Amy\u2019s hole admiring his work. Still full of energy he says, \u201cAlright which of you sexy ladies want to go next. The one who took the opportunity is...</span></div></div>",

While walking toward him she can sees Tails\u2019 gonads become bigger being filled to to overflowing capacity which made her make a cute purring noise. She then proceeded to have Tails lay flat on the bed while she stands over his body. Tails sees mostly her belly from his pov and then see the belly descend as Blaze lowers herself making her pussy get penetrated by Tails\u2019 still erect member. She continues going down until his whole shaft fit snuggly inside her and she was sitting on his largely engorged testes. She then proceeded to move her body up and down riding his cock feeling it go deeper into her tunnel and touching her cervix. While riding she fondled her large breasts and from what Tails can see they were leaking. \u201cThink I can have some of that kitty milk?\u201d. She leans forward while making sure her hips moved up and down and then Tails went ahead and started sucking on a nipple slurping up some milk. As the warm milk traveled down he was getting turned on even more making him close to release and difficult to stop. He gave one powerful thrust up and his cock let out a large stream of splooge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Tails, you were once again waiting at the sphincter along with millions of Tails\u2019 little swimmers until it opened and you were jetted out going through the same path as before until you came through the opening once more and were now inside a nee womb. This one was a little different as it was much warmer that it was almost like an oven but manageable. You begin to look around inside the womb not knowing who it belongs to until you looked at the fetuses. You were able to see foxes as usual from your host and then you saw the developing kittens as well. \u201cI must be inside Blaze. That would explain why it\u2019s so warm in here. You saw that the cubs that some were yellow and purple and the same for the kittens. Then you saw some had the same color as your hair and you thought they look amazing. What surprised you the most were the hybrids as some you saw had the body of a fox except growing a fox\u2019s tail or tails. All of them seem to be in perfect development and health by your examination so you proceeded to make the magic circle to make the link with her and your base. Once completed a portal opened up and you can see your \u201chome\u201c where you pass through it. Once back you waited until the next intercourse Tails has with one of his other lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, Tails was still letting out his load inside Blaze. So much so that her belly was growing slightly and being overfilled that even her babies started kicking making her moan. \u201cTails, if you fill me up anymore I think you\u2019re going to drown our babies in your seed\u201d. When she said that she had a playful smile showing she was joking. One second later Tails finished giving the last of his seed. She rose off his cock making some of his seed spill out and started walking toward Amy who just had her fill earlier. Now Tails had only the bootylicious Sally or the wild and rocking Mina left to please. Who decides to go next?</span></div></div>",

You couldn\u2019t understand but you managed to restore enough mana to do something about that. You cast a spell where the entire testicle was enveloped and even the scrotum as well. Once the aura disappeared, you were able to hear the voices very clear. You were able to allow sound to pass through the organs better so you can listen in on their conversations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Tails, even though that\u2019s not a leg do you mind telling us how you got \u201cthat\u201d?\u201d. Cream then interrupted asking, \u201cWait... if that isn\u2019t a leg then what is it?\u201d. Vanilla then says, \u201cYou\u2019re getting at the age so I should tell you. That is what a man or in Tails\u2019 case boy uses to please a woman like you and I when he becomes old enough. They can please us even more when they\u2019re big and long like that\u201d. She kept eyeing his long rod some more making Tails blush while Cream was starting to understand eyeing it as well. \u201cDo you see those large round things under that long woman pleaser Creamy? Inside them Tails makes something that looks like milk that feels really warm when it goes inside a woman. If enough goes inside then he can make a girl have a baby grow inside them\u201d. \u201cA baby?\u201d Cream repeats the last thing her mother said. She then imagines herself with a round belly like when her mother had her. Vanilla then went to ask, \u201cSo Tails, how did a boy like you get something big like those?\u201d. Tails a little flustered getting all the compliments replied, \u201cI-I don\u2019t know. I just woke up like this. Though strangely enough it doesn\u2019t hurt and feels nice actually.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019ll bet\u201d Vanilla says giving bedroom eyes at him or more specifically his cock and balls which made Tails blush even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, you heard the entire conversation and you can tell that the rabbit Milf wants some of that fox cock and maybe Cream as well since she sounded interested that she heard the word baby. There was also one fact that you heard about rabbits that was interesting and that was that they were good at multiplying. You imagined both Vanilla and Cream filled with yours and Tails\u2019 kids. Now the only problem was it sounded like Tails was hesitant to do anything with them and doesn\u2019t sound like he was going to make a move anytime soon. It was then you came with an idea. \u201cSorry Tails. This is going to hurt for a bit but if you knew I was in here you would be thanking me for this\u201d. You used your magic one more time and have the magic aura envelop both testicles once more. In moments, the gonads were getting larger slowly but the production of sperm cells was going triple the speed. You thought that with the barely enough capacity inside to hold in the continue growing number of sperm cells produced that will give Tails the need to cum in which you hope that Vanilla and Cream will try to help him. The flesh walls around your home/base were beginning to pulse wildly. \u201cThat should help speed things up with the love making. Have fun Tails\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, he felt pressure building within himself and the next thing he did was fall on his knees and grab hold of his large nuts. \u201cTails?! Are you okay? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d asks Vanilla. Tails was panting heavily until he can barely make out the words, \u201cThey... feel... so full\u201d. Both Vanilla and Cream take a look at his balls that he was cradling and saw that somehow his testes were slowly growing and pulsing like crazy. \u201cNeed... to release\u201d Tails says and even though there were women in front of him he began stroking his cock. Vanilla shocked while also turning her on says, \u201cOh my goodness Tails. Don\u2019t do that. Here, let Cream and I help you. But first, let\u2019s go somewhere where we all can get comfy. Cream, help me with Tails\u201d. Cream obliges and they both carried him under his arms as they moved them upstairs and into his bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both helped him lie with his back on the bed. They were still in shock when they see between Tails\u2019 legs was a large meat pillar rising from the bed and right in front of it were two enormous fleshy spheres they continued to grow slowly. They also see Tails continue to pant heavily with a few grunts of pain in between. Cream concerned while looking at Tails asks, \u201cSo mama, how do we help him?\u201d. When she turns to face her mother she immediately sees her with her dress off and started taking off her bra. \u201cMom?! What are you doing?\u201d. Vanilla replies, \u201cLike I said earlier, I\u2019m going to help Tails. There must be too much \u201cmilk\u201d inside those round things and I\u2019m going to help him get rid of it by using my body. Why don\u2019t you watch me and see how it\u2019s done. Then you can decide if you want to help as well\u201d. Cream nods and agrees to watch while Vanilla did a sexy walk towards the bed and Tails. Tails still in pain managed to open his eyes and sees Vanilla completely naked. He saw her with all her curves, wide hips, DD cup breasts, large bouncy butt that can be seen even though looking at her front, and her pussy that was right above his member while looking soaked and leaking. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Tails. I\u2019m here to help. Just enjoy yourself while I work\u201d. She then began lowering herself letting the tip pass through her vaginal lips and now letting the rest of his shaft enter into her tunnel until the tip was pressing against her cervix. The warm feeling and her muscles squeezing his member was enough stimulation to help him deal with the pain but who knows how long that will last. Vanilla then began moving her body up and down letting Tails\u2019 member slide in and out of her hole. Though Tails was feeling pleasure from his penis he needed to distract him from the pain with something else. He then saw Vanilla\u2019s fun bags bouncing in front of him and even though she\u2019s an older adult her breasts were still nice and round and her beauty never changed even after having Cream. He takes the opportunity and moves his head and puts one of her nipples in his mouth and starts sucking on it. Vanilla moans a bit while she continues to move her body up and down. The pleasure was short lived when Tails lets go and grunts in pain which Vanilla can understand that he needed release way more than he did before. She could also tell by the testicles being right below her butt and she can feel the pulsing within them increase. \u201cI wanted to enjoy this a bit more but you seem too much in pain so I think it\u2019s time for a special technique I use. Doing this I guarantee will make any guy cum almost instantly. I can It the \u201csexy bunny hop\u201d\u201d. Vanilla then used her strong legs and started moving her body up and down at triple the speed making every part of her body bounce furiously. The continuous sliding between her inner muscles and his member was very stimulating and Tails was about to release. \u201cVanilla... I think you should get off. I\u2019m about to let it all out\u201d. Vanilla with a smirk on her face says, \u201cGet off?\u201d Oh no sweetie. I want it all inside. Give me all your baby batter and give me your kids\u201d. Tails wanted to ask why but the pain was too much and he had no choice. He gave a thrust that allowed his tip to go past the cervix and inside the womb. Then like a hose, a gushing amount of fox and fox/human sperm cells were leaving the testicles and passing through the shaft and finally exiting the tip and flow into the uterus. Rabbits being able to multiply in large amounts meant that Vanilla\u2019s womb was full of eggs and the sperm cells started attacking the eggs. Tails was still pumping his seed into Vanilla causing her belly to bloat and become round looking like she was pregnant. Vanilla receiving the last of it was still panting heavily then says, \u201cSo Tails, how do you feel now?\u201d. He replies, \u201cThey still feel kind of full but they don\u2019t hurt anymore. She can kind of tell as her butt was still in contact with his testicles and they did seem to pulse more slowly at the moment. \u201cVanilla, why did you want me to cum inside you. You know that will make you...\u201d. \u201cPregnant?\u201d Vanilla says finishing his sentence then continuing with, \u201cI know. To tell you the truth,I wanted to be pregnant again. Only this time with your young and fertile seed I will have many kids. Cream\u2019s father had a medical problem where his sperm was lacking and the end result we were only able to have Cream before he passed away. But with this large batch inside my womb I\u2019m sure I can have at least eight or maybe more little brother and sisters for Cream\u201d. Tails then imagined Vanilla with a very large pregnant belly with a few kicks coming from inside. \u201cYou naughty little fox. You just imagined me pregnant didn\u2019t you?\u201d. Tails was trying his best to convince her not by shaking his head no. Judging from that reply she can tell he must have a pregnancy fetish. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. After all that is what I wanted so I know you would be curious and imagine it. But It looks like I\u2019m not done yet\u201d. \u201cWhat?!\u201d Tails yells out worried what she meant by that. \u201cWell you did say those balls of your were still full. So I thought I should go another round with you but with a different view\u201d. She then started turning her body with his member still inside her in which her inner muscles moving around his shaft made him moan and actually enjoy the her wet hole. Now Vanilla was in reverse cowgirl position and Tails now had a full view of her round plump ass. She then proceeded to move her body up and down but now her belly full of seed was bouncing as well. Tails felt mesmerized seeing her butt bounce up and down where he decided to use both hands and grab each butt cheek. Vanilla first let out a gasp from the grab and then made purr like noises as she felt both her butt cheeks being felt and massaged by Tails. She then continued her bouncing with Tails\u2019 hands following. Then Tails felt another surge in his balls as he was about to cum. He already did it inside with Vanilla so making her pregnant is a past worry and decides to cum again inside but this time surprise Vanilla. When he felt close to releasing he let go of Vanilla\u2019s butt and grabbed both her arms and then took one final deep thrust and penetrates her cervix again and releases more seed into her womb. More sperm cells attacked the available eggs where many were then fertilized and attached to the uterine walls. Vanilla facing the opposite of Tails was now facing Cream  and her daughter was filled with shock as she saw her mother giving a face of pleasure with her tongue hanging out and even saw her belly inflate even more being filled with more seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tails and Vanilla were panting heavily but Vanilla manages to say, \u201cWell I think that\u2019s enough for me for now\u201d. She shakes her belly to hear all the sloshing of Tails\u2019 baby batter inside then continues with, \u201cI wonder how many kids I will get with all this\u201d. She then proceeded to lift herself up carrying her belly and dislodging his cock from inside her allowing some splooge to leak out of her pussy. She then walks towards Cream and asks, \u201cWell Cream, do you want to give it a try and help Tails yourself?\u201d It was then that...</span></div></div>",

I want to have babies inside me as well\u201d Cream says feeling a little embarrassed letting the truth out. \u201cWhat?! Why?\u201d Tails asks in shock with her reason. She then explains, \u201cIn our house I found a photo of Mama with a large belly. That must have been me growing inside her belly. She looked so beautiful and happy that I wonder if I would be the same if I had a couple of babies growing inside me\u201d.

She was going to live out his fetish and he just got a confession, so how can he say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He just nods and she jumps with joy as she then undresses removing her orange top and skirt then taking off her pink bandeau bra and panties letting her breasts bounce and her pussy exposed. She then walks toward the bed and climbs it to make herself right above Tails and his member. She aligns her vagina right above his cock just like her mother but was nervous. She says, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to put Tails\u2019 thing inside my... my...\u201d where her mother finishes with, \u201cthat is called your vagina sweetie. No need to be shy saying it\u201d.  Cream nods and then covers her eyes with her hands as she slowly lowers her body letting the tip of his penis pass through her nether lips and letting the rest enter deeper inside her and she let out a few moans. She then can feel it reach its end as she can feel the tip now pushing against her cervix. She removes her hands to see herself that Tails\u2019 member has disappeared inside her then looks at Tails moaning as well while saying, \u201cSo wet and tight\u201d. \u201cWay to go Creamy. Now make him feel good and get lots of \u201cmilk\u201d from him. I want to have lots of grandchildren as well\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream then placed her hands on Tails\u2019 chest and started moving her body up and down. As Tails mentioned before, he can feel her tight virgin muscles squeeze against his shaft while feeling it get warmed up by her body and covered in her love juices. Tails moans was getting louder making Cream believe she was doing it right. She did see her mom\u2019s \u201ctechnique\u201d and decided to try it as well. She was a fast learner as she began moving her legs and bouncing three times as fast. Her breasts and butt were bouncing with each bounce she made. Tails can see her fun bags bounce in front of him and even though they are not as large as Vanilla\u2019s, she is her daughter and will probably be big like that when she\u2019s older especially when she becomes a soon-to-be mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCream... I\u2019m about to cum. Take my seed and bear my children\u201d Tails says as he can feel pressure bulging up in his balls. Cream understood as she gave one final slam while Tails did another final thrust up where it caused his member to go deep enough to for the tip of Tails\u2019 penis to penetrate the womb and pass the cervix. He then let out burst of cum to flood her womb where there were many eggs inside Cream\u2019s womb just like her mother. Tails\u2019 little soldiers immediately went to attack those egg cells. Tails kept pumping cum into her womb causing her belly to slowly inflate making her look a few months pregnant. Tails was panting heavily when he heard the words, \u201cMore. Please give me more Tails. I want to have lots of babies with you\u201d. He looked at Cream who looks to have eyes that were filled with lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did it twice with Vanilla so he thought why not with Cream but he was gonna do something different. With him still inside Cream he lifts her body and himself off the bed where he stands then lays Cream on her back on the edge of the bed putting her in a missionary position. He then started moving his hips back and forth sliding his member in and out her body with his large testicles swaying back and forth. He continued pounding her for a few minutes until he had that feeling before where he needed to release. He took one final thrust and plunged deep inside and passing through her cervix once more and entering her womb. He then more of his seed travel through his entire reproductive system and exit his penis tip and flood inside her uterus. More sperm cells started attacking the egg cells inside her womb fertilizing them and attached to the uterine walls of the young rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream was just like her mother as while more of Tails\u2019 seed was being pumped into her womb making her belly look nine months pregnant she panted heavily while giving the same face of pleasure with her tongue hanging out her mouth. Once the last bit of semen left his penis he pulled out of her pussy watching some of his seed leave her hole. Cream still laying on the bed started rubbing her belly hearing the sloshing noises and says, \u201cMama, is this enough to have some babies grow inside me?\u201d. Vanilla replies, \u201cYes sweetie. Your belly has so much you might have as many as me. Maybe more\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the testicles, you can hear that Tails was able to satisfy both rabbits. You thought that maybe you should put things back the way they were. You used your magic once more and revert the sperm production back to only twice the speed and have both testicles stop growing keeping them at the current large size they are now. Back with a Tails and the rabbits, Vanilla asks, \u201cTails, how do you feel now? Are you still in pain?\u201d. He replies, \u201cYeah, I think I\u2019m alright now. Strangely enough though, I  still feel very horny and need more. Do you ladies mind helping me a bit more?\u201d. Both Cream and Vanilla look to see that his cock was throbbing while his testicles still looked huge, pulsing, and full and when he did a little shake they can hear sloshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Someone else was entering Tails\u2019 house at that moment. Once the door pushed open a pair of robotic legs can be seen entering the home followed by a robotic arm and the rest seem to be the figure of another female rabbit. \u201cTails sugar, ya in here?\u201d. It was Bunnie Rabbot and it looks like she needed Tails for something. \u201cWhere are ya you cutie. I need you to do a check up on my arm and legs if you don\u2019t mind none\u201d. She started looking through the bottom floor of the house and the workshop but didn\u2019t find him. It was then she heard noises coming from upstairs. Once she went up she followed the noises and the closer she got the more it sounded like loud moans and panting. She can tell the noises were coming from the door and she prepared herself as she opened the door. \u201cOh my stars!\u201d Bunnie only managed to say as she was shocked with what she saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sees Tails\u2019 back side where she sees his hips moving forward and back along with a pair of legs clinging to his waist. Tails continued moving until he yelled out from pleasure with another yell from Cream as he started pumping more of his seed into Cream\u2019s womb. Bunnie then looks to the side and in the corner she sees Vanilla giving one of those faces of absolute pleasure while baby batter was leaking from her pussy meaning she must have had a third helping already from Tails. Since things quieted down Tails was able to hear the sounds of mechanical parts where he turned around. \u201cOh, hi Bunnie. Sorry you had to see me like this, but Cream and Vanilla were helping me with a little problem I\u2019m having. Hold on\u201d. He then pulled out his member from Cream\u2019s pussy and then turns toward her. Once he turned around Bunnie can see everything. From the large shaft that was wet from the love juices while throbbing strongly wanting to be inside someone to the large family jewels dangling under it that were pulsing furiously like they wanted attention. Bunnie was surprised that he showed no effort to hide them while she was standing in front of him. She thought could Tails be growing up so fast and now knows a lot when it comes to sex. It was like he was an entirely different person. The more she eyed his package the more she felt like she wanted it as well as she can feel a warmth from below because unfortunately for her she was in heat. She tried to get Antoine to satisfy her but she had no luck with him as he didn\u2019t feel up for it making their love life and relationship drifting apart. But with Tails she thought she can get what she needs to satisfy that desire she has and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I can help you with your little problem?\u201d. Tails was shocked by that question to hear someone who took care of him when he was little wants to have sex with him to satisfy his urges. \u201cAre you sure Bunnie? If you join in there is a high chance I can get you pregnant as well. Cream and Vanilla are fine with that, but do you want to risk that as well?\u201d. Bunnie thought she was going nowhere with Antoine so why not go with the cute fox boy. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Make me a mother of your youngens as well. From the looks of it, you want that to happen anyways. She wasn\u2019t wrong as he imagines all three bunnies in the future having large pregnant bellies in front of him while in unison saying, \u201cTails...\u201d. He then snaps into reality and then looks at Bunnie to nod and tell her to come over. The only concern Tails had was that with her legs roboticized would her entire lower area be roboticized as well? She then pulls off her only clothing the pink leotard and he got his answer as he saw a pair of wet fleshy lips between her robotic legs. \u201cWow...\u201d Tails ogles while Bunnie replies, \u201cYup. That's still me. Before we start do you mind if I...\u201d. She was then pointing at his large stick where he got the hint and replies, \u201cSure, go ahead\u201d. She then went on both knees with her face staring at his massive cock. She wondered if she could fit the thing in her mouth and tries by opening her mouth and taking the tip inside. She continued taking the rest of it letting it travel down her throat making Tails moan. She stopped almost taking the whole thing before she started gagging from his member and instead proceeded to move her head back and forth. She was then hit with two flavors one from a Tails\u2019 stick and the other the juices from his last mate Cream. She continued as she couldn\u2019t resist the taste and musky smell from his cock and Tails started helping by putting his hands behind her head and guided the movement of her mouth. After a minute, Tails felt like he was about to let it all out so he pulled Bunnie\u2019s head closer letting his his member travel deeper down her throat. Sure enough ropes of cum started leaving his cock and started descending to Bunnie\u2019s stomach causing it to bloat a bit. Bunnie took in every last drop and once Tails was done and pulled out she felt like she just gulped down an entire gallon of milk. She then looked at Tails\u2019 testes to see they shrunk a bit but immediately were growing back to their previous large size. \u201cHow much you got in there?\u201d Bunnie asks curiously. He replies, \u201cDon\u2019t know. Been trying to see if they\u2019ll grow smaller but no luck\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that actually made Bunnie smile as she was not done with him yet. Still on the ground she turns around with her behind facing him while giving a little shake. \u201cCome on Tails sugar. Take me and make me yours\u201d. He was happy to oblige as he took his still erect member and puts it right behind Bunnie\u2019s hole. He takes a deep breath before plunging inside making his cock take in all the space in her tunnel with his tip brushing against her cervix. Bunnie yelled out in pleasure surprised by how forceful he was entering her. Tails then proceeded to move his hips back and forth letting his shaft slide in and out of her tunnel. Bunnie can immediately feel the throbbing from his cock while he can feel her inner muscles trying to squeeze the life from his member making them both feel good. The humping went on for a while until Tails felt that pressure in his balls again. He needed to make sure so he asked Bunnie again, \u201cBunnie I\u2019m close. I can pull out and cum outside\u201d. She immediately replies, \u201cNo! Do it inside. I need to feel your fox milk inside me. I\u2019m burning up down there and only your milk will do the trick. I don\u2019t care if you make me a mother\u201d. With the final confirmation he gave one final thrust penetrating through her cervix where she yells out, \u201cOh my stars!\u201d. Immediately Tails\u2019 seed started flooding Bunnie\u2019s womb and starts attacking egg cells managing to fertilize them and latching to the walls of the uterus. Bunnie can still feel Tails cumming inside her causing her belly to inflate. Once the last of it entered Bunnie she felt like she needed more of Tails\u2019 splooge. She got her wish when she felt Tails lift her from the ground despite him being a little smaller than her. He then takes out his member to have her turn around facing him face to face and then lifts her body in the air where he re-inserts his cock into her pussy once more. \u201cT-Tails, what are you doing?\u201d. He smiles while replying, \u201cI need more. I know you it more as well. I can tell by how wet you are\u201d. She couldn\u2019t deny that and let him proceed as he moved his hips up and down while holding her up. With every thrust he made caused her body to bouncing meaning Tails got an eye full of fun bags bouncing in front of him. He then took one step further and kisses her on the lips where instead of rejecting it she joins in and does the same. It went on for a while until Tails had that saying feeling before. Since he has his seed inside her he didn\u2019t need to hold back on this next release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave one final thrust having his penis inside her womb and releasing his baby maker fluid in gallons. Bunnies made out a face of pure pleasure as her belly begins to inflate once more to the point of even touching Tail\u2019s stomach. Tails was finished and felt like he was almost milked dry and the end result was Bunnie\u2019 s belly looking to be nine months pregnant with triplets. With all the seed in her womb there was no doubt more of her eggs became fertilized leading to more of Tails children to grow in her uterus. Tails felt happy that he was able to impregnate three beautiful bunnies and that they were happy themselves to bear his children. Now he wonder if anyone else would show up and see his new equipment joining his little harem he already has. Also thinking about what the future will hold for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, you thought to yourself that Tails has been pretty busy and wonder yourself how far this will go in this little harem that Tails was having. You looked around to see the teste was being filled with sperm cells once again which you assume the other was doing the same. You thought will Tails be mating with someone else either by chance or he looks for someone? Should you stay for a while and see the end results of Tails\u2019 love life? Maybe you should do what you did to Tails to another male. All these thoughts flooded in your head and you needed some time. What happens next... </span></div></div>",

Just what I needed after cleaning and working on the Tornado for so long. Feeling pretty hungry right now. Should get something to eat. He use his Tails and lifts himself out the pilot seat away from the plane and descends to the floor.  \u201cWonder what sounds good today\u201d Tails says were he finally noticed the change in his voice as it sounded lighter and higher pitched. \u201cWhy do I sound so funny?\u201d.

He looked at his tornado where the metal was shiny and reflective and he saw his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a female fox in front of him and wondered what that was about until he realized that was him. He became a she. She couldn\u2019t believe it and needed to see if it was actually real.

Now she had to see about those small hills on her chest which looked to be the size of D cups. She guided one of her fingers closer to one of her breasts and poked it where she let out a yelp of pleasure and her face turned red.There is also all the curves on her body and her butt that seem to grow nice and plump and bouncy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to face facts that she turned into a sexy vixen.

Panicking she quickly found a place to hide in as flying and hiding in the Tornado would make a lot of noise. She hid behind a locker that hold many of her tools.

I wanted to know if you can fix my communicator. I haven\u2019t been able to contact Cream or the rest of our friends. Hellllooo?\u201d Tails was looking at Amy looking for her but she was hidden nearby. Amy looked near the Tornado where there was enough space for Tails to sneak past her and run to her room. She crept and sneaked behind Amy not making a sound and thought she was in the clear. Unfortunately for her, one of her tools was on the floor where she stepped on it and it rolled under her foot and she fell ending with a *thud*. Amy turned to see Tails on the floor with her vagina and breasts exposed while she was rubbing her new round butt. It took a moment for Tails to notice Amy seeing her where Amy\u2019s face was red and that led Tails to tell out, \u201cKyaa!\u201d before using her tails to cover her vagina and her arms to cover her D cup breasts. \u201cTails? What happened to you?\u201d. The only answer Tails can come up with is, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know?. You mean you didn\u2019t cause this?\u201d. Tails with tears in her eyes shakes her head no and explains she just woke up like that after resting from fixing her plane. Tails has no reason to make this stuff up so Amy believes her. Tails looks like she was about to cry while saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do now\u201d. Amy tries to cheer him up by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Tails. I\u2019ll help you keep this a secret from our friends. And the first thing to do is get you some clothes before you go out in the open\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me just going outside like this?\u201d Tails asks not realizing what the problem is. Amy rolls her eyes and explains, \u201cWe can\u2019t leave you with all those for all to see\u201d where she points at her breasts poking through her chest fluff and her pussy in front not covered by her tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails agreed and Amy told her that she can give one of her clothes for the meanwhile until they go to a clothing store and get Tails some new clothes. Amy managed to find a long piece of fabric that she can cover Tails with like a cloak. She puts it over Tails and left Tails\u2019 house and headed towards Amy\u2019s house which was close by and hopefully less possible to be spotted by someone. After a few minutes they reached Amy\u2019s house and they both entered and they headed towards Amy\u2019s bedroom. Tails stayed near the door while Amy walks to and opens her closet. The first thing that Tails spots in Amy\u2019s closet is the many red dress that Amy wears. \u201cHow many of those red dresses do you have?\u201d. Amy instantly replies, \u201cI like this dress. Who cares if I have many of them\u201d. Tails just accepts that while Amy tosses one of her dresses to Tails where she immediately puts it on. The dress felt a little tight on her chest and her butt was a little exposed under but it at least managed to cover any chance for anyone to see her pussy. \u201cSorry Tails. I can\u2019t give you any of my panties since they look like they might not fit you\u201d insinuating about her large butt that would like her butt is eating Amy\u2019s panties if worn. Tails understands and looks at herself wearing the dress then saying, \u201cI think there might be a few problems wearing this, but at least it covers enough. We should find a clothing store right away\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was rushing out of the bedroom ready to leave until Amy stops her by yelling, \u201cHold on\u201d. Tails did halt and asks, \u201cWhat is it now?\u201d. Amy then replies, \u201cI think there is one more thing we need to hide, don\u2019t you think?\u201d. Tails was confused what she meant until Amy pointed in which Tails found out it was directed to her twin Tails. \u201cHow many other foxes you\u2019ve seen that have two tails. Hold on I might have something that will help\u201d. Amy goes to a dresser and opens a drawer. Inside was a pair of gold ring accessories like the ones she wears around her wrist but they were much larger. She went back towards Tails and asks, \u201cDo you mind holding your tails together?\u201d. Tails nods and kept her two tails together while Amy slipped the gold rings over her tails. \u201cThere\u201d. Amy was finished and now concealed her two tails by disguising them into a large fluffy single tail. \u201cThis feels weird\u201d Tails says trying to get used to it looking in a mirror and moving her two tails as one in which Amy replies, \u201cI know, but at least it will be pretty hard to tell it\u2019s you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails agrees and they both headed out the house and on their way to buy new clothes for Tails. Then what happens next is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After some walking, Amy and Tails finally reached a shopping center. Amy kept leading Tails until she says, \u201cHere we are\u201d leading Tails to one of her favorite stores. Tails looks at it and asks, what\u2019s so great about this place. Amy then gives an explanation, \u201cThis place has all the latest fashions and the most cutest things. This is actually where I bought my favorite dress. Also, the store owner is just the nicest person you\u2019ll ever meet. I think you met her once before. But try to act you don\u2019t know her if you do\u201d. Tails agrees and they both head inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, their eyes viewed the many dresses, underwear, and accessories as far as the eye can see. Tails had no idea what to pick since she never wore clothes when she was a guy. \u201cWhat do you think looks good for me Amy?\u201d. Before she could answer she heard a familiar voice. \u201cWell if it isn\u2019t my favorite customer\u201d. Amy turns around to see Honey the Cat and when Tails saw her she did feel like she did see her somewhere before but like Amy said best not to remember at the moment. Amy rushes to give Honey a hug saying, \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you Honey\u201d. After they both separated from their hug Tails walks toward them and Honey spots her. \u201cAnd whose this? Wait... she somehow looks familiar. Both Amy and Tails were sweating bullets thinking the secret was revealed, especially when Honey yells out thinking she figured it out. \u201cI know! Are you in any way related to that cute fox boy Tails?\u201d. Both Amy and Tails looked at each other then Amy answers with, \u201cYeah... something like that\u201d. \u201cI thought so. But between you and me, he may be cute but it seems you got the cute and sexy working for you\u201d Honey says while examining Tails\u2019 curves, butt and large chest. Tails blushes while saying, \u201cT-thank you\u201d. Honey then went ahead and asks, \u201cSo, what\u2019s your name?\u201d. \u201cOh, my name is Mile-, I mean Millie. Nice to meet you\u201d. \u201cThe pleasures all mine Millie. Feel free to look around and if you need any help let me know\u201d. Tails thanks her and both she and Amy kept lookin around the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many dresses and looks to choose from, Tails couldn\u2019t decide. Luckily for her, Amy was there to help and choose out a few dresses and even some normal outdoor clothes to wear and Tails headed to the clothing store. \u201cHold on. Aren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201d Tails turns around not knowing what she meant until Amy started pointing at the section with bras and panties. \u201cDo I really have to?\u201d Tails asks where Amy immediately replies, \u201cYes you do! I allowed you to go clamando for this long but now you need to put on some underwear. Also a bra since I can your breasts bounce everyone during our walk here. Judging from your bust you look like a D cup so go find one\u201d. Tails annoyed went to find a bra and panties her size and finds one in blue as the first one she takes. \u201cBlue, does it remind you of a certain friend of ours?\u201d Amy asks jokingly. Not realizing that connection until now Tails yells, \u201cCut it out Amy!\u201d. She pulls a couple more of them and heads to the changing room. She takes one of the booths and immediately starts putting that blue bra and panties. Already she thought it was weird. Weird already that she has spherical shapes of fat growing on her chest and now her thing replaced by a pair of lips with a tunnel inside. Now she has to wear a piece of fabric between her legs and to hold her new chest. She puts then both on and pleasantly enough, they felt great on her body with no signs of discomfort. She chose next to wear a skater dress in a teal color that had a hole in the back for her \u201ctail\u201d to fit through. She puts it on and then looks at her with a mirror provided in the booth. There she looks at herself the more she likes how she looked in the dress but she needed another opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails steps out of the booth and see Amy outside where she asks shyly with her arms behind her back, \u201cWhat do you think Amy?\u201d. She happily responds, \u201cOh my gosh Tails! You look so cute. If you were s girl this whole time I\u2019m sure the guys would be all over you\u201d. Surprising to hear this kind of compliment she asks, \u201cY-you think so?\u201d In which Amy nods. Tails didn\u2019t know what else to think. Every since his change from boy to girl he\u2019s been hiding these new emotions welling up inside him. He thought to himself, will this change his preference that since she\u2019s a girl now will she like guys now? Hearing that compliment from Amy made her think more about it. She then decided to worry about it later as she doubt no situation involving that topic would occur soon. She went ahead and tried the rest of the clothes she picked out and with Amy\u2019s approval went ahead and bought them. Honey helped with their transaction  in which Tails paid in rings and Honey says, \u201cThank you for your purchases. We hope to see you again soon.\u201d They both left the store while Honey waved goodbye to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we bought you some clothes we should go get something to eat\u201d Amy says thinking Tails was listening. Tails carrying shopping bags filled with her clothes thought of things like is there a way to change her back into a he even though having no clue how it happened in the first place. Or should she embrace her new life as a female and think of looking for her significant male other. All those thoughts left her distracted to not only get separated from Amy but bump into another mobian. She fell backwards landing on her butt letting out an \u201cOww...\u201d while the contents of her bags spilled on the floor. She rubs her butt to soothe the pain when she saw a shadow loom over her which must have been the mobian she ran into. \u201cDo you need some help?\u201d Tails heard and by the sound of it was male and familiar. She looks up to see it was...</span></div></div>",

Have we met before?\u201d Sonic asks wondering how she knew his name. \u201cOh.. there isn\u2019t any mobian who doesn\u2019t know about the hero of Mobius, Sonic the Hedgehog\u201d. It seem that he bought that explanation as he thought that made sense. \u201cWould like some help with your things?\u201d Sonic asks while Tails just noticed all her new clothes all over the floor and scrambles to collect them all. Sonic just decides to help the fox girl as he starts placing the some contents into a bag. He picked one up and finds out he was holding panties making him blush. Tails sees this blushing as well grabbing it out of his hands and says, \u201cThank you Sonic, but I\u2019ll pick up the rest. She goes ahead and goes on her hands and knees to pick up the rest of her clothes on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tails is on the floor, Sonic manages to catch a glimpse of her blue panties under her skirt but then looks away as he blushes. Tails did feel like someone was looking behind before realizing her situation and blushed even more and quickly stuffed the rest of her clothes in the shopping bags. She rose up with bags in arms and talks to Sonic. \u201cSorry about bumping into you. Umm... you didn\u2019t happen to see anything while I was down there, did you?\u201d. Sonic tries to hide his blush and replies immediately, \u201cN-Nope! Didn\u2019t see a thing\u201d. Sonic got another good look at her and thought she looked pretty cute and sexy in the dress. At the same time she reminds him of something but couldn\u2019t figure out what. \u201cSorry we had to meet in these embarrassing circumstances Miss...\u201d. Tails answers, \u201cMy name is Millie\u201d. \u201cGreat to meet you Millie. Hey, if you aren\u2019t busy would you like to join me for a snack. I know this great place that makes the best chili dogs\u201d. Tails replies with only, \u201cOh, um... well...\u201d. She thought to herself what was wrong with her. She never had trouble talking with Sonic before. She then thought could it be because now that she\u2019s a girl and these weird feelings and emotions inside her is making it difficult to talk to a boy like Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside \u201cMillie\u201d, you were starting to wake up from your long slumber with your mana fully replenished and found out you were now inside a large warm space where you can clearly hear Tails\u2019 heartbeats when you remembered before you were in a tunnel like space that was Tails\u2019 member. You can only assumed that the spell you casted work making Tails into a female and you are now inside \u201cher\u201d womb. You were proven right when you levitated to the top of the uterus and see two tunnels that you assumed must lead to her ovaries. You used your magic tablet to give you an entire diagram of Tails\u2019 body. Sure enough, you can see she has large breasts, a plump butt, and luscious curves all over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard muffled noises which one you assumed to be Tails\u2019 female voice and the other of a male that sounded familiar. You decided to use your magic to allow sound to pass through Tails\u2019 body letting you listen better in conversations. You then heard, \u201cSo what do you say, Millie? Would you like to have lunch with me?\u201d. You can tell that voice belonged to Sonic. Now the question was should you get them together and mate or should he let them maybe develop a relationship on their own. It was then that...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to take matters into your hands as you started traveling to one of \u201cMillie\u2019s\u201d ovaries. One you got there you saw the many sacs that would be holding the freshly produced egg cells. With your magic you focused on the entire ovary. Soon those sacs would rupture and release the eggs and began traveling through the Fallopian tube and making it to the uterus. Once the sacs released all the eggs they have stored, they start healing and began producing more eggs. You did it one side so might as well do the same thing for the other ovary. The end result of your intervention was many eggs floating inside the uterus just waiting to be fertilized. \u201cLet\u2019s see if Tails get things started\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that time Tails was still talking with Sonic and still deciding whether she should go with him. It was then that she felt strange. For her it felt like her whole body was heating up and just getting warmer. She also felt tingly in her lower half between her legs. She just then fell on her knees while Sonic was panicking wondering if he did something wrong. Other mobians were beginning to stare so Sonic thought fast as he picked up Millie and her bags and dashed away somewhere where they couldn\u2019t be seen. He did managed to find a way that looked like not many pass through and thought they were safe. \u201cThat was close. Didn\u2019t need the extra eyes looking and thinking something was wrong\u201d Sonic says then giving a sigh of relief. He looked back to see Millie was still breathing heavily. \u201cMillie? What\u2019s wrong? I can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d. Tails couldn\u2019t figure it out either as she never experienced this before until Sonic showed up. She then thought could it be her female side is taking over after making contact with a male. Suddenly her head was getting fuzzy and she couldn\u2019t take it anymore and let these feelings overtake her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looked at Millie and saw that she wasn\u2019t breathing heavily anymore and then saw her look up at him with her having bedroom eyes. \u201cMillie?\u201d Sonic manage to only say before what happened next. Millie got closer to Sonic and started rubbing his nether regions. This made Sonic moan a bit and sure enough Millie got the result she wanted. She saw that he was well hung with a large member and very large family jewels that she can play with if she wanted to. \u201cMillie, what are you doing?\u201d Sonic says but it seems they fell on deaf ears. She then got closer to his package with her mouth open and begin stuffing his member inside her mouth and even down her throat. Sonic began to pant heavily feeling his dick put inside her  warm mouth covered in saliva. Millie then proceeded to move her mouth back and forth letting his dong slide in and out and sometimes travel deeper down her throat. Sonic couldn\u2019t help but take part as he grabbed behind her head and started moving his hips back and forth manually moving his member inside her mouth. This lasted for a few minutes until Sonic couldn\u2019t take it anymore and released his load in bursts down her throat and fall into her stomach. He was able to take out his member out of mouth still shooting what was left into her mouth before falling on the floor and catching his breath and feeling exhausted. Millie swallowed the seed left in her mouth and licked her lips while quietly saying, \u201cThat was delicious\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then immediately started taking off all her new clothes and accessories except the rings keeping her tails together. While Sonic still recovering from what he just a few moments ago hears Millie say, \u201cYou said you wanted to help...\u201d. He then looks up to see Millie completely naked with her arms against a wall and her butt facing him exposing her butt hole and pussy where she finishes with, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you help me with this?\u201d then using one of her hands to slap her one her butt cheeks causing it to bounce. This excited Sonic making his penis hard again and filled with vigor while his testes were pulsing ready to go. He stood up and the first thing he did was feel the young vixen\u2019s plump butt on how soft it was making Millie giggle from the touch. He then started aligning his member to her lower entrance then taking a fast plunge into her tunnel. He then immediately began to move his hips back and forth making his dick travel deeper into her tunnel getting closer to her cervix. Each time his hips made contact with her butt made a slapping sound while causing her butt to jiggle. Both Sonic and Millie were panting heavily as they were both enjoying it. After a while Sonic can feel the pressure inside his balls was becoming too much meaning he needed release. Without telling Millie, he did one final thrust which was enough for his tip to penetrate her cervix and started releasing his seed in loads into her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you saw the entrance to Millie\u2019s baby maker passed through by Sonic\u2019s tip and started spraying out his little swimmers into her womb in search of eggs. Lots of them were able to find eggs and immediately entered them as the eggs were eager to accept them and then started attaching to the uterine walls. Now you can see that \u201cMillie\u201d was pregnant with Sonic\u2019s kids. You were really surprised how Millie immediately went to have sex with Sonic. Could the magic you used had a side effect that affected her mind into have strong feminine urges? Well it\u2019s already been done so why do something now. \u201cI wonder how things will turn from here?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My body can\u2019t even hold it all in\u201d. Sonic closes his eyes thinking he needs to rest for a bit and once he opens his eyes shocked him. He now sees Millie on all fours shaking her plump, round butt side to side while she says, \u201cBut I want more. I know you want some of this too\u201d. She was proven right as little Sonic sprang back to life throbbing wanting more which Millie just giggled seeing that. Sonic dashed behind her and immediately shoves his schlong back into her wet tunnel then moving his hips back and forth making a clapping noise as hips collided with her jiggly butt. For him it felt better a second time as it felt his member getting squeezed by her insides like her body craved his dick so badly. This only motivate him to move faster and Millie had no complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Amy was in search of her fox friend as earlier she noticed Millie didn\u2019t follow her to the dining area. For almost half an hour she was searching through every part of the shopping center for her friend. She thought she wasn\u2019t going to find her until she heard faint noises coming from a deserted area and decides to follow them. The closer she got she was now able to hear echoes of heavy breathing and moans that sounded like coming from a boy and girl. She assumes she might be stumbling on a couple\u2019s \u201cprivate\u201d time but she needed to be sure. She was shocked when she got a good view of the source of the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy watches as Sonic is plowing her now female fox friend and judging by the expressions on their faces were enjoying every moment of it. \u201cHope you\u2019re ready Millie. Here comes a second helping\u201d says Sonic feeling like he was ready to burst. Millie immediately replies, \u201cDo it Sonic! Give me everything you got\u201d. Sonic grabbed and pulled on her \u201ctail\u201d bringing her closer as he gave one final thrust penetrating her cervix and entering her womb once more and releasing his load. Inside, you saw all of Sonic\u2019s little swimmers invading the womb and started attacking eggs to fertilize. You did hear how Millie wanted to hold more of Sonic\u2019s seed inside her so you used your magic once more. You cast a spell and immediately the fleshy walls of the uterus began to stretch and expand further apart from each other creating more cum capacity and space. Judging by how things are going with all those new fertilized eggs attaching to the walls she was going to need the space for all those fox cubs, hedgehogs, and hybrids growing in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy continues to watch as Sonic pumps the last of his baby batter into Millie before she collapses on the floor laying on her side to reveal her inflated belly full of seed making her look pregnant with twins with no sign of spunk leaking out. Amy didn\u2019t know what to do. Should she be angry that Sonic did it with another girl or saddened that she\u2019s not Sonic\u2019s first. In the end, all she managed to do was yell out, \u201cTai- Millie?! And Sonic?!\u201d. Sonic turns around and freezes like a kid getting caught doing something bad. \u201cAmy?! How long were you there?\u201d. She replies, \u201cLong enough to see you have your way with my friend\u201d. \u201cYou know Millie?\u201d. Amy nods and that left him speechless. While he was baffled by this news and idea occurred to Amy. This whole time she could never get Sonic to do it with her. But maybe since he had his way with Millie he might still be able to continue with her. She walks up to Sonic and starts stroking his shaft snapping him out of his realization. He looks at her giving him bedroom eyes with her saying, \u201cHow about giving me a turn riding this thing. The idea of having to bang two girls in one day filled him with enough vigor to go one more time as his member became erect once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGood boy. Now why don\u2019t you lie down while I get ready\u201d. Sonic did as he was told and laid flat in the floor with his cock sticking in the air. Amy began taking off her red dress to reveal her white bra and panties then eventually taking those off as well revealing her medium sized breasts and pussy which Sonic can see was already wet. She then stood over Sonic and slowly descends her body letting his dick enter her pussy until it was fully in her body making her moan in pleasure. She then proceeded to move her body up and down letting his dong move in and out of her pussy while Sonic enjoys the view of her breasts jiggling in front of him. He couldn\u2019t resist and grabs both breasts in his hands making Amy squeal but continues to move her body. After a while Sonic can feel pressure building in his balls telling him that he was going to cum soon. \u201cAmy, I\u2019m about to...\u201d. Amy immediately replies, \u201cDo it inside just like you did Millie\u201d. He was happy to oblige as he did one final thrust up making his tip penetrate through her cervix and release his load into her womb. Unlike Millie who was getting assistance of some kind Amy only had a limited amount of eggs floating in her uterus that the sperm still managed to fertilize them and have them stick to the walls of the uterus. Now just like Millie she was pregnant with Sonic\u2019s kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s womb was filled making her belly inflate a bit where she started poking at it feeling how squishy it is. She then got up to dislodge his penis from her hole making some cum drip out while Sonic stayed on the floor exhausted needing to rest for a bit before trying to get a few answers from Amy involving her and the fox girl he just made love with a moment ago. Then...</span></div></div>",

She then became aware of the warm feeling between her legs and she looked down. She placed two fingers in her private area and when she pulled them out she manages to collect some white substance on them. She was still a little dazed but little by little she was putting the pieces together until she realized what the white stuff was. With this realization her head turned a bright red and steam was forming above her head almost feeling dizzy until she let out a light squeal that caught the attention of both Amy and Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sonic do you know that girl?\u201d Amy asks Sonic wanting to see how much he knows. He replies, \u201cNot really. All I could get from her was her name is Millie. Then things just happened until you caught me and her. Are you mad?\u201d. She was before but then says, \u201cI\u2019m a little saddened that I wasn\u2019t your first, but at least you gave me the one thing I wanted for so long\u201d. It was then Sonic realized something, \u201cWait... when you found us you said her name. Do you know who she is?\u201d. Amy panicked as she might be at risk of revealing Millie\u2019s secret so she needed to think of a lie quick and she knew just what to say. \u201cYeah... she\u2019s my friend. And she happens to be Tails\u2019 cousin\u201d. Sonic shocked by that fact stops Amy mid sentence and says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know Tails had a cousin (and a cute one at that). Why didn\u2019t he tell me.  Maybe I should give him a call so he can tell me himself\u201d. Sonic was about to pull out a communicator until Amy stops him yelling, \u201cYou cant! He\u2019s uh...  traveling somewhere to do some research where talking to him will be difficult. He won\u2019t be back for a while. Until then he asked his cousin to watch his place for the meanwhile. Turns out she\u2019s a genius too. Tails asked me to show her around to get used to the town and locals while giving me money to buy her some new clothes. We spend some time together until we lost each other and that must have been when you found her and then doing... that. And that\u2019s how it all went down I swear\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was suspicious of that story looking at Amy while she had a fidgeting smile and was sweating profusely. After a while Sonic shrugged it off and decided to accept it giving Amy the chance to sigh in relief. Sonic then walked to Millie as she was on the floor scrambling to put on her bra and panties then putting on her dress then sighing in relief when it was on. Millie then saw a hand reached out that look familiar and looked up to see it was Sonic. When they looked eye to eye she became flustered and backed away a bit. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to frighten you. Here let me help you up\u201d. Even though her memories of what happened moments ago were hazy, she shouldn\u2019t make Sonic worry and deny the help of her best friend so she takes his hand and gets pulled up. \u201cSo you\u2019re related to Tails? Well it\u2019s nice to know a little more about you and we could get to know each other more\u201d. Millie still a little flustered manages to say, \u201cS-same....\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then thought she take Millie away from Sonic before anything else happens that could cause trouble. \u201cWell, I believe we can all agree today has been an eventful day. But I think I should show Millie around before taking her home\u201d. Amy started pulling Millie\u2019s arm leading her away from Sonic until he yells, \u201cWait! Do you... do you think I can visit you some time?\u201d blushing a little giving Amy an idea of his feelings during his time with Millie. She quickly says, \u201cSure, you can see her at Tails\u2019 place another time. Gotta go. Bye\u201d as she continues to run off with Millie not giving her say in the conversation. \u201cOkay... bye\u201d Sonic manage to say before the two girls became out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two were far enough even close to Tails\u2019 house they both stop to catch their breath. Amy looks at Millie to see she looks confused needing answers. \u201cAmy? What was I doing before?\u201d. Amy didn\u2019t know all the details but she tells what she saw when Sonic was doing her fox friend where she was enjoying every moment and even heard her say to Sonic to cum in her again. The more she heard the more Millie got embarrassed finding out she has a lustful side to her where she doesn\u2019t know how wild she went. But that was not her biggest problem she had. Her biggest concern was the fact her body was filled with her friend\u2019s seed and there could be a likely chance she might have his kids growing in her belly soon. \u201cWhat if I get pregnant?\u201d. Amy replies, \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to know now. Besides you might find a way to turn back into a boy before then. Worse case scenario, you can get rid of them early before you become attached\u201d. In her heart she couldn't do that as she didn\u2019t have the heart to do such a thing. So the only thing she can decide is fix her problem or have those babies. Her hopes were high though that one interaction with Sonic wouldn't be enough to fertilize her. That was when Amy needed to ask Millie a serious question. \u201cI need to ask, do you like Sonic?\u201d. She gave a simple answer, \u201cOf course. He's my best friend and bro\u201d. Amy then needed to rephrase herself, \u201cNo, I mean do you like like him?\u201d. Millie then froze and found it difficult to speak until finally saying, \u201cNo. Yes. Maybe. I don\u2019 know. Ever since I changed to a girl I cant get a grasp on my feelings. Especially when I see Sonic\u201d. While Millie thought about the situation, Amy thought of a scenario she needed to share. \u201cImagine if we both got pregnant by Sonic. Would you like to join me in making Sonic happy and making a family. I\u2019m willing to share\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing and started laughing it off believing it was a joke but Amy reassure her she was being serious. This was too much to think about and decided to get rid of the subject by saying she was heading home. Amy said goodbye and started heading home herself leaving Millie alone in her house. As the day was ending she headed to the bathroom and turned on the shower. Then went to the bedroom where she took off her dress and undergarments. She was completely naked where the last accessory was the rings on her tails that once taken off freed them becoming a twin tail once more. She then looks at the mirror in the room and sees the changes remembering her male body now changed to the present female body. She headed into the shower and while the water falls on her she was deep in thought of her multiple concerns. After a while,  she got out and started drying herself off and got ready to bed. She needed to get used of covering herself up and since she didn\u2019t think of sleepwear she can only put on a new pair of bra and panties then slipping herself under her bed covers. All this thinking was taking a toll on her mind and needed to rest where she hopes the next day would be better and then drifted off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside Millie, You continue to see inside her womb as there were six fertilized eggs against the uterine walls that were each dividing and starting to form a small shape. You felt since you caused what happened between Sonic and Millie that you felt obligated to see her pregnancy through and give your support to make sire they stay healthy and help the fox mother with any changes her body needs to make for them.

Perfect. You decided to open a small portal inside Tails' balls, straight to the center of his baby factory, and saw the interactive image of hundreds of thousands of youthful, bonafide Tails sperm also lounging around with nothing to do. Without further ado, you reached in and plucked a random sperm from its pack, the others none the wiser that one of their swimming buddies were missing. Tails himself didn't even an inconvenient tingle from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the young and innocent sperm was brought into the womb, you put it in a temporal bubble of its own, preventing it from making a beeline to Vanilla's egg, not until you were done with the modifications necessary. On your tablet, projected two holograms: one of Cream, and one of Tails. Giving her Tails' flight ability would be not only redundant, but also arouse suspicion to your intervention should a rabbit suddenly give birth to a fox-hybrid. However, Tails is smart, his intellect rivaled by few, and his innate abilities of handling machines could come in handy for her later on down the line. And even though you couldn't double up on the flight ability itself, you could still incorporate the fight endurance Tails had built up over the years in order to keep Cream airborne longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plugged in all of these different modifications to the sperm, seeing the changes made were compatible with it as you made sure Tails' likeliness were overridden by Cream's original appearance as much as possible. Sure, the only noticeable difference would be the lighter shade of orange as opposed to the more, you know, cream-colored fur coat she was named for, but other than that, she was one-to-one. With the changes made, you dispelled the field around the sperm, watching as it immediately zoomed off to fertilize Vanilla's egg, Prower DNA combining seamlessly with Rabbit DNA. With the egg multiplying back into its blastocyst form you first saw it as, this time under a different father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dusted your hands at a job well done. The only thing left to do was play the waiting game.</span></div></div>",

You were amazed how warm and comfortable it was in there but even more amazed in the center of the womb. In the center was a rabbit fetus not fully grown yet but at least grown enough to tell it was a rabbit. \u201cHello Cream.

I thought you love him!\" Tails said, he was terribly confused and excited and trying hard to hide <i>that</i> excitement. Amy giggles on this question and overall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't have to know~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails stared agape on Amy's statement and rather a bold move but he conceded, Sonic wasn't interested in Amy and he wouldn't feel much if he and Amy get... frisky. He nods and Amy smiles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Now let's go somewhere... comfortable~\" She let go of the fox and just as he did that, You appeared inside of her dress and went to her breasts just by the time they got to Tails' room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen You were now modifying Amy's breasts, however... They were making out as Amy inserted Tails member into herself until she felt a tingling sensation coming from her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh~ Yes~!\" Correctly, Amy was riding Tails just when she felt something weird going on with her breasts, she stopped, his dick hitting all the way deep into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghnn! .. ?\" Tails grunted as he sees Amy stopping \"Uh? Amy, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breasts... they feel... sensitive and funny-\" Just as she said that, her breasts began to grow right before their eyes, from perfect bordeline D-cup into heavy and full G-Cup in minutes, their eyes widen in complete surprise upon seeing this but it wasn't done for Amy felt and saw small beads of milky substance coming out of both erected nipples and rolling down her grown mammaries<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... Breast Milk?\" Tails ask slowly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's no possible, I'm not pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

She then held one of her breasts in her hand and guided it to her mouth where she opens and clamps on the nipple and started sucking on it. She can feel the white substance travel down her throat and thought it was creamy and sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was licking his lips showing he wanted to taste some of that milk. Amy was able to see that and decided to join in by using his other hand to hold her other breast and started bouncing it in front of Tails showing her approval to get some. He lifted his head to get closer and placed his mouth over the other nipple and was sucking on it as well. Muffled moans can be heard from Amy as the feeling of both her breasts being sucked on felt so good for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the inside, You were in the breast that  Amy was sucking on in which a powerful suction was occurring which you knew you might be trouble for you since you didn\u2019t want to be in Amy\u2019s or Tails\u2019 stomach. With the time you had left, you skim through your magic tablet and find a spell that will help increase the weight of your body. You cast the spell and now you were impossible to move or get sucked in as you saw large amounts of the white stream exiting the gland and move from the ducts to the nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason after drinking Amy\u2019s milk, Tails felt revitalized and bursting with energy where he continued to moves his hips up and down in an even faster pace getting his member deep inside her. Amy continued to ride Tails where she can bounced harder on his cock while Tails continued moving his hips. Tails was even more excited when he sees those large fun bags bouncing in front of his face. He was at his limit as his balls began to pulse having the dire need to release some of its load. He then continued and with one final thrust penetrated Amy\u2019s cervix where many of Tails\u2019 white soldiers were invading her womb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that they had sex, you had a few options to consider. You could teleport to Amy\u2019s womb and help get Amy pregnant. Maybe even get an egg for yourself and impregnate her with a child of your own along with Tails\u2019. There is also the option of modifying Amy\u2019s body some more. Or if you felt like you were done could leave her body and find someone else to enter.

You had to stretch to grab one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had two people in it. Vanilla the Rabbit and Cream the Rabbit. Admittedly, Vanilla had much bigger breasts and a amazonic figure. Cream looked a bit more muscular and actually had breasts, about a B cup or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put back the picture when you heard a door open and close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama!

Chocola and Cheese grabbed the ends of the carpet near the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better,\" Vanilla said, sounding pleased. Cheese and Chocola lifted and lowered the carpet, creating a moving bump that seemed like it was aiming for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mom, I was thinking-\" You uttered right before the moving bump hit you, sending you in the air as the bump vanished. You crashed against something soft, so you grabbed onto it to prevent yourself from falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! How forward!\" Vanilla's voice said, letting you realize what you landed against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou currently were hanging onto Vanilla's divine-sized derriere. You slowly climbed down, saying, \"S-sorry. something just threw me into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Vanilla replied. Her tone was odd, like she wasn't angry at all, but no hint of if she believed you or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you and Vanilla went shopping for clothes, even though you could use magic to make some. When you came home, Vanilla was insistent about washing the clothes. You gave a similar argument about using magic, but Vanilla merely shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you wandered about a bit before she asked you to check if the washing machine was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked to the laundry room, Cheese and Chocola waited in the room out of sight and held some nearly invisible string. when you stepped in, they held up the string, which caused you to trip and somehow land in a laundry basket that was as tall as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they heard you scream as you tripped. Cream and Vanilla ran to the laundry room. The two Chao did their best to look like they had ran as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to climb out of the laundry basket and noticed the reactions of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chao covered their mouths in surprise, though Chocola\u2019s eyes seemed amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla covered her mouth with a single hand and seemed amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream had her hands at her hips and her cheeks were puffed out in a cute pout. her eyes showed that either she was angry at you or was just really annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tripped,\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d believe you better if one of my bras wasn\u2019t on your head like a hat and one of Creams\u2019 panties wasn\u2019t around your neck,\u201d <br>\r\nVanilla said, sounding amused and embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your head and discovered that indeed, Vanilla was right. You carefully took off the underwear and dropped them, feeling rather embarrassed that you landed in a laundry bin filled with underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few days, but Cream managed to talk with you again. The Chao chose to wait on their pranks, not wanting to risk being found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[Y/N], I have a friend coming over. Her name is Amy Rose,\u201d Cream explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I\u2019ll be on my best behavior,\u201d you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream shook her head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not the problem\u2026 Well, maybe a little. The thing is that Amy is a little too boy-crazy, even though she\u2019s never seen a boy in real life before. She\u2019s read a lot of comics, hentai, manga, anime, and a whole bunch of other stuff that Mama doesn\u2019t like me knowing about. I think it may have done a number on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo.. Keep my distance  and make sure I\u2019m with you, Mom, or the Chao while she's here?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. Now let\u2019s go wait on the porch for Amy to arrive,\u201d Cream replied before picking you up and carrying you outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I can walk, y'know!\" You pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And risk you pulling down my panties?\" Cream answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a pervert! They were all accidents!\" You pleaded.</span></div></div>",

The house had plenty of knick-knacks, like little trophies, dioramas of various places, books on all sorts of topics, and pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pictures had anthropomorphic clothes-wearing animals that let you know that you did indeed enter a Sonic dimension. You had to stretch to grab one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had a Amazon-ish Amy Rose.She had muscles, but still looked feminine. Hell, she had boobs as big as her head. She stood by a female-looking Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at a chair that you would have to climb onto and knew that both were taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the picture back, you heard the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man!

It's just it's been a few months since I've seen a man. I guess I'm just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked away from you, covered her face with her hands, and giggled like a school girl before looking back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked, \"So... what? Is there a lack of males in this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned a little before nodding. \"Enough that scientists are worried it might lead to serious problems in a few generations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like I'll be kidnapped and molested against my will, right?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked for a moment, giggled nervously, and rubbed the back of her head. Looking back at you, she gave you a fake smile, saying, \"You'll be fine as long as you're with me and my friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought, <i>'I might have bitten off more than I can handle.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took another deep breath before asking, \"So...

Not only that, but going by the cry, human males were a hot commodity here, possibly the rest of this toon world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you panicked a little. You first used an illusion spell to hide yourself, then another to make it look like you ran off in some direction. Then a shrinking spell and ran under the flat rock, where there was a hole big enough for a small animal or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing the stampede run by and away, you let you let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a voice said, \u201cGolly! That was a fright! What caused it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, someone realized that I\u2019m a human male and I guess going by how some of the eyes were looking at me, that must mean I\u2019m some kind of sex object,\u201d You answered without realizing as you carefully looked around outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re human, then how come you\u2019re so small?\u201d the voice asked, sounding a bit curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a book of spells from my grandma. I can use magic from my mother\u2019s side, but she didn\u2019t care much for it aside from money,\u201d You answered before realizing you were talking to someone. You slowly looked back and saw Gadget Hackwrench. Deciding to be polite, you said, \u201cMy name is Alex. Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGadget smiled and replied, \u201cMy name is Gadget Hackwrench. I\u2019m a Rescue Ranger! Normally, I work with others, but we\u2019ve been stretched thin, so I\u2019m working by myself at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought quickly. If you left her alone, she might let you go or might be spiteful and call attention to you. If you worked with her, she might kidnap you or help you find spells to add to your book. But you had a heart of gold and didn\u2019t want her left alone. So you said, \u201cWell, if you need help, I can offer whatever I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGolly, that is sure sweet of you! I\u2019ll gladly accept your help!\u201d Gadget said before giving you a quick kiss on your cheek. \u201cFirst thing we gotta do is head to the Ranger Plane. I was trying to recruit some field mice to help me, but they refused. Can you sue your spell book to move some foot petals?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d You answered, remembering that the Ranger Plane was petal-powered. You followed her outside. As the two of you climbed a rope to the top of the rock, you asked, \u201cBut how did you get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made a motor that could move the petals, but it kind of worn itself out when I neared the rock,\u201d Gadget sheepishly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of you reached the rock top and neared the Ranger Plane, you took out the book and began to look through it. Gadget asked, \u201cWhat kind of spells can you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, invisibility, shrinking, growing, teleportation, mass alteration, plane-walking, and a few others. I can always learn more, but I need to either see it in action or read other spell books,\u201d You answered as you continued to look through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGolly! All of that sounds like a lot of fun! Can anyone else use your spell book?\u201d Gadget asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused before you answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I like to hope that only I can use it, but I never asked my grandma.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was always helped and given compliments, but I never did the same for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitch gulped.

Before being covered, you noted the expertly tied in silk rope in a way that emphasized her ass,pussy, and tail. You even managed to see that Gadget was tied up in a similar way that let you know that the mouse ladies' breasts were sticking out proudly. You could feel that you were also tied up in silk rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Glitch and Gadget caught their breaths, Glitch looked at her rival and said, \"Just letting you know, I did not intend on getting tied up and stripped. Something must've gone wrong. Maybe a bad processor or wiring or... oh...Oh wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Gadget asked, wondering why Glitch was looking down and blushing. Then she saw what Glitch was looking at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of you were naked and tied up erotically. Not only that, but your dick was in Gadget's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGadget's iris and pupil shrank as her jaw dropped.

Is it painful for him to be in you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... Feels pretty good. Tight, but good,\" Gadget muttered before she began to move her hips up and down as best as she could, while being tied up. She closed her eyes and shuddered a bit as she cummed. \"Yup, feels good. Really good. Now I know why I liked it when my inventions vibrated a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered briefly as you cummed. Glitch blinked for a moment before asking, \"Can I have a turn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGadget smiled as opened her mouth to reply, but took a moment to take in her situation.

The cat in question was grey-furred with white markings over her eyes and a white stripe running from the top of her muzzle all the way down to her belly. You couldn't immediately recall her name, but you remembered that she was from American Tail and she was supposedly one of the good guys. You say supposedly because the way she was looking at you right now you doubted she had any good intentions in mind. <br>\r\nShe spoke in a thick Brooklyn accent that you're ashamed to say turned you on a little bit as looked you over. \"Looks like two little mousies got themselves into a predicament they can't get out of.

Sleeping gas came out of the side, covering you for a moment before it made you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I insist,\u201d \u2018Gadget\u2019 said in her natural Lahwhinie voice. She chuckled as she continued to fly off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you were stripped down to your undershirt and boxers, tied to a chair in a makeshift apartment. A cigar box  and hand towels were made into a bed, several matchboxes were made into a dresser, several different sized spools were used as chairs and a table, and a few doll-sized armoires decorated the room. A small window let you know that you were in a forest area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGadget? Where are you?\u201d You called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re awake,\u201d A voice replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018That didn\u2019t sound like Gadget,\u2019 </i>you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn walked\u2026 Well, she looked like Gadget, but was wearing doll-sized shirt and sweatpants. Her head lacked Gadget\u2019s trademark goggles. She said, \u201cWell, handsome. I\u2019m sorry for tying you up, but I\u2019ve never seen a small human before, so I was only protecting myself when I was helping you get somewhere safe after I found you all alone in a plane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, can you free me?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to, but first we need to talk about something important to the both of us,\u201d She answered as she began to saunter towards you, her hands on her hips. \u201cOur new partnership.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy in hell would I work with you?\u201d You asked. She sat her large soft ass on your lap and gave you a soul-searing kiss. After a few moments, she stopped it and leaned back with a smile. After a moment, you said, \u201cThat was  nice. Great, even. But not enough to get me to work with you. You didn\u2019t even tell me your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point. I am Lahwhinie. Once, I was a queen of a tropical island, but circumstances forced me to not only abdicate my throne, but abandon my home. All because the mouse who looked like me decided to ruin my life when I asked her for some help with a test that my people asked me to take,\u201d The mouse babe explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Lahwhinie? Wait, I know who she is! She\u2019s that evil look-a-like Gadget. She's either lying to get me to join her or she's delusional,\u2019</i> You thought. \u201cMy name is Anon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut with your magic, I can get my people to reject the lies that Gadget and her friends told them,\u201d Lahwhinie cooed as she leaned against your side and drew small circles on your chest. You got to feel that her boobs were not held by a bra. \u201cIn return, I\u2019ll do anything you want. And I do mean ANYTHING.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike\u2026 what?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to be a king and make me give you kids,\u201d Lahwhinie cooed before kissing your cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll grant that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, you asked, \u201dYou tried to use the book, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked shocked, then embarrassed for a moment she went back to that smile that said \u2018I have full control\u2019 before asking, \u201cA gal like me gets curious. I thought that it\u2019d be a neat little thing. I was going to return your book after testing out a few spells. It is yours, after all. The owner\u2019s page does have your picture on it. Even says that only you and your relatives can use it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFree me and I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d You replied, having a good feeling she would have abandoned you if she could cast spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me give you some incentives,\" Lahwhinie cooed before she began to shower your face with kisses.</span></div></div>",

Next to her on the sandy ground lay a black leather-bound book with a swirling pattern embossed on the cover.<br>\r\nA soft ringing sound began to emanate from the book which caught the elderly woman's attention and so she reached over and picked it up before she began flipping through the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile dropped slightly and her brow creased as she read what was contained in the message until it finally curved downward into a slight frown.<br>\r\nIt seems that <i>someone</i> just couldn't keep it in his pants and now another someone was trying to blackmail him by stealing his seed to get around the protections she laid on the book.

Just remember your training and I'm sure you'll turn out alright.

Just then a loud humming sound filled the room and began to build in pitch and intensity.

They were from the Eek the cat Cartoon, and their episode was Quadrapedia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth had white fur, long hair, and sexy bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first speaker was Pam. She had long black hair and wore red thigh-high boots, a red latex outfit, and a star pendant. Her lips were covered in red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second speaker was Polly. She had brown hair, black women's shoes. Polly wore long black gown that showed off her long legs, and a moon pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... Hello,\" You replied, wishing you knew a stun spell, a sleep spell, or something that would help get you an easy out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So a human has entered our lair without permission,\" Pam said with an evil sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes darted around and you saw a ladder that  led to a trapdoor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should punish him, my sister,\" Polly cooed with a lustful gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to sidle over to the ladder, making sure to secretly grab a heavy book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only think of one fate for this human,\" Pam said as she bent forward, making sure to let you look down her massive cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maybe staying here isn't so bad... No! They're evil cats!'</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolly smiled at her sister and smiled as she replied, \"Ooh! We can move our beds together as we make him ours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam nodded before she and her sister, lifted their heads up, closed their eyes, and  laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran as fast as you could to the ladder, causing the witch cats to stop laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here!\" Polly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else you'll be kept on a short leash to our beds forever!\" Pam growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got on the ladder and began to climb up, but Polly managed to grab your pants and undid them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go! Let go!\" you ordered, taking a moment ever so often to swing the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam slapped your ass, making you drop the book on Polly, causing her to fall, but take your pants with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grumbled under your breath, you dashed up the ladder. Once  you got past the trapdoor, you saw there was a slide lock and used it to lock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolly glared at the door as she rubbed her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pam helped Polly stand up, Pam said, \"Worry not, sister.

You gulped as you knew you\u2019d be the pillow of the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were lifted in the air by a magic aura and a cloth was wrapped around your eyes. You opened your mouth to say something, but another cloth was used to gag your mouth. You tried to remove the cloths, but discovered you couldn\u2019t move your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aura carried you away from the fight, going by how the sound faded rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you felt that you were placed on a bed, you felt the magic aura vanish. You tore off the cloths and saw three cat women, all from the Bucky O\u2018Hare show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, Princess Felicia, and Queen Katrina were around you in a bedroom. All were magic-using Cats from the Planet Aldebaran.Play your card right, and you get more spells for your book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, hello?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Queen Katrina. To my right is my Granddaughter, Felicia. To my left is Jenny of the ship, Righteous Indignation. We are from the planet, Aldebaran,\u201d Queen Katrina began. \u201cBecause you are not only a male human, but a magic-using one, we need you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, you need me to help breed more magic-using Aldebarans?\u201d You asked, resisting the desire to drag the three ladies to the bed and immediately make litters of kittens with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina nodded before replying, \u201cYes. More and more magic-using women are being born on our planet. At first, the Artificers were pleased, as they are a sisterhood of magic-users and need the numbers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then someone pointed out to them that if male Aldebarans became extinct, then all of Aldebaran would soon follow,\u201d Jenny added. \u201cNormally, I am on a ship, fighting an army of Toads led by an evil computer gone mad, but I was asked to bring my Queen and Princess here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had heard that we might be able to find some help here. I was expecting advice, a potion, or a spell,\u201d Katrina said with a sly smile. \u201cSo imagine my surprise when we found you here. You being a human male makes you attractive. You being able to use magic means you\u2019ll be very fertile to us. As such, I will grant you two gifts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched your forehead and then a quick groping of your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering what Pam and Polly did to you, you asked, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one on your head lets all Aldebarans know that we can use magic in your sight, even teach you our spells,\u201d Katrina answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pleased you, as you knew that they had some great magic, like being able to put world-devouring Quark demons to sleep. So you asked. \u201cAnd the one on my crotch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there is a willing woman who is in heat near you, your heat will last as long as hers will last or as long as you are near her,\u201d Katrina cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you sensed that your book not only gained instructions to use the two spells that Queen Katrina used on you, but also the one that Pam used on you. If only you still had your family's spell-book, but you suspected that Pam and Polly still had it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we\u2019ve gotten all that out of the way, let\u2019s get down to business,\u201d Jenny purred as she climbed on the bed and you. Her skintight jumpsuit and pink wild hair really made her attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to push her off to escape, but the other two climbed onto the bed. Queen Katrina grabbed one of your hands and made you grope her hidden-but-surprisingly-large bosom through her robe, while Princess Felicia began to hump your other hand. Princess Felicia's jumpsuit did little to hide how aroused she was from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter using magic to remove her armor from her jumpsuit, Jenny smiled before she began to cover your face with kisses as she began to rub her body against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lust magic that both the Queen and Pam used on you made you hard as a rock, which pleased Jenny. She showed her pleasure off by rubbing the tip of your erection with her tail.</span></div></div>",

Toon World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, Toon Town is divided by a lot of other places no seen in the movie, it just not only compose of old toons from the 30s to the early 90s but <i>all</i> know cartoons and shown on TV and movies, Animated Movies. This wasn't exactly like in the Movie from 1988.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached, you heard a conversation on the nearby Apple Orchard <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm telling you, Darling. If it weren't for that Big-breasted Bimbo from Anime Island, I would've snatched that cutie into my bed!\" You heard a rich, high-class feminine voice nearby but you heard a growl \"It just not fair! Why he went straight to her when I'm almost literally throwing myself to him? It's because my teats are small?! I could have changed that and gotten a bigger bust than that so-called '<i>dragoness</i>' cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah think the problem isn't about teats, Sugarcube, they just like' em on the chest better instead of the crotch.\" You heard a feminine southern tone and sigh followed \"Face it, Sugarcube, Ah think yah're just wasting time, humans and Humanoid toons don't see us, pony folks in the same way.\" Pony folks? No wonder this village and the castle looked familiar to you, this was Equestria or ToonEquestria, for the voices and accent, you were eavesdropping Applejack and Rarity, you hide behind a fully-walled fence and peak through a hole which no only confirming your arrival by seeing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it was that, Darling. He was smitten by my charm until she came looking for him.\" She growled, \"I was this close!-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah think you're trying too hard.\" AJ stated, \"Hadn't been there any stallion or mare that call you fancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack, dear. There are no many stallions in this town, Non in Equestria, and your Big Sister only allowed herself in turn into a Stallion when we were still filming the show. many were like that to fill the background and cast with enough stallions.\" Wait, Big Mac was always a she? Also, filming the show, were they talking about FiM? \"And they rather stay in their natural form, There aren't many true stallions around and have their herds full already.\" She sighed \"And while I don't mind the touch of a mare, Its... not the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah understand sugarcube.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIneresting, So Stallions from the show were majority mares that had turned into stallions for the sake of filling the cast with sizeable male members to the screen, which it also means many things but also give the rise of new questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what do you do.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly out of the blue you felt a sharp pain to the back of the head and stars danced in your vision, your eyes crossed and as you fell to your knees your vision grew blurry. The last thing you saw before losing consciousness was a pair of yellow and pink blobs standing over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAGH! The sharp pain your cranium forced your eyes open and you back into consciousness. Everything was completely dark like your eyes had been covered and you felt your mouth stuffed with some sort of gag. You tried to move your hands and feet but it seems that someone had tied you to a chair. Whispering voices pierced through the darkness, and even though you couldn't see them, you instantly recognized their voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Is a He~!\" That was... Pinkie Pie, definitely Pinkie Pie. \"I told you we're lucky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Pinkie...\" That's Fluttershy, that's totally unmistakable about it, even if both characters have the same voice actress, they have very different speech patterns and tones \"I don't deny that is a Male but... he doesn't look like a toon.\" Pinkie snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but of course he is a toon! Who can actually survive a hit like that to the head? Especially with a bat\" They did what... they hit you with a bat?! You're now grateful that you installed some protection and the lexicon gave you a healing factor, otherwise, you'll be in a coma for you don't know how long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh... Good point but... He doesn't look like a normal Toon either... does he come from 3Dtopia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know and I don't care~!\" Pinkie Sing-sang \"We can finally realize our dreams!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... is this even legal or morally correct? I feel we're breaking a few laws already.\" Just... What they're planning for you? What can warrant your kidnapping when you can help them if they asked nicely is this even necessary?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desperate times call for desperate measures, Fluttershy, and I didn't exactly see you complaining when we dragged his heavy butt back here. We need to take every opportunity we can get if we're going to come out on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I don't know how I feel about this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you feel that strongly about it, I can go first if that will ease your guilty conscious,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me the amulet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a cool metal object being wrapped around your neck and Fluttershy gave off a satisfying hum as the clasp clicked into place. You felt Fluttershy's warm breath as she leaned in close yo your ear and whispered, \"Get hard for momma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, out of the blue, you felt a sudden wave of... arousal, very strong arousal, enough for blood to be pumped to that area of the body, making it rise and grow... It was then you noticed something, you were naked. You think that you know what they want but... what is this thing? You could feel magic, powerful magic being used even without your lexicon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a wolf-whistle. \"Holy moly! And he continues growin' and growin'!\" That was... Pinkie Pie yes but there is a very different tone on her voice, a very flirty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my~\" Fluttershy seems to agree, you felt a perk on your cheeks \"That's right, sweetie, get hard and big for me and Pinkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what those ponies are planning?! Are they going to rape you?! You began to struggle on your biddings, shaking your wrist, hips, legs, and arms, you try to scream but all that left from your mouth was a muffled sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy laid a feathery light comforting wing on your shoulder and said, \"Don't fight it. You want this as much as  I do. Just give in to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, all of the fights went out of you and you slumped back into the chair. She was right. You did want this, more than anything, in fact. You wanted to fill Fluttershy and Pinkie's wombs so full that they would have to be rolled everywhere for transport. You wanted to see them seeded with your offspring and to become a doting father to an army of foals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could take them with you in your travels through the multiverse and teach them all there is to know about the arcane arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows, maybe you might even find the real Equestria out there somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a squee next to you. \"He is willing now, Pinkie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh Yeah! Finally!\" Pinkie cheered and then you felt her lapping on your throbbing prick and two wet kisses on each of your seed pods. \"I think he is ready~! We're going to become mommies for realsies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this was their goal? that is nice, you want to help them then, you were now for real in wanting to fill their thirsty and willing holes with your seed.</span></div></div>",

After you got in, She re-adjusted her seat, closed the door, and said, \u201cI\u2019m Motoko Kusanagi, though going by how you stared at us, I think you already knew that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m [Y/N] and the driver is Haruka Urashima,\u201d you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019d you get here?\u201d Haruka asked, as she began driving again. Motoko appeared to be looking out the window, but was using the side mirror to stare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA magic book, once owned by my grandma,\u201d You began. After you were done with your tale, you said, \u201cAnd so I\u2019m now just traveling for the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a feeling of familiarity, Haruka sighed, \u201cKind of sounds like what happened with my Nephew...Well, Niece, now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko answered, \u201cAn incident happened about two decades ago. Men were affected and most either vanished or became women. Some suspected a person by the name of Ranma Saotome to be responsible, as they had a water-based curse that caused them to become female. The reason they are thought to be responsible is that they were searching for a cure and seem to be a nexus of chaos. To this day, no solution or explanation for the world-wide disaster has been found. Magic nor technology are able to find any solid leads or answers. The human world has this world on Quarantine since then because while we animation-based beings are essentially immortal, they are not and thus they do not want to risk the human race becoming extinct. Good decision on their part, if you ask me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Since you\u2019re just wandering about, wanna go back to Anime Island with us? It\u2019s the animation equivalent of Japan in this world,\u201d Haruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be safer than this place, as it\u2019s more grounded. At Anime Island, you can usually tell when someone is peeping on you. Here? Someone could sneak into your pants and start giving you a blowjob without you knowing about it,\u201d Motoko added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 might have a point, but what about violent Tsunderes?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019d be beaten up by the ones that want a man and arrested by the police, since because of your gender rarity, you are protected. If the violent Tsunderes are lucky, the police will get to them first,\u201d Motoko answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you\u2019re looking for a place, The Hinata Inn is always looking for new boarders. But really, anyone would be willing to give you a place to live in return for a few\u2026\u201d Haruka said before perversely chuckling, \u201cA few benefits, if you catch my drift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko let out a scoff of disgust. \u201cOr you can apply with the government, [Y/N]. They\u2019d give you a protected place to live and teachers for your magic book. The Price probably would be to help in finding a cure for our man-less situation and some semen every once in a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fiat came within view of a port that had various boats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast chance. Coming with us?\u201d Haruka asked as she pulled into the port and pulled out something to show one of the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup,\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear that,\u201d Motoko replied, looking back and giving you a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka drove in and stopped on a platform. The platform was raised by a crane and placed on a luxury boat. After all three of you left the Fiat, Haruka asked, \u201cSo are you coming with us or wanna just wander about the boat?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You sure you want to be by yourself?\u201d A voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back and saw Ageha Kurono. A mother\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm\u2026 I\u2019m okay,\u201d You replied, seeing that like most women on the cruise, she was dressed in a two-piece bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in close and whispered, \u201cMost women here think you\u2019re a well-disguised Reverse trap, or whatever the term is for a girl disguised as a guy. The moment they find out you\u2019re really a man, things will get very\u2026 very, Hentai. In the femdom-mindbroken slave way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered in fear a little. You wanted to be molested, not raped'n'mindraped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo follow me and I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll be safe,\u201d Ageha cooed as she grabbed your right hand and gently inserted it into her incredibly soft bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling that succubi from Rosario+Vampire could hypnotize men (and women, according to one of the manga\u2019s omakes)  and that if the succubus kisses you while you\u2019re hypnotized, you\u2019d become their permanent slave, you asked,\u201cHow\u2026 How do I know you won\u2019t make me your love slave or your daughter\u2019s?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgeha frowned a little before smiling and saying, \u201cBecause I\u2019m the playful kind of succubus and my daughter\u2019s the succubus who wants to be a housewife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, Manga-Ageha, whose a lot nicer and is friends with Tsurara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a voice said, \u201cWhereas I\u2019m the kind of lady who would like to have you as a love slave from time to time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour upper left arm was pressed inside the bosom of that voice\u2019s owner, Ririko Kagome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I would like a pet, one that I would love to keep forever. Your scent is a wonderful one...\u201d Gyokuro Shuzen cooed as she grabbed your left hand and slid it inside her bikini bottom, letting you feel her pussy. You blushed as you felt that she was becoming quite aroused. She whispered, \u2018And I do want one with your manly scent\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018I guess this Gyokuro doesn\u2019t hate humans?\u2019 </i>You thought before another person pressed their assets against your upper right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGyo-chan! Ag-chan! I thought we agreed to protect this person!\u201d Akasha said in a very cute pout, showing that she is just like her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyokuro glared at Akasha and asked, \u201cAnd yet you\u2019re trying to seduce them, just like us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how your special sauce will taste when mixed with curry?\u201d Ms. Apsara asked, hugging you from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ms. Apsara slipped her hand into your pants to give you a handjob, Ageha muttered, \u201cAnd people look down on Succubi for being horny devils\u2026 I really do mean to help you\u2026 If only Tsurara was here, but she hates the heat...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiriko sighed, \u201cVampires are seen as sex gods to humans, after all. Lamias have a small, but growing group.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...Er\u2026 Uh,\u201d Akasha muttered before sniffing the air a little. Her eyes glazed over and she began to lean in closer to your neck, muttering, \u201cThirsty\u2026 so thirsty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiriko held your head and forced you to look at Ageha, whose eyes began to glow a bit. Your surroundings began to waver and waver\u2026 You thought you heard her say, \u201cI apologize, but I need to do this to save you from-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you were pulled out of the group, hearing Tsunade say, \u201cAlright, ladies, leave her alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd say something, but Ageha did say that most women thought you were a girl dressed up like a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d you said as Tsunade put you down. She wore a green bikini with a short grey robe over it. She quickly jabbed each of the R+V Monster women, causing them to fall over. They were alive, but were having trouble moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. I saw someone get crowded and well...\u201d Tsunade began before noticing your adam\u2019s apple.<i> \u2018Oh, they\u2019re a man. No wonder they crowded this lucky fella.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks once again,\u201d You said before you turned around and tried to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be spun around and wind up with your face in Tsunade\u2019s terrific Tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I deserve to be rewarded. Do you know how to go down on a woman?\u201d Tsunade cooed as she lifted you up in a bridal carry that kept your head in her bosom, though it did allow your eyes to be freed from the boob flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Whose the lucky lady?\u201d Mei Terumi asked as she walked over to Tsunade, pressing her sizable girls against your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno, but I plan on showing them some personal lessons,\u201d Tsunade answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Room for three more teachers?\u201d Yoshino Naru asked as she and Mebuki Haruno began heading in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMebuki grabbed your hand and placed it on her ass, while Yoshino slipped her hand in your pants and let out the tiniest of gasps before giving you a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a green energy shock hit the Nin-women, causing Tsunade to free you and the Kunoichi to fall over. They were twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my! Wasn\u2019t that a bit harsh?\u201d Misaki Masaki Jurai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense! They were all getting a little handsy with her! I don\u2019t approve of that outside of the hotsprings!\u201d  Seto Kamiki Jurai cooed, enjoying her handiwork. \"Were it in the hotsprings, then I'd happily molest the younger ones. It is tradition on Jurai, after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Mitsuki Bakugo and Mrs. Briefs were watching from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you think started this?\u201d Mitsuki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Briefs stared at you for a few moments before whispering, \u201cOh, the one in pants is a man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki blinked a few times before smiling and saying, \u201cOh. That changes things.\u201d</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks?\u201d you replied. You were hesitant because while both Ageha and Tsunade both seemed to want to save and help you, both apparently went man-crazy for you. Ageha could be excused due to Peer pressure, but Tsunade\u2019s change was out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my! What\u2019s going on here?\u201d Mitoto Kuramitsu asked. Though she was in a one-piece swimsuit, she still was doing her job as a cleaning lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just helping this victim of poor circumstances from two groups of women wanting to dominate them,\u201d Seto answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about Seto\u2019s eyes had you guessing that not only did she know you were a guy, but she was either planning your future marriages (yes plural! Jurai is like that!) or was going to use you to cause trouble because she was bored. Possibly both. She was like that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d\u2026 I\u2019d like to continue to just wander around, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d You asked, taking steps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw\u2026 But you look so cute! If you were only a few years younger, I\u2019d adopt you!\u201d Misaki pouted in a manner more akin to a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou in the pants! Come with us!\u201d Ms. Apsara said, as she and the other women from Rosario+Vampire had recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade and her fellow vacationing Nin had recovered as well. \u201cNope! They\u2019re coming with us! They need an inspection and I have the license to do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI offer you to join us, but I didn\u2019t catch your name,\u201d Seto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, [Y/N],\" You answered. Somehow, you knew that which group you chose, you'd be molested by other members of that group for the rest of the trip to Anime Island.</span></div></div>",

Behind you was Kim Possible, Bonnie Rockwaller, and Monique. Ahead of you was Princess Lana from Captain N, and the cartoon versions of Princess Toadstool and Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed up like a tour guide, Betty Boop said into a microphone.\"Welcome to Toon Town Tours, a guide to the town that toons built! While I do know that a number of youse are some of those famous toons that helped made the place famous, I ask that youse please be quiet. If youse want to talk, raise your hands, so I can let youse speak into the microphone and let the others hear a tale or two from youse. Now let's begin the tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing at a firehouse at the side of the road, Betty said, \"That right there is a firehouse, used in countless cartoons, either as a setting for an entire cartoon, or as a setting or prop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Bonnie noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty continued, \"Next to it is an old-style police headquarters, mostly used in the theater cartoons. It's not really active and mostly kept for historical reasons. Youse can visit it on yer own time and see the tour shop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie leaned over the top, looked down at you, and asked, \"Great look. Haven't seen anyone bind their breasts that much and breathe well.... and I do like the strap-on and how it actually is getting bigger, like you're a man getting aroused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I am a man, Miss,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Daisy Mayhem blinked for a moment before they began to study your body. Both of them began to smile a little when they saw your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And next to it is a hospital, it's mostly updated, save for the parts reserved for old-timey cartoons that do donate some of the proceeds of their shorts to the hospital and various charities,\" Betty said as she gestured to a rather modern-looking mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie giggled for a moment before saying, \"Yeah, right. Everyone knows that there hasn't been a male toon around here in decades, if ever. Besides, all their arousal was for for a quick gag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am a human man, but I am genuinely attracted to you all,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women immediately around you took in that information, planning on talking to you privately. Or in Daisy Mayhem's case, kidnap you.</span></div></div>",

You were beginning to think coming aboard without even the rudiment of a disguise was a grave mistake.<br>\r\nAll the while Betty Boop continued to drone on about various hotspots and historical sites, seemingly incognizant of what's going on.<br>\r\n\"if youse would look to your left you'll see the old town hall, which was in use for about 50 years before a new one was built and this one came into disuse. Moving on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone else looked out the window and pulled out their phones and cameras to snap pictures, you felt a hand forcefully grab your head and force you to turn into the biggest pair of honkers your eyes had ever seen. Your face was pressed directly between those perfect beautiful breasts and your mouth contact with the flawless smooth skin.<br>\r\nA low, sultry voice spoke directly into your ear which caused your little friend down below to rise just a little bit more.<br>\r\n\"Listen to me very carefully, sweetie. You've wandered into a pretty dangerous situation and the only way you're going to get out of it with your purity intact is with my help. Nod once if you understand.\"<br>\r\nYou nodded once just as she asked which served to push your face even deeper into her bountiful cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave off a satisfied hum and gently stroked the back of your head.\"Good. Now what I'm about to do may seem scary but trust me when I tell you it's perfectly safe... mostly. Now, tuck your arms in and try to keep quiet. We don't want to attract the attention of the others.\"<br>\r\nYou were about to ask what it is she was going to do when you felt a pair of strong arms reach under your armpits and grasp your entire body. Jessica's pair of hooters suddenly looked a lot bigger and more spacious than before if that made any sense, then again to a Toon the laws of common sense don't seem to apply.<br>\r\nThe arms lifted you up and over, tilting you so that you were sliding face-first into the cleavage.<br>\r\nYou weren't sure if space inside was getting bigger (or maybe it was always this big due to Toon logic) or if you were shrinking, but Jessica Rabbit quickly and quietly tucked you like she was hiding a stick of bubblegum between her breasts...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dexter's Mom and Debbie tried similar tactic by offering you on going to a pool party on Dexter's home by appearing on their swimsuit, figure similary changed to be inciting to your eyes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nToons could alter their appearance, that's a fact.

You know that you were up late last night researching all you could about the Toon World, but you couldn't remember exactly when you dozed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the amazing perks of living with the Toons is that they lived in the modern age and had their own internet, which sucked up all your attention when you found out about it. They also had their own version of cable television which they used to produce their own content and original stories, which is pretty wild when you think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, no all is rose and rainbows. Aparently 90% of the male toons are all missing or turned into female versions few years ago. Something of a big accident that affected the weather in all form wacky and weird things. For what you can gather, however, Toons are immortal and forever youthful unless they want to age and this hadn't affected them negatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnime Island, Toon World versi\u00f3n of Japan, benefited much from this, especially, their harem anime industries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere also an Earth, with normal humans and all. Both worlds had conection with since 1913, but with the rise of streaming, digital content and internet connection, both worlds barely have visitors from each others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you bolted upright in your bed as you heard a noise coming from the kitchen, the sound of shuffling dishes and the sound of a woman humming. It took you a millisecond to remember that all of your neighbors and even the property owner, were women so hearing a feminine voice shouldn't be that strange. Still, you couldn't help wondering who it could be and what they were doing in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and shuffled off of your bed before stepping into a pair of fluffy bunny slippers provided to you by Peg and your limbs snapped and popped as you stretched with a huge yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to go face the day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got off the bed, put some basic clothing and got of the room and made your way to the kitched. Just who could be the intruder? Peg Pete? she has the keys as well so it's possible but this is toon town so they could make keys are anything or nowhere (note: need to invest better, magical locks) Maybe a gadget savvy like Madeline Fenton? or perhaps an another magic user? So many but as you arrived you finally noticed who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Options -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 - Lila Test<br>\r\n2 - Peg Pete<br>\r\n3 - Dexter's Mom<br>\r\n4 - Madeline Fentom.<br>\r\n5 - Some other Toon milf.</span></div></div>",

They could be as big as they needed to be. So you only cast a few of the increase-room-size spells and the rest were were security spells. You have some other spells, but they needed time to cast. After all, you might like one room being a ballpit room, another being a massive game room, another a supersized dining room, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, you heard a knock at your door.

It was a few blocks away. At one of the clothing stores, your mouth was covered by a hand. And you were pulled into one of the clothes tree circles and out the store\u2019s exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome silky cloth was shoved into your mouth and then some tape was put over your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were shoved into a van, Hayley Smith said, \u201calright, me and a number of other women all heard about you.

So we\u2019re going to get you first, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your hands were tied behind your back and the van started, Judy Jetson cooed, \u201cAnd you get to play a game!

Guess right and you get to be untied for your first time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg Griffin added, \"But guess wrong twice and you'll be forced to date all of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulders slumped. You went from dealing with really hot toon women who wanted to jump your bones, but wanted to play around first, to their equally hot daughters. Daughters who were taking matters into their own hands with your consent being a nonfactor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the van stopped and you were pulled out. You saw that you were in some warehouse of some kind, one that had been converted into a makeshift home of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow here's the bed. Sure, it's not the fanciest, but it'll do!\u201d a Teenage Pebbles Flitnstone chuckled as she patted a bed with metal bed railings and straps. The bed was right in the middle of a bunch of Toon Teenage girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were brought over to the bed, you looked around.

You meanwhile, you weren't quite sure about it, you already have a family and quite frankly that plan had flaws on the adoption system since... you quite doesn't exist here, you have not documentations and if you do in the other world, it's going to be a hassle to explain two versions of you, one child and one young adult to the authorities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly were picked up by a toon and made to sit on her lap, it turns out to be Jessica again, her boobs were now bigger than your head because of the size difference and rested on top of it, feeling their weight.

That sent more than a few shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you ladies, but living in an apartment complex can be used against me in my job, Charlotte Pickles said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela Mansion added,\u201cMe too, even though I know my sweet little Sammie would love to live in an apartment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCount me in the \u2018apartment too low class\u2019 vote,\u201d Tanya Barrett said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! An apartment is not too low class! It can be very secure, especially ones that have hidden garages that the government owns! I\u2019ve lived in plenty when I\u2019ve been undercover on missions!\u201d Mrs. X exclaimed. \u201cJust let me call up my daughter Tuesday and she\u2019ll agree with me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on stakeouts and I vote for the apartment,\u201d Sunset Boulavardez said, glaring at the snooty trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernice Florence Hufnagel of the <i>Duckman </i>show looked annoyed at you and said, \u201cI\u2019m voting against the apartment because with so many women around, he\u2019ll probably become a pervert who\u2019d steal our underwear and become very familiar with the apartment layout to hide his ill gotten goods. At least him moving from house to house will allow us to search him for any of our underwear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica hugged you a bit tighter. \u201cReally now, Bernice? You\u2019re usually so good with kids\u2026 Maybe you\u2019re trying to badmouth him in front of others to get him all to yourself? I wonder\u2026 As a husband or a child?

Maybe you think he can be both?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis mind is still an adult, Jessica,\u201d Bernice said. \u201cBut in the event that the body reshapes the mind, maybe he should pick who to live with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeeMee\u2019s Mom said, \u201cThat would be a good idea, but he might decide to live on his own. He has no idea how things really are around here. He becomes an adult again and he risks the bad toons kidnapping him to make him their sex slave or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeLee\u2019s Mom added, \u201cHe stays as a kid and lives alone, thus Social services take him away. They\u2019ll even take his book away, claiming he might\u2019ve taken it from a magic-using toon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat worried you. Trapped in Toon Land without any way to defend yourself. You had no idea if your de-aging magic would wear off normally and let you grow up or if you\u2019d stay this young forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica rubbed your chest as she asked, \u201cSo\u2026 [Y/N].

So you began to climb upwards. This time you grabbed onto titflesh to have a better grip. Each grab caused Jessica to utter, 'Oh!' 'Ah!' or 'How forward!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused when there was a breastquake and wondered what caused it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had caused it was that Jessica had sat down on a loveseat and stared at her bosom, knowing you'd pop up sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she expected, your head and shoulders popped out of her cleavage. She looked down at you with a playful smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... am I and my purity safe?\" you asked, looking around. You saw that you were in a really expensive home that wouldn't look out of place in one of the Hollywood celebrity homes. The pictures were of Jessica in various poses and outfits, of Roger in various cartoons, and of both on vacation in loving poses together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the moment,\" Jessica said before kissing your mouth with her pouty pillowly lips. \"But you're honestly really only safe with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked a few times to get back to normal. The kiss was brief, but amazing. Had it lasted even a tiny bit longer, you'd cream your pants. You asked, \"Are you sure? You stuck me in your boobs when we first met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it was to save you. Those bad toons would've raped you until you were their mindless slave. I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way,\" Jessica answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't Roger get mad?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica frowned in a sad way before answering, \"If he was still male, maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to him? You asked, getting a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day about two decades ago, most of the male toons either vanished or became women. The ones that stayed male went into hiding. The human world put our world into quarantine because they didn't want to risk the same thing to happen to them. Some of us toons do still have business there, so we have to go through some procedures to make sure we're clean. Humans rarely visit here. I guess they don't want to risk the bad toons becoming so horny that they become a perverted version of their onscreen character and molest them,\" Jessica explained. \"We've tried to bring back the male toons by any means, but it all has failed so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at a picture of Roger ans sighed, \"He started to become a bunny girl and ran off for a cure. I don't know where he is now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe looked back at  you and wondered how'd you look in red overalls and a rabbit-ear headband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can help?\" You said as you took an arm out of her bosom and reached for one of the loveseat's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gasped in surprised before she put a hand on top of your head and began to shove you back into her bosom, saying, \"Oh no! You don't know just how dangerous Toon world is for you! Even among the good toons, you have to be careful! I'm used to the feelings of arousal, both mine and others, so I'm mostly in control when they pop up. The other toons? They'll all become a bunch of lovestruck women at the mere sight of you and they'll consider your consent optional! Just stay between my girls until I let you know you'll be safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely managed to grab the loveseat's arms and began to struggle against Jessica's strength. You swore she was becoming bigger and bigger the more she pushed you into her cleavage.</span></div></div>",

There were several reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was they'd be familiar with magic and tech, so you wouldn't have to explain too hard.<br>\r\nAnother was you could learn a good amount of new magic.<br>\r\nA third was that a good amount of heroes, villains, and monsters are all cute, sexy girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after entering a portal that had faint images of Shantae's adventures, you landed within viewing distance of Scuttle Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you headed towards the town, knowing that one way or another, yours and Shantae's paths would meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few monsters, like Scarecrows, bats, orcs, snakes, spiders, and other enemies that often appeared at the beginning of Shantae's adventures. You dealt with them all with fireballs and lightning spells. Each enemy left behind some gems, which was the money for the world. You eventually had to use your magic book to create a bag of holding for the gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurred to you,<i> 'I wonder if I can create a harem? I know there's more than enough cute monsters girls in this world for it.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to avoid thinking about that, but it did keep popping back up. You did the math and came to the conclusion that it had a 50/50 chance of succeeding. The failure ending for it? you become the servant/boytoy of your harem, obeying all of their orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming they don't simply beat you up, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually got the feeling you were being watched, so you stopped looking for new spells in the book less and less. You didn't want to risk the book getting stolen, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of being watched didn't go away. In fact, it seemed to increase, like the person was getting ready to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get too worried, as Shantae's games were on the light side. Even though you recalled your Grandma's warning about the worlds might be different than you expected them to be, the world you're in couldn't be too dangerous, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt a presence behind you, making you turn around to deal with them.</span></div></div>",

My grandma gave me a magic book and told me to travel worlds,\" You answered. \"If there is a problem, I'd be happy to help, especially with someone as cute and attractive as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae blushed before looking away. \"Uh, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, you probably get a lot of complements from just about everyone you meet,\" You said.

She's one of my friends and she is a zombie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad to have brightened up your day a little. So what brought you out here?\" you asked.

Since I haven't seen their Pirate leader, Risky Boots, for awhile, I decided to be proactive for once and stop her before she can complete one of her schemes,\" Shantae answered as she looked at you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be happy to help,\" You said with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but don't be surprised if you can't keep up,\" Shantae replied before doing a belly dance. She changed into a monkey. \"Because I can change into any animal with a dance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran off out of your sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took out your book and looked for a find-person spell.</span></div></div>",

Referred to \u2018Cano-sapiens\u2019, they were used by Professor Shephard, aka \u2018The Master\u2019, to combat the evil General Parvo. The five dogs, who in the canon storyline were all placed with world leaders, were:<br>\r\n1 Hunter, an American Golden Retriever with super speed who led the team <br>\r\n2 Colleen, a British Border Collie and the only female in the team<br>\r\n3 Blitz, a German Doberman with the ability to bite into most things<br>\r\n4 Exile (Exilo Michalovitch Sanhusky), a Russian Husky with super vision (think producing heat or cold from the eyes, for example) and super strength, and<br>\r\n5 Shag, a Swiss OES (Old English Sheepdog) who looks the least humanoid of the team, but is still biped, in cano-sapiens form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were actually eight dogs in the recurring cast, the other three being Muzzle (formerly Scout), a Rottweiler; Persia, an Afghan Hound \u2018Space Rover\u2019 (think astronaut); and Professor Hubert, a Bloodhound scientist. Also, Hunter had a mother, as did Exile (along with his father).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExplaining over, do you enter the regular Road Rovers universe, or do you enter a different version of the universe?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ok then, what about this one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea here is that, instead of being nominally just the main five (plus Muzzle), the Road Rovers are a global movement of thousands of Cano-Sapiens answering to the name and ideals of The Master. Hunter would lead the American Road Rovers (and the global movement at large) from the White House (where he lives with the human US President), Colleen would lead the British Road Rovers from 10 Downing Street (where she lives with the human PM of Britain), Blitz would lead the German Road Rovers from Bellevue Palace, Berlin (where he lives with the human Chancellor) and Exile would lead the Russian Road Rovers from the Kremlin (where he lives with the human President of Russia), while Shag would have an important position in the Swiss Road Rovers (leader, if you want) based in Bern. The five would still team up on occasion, alone, with members of their national units alongside them, or with other national Road Rover leaders. The transdogmifier still exists in this scenario (the Road Rovers would not be without it), and the Rovers can use it to switch between Cano-sapien and regular form depending on whether they\u2019re on active duty, on alert, or off-duty. Each Road Rover lives with a family, and the national leads can call for their subordinates to report for duty if necessary, but only The Master can call for a national leader if they are off-duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, space is considered by the Rovers as a \u2018nation\u2019, with Persia as the national leader for space, while Hubert provides scientific assistance to the current leader of the global movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this idea good enough for you?</span></div></div>",
