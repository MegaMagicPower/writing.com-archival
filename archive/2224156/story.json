The beam felt warm and strangely comforting as he dropped to the floor nothing more then a small stick of gum, his clothes now the tin wrapper around his sweet and chewy body.

She put the device in her room in her jewellery box filled with the rings of eaten ring pops and other small accessories and walked back out to the kitchen where her mom was on the phone with someone.<br>\r\n\"Yep it'll just her tonight, john will be over at a friend's\" Amanda said as Sarah walked in carrying John in her hand and sitting at the table and started to draw johns new form with a happy face and dancing.

David and Amanda got in their car and drove off as Amanda waved and turned to face Sarah. \"Alright whats on the agenda for today kiddo\"<br>\r\n\"Look I drew John\" sarah said as she showed her picture of dancing gum.<br>\r\n\"That's very good I love your creativity\" Becky said as she looked at the picture. \"Well do you want to draw together? We can see whos better\" she said as she walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"I'll get more paper\" Sarah said as she ran off to her room. Becky sat down at the table and noticed the gum.<br>\r\n\"Oh gum\" she said as she grabbed it \"spearmint my favorite\" Becky said as she opened the foil and popped it into her mouth and through the wrapper in the garbage. Sarah came back with a stack off paper and the two started coloring as becky chewed on the gum, Sarah completely forgetting about her brother for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky Grant<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nWears long sleeve shirts, skirts with stockings and flats.

She played for 10 minutes then remembered the new toy her daddy had in the basement and went to go check it out. She entered the basement and walked up to the work bench, pulling over a box to stand on so she could reach, and grabbed the little metal device.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You start as John who exactly he is depends on the story line. He could be a genius inventor or just an unlucky kid that gets caught up in an experiment. All that matters if he gets his hands on a device that can shrink and transform matter in nearly any imaginable way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacter descriptions<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn- average guy nothing particularly special about him (with story exceptions). Lives on his own, moved out when he was 22.<br>\r\nAge(adult line)- 26<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda- johns mother. Stay at home mom, she usually spends her days cleaning and doing stuff around the house or with her kids. Looks very well for her age. Wears blouses with jeans or dresses with pantyhose and is usually barefoot, wearing socks or has slippers on around the house.<br>\r\nAge- 47<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid- johns father. Works at an office 9-5 Monday-friday job. Wears suits.<br>\r\nAge- 48<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah- johns younger sister. Lives with her mom and dad to help with the twins. Wears jean shorts, skirts, and jeans. Works at a diner.<br>\r\nAge- 21<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam- johns youngest sister and June's twin. Wears dresses and skirts mostly. Plays on the school soccer team.<br>\r\nAge- 14<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune- Sam's twin. Wears jeans. Likes to pull pranks on her twin by placing bugs in her hair and clothes. Her room is usually messy. Can't see without her glasses.<br>\r\nAge- 14<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore characters can be added just give a small description about them (name, age, a bit about them). If you want to add a picture of them that's fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. No suddenly changing a person's personality (dont have a character go from kind to suddenly going to humiliate John for no reason)<br>\r\n2. Keep the continuity. If a character is wearing something in one chapter don't have them suddenly wearing something else out of nowhere, if you want a character to wear something else write that they change.<br>\r\n3. No one sentence chapters (choice chapters are an exception if it only goes 2-3 deep I don't want to go through 30 of them just for it to go nowhere) add at least a paragraph.<br>\r\n4. Have good grammar/spelling. I get that English might not be some peoples first language but please try to make additions readable, just use spell check and make it legible.<br>\r\n5. Dont have any pointless chapters i.e. \"what is this story haha\" or \"that addition sucked\" or stuff of the like it just takes up something someone else could have added to and is just plain rude and unneeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese next few arent exactly rules but more like requests/preferences:<br>\r\n1. Keep it mostly unaware. John can be seen but make them think hes a bug or just some dirt. You can have people realize it's him but i want this to mostly be an unaware story. People can also know that john/others are shrunk/transformed and help him/them.<br>\r\n2. Underage characters are fine just don't do anything to inappropriate with them.<br>\r\n3. This is a mostly giantess/female story there can be male giants or other males in the story but dont make them the focus. They can interact with john/others while they are shrunk/transformed but don't have it turn into an m/m story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn can't die the device condenses his molecules to the point were he's pretty much indestructible, he still feels pain but getting stepped on or chewed wont kill him. The device also protects him from stomach acids. When him or someone else is transformed and they're damaged/eaten they can still be turned back, they would just need to be collected if they are in pieces at least up to 80% of them to return to normal or become something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may add more rules if something I didnt think about/ mention on here becomes a problem. But other then that the sky's the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will try to add at least once every week until this story starts to take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther then that I reserve the right to edit/delete any chapter that violates the rules.</td>",
