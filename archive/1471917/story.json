She also<br>\r\nneglected to read the very,very small footnote on using the spell, so she doesn't realize what's going <br>\r\nto happen to her momentarily. Approaching Salem from the rear she doesn't realize that he's turning<br>\r\ninto a beautiful girl. In fact, Salem has become a carbon copy of Sabrina. Which wouldn't be so bad<br>\r\nexcept Sabrina trips just as she says that she wished Salem was taller. With her hand touching his<br>\r\nbare arm &amp; spilling some more of the potion, the transformation resumes. Salem stays a woman but<br>\r\nis now becoming a female version of his former male body. Making things more interesting Sabrina's<br>\r\nis also transforming into Salem's previous 6'1\" height. He was athletic and previously had a 44 inch<br>\r\nchest which is now becoming a 44DD on both of them. He was narrow waisted at only 26 inches and<br>\r\nhad a 36 inch torso. Only his hips were a reasonable size of 38 inches. They both now have very full<br>\r\nhourglass figures. Both of their hair grew all to way down to their waist &amp; tripled in diameter. So they<br>\r\nhave very shiny hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina takes one look at her new body and faints dead away. It takes Salem nearly an hour to revive<br>\r\nher. The problem was that every time she started coming around she would she herself and faint again.<br>\r\nSalem is very angry at Sabrina. He says, \" I wanted to become a man again Sabrina, not a woman !!<br>\r\nWhat did you do wrong?\" Sabrina's annoyed with Salem's complaints. What do have to worry about<br>\r\nI'm the one who has to explain to everyone at school tomorrow how I managed to grow so far up &amp; out!<br>\r\nEven-though I don't know why the spell worked this way, I can't complain about this body. Salem, look <br>\r\nat it this way, at least we can share clothes. Yeah, just what I've been waiting for all these years, he<br>\r\nreplies sarcastically. The more she looks at herself the less Sabrina wants to make any changes. She<br>\r\ncould end up turning into a man which she would freak out on. Yes, she decides that she's keeping her<br>\r\nnew body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling Salem that what is her(his) reaction?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nearly 3 years ago, he was in a terrible plane wreck and was declared dead at the crash.<br>\r\nIn actuality, he was in a very deep coma that made it look like he was dead. He was the second oldest in the family<br>\r\nand when his grandfather died 2 years before then he had left Thor (don't ask) his collection of rare books that he had<br>\r\nassembled over his 85 year life. Many of these books dealt with spiritual issues &amp; mythological creatures including<br>\r\nthe book on mermaids that Lewis had purchased on the Internet several months ago. His older brother was jealous<br>\r\nbecause he thought that being the oldest he \"deserved\" to inherit those books and other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis older brother is a compusive gambler that had an extremely bad streak playing the ponies. After the crash, he<br>\r\nconvinces the enforcer sent by the bookie that he can pay it all back selling his 'dead' brother's rare book collection.<br>\r\nwhich he proceeds to do. Unfortunately for his brother, Thor didn't truly die and so last month when he suddenly came<br>\r\nout of his coma, pandemonium erupts. His brother is arrested for grand theft. Fortunately, since he wanted to keep<br>\r\nthe theft and sale secret he had sold all the loot on the Internet. The ISP was very accommadating with providing the<br>\r\ntrue name &amp; address of all the purchasers when it was informed that all the goods were stolen. Most of the items<br>\r\nare quickly returned although very reluctantly by some of the purchasers. This book however, along with several other<br>\r\nitems Thor felt needed to be retrieved in person. Some of the other items being returned were not in the same shape <br>\r\nas when they were sold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrives in town with his new step-sister that he met for the first time when he woke up from the coma.

That way<br>\r\nif he was looking to see if they were still there he would think that they had given up and left. Thor then<br>\r\nsuggests one of them take a phone so they can call him when Lewis comes home. Maybe 20 minutes<br>\r\nlater, Rikki walks by the car on her way to visit Lewis. Thor sees her, realizing that she is a mermaid<br>\r\nhe calls to her. {She hadn't seen Cleo that day so she doesn't know what's going on.} She approaches<br>\r\nthe car asking him,\"Who are you and what do you want?\" Thor replies, \"I need your help and please<br>\r\nwould you get in this car?\" Seeing how pale he looks, she leans in through the back window to politely<br>\r\nturn him down. He then says, \" I'd prefer you to do it voluntarily, otherwise I'll just have to force you to<br>\r\nclimb in while you still can.\" \"Riight, and just how do you plan to do that?\" she replies as she starts<br>\r\nstraightening up preparing to leave. Without hesitating Thor says, \"This way!\" He quickly throws a liter<br>\r\ncup of water at Rikki hitting her full in the face &amp; most of it soaks into her hair. Knowing what will be <br>\r\nhappening in a few seconds and realizing that she now has no choice, Rikki starts climbing through the<br>\r\nwindow just as she starts her transformation. Thor then pulls her fully in before she completes turning<br>\r\ninto a mermaid. He's exhausted and hits the redial button on the phone so that his sister &amp; Charlotte<br>\r\ncome running. Rikki is unable to completely dry herself before they arrive. Fortunately for Rikki when<br>\r\nhe helped to pull her into the back of the station wagon he covered up her lower body. He didn't want<br>\r\nanybody walking by seeing her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of this is going on, up in the tree Charlotte and Re have been talking about Thor. Re confesses<br>\r\nto Charlotte that she dearly needs for Thor to 'jump her bones'. Even though were both adults when he<br>\r\nwoke up and they officially first met, he won't because their parents are married. Charlotte is mystified<br>\r\nwhy Re feels that way and she is truthfully unable to explain it. This is the main reason why she was so<br>\r\nquick on volunteering to travel with him on his trip to reclaim all his stolen items. Having recently lost<br>\r\nLewis to Cleo, Charlotte sympathizes with her plight and silently vows to help her if she thinks of a way. <br>\r\nIt's about this time that Thor calls them. Before passing out he says, \"Come quick, The solution to my<br>\r\nproblem is ....\" Jumping out of the tree, they dash around the corner to the car, with absolutely no idea<br>\r\nabout what he was talking about before he fainted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow desperately terrified that her secret will be revealed, Rikki isn't that relieved to see the girl arriving<br>\r\nwith Charlotte. She's pretty certain that Charlotte will help her to keep her secret, if she can. Seeing<br>\r\nwho's in the car, Charlotte tells Re, \"get in and drive to where you're staying.\" Re hadn't seen RIkki in<br>\r\nthe back and so when they return to the hotel she hops out to get her step-brother's medicine. Seeing<br>\r\ntheir opportunity Charlotte crawls into the back to help Rikki finish drying her hair. It's then that Thor<br>\r\nwakes up telling them to stop. He needs the girl to stay a mermaid for only a short while. He then tells<br>\r\nCharlotte to keep his sister away from the car for a few minutes. Now seeing Rikki in all her splendor,<br>\r\nhe says out loud (without realizing it.) \"Great, out of all 5 types I had to catch a \"Fire mermaid!\" Both<br>\r\nRikki and Charlotte are mystified over why he said that there are 5 types of mermaid. Charlotte however<br>\r\ndoes leave to intercept his sister before she returns to see Rikki's tail. That is something that all 3 of<br>\r\nthem would prefer not having to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Rikki is so angry at Thor she could kill him. Sensing her mood he tries to quickly explain<br>\r\nto her why he did what he did. He mentions the book that Lewis had bought from his crooked brother &amp;<br>\r\nthat he wants it back. Although she knows that it works, Rikki doesn't let on knowing about the book.<br>\r\nHe asks her to get the tin out of the glove compartment. Wanting to get this nightmare over with Rikki<br>\r\nretrieves it for him. Opening the tin he puts 2 fingers in so that he can quickly make 2 wishes. Before<br>\r\nshe can react he smears it on both sides of her face, makes his wishes and passes out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at this time that Charlotte and Re reappear, Charlotte just couldn't stall any longer. Being in the lead<br>\r\nCharlotte signals to Rikki to stay hidden. It's not easy when you're an over 7 foot long mermaid including<br>\r\ntail but Rikki manages to do so. When they open the car door Re sees the tin and picks it up saying,<br>\r\n\"I wonder why he got this out?\" Before Charlotte can ask Re what it is, Re tells Charlotte that he had<br>\r\ntold her on their flight that if he died that she was to take this tin to a run-down mansion. He had a key<br>\r\nand she was to ring the doorbell. If a young lady answers the door, she was to give it to her and if she<br>\r\ndidn't answer the door, Re was to use the key to enter and wait for her return. She may need to stay a<br>\r\nfew days but the young lady would be sure to return. Re was to then give her the tin and tell the young<br>\r\nlady where and when he died. I think she's a girlfriend that he has and wants no one else in the family<br>\r\nto know about. Obviously, he knew her for a long time before his accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, before all you readers fall asleep, we have 2 questions here:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just then Charlotte's mobile rings.<br>\r\nIt's Cleo, she and Lewis are at his house. Things are sure getting more complicated.<br>\r\nCharlotte gives Cleo the address of the hotel and suggests that they come over as<br>\r\nquickly as they can. When she hangs up she tells Re that the person her brother is<br>\r\nlooking for will be arriving  there soon. \"Why don't you go wait in your room. I can help<br>\r\nyour brother up there when he wakes up.\" Re agrees and heads for the nearest stair<br>\r\nwell. \"Finally,I can get out of here.\" Rikki says. Charlotte goes to help Rikki finish <br>\r\ndrying her hair and then escape from this crazy person, as far as Rikki is concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Rikki, she just can't get a break today. Just as Re had started up the stairwell,<br>\r\nshe turned around, returning to the car. She'd left her room key on the front seat. So<br>\r\nCharlotte asked her since she hadn't gone up there, \"why don't you go and get some<br>\r\nfood for us while we wait. Your brother might not be in the mood to go out to eat. It is<br>\r\ngetting towards dinner time. Re starts to wonder why Charlotte keeps trying to keep<br>\r\nher away from the car. However, she is getting a little hungry herself and since she<br>\r\nwon't know what Lewis looks like &amp; Charlotte does, she agrees to get dinner for all<br>\r\nfour of them. She figures her brother will probably be hungry when he awakes like he<br>\r\nusually is when he recovers from one of his fainting spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte keeps looking in the direction that Re had walked off to just in case she<br>\r\nshould return again. Telling Rikki that she can now continue drying her hair, Rikki<br>\r\nagain says, \"Finally, I sure hope nothing else goes wrong.\" As soon as Rikki has<br>\r\nfinished, she realizes she shouldn't have said that. Thor has wakened up &amp; he grabs<br>\r\none of her arms. She starts struggling but being so wrapped up she can't get much<br>\r\nleverage so he's able to hang on. His strength is returning. He asks Rikki her name.<br>\r\nShe refuses to answer. He sees that they are now parked outside his hotel, so he<br>\r\nasks Charlotte to help him get up. She agrees, but only if he lets go of Rikki. That<br>\r\nhe's not willing to do yet. So with one mermaid still struggling in his grip Thor does<br>\r\nthe only thing he knows will work, he puts both of his hands around Rikki's throat.<br>\r\nThinking he's going to strangle her, she panics. In her panic she starts heating up<br>\r\nthe inside of the car. It starts smoking, Charlotte tells Rikki, \"Stop that!, the smoke<br>\r\nwill attract a crowd.\" The smoke stops because she has now passed out. Thor then<br>\r\ntells Charlotte to help him carry Rikki's body up to his room. She's appalled at what<br>\r\nshe is now involved with but is to afraid to do anything to oppose him. She helps him<br>\r\ncarry Rikki's limp body up to his room. It is rolled up inside an 8 foot long rug that<br>\r\nhas somehow appeared in the car. At least, Charlotte doesn't recall seeing it earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they are in the room, he tells Charlotte to open the door to the large bathroom<br>\r\nso that they can put her body there. Then he says, \"go downstairs and wait for Re to<br>\r\nreturn with dinner.\" She complies without saying anything. As soon as she steps off<br>\r\nthe elevator, she sees Lewis and Cleo entering the lobby. They both ask Charlotte,<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" Charlotte replies,\"I REALLY don't know. This guy must be<br>\r\ncrazy!\" They ask her, \"Why do you think that Charlotte?\" Starting to hyperventilate,<br>\r\nCharlotte replies, \"I think he intends to do something terrible to Rikki!\" \"Rikki!\", they<br>\r\nsay. All of this has been a little too loud because a small crowd has collected around<br>\r\nthem and the manager has called security. Noticing the crowd, Charlotte suggests that<br>\r\nthey go outside to the station wagon to intercept Re when she arrives with dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile upstairs, Thor has revived Rikki. She is apoplectic. Noticing that they are<br>\r\nnow alone she decides that she has had enough and yells at him. \"If you don't let me<br>\r\ngo right now, you'll see just how angry a mermaid can get!!\" Kneeling in the doorway<br>\r\nand clearly tired when she yells at him, he starts crying. Rikki is besides herself she<br>\r\njust can't believe this. This maniac who obviously must want to do something terrible<br>\r\nto her is breaking down. It doesn't weaken her resolve to escape. He then says to her<br>\r\nsomething that totally stuns her. \"Please, fire mermaid I haven't intended to harm you.<br>\r\nIf you will just let me kiss you I'll explain.\" Knowing he has already tried to strangle<br>\r\nher once, she only agrees because she'll be ready this time. If he tries that again she<br>\r\nintends to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikki is sitting in the over-sized tub, her hair had finally dried enough for her to return<br>\r\nto her human body. As he approaches her she is fully prepared to defend herself. So<br>\r\nshe is totally stunned when he starts French kissing her. It feels like she does when<br>\r\nshe turns into a mermaid, only she doesn't. The kiss lasts well over a minute and she<br>\r\nis still in her human body. When he stops, the first words out of her mouth are, \"What<br>\r\non Earth have you done to me? Why did I feel the way I did when you kissed me?\"<br>\r\nNow very terrified and lowering her voice she asks, \"Am I still a mermaid?\" \"Oh, yes\"<br>\r\nhe tells her. \"You're now a very special mermaid. My name is Thor, what's yours?\"<br>\r\n\"Rikki\" she says. He then tells her about making those two wishes earlier that day.<br>\r\nThe second one was specifically for her to make up for the inconvenience he was<br>\r\ngoing to put her through. With one exception, you're the most beautiful mermaid that<br>\r\nI've ever met. Hearing this, she interrupts him, \"What do you mean, I'm the second<br>\r\nmost beautiful mermaid, just how many mermaids have you met?\" Dozens, he replies.<br>\r\nBy now, she's willing to accept anything he says. \"Still, what has happened to me?\"<br>\r\nRikki asks plaintively. \"Just as I wished for you, Rikki, you no longer need to fear water.<br>\r\nYou can now take a real bubble bath again! In fact Rikki, now whenever you come into<br>\r\ncontact with water you can choose whether or not to turn into a mermaid. Isn't that a<br>\r\ndream come true for you?\" She replies, \"Yes, that sounds wonderful, but what about<br>\r\nmy friends?\" At this point, Thor really isn't interested in talking about her friends. He<br>\r\nthinks that she's just talking about regular people and not other mermaids. He's about<br>\r\nto explain more about his wish to Rikki when there is a loud knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring Rikki's reconciliation with Thor, things downstairs have been jumping. The<br>\r\nmanager had kept an eye on Charlotte and the others when they walked out. Once<br>\r\nsecurity arrived they went out to question them about why they were there and just<br>\r\nwhat was Charlotte talking about. Still very upset, Charlotte is very reluctant to say<br>\r\nmuch. She's concerned she may let something slip about the girls being mermaids.<br>\r\nIt was at this time that Re shows up with dinner. Not knowing what's going on she<br>\r\nwalks right into the mess. By now, security had called the police. They figured that<br>\r\nthe police would be able to get to the bottom of this. Finally, Charlotte has calmed<br>\r\ndown enough for the police to assume that Thor had kidnapped Rikki for something<br>\r\nvery bad. So they go into the hotel to settle the matter. Re was placed under arrest<br>\r\nso that she could not warn her step-brother that the police were coming for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the police order Thor to open the door, he replies, \"I'm sorry, but I don't need<br>\r\nyou. You must have the wrong room. Would you please leave me alone.\" Hearing him<br>\r\nloudly close the bathroom door the police assume that he's trying to flee and so they<br>\r\nbreak down the front door. He's standing near the bathroom door when they enter.<br>\r\nHe's quite annoyed that they interrupted him. Not grasping that they're dead serious<br>\r\nhe angrily tells the police again to leave. {It is really not Rikki's day.} She accidentally<br>\r\ndrops a bottle in the bathroom, the noise alerts the police that someone is in there.<br>\r\nWhen they ask Thor who is in there, he doesn't reply. Then he makes a move that<br>\r\nthe police interpret as going for a gun and they shoot him. Within seconds, he's on<br>\r\nthe floor with several bullets in him. The very loud gunfire upsets Rikki so much she<br>\r\nstumbles falling into the tub. However, when the police searches the bathroom and<br>\r\nthe large bathtub Rikki had fallen in, they don't see her. Noticing the broken bottle is<br>\r\nso close to the shelf they figure if fell off by itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to Rikki and do things work out okay?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff-hand I really didn't see how to write both wishes into the story, so here they are.<br>\r\nFurther pieces will explain who will be affected by the first wish. As you can see in<br>\r\nthe section below, Thor made it only for Rikki's benefit. (And her future family) <br>\r\nIncidentally, Rikki WILL learn why Thor said that there are 5 mermaid versions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor's first wish was: I wish that any female virgin, who within 50 leagues of this place<br>\r\nlearns mermaids are real shall become a mermaid on the night of the next full moon.<br>\r\nShe will only transform into a mermaid when the moon is above the horizon and salt<br>\r\nwater touches her skin. Unable to change back to her human body until the moon sets<br>\r\nshe will not receive any mermaid powers. Should she become pregnant her mermaid<br>\r\ntransformation will stop for 30 full moons. All pregnancies will result only in live births.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor's second wish: I wish that when I kiss the 'fire mermaid' that I'm touching, she<br>\r\nwill acquire the ability to choose when and how to transform her mermaid body. All <br>\r\nof her female descendants will become a 'fire mermaid' when they are the same age<br>\r\nas she was when she first became a mermaid.  </span></div></div>",
