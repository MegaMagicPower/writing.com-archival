Out here, the paths your chosen female character can take are endless.  In fact, where each path begins is a character whose story is waiting to be told.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Have you ever looked at an online artwork with some unnamed female character or created your own in a video game and you wondered what her story was or her drive?  Then this is the interactive for you, my friend.  In a plane with many universes you get to decide the destinies, the personalites and the events these fine ladies take. Will you have them go on an epic adventure; have them get involved in interesting situations; or even just have them sitting around eating ice cream all day?  All of that is for you to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Guidelines</u></b><br>\r\n- All submitted characters must have no names.  Giving them names is your job.  With that said, do not use characters that already have names, mainstream or not - and I will find out if the character(s) you chose already have names.<br>\r\n- All main characters must be female.  Males can be supporting characters or secondary protagonists, but they cannot be the main focus.<br>\r\n- When adding characters, make sure to add their pictures at the start of a selection chapter. (See the first page for an example).  Assuming you are the one who will be giving the reader a first impression on your character, it would be wise to write an introductory chapter for her.<br>\r\n- In addition to finding unnamed female characters on the Internet, you are free to use custom made characters from video games (providing you are the only one who named them) or unnamed NPCs.  Just submit a screencap or an artist's illustration of said female and you are good to go.<br>\r\n- Please proofread your work for improper spelling and grammar, and then fix it.  And no abrupt endings either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">DISCLAIMER</font></b><br>\r\nDespite what the keywords and the other items in my portfolio suggest, this is by no means a \"tickle interactive\".  While I do love that kind of story and I would not mind seeing any fetish stories, your character and plot does not <i>need</i> to revolve around that stuff.  Leave out bestiality and anything involving human waste products, and you can write whatever you want.  I will leave everything to your imagination.  Furthermore, all artwork shown in this interactive are copyright to the artists that created them.  No profits are being made off of their toil and labour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo explore the vast expanses of the Multiverse, simply click the link below to enter. <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></td>",
