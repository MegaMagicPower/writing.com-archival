At the young witch, or more specifically her feet. Hermione was sitting on the gryfindor common room sofa with her face in yet another huge book, Harry was sitting in the floor leaning back on the sofa. In the perfect position to see hermione slip off her two shoes, and playfully dangle one shoe off her right foot; hermione didn't take her eyes off the book for a second as she did this. The shoe was tugged around a bit as hermione wriggled her foot, until it eventually fell off- hitting the floor by Harry's hand.<br>\r\n    Harry looked up, hermione wasn't paying any attention. Then suddenly Harry realised what he was doing, he was actually staring at the witches feet. And even drooling at the thought of them. Harry tried to rid himself from the thoughts, but he couldn't. Then another thought came to him ...<br>\r\n    Harry slowly moved his hand towards the black shoe. Harry gave one more glance to hermione before slowly lowering his head into the shoe. Harry took a number of deep breaths, each time inhaling more of the witches scent.<br>\r\nSuddenly Harry heard hermione speak from behind him, \"Harry? What are you doing?\" Hermione didn't sound surprised or freaked out, just curious. Harry panicked and turned his head to under the sofa, \"I was...jus-\" Harry began \"Just- looking. Under here...\"<br>\r\n    Hermione giggled, \"You truly are a awful liar.\" she said as shee placed the book on the floor. Harry went red, but still a bit panicked. \"I'm just...uh, going to bed-\" Harry got up and took a step forward. \"Wait.\" he heard from behind him.<br>\r\n    Hermione rubbed her foot on the sofa. \"Would you mind just rubbing my feet a sec?\" Harry stopped himself from saying yes too quickly. \"Um...ok?\" he said, trying to mask his happiness.<br>\r\n    Hermione smirked as Harry sat down, placing the feet on his lap. He began to carresse her feet. Harry rubbed his hands up and down the witches feet, her soles were smooth and pink. Harry smiled desperate to have her feet.<br>\r\n    \"I couldn't help but think so...\" hermione said, watching him. \"Hmm?\" Harry responded. Hermione wriggled her toes, \"You've been staring at my feet for two years now.\" she smirked. \"I went to the-\"<br>\r\n    \"library?\" Harry laughed, rubbing her toes.<br>\r\n    \"To look it up,\" Hermione continued, \"And I'm ok with it, Harry.\" she gave a re-assuring smile. Harry looked up, \"I- uh...\" he mumbled. Hermione lifted one foot onto his shoulder and tapped his cheek. Harry stopped for a second, \"Please don't tell Ron ...\" he said finally \"He'd never let me live it down.\" hermione rubbed her toes on Harry's cheek. \"Maybe, we could make a deal.\" she said. Harry turned his head and gently kissed Hermione's sole.<br>\r\n    The young witch still couldn't believe the boy who lived was at her feet. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Harry was just enjoying the warm feeling of Hermione's feet of his face, scattering them with kisses. Hermione smiled at his submissiveness and asked \"would you like to lick my feet Harry? I read you foot people like that sort of thing.\" Harry, took in this request and stuttered out \"Ye-yes h-Hermione I d-do\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry began sliding his tongue up and down Hermione's sole, relishing the flavour. This made Hermione shudder with pleasure and begin to egg him on to continue with the foot worship.

Hermione slumped down onto her bed and slowly slipped off her black shoes, revealing her two grey sock-clad feet. Everyone in there cringed slightly at the smell.<br>\r\n    Hermione laid down on the bed, rubbing her two feet against a pole of the four poster bed. \"Draco enchanted all the books to show a picture of me kissing Ron, everyone in the school is luaghing at me!\" Hermione angrily announced, Pavarotti came over and sat down at the end of Hermione's bed. \"You know what you've gotta do, right?\" She said, with a hint of sly in her voice. \"You've got to get him back.\"<br>\r\n    Hermione sat up in interest, \"How?\"<br>\r\n    Ginny looked up from her book as if on cue, \"Well,\" She smirked \"There are certain spells you could use.\" The young ginger turned her book around for the others to see, \"You can make him completely at your will, you can force him to be or you could shrink him. You can also make his senses more sensitive.\"<br>\r\n    Hermione flexed her toes and smiled, \"You mean, like we could make his sense of smell more sensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Draco was walking down the Hogwarts halls, to the slytherin common room. He crept through the darkened dungeons, he had to be quite as it was 3 hours after curfew. He heard a creak, \"He-... Hello?!\" The scared blonde called out. He could almost make out a darkened shillouhete in front of him, it almost looked like Hermione. Suddenly a spell came from the darkness and Draco instantly fell to the floor, he got onto all fours against hiss own will. He then heard the spell Lumos and the whole dungeon was illuminated, towering over him was the teenage witch; Hermione.<br>\r\n    \"You little mud blood!\" Draco spitted, that was possibly the worst mistake of his life. Another spell came down at him, suddenly he could smell more things, more strongly. Hermione slipped of a shoe, Draco grunted at the over bearing smell. Hermione laughed and lightly tapped the Slytherin's face with her foot, contained within her stockings. Draco screamed and tried to move his head to the side, but it wouldn't budge. Hermione Finally shoved her foot into his face and kept it there for a bit, \"Ok,\" She said, \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n    A bright red light suddenly flashed through Draco's vision and he slowly fell asleep, last last things he heard was from Hermione, \"Brilliant! A pocket size Draco, or sock size...\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly he was hit by the odour that surrounded him, the smell of feet. Draco wasn't on all fours anymore- instead he had free will over his movements once again. Draco tried to get up, but couldn't. He managed to twist himself around, his face instantly collided with a warm grey ... Thing. The other side was slightly squishy, and from the little light available he could see it was a skin colour.<br>\r\n    Draco couldn't remember anything from the past night, after his last class his memory was too fuzzy to see what happened afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Draco was left like that for little over half an hour, he called out but no reply came. Suddenly the grey thing Draco's face was currently pressed against dragged backwards and lifted up, elegantly. It dragged Draco back a bit and even lifted him slightly as his face stuck to the grey thing. Draco looked up and screamed. He was on the insole of a shoe. The grey thing hover above the shoe about four feet above. Draco could now see it was the sole of a sock, with a sweaty soleprint imprinted on the underside.<br>\r\n    Draco quickly got to his feet and jumped up to the rim of the shoe, he tried to clamber out. \"Who are you?! You little freak!\" Draco shouted, suddenly the socked foot fell to the ground. And Hermione's head popped into Draco's field of view. The shoe was at the side of Hermione granger's bed, and hermione was now sitting on the side staring down at the hopeless blonde slytherin. Her long hair dangled down too.<br>\r\n    Draco looked up, you could easily detect the fear in his voice \"I should of known it would be you! You filthy little-\"<br>\r\n    \"I don't think your in the position to say that.\" Draco was interrupted by someone, but it wasn't hermione. Suddenly a new face stared down at him, it was ginny weasly. \"Weasly!\" Draco spluttered. Hermione looked up to ginny, \"Its ok, I'll handle it from here.\" ginny walked away and Draco heard the door shut, and lock. \"Just you and me.\" hermione grinned and hovered the grey sock above Draco. It then cam down, surrounding Draco. Hermione scrunched her toes and clasped Draco in between them. Draco let out muffled whines. Hermione moved her foot over and dropped Draco onto the wooden floor, before he could move she quickly pinned half his body down with her foot. Draco stared up at her and cringed, \"Let me up, you pathetic gryfiddor.\" Draco screamed. Hermione smiled. She hovered her other foot around Draco's face. \"Granger!\" Draco shouted \"My father will hear of this.\" with that hermione planted her foot onto Draco's face. She rubbed it around and giggled. \"It stinks.\" Draco mumbled. Hermione rubbed faster \"Do you never know when to give up?\" she laughed. Finally hermione set him free. Well, his top half at least. Draco's shirt had now untucked and his hair was a mess.</span></div></div>",

Eventually Hermione stopped, Draco panted heavily. \"Let me up now, Granger!\" He said angrily, still trying to assert dominance in the situation. Hermione just looked down at him for a second, \"Ready for more?\" she finally said. Draco scowled, \"What do you mean- you filthy ... \" Draco stopped as he looked up at what she was doing. Slowly Hermioen peeled off her sock. It landed with a thud a few centimetres away from Draco. For the first time, Draco looked up in fear. \"That's better.\" Hermione said, and wriggled her toes. The foot came down, her toes resting on his chest. She pinned him down and lifted her other socked foot that had draco's lower half pinned down. She slowly peeled that sock off too, and gently wafted it over draco's face. Hermione quickly lifted her foot off his chest and pinned his lower half down once again. Hermioen rubbed her heel on Draco's face, Draco almost turned green from the smell. \"Once my father knows about this he'll-\" Hermione rubbed her foot up and down his body, pushing the air out his lungs. She made sure every single toe managed to rub itself over the slytherin's face. Slowly she rubbed her foot against him until her big toe hovered over his face, she waited a moment. \"Come on, kiss it.\" She smiled, waiting for his answer. Draco stared at the big toe that hovered over his face, it was about twice the size of his head. Draco spotted at the toe and tried to turn his head away. Hermione frowned, \"You better learn your place.\" she said, pushing the toe into Draco's face. Then rubbing the remaining spit onto his shirt. Suddenly there was a knock at the door, Hermione turned her attention from the boy at her feet to the dormitory door. \"Come in.\" she said, ignoring Draco; who was trying to push himself free from the foot that imprisoned him.<br>\r\n    \"Is he being good?\" Draco heard from the door, he recognised the voice from earlier- it was the Weasley girl. Draco heard more footsteps coming from the door, it must of been at least three people who entered the room. Hermione glanced down at Draco, \"He not being very obedient.\" she said, sadly. Draco saw Ginny Weasley sit down in the bed, to the right of Hermione. And to the left was Katie bell, who pooped up from the back of the bed. Ginny and Katie quickly removed their shoes and began to take off their socks. While they were distracted Draco quickly sil out from the foot that covered his lower half, he stumbled but quickly got up. Hermione spotted him, \"Hey, Foot boy.\" she said, but Draco was already running. He ran a few feet before a giant foot suddenly came down in front of him blocking his path. Draco let out a yelp and slowly looked up. Parvati Patil stared down at him. \"I think we need to tech him a lesson in obedience.\" Parvati said, devilishly and bent down to pick him up. Draco tried to struggle, but slowly he was moved down to the ground by the girls feet once more.<br>\r\n    The smell was almost overwhelming now that Draco had 8 big bare feet around the size of himself surrounding him.<br>\r\n\"Just to make sure,\" Hermione says, pulling out her wand, \"Incarcerous.\" She says, pointing her wand at Draco. A flash of grey surrounded him and small brown ropes began to tie him up. Draco was too tired to shout more insults, he was just relishing the time he was now spending not under someone's feet.<br>\r\n\"Let's begin training him then.\" Ginny says, smiling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Draco tried a new tactic, he quickly closed his eyes as he was assaulted by feet. He heard the sounds of every girl int he room laughing and giggling. Draco felt strangely less ill, was he getting used to this? Draco cringed at the thought. Suddenly the feet retreated. Ginny moved her foot towards him, \"Now,\" Weasley began \"Show respect and kiss my feet.\" she said and shoved her soft pink sole into his face. Draco didn't move, he took deep breaths though. It was odd. Weasleys feet were nowhere near as bad... Actually, come to think of it, even Hermione's wasn't sick-inducing- really...<br>\r\n    \"Kiss!\" he heard from Ginny, more urgently this time. Draco this time to a second to refuse- what was happening to him?! It must be being surrounded by mud bloods and those realted to squibs. Eventually he spotted once more a the foot. Parvati began to speak, \"We need to give him a more intense workout.\" she gave a smirk. \"I suggest,\" Katie Bell joined in, \"he helps with our toenail polish.\" She said, flexing her toes. Hermione smiled, she whipped out her wand and conjured a small bottle of polish. \"Excellent idea. Come on, little foot-boy.\" she said, placing the polish on the floor. She realised him from his ropes. \"And.\" she said, quickly, pointing her wand at the small Draco, \"I think it would be a truly awful idea to try and run.\"<br>\r\n    Draco stared at her, taking a moment to decide whether he should risk running. Begrudgingly he began to open the polish, which was half the size of him. \"Me first.\" Hermione said, watching the small Draco sloth over to her feet. Draco began to paint each toenail. He started with the big toe. He slapped the polish on, not really caring. The polish was black, at strangely nice on her toes. It was strange, as soon as the polish kissed her toenails suddenly her feet looked pretty- beautiful, even. Draco stared at the toe, he began working in the second. This time taking more time, making sure it was neat- and pretty. Slowly he worked through all her toes, on both feet- he even began to enjoy the smell. \"Done.\" Draco said, not quite in the bad mood of just a few moments ago. Draco looked down at the witches feet, \"Their so pretty,\" Hermione said. Draco continued to stare, \"...yes, I guess they are...\" Dracis voice trailed off. Suddenly he felt a nudge. Ginny's foot was gently nudging his side, \"Me next, then.\" She said. Draco was apprehensive, this was a Weasley. A filthy, dirty- Poor, Weasley. And he was at her feet. Draco just scowled at her, \"Now.\" Ginny said, sternly. He then remembered the wand being pointed at him. Draco scowled and moved towards the Weasley girls feet. He dragged over the polish, and gently began to paint her big toe. The polish had magically changed colour, to a scarlet red. He began to paint each nail. Then, yet again. He began to ... Enjoy It? This was a Weasley. But still, at the same time, she had great feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    One by one Draco did all four girls feet, every time the polish changed to the colour that looked best for them. Hermione watched him carefully, she could see he was finally excepting it. Maybe even enjoying it. Draco wasn't sure what was happening to him. He finished painting Pavarti's toes a delicious bright pink. Draco was actually drooling. At feet? But it felt so natural now, it felt ... Right.<br>\r\n    \"One last test.\" Hermione finally said, she lifted her foot and tested the slyhterin with it. Draco's initial instinct was to run to it. Hermione smirked, \" ... kiss it ... \"<br>\r\n    Draco took a few seconds, before he walked over to the foot. It was slim and soft. Draco stood next to it, inhaling the scent. Draco faltered for a moment, was he really ready to take this step? He stared at the sole, the urge to obey was quickly growing stronger. He needed this.<br>\r\n    Draco eventually gave in, he shoved himself into the foot and hugged it tight. Kissing up and down the soft sole. His fate now sealed</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry Potter should have been the happiest wizard alive. After all, he had rid the world from the evil Lord Voldemort and settled into a fully-committed relationship with his sweetheart, Ginny. In fact, they had been married for nearly three months now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet something was troubling the most famous wizard alive. It had been lingering inside him for a few months now, threatening to escape and boil over at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cho. Cho Chang.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the thought of her name sent shivers of ecstasy spreading around inside of him. The seed had probably been planted at his wedding, when she turned up, looking more attractive than he ever remembered her to be. Her cute smile, her long black hair, even her bare toes seemed ridiculously attractive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry!\" Came a sharp voice ringing throughout the room, completely breaking his train of thought. \"I <i>told</i> you to sort those old newspapers out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBitterness immdetiately swept over The Boy Who Lived as he glanced across at the pile of Daily Prophets. It had been like this for a while now, especially since the wedding. It seemed as if Ginny's single,relentless mission in life was to nag and berate him, incessantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear,\" He called back, not without a sardonic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife appeared in the doorway, a stern expression on her pale face. \"There's no need to be like that,\" She said gruffly before storming off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't...\" His voice trailed off, knowing that it was fruitless to have a discussion with her. She was impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered when Ginny had been so relaxed, so fun, so...hot! But every time he looked at her, all he could feel was a restlessness, a regret: it had become increasingly clear that Ginny was not the woman that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then her face appeared again. <i>Cho Chang!</i> Perhaps it was due to the fact that they had \"unfinished business\", so to speak. Was it something as simple as that: that they had never officially broken up, just a few years ago when they had briefly, and unsuccessfully (it must be said) dated? That's right: Harry proposed to Ginny just a month after the demise of Voldemort: it seemed like the right thing to do. At the time, he was full of jubilation. The following summer they were married; a year on from then, here he was ruing his decision and feeling an undeniable need to see this Asian beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven on his wedding day, he nearly pronounced Cho's name instead of Ginny's: they had spoke just a few minutes before the  actual service - she was clearly fixed in his head from that moment onwards. Trying his hardest to put her out of his mind, he put it down to nerves and stress: getting married was a big deal! However, since then, every single day he had found himself thinking about her, fantasising about her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no good! He simply had to make some contact with her - sure he could cast a spell or take a potion that would free his mind from thoughts of Cho Chang, but why should he? He was Harry Potter - the conqueror of Voldemort, the wizard responsible for restoring peace! A considerable amount of pride stirred inside him: he had nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to hide. Grabbing a piece of parchment, he scribbled down a quick message to Cho, keeping it casual and informal, but friendly. Creeping out of the room, he ensured that Ginny wouldn't hear or intercept his message as he attached it to one of their owls. The last thing he needed was her spotting this...Merlin, the questions she would ask!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his load lightened somewhat, Harry set about his task of organising those damned newspapers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no more than a few hours later that the flapping of wings interrupted him; nervous excitement built...was this Cho, replying already?! Hastily, he opened the parchment, which had a Ravenclaw emblem on it. What did it say...?</span></div></div>",

So good to hear from you! How is married life? Was sooooo nice to see you at your wedding - what a great day that was! Such a nice surprise hearing from you...would you like to come over for tea sometime?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of euphoria filled him: he was going to see Cho! This was almost immediately replaced with a feeling of guilt. What what Ginny make of this? He could pass it off innocently as meeting up with an old friend, which objectively speaking one could argue that's all this was. However, Ginny wasn't stupid. She knew full well that Cho was the first girl that Harry had ever shown an interest in. He remembered the fire in her eyes when she insisted that she take him to the Ravenclaw tower on the eve of the final battle with Voldemort...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you finished sorting those newspapers yet? How long can it take?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer catty voice quelled the doubts he had; that confirmed if for him: he would see Cho Chang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly penning a reply, he had to make a real effort not to declare his love for her there and then. Taking a breath, he controlled himself: his message was brief but clear. Going for tea sounded like a plan...when would be best?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you writing a message to?\" Ginny appeared behind him, startling him completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I, er. No one. I mean, it's just a message to Luna. Not that I have to explain myself to you,\" He added, with more menace than he had intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, keep your hair on. I was only asking,\" she huffed. \"You don't have to be so defensive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defensive...I'm defensive? Ginny, I...\" He stopped there, knowing that this would be an open window to a pointless argument, something he could really do without right now. He walked calmly away, sending his letter to Cho off, knowing that was a close shave. Now he had lied to her...it was a small lie, but a lie nonetheless. An uneasy feeling swelled inside him as his eyes met hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" She began, a little more kindly. \"I know it hasn't been easy - I thought you were a shoe-in for being an Aura...\" Shame flowed inside of him at these words. He too thought that defeating Voldemort would have been an ticket straight to the wizarding job of his dreams. Not the case apparently - without his NEWTS, Harry had attempted to, unsuccessfully, obtain the qualifications that he needed. Thank the heavens he had a considerable amount of gold to his name, plus a famous name at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know you can tell me anything, right?\" She said softly, placing a slender hand on his shoulder, giving it a squeeze. His guilt threatened to overspill - this was the most tender and gentle she had been for well over a month. Maybe he should just confide in her, admit his feelings for Cho and hope that she would understand, help him - as his partner and wife - to overcome this silly, inexplicable obsession he had for a girl he had barely seen in the past few years...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know how it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him an uneasy smile in return. He had used that line before, quite a lot recently. Being Harry Potter meant that there was always a lot going on inside. It didn't feel good to play on the fact that he was a tortured soul, though that didn't stop him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked up the stairs, his mind became absorbed on his primary objective. He just had to see Cho! She would get back to him soon. Hopefully...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night, Harry,\" Ginny pecked him briefly on the cheek before turning off her lamp and turning to her side. Within moments he could gentle snores emitting from her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it. Why hadn't Cho got back to him? The previous feeling of euphoria a few hours ago had been replaced with anxiety and uncertainty: had he been too keen, too forward in his last message to her? Maybe something had happened to the message - someone else could have their hands on it? What if Ron or Hermione had managed to intercept it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying his best to push those irrational thoughts away, he slipped out of bed for a glass of water. His head in his hands as he sat in the kitchen, he nearly let out a cry of frustration; this was killing him! Now that he had established some contact with Cho, he simply had to see her. He had to see her now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit was a hasty decision but it seemed like the only one. \"Accio Firebolt,\" he muttered, loud enough so that his broom flew towards to his open hand. Yes, he would find Cho! He didn't know her address but he would be able to find out: a trip to The Leaky Cauldron usually proved fruitful when looking to gain any sort of information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to leave the house, a hooting noise stopped him dead in his tracks. As he detached the note from the owl's talon, his heart skipped a beat when he recognised the same parchment and seal as before. It was her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great! Come over tonight if you want - I'm working late so will be up for a while longer! See you soon...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief spread through every fibre of his being. Why had he panicked so much! He let out a small chuckle: he was Harry Potter, the much-celebrated wizard, of course she would want to see him. For a moment he considered sending her a message to tell her it was a little late now: Ginny was in bed after all. This was fleeting however as the urge to see her took over. Checking the address that she had included at the bottom of the letter, he hopped onto his broom and sped away. Realising that he could have apparated pretty much immediately to her place, he shrugged. It was as if he had retreated in his mind several years, which did not seem to bother him at all. It almost seemed like some kind of way of mentally preparing for the gorgeous Cho...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later he arrived at her door, his heart beating even faster than it ever had. Clearing his throat, he could not prepare himself for the sight that adorned his eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Harry!\" The stunningly beautiful Asian girl squealed as she wrapped her arms around his neck in a warm greeting. Harry felt her sweet perfume soak into his nostrils as his eyes wandered down her tight grey pyjama top and almost-hot pant style pink shorts. Merlin, her legs were so long and beautiful. Her bare feet flexed a little off the ground as she continued to embrace him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, hey...\" Was all he could grunt in response, his vocal facilities almost lost to him, such was his excitement for being this close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned back. \"Is Ginny not with you?\" She bit her lip slightly, while her cute nose wrinkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"No, er....she's...busy...\" He replied, sounding somewhat uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come in!\" She beamed at him, leading him through to the living room. As she sat down next to him, he felt his eyes locked into hers...now that he was actually with her, he had no earthly idea of what to say!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds or so of awkward silence continued until Cho coughed slightly. \"So...how come you got in touch with me? No offence, I mean...it was just such a nice surprise!\" She said in her sexy, Northern accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stared back, not sure how to respond. Should he be honest with her or make up something?</span></div></div>",

Ever since my wedding. I - I...\" He gulped in some much-needed air. \"I just think you're so beautiful and amazing...\" He stopped again, seeing how the effect of his words would sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't planned to do this, though to be fair he hadn't really thought as far ahead as this point! All he had wanted was to see her; now that he declared his feelings for her, how would she react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho continued to stare at him, her expression unreadable. A few more moments of this was unbearable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please - say something!\" He gulped at her, finding himself bending forwards as if he were pleading with her. \"Cho...just...please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho folded her arms, leaning back against the arm of her couch, her long, bare legs. crossing over as her toes wiggled, almost teasingly at him. Normally, a woman's foot or toes would gross Harry out, but with Cho EVERYTHING was simply divine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Harry. What can I say...?\" She stated softly. Allowing some silence to hang in the air, Harry began to babble at her again but she held out a graceful hand in front of his face to silence him. \"Ssh. Now, as I was saying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, staring right at him as if to measure the impact her imminent words would have on him. The suspense was killing him...!</span></div></div>",

It's not like that. I mean,\" He paused, trying to force himself to sound something resembling coherence. \"Ginny and I....it's...complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Complicated? What's complicated about you planning to cheat on your wife?\" Cho seethed at her ex boyfriend from years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...um...\" What could he say? If he admitted to Cho that he didn't love his wife, would that antagonise her, help to explain himself a bit better. It was becoming abundantly clear that Harry had made a grave error in professing his love for the Asian Scot. \"Look, I'm sorry, Cho. Please - I'll, I'll just go.\" He said awkwardly, shuffling to his feet, wishing desperately that he hadn't have come over to see Cho tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Cho used one of her long legs to force Harry backwards, sending a spark of pleasure to shoot through him, despite the  tense situation. \"You owe me an explanation! Do you really think, just because you're the famous Harry Potter that you have the right to cheat on your wife, and expect every girl to fall at your feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's eyes flickered down at the mention of this last word, noticing the white, glossy varnish adorning her feet. What could he do to resolve this? Before he could react, Cho's hand moved like a blur as she pointed her wand directly at him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expelliarmus!\" She yelled at Harry, catching him by surprise and knocking him backwards so that he tumbled off the end of the couch, hitting the ground with a thud! Being at such close range to him, his wand was wrenched from his trouser pocket with such speed, that he was more than impressed to see Cho grab it as it hurtled toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what the...!\" Harry gasped, the wind knocked out of his sails as he lay sprawled on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho stood over him, her arms folded and a menacing air about her. \"You really think you can do whatever you want, just because you're <i>the</i> Harry Potter. Well guess what, that doesn't work with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, please!\" He groaned up at her, feeling a thumping pain in the back of his head where it had come into contact with the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's what's going to happen. You're going to apologise for coming over here, with whatever perverted reasons you had. Then you're going home to your wife. Then I'll send this,\" Cho waved his wand - the same one that he had disarmed from Draco Malfoy just a couple of years ago - above him, \"I'll send this back to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My-my wand!\" He murmured. A wizard without a wand was like a bird without wings, or a fish without fins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. Lousy, cheating scumbags like you don't deserve wands. Go a whole week without it, devoting yourself to Ginny completely - and I'll find out if you have or not, and I'll let you have this back.\" Cho said disdainfully down to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do you have to say to me?\" She raised an eyebrow expectantly at him. Her face, though it was wearing a stern expression, still looked utterly gorgeous to him. \"Ready to apologise to me, Harry?\"</span></div></div>",

But there were three powerful factors that prevented him from doing so: Cho had two wands and he had none; the pain in his head was pretty intense; gazing up at the stunning raven-haired beauty, he found himself far too weak in her presence to attempt anything physical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing himself forward, he immediately felt disorientation take over, causing him to crash back down on the ground, at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Harry murmured pitifully. \"Please, not my wand...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you that I want an apology,\" She stated coldly, clearly unimpressed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his head up, just enough to look down at the tops of the Asian girl's bare feet. \"I'm b-begging you. Don't take my wand!\" Harry couldn't take it any more as he sank back down to the floor, his mouth pressed onto the silky smooth skin of Cho's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really that pathetic? I mean, telling me how you're obsessed with me, even though you're married...now you're lying on the ground at my feet, begging me for your wand... Is this the same Harry Potter who defeated You Know Who?\" She sighed, almost sounding flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Harry replied meekly, his lips pressed against the top of her foot still, neither of which were budging from the floor. Without really meaning to, he found his lips forming an 'O' shape so that he pressed them lightly against her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're kissing my feet? Wow you really have changed since I last knew you.\" With that she wrenched her feet away from him, leaving him face down on the carpet. \"And that was your apology I take it? Just leave, Harry. I've seen more than enough of you.\" She turned away, kneeling down on the floor so that she could reach for something that had fallen down the side of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, she exposed her bare soles to him. Lifting his head up, he was met with the sight of both bare soles, upside down to him, just a few inches from his face. \"Please, please! He grovelled up at her. Please, Cho. Please can I have my wand back?\" He felt the pain in his head start to subside, giving him enough strength to lean back so that he was kneeling before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho ignored him as she continued searching down the side of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" He called up at her, his voice finding some of its previous authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned round to look at him. \"Really? Still here? What's it going to take to get rid of you? Do I need to obliviate you, help you forget about your creepy little obsession with me?\" She said this with disdain, though Harry was sure he could see a little bit of excitement flash in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no not that!\" Harry hadn't considered this before: it wouldn't negate the antipathy that he felt towards his relationship with Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh do you want to kiss my foot again?\" She said mockingly, laughing at Harry as she lifted a bare foot and placed it just in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at her soft, slightly wrinkled sole, Harry gulped. He had never been into feet before, but this was not the first time that he had looked at Cho's foot and admitted privately that it was not unattractive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine - if you kiss it again, will that get rid of you?\" She chuckled at him; for the first time she showed some kind of sign that she might have been enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...but my wand,\" Harry stared up at her imploringly, knowing that she called all the shots. His options were dwindling rapidly: it seemed as though he would have to leave, by force or by his own volition. The only offer on the table was a kiss on the bare sole of Cho Chang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting your wand,\" she told him firmly. \"One more chance: you can kiss my foot before I let you go. Or I'm going to have to start using MY wand...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he was beaten. Any contact with Cho was something that he could not refuse: he arched his head up so that his lips were on the centre of her soft, pale sole. He felt a damp, musty, but not altogether unpleasant smell fill his nostrils as he pressed his lips forward. \"Please...?\" He whimpered one more time, but the movement of his lips had sealed his fate: his kiss was completed and Cho was now determined to get him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing her foot forward, Harry felt her toes brush against his nose as he was sent flat on his back. Standing over him, Cho held both wands in her hands. \"OK, which spell shall I use to get you out of here...?\" As she flicked her hand backwards, and began to say \"Loco...\" Her voice trailed off as he rolled to his side and scurried towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame and humiliation washed over him as he realised how pathetic a display that was: begging and pleading with her, kissing her foot...would she ever be able to take him seriously again? And the worst part, she clearly despised him for the fact that he was married and had these feelings for her! Hopping onto his broom, he headed back home, preparing for a week without his wand...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he returned to bed, she hadn't even stirred, and at one point apologised for waking him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the only thing fresh on his mind. He was dreaming of the events that had just taken place with Cho: in one scenario she had actually been delighted with his revelation and had reciprocated his feelings! Just when he was about to make out with her, her lips were replaced with her bare foot, which he still found himself pressing his lips eagerly against. For the next couple of hours, Harry Potter tried futilely to think about other things other than Cho Chang and his wand. He even thought about her feet! At least it took his mind off his wand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" Ginny mumbled as Harry lay awake, feeling absolutely shattered with the broken sleep he'd had. As she busied herself with putting the kettle on for a cup of tea, he could think of only one way round this: he had to go back to Cho's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was an incredibly risky option: she had made her feelings more than plain last night, but he simply had to get his wand back. Admittedly, the idea of just being around her again did seem rather wonderful. Then again, his utter patheticness last night filled him with more than a little trepidation. The defining image of Harry Potter: pleading at Cho Chang's feet and kissing them...is that something the history books would include?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResolving to cast aside his amorous feelings for Cho and focus purely instead on getting his wand back, he made a hasty goodbye to his wife - an excuse of seeing Hagrid - and hopped onto his broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just apparate over?\" Ginny asked him, observing him shrewdly with a cup of tea in her hand as they both stood in the front garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he couldn't tell her about his wand...that would only complicate things beyond measure! \"I just like it, you know. Plus, Hagrid likes seeing me on it too,\" Harry replied casually before taking off, ensuring that he went in the direction of Hagrid's, should Ginny still be watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sharp turn when he was up in the clouds, he arrived at the Asian Scot's within minutes. Lowering himself down towards the roof of the house, he noticed that one of the windows was open. A new plan instantly began to hatch inside his head...it was still early: maybe he could sneak in and retrieve the wand without her knowing! Could he really do something that sneaky; what if she found out....?</span></div></div>",

Aiming his Firebolt downwards enough so he could reach the ledge by her window, Harry steadied himself before peering through her window...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still asleep! His heart rate increasing, both the sight of the object of his affections as well with the fact that he could get in unnoticed, he gingerly looped one leg over the gap, then the other. Cho looked completely peaceful: her entire body was angled to one side and one hand was squeezing her pillow. The Boy Who Lived noticed the grey top she was wearing was the same as before...he wondered what else she was wearing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing himself away from such thoughts, he tiptoed through the room, his eyes darting around furiously for his wand. It wasn't anywhere obvious, so he subtly crept past her, into the bathroom but to no avail. Then he headed downstairs, quieter than a mouse. Soon, he was back in the living room: the place where he had grovelled so pathetically before her last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to find it: there it was on a coffee table beside the couch. A blissful feeling spread inside him: thank Merlin for that! Grabbing it and tucking it inside his coat pocket, Harry prepared to exit: he could just sneak out the front door now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it wasn't Cho: it was the sinking realisation that she would find out he had retrieved his wand! She would notice it gone in a second. A light bulb flicked on inside his head: what if he conjured up an identical replacement wand...then again, he had never been an expert at transfiguration. Or he could creep upstairs, alter Cho's memory: including the details of his visit last night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, he could just plead ignorance and play dumb: someone else could have stolen the wand! He could even break a couple of things, just to make it look like there had been some sort of burglary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Harry decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Two owls with one stone: he would have his wand back with no questions asked, and he would remove his humiliating display from yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after creeping up the stairs, Harry stood over the gorgeous Asian Scot. He wished that he could slip in under the covers to join her, but that was an idea that would definitely not go well. A rash, impulsive crossed his mind: if he was going to adjust her memory anyway, maybe he could have a little fun first...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went against his better moral judgement; he couldn't even blame it on the dark side of him embedded in him from Voldemort. This was Harry Potter being a slave to his own passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Petrificus Totalus!\" He yelled at her suddenly, pointing his wand directly at her sleeping body, which became instantly stiff. Was this wrong? Well, it clearly was but he just couldn't resist! Wrenching the light blue covers off her bed, he let out a small murmur of pleasure at the sight of Cho's tight pink pants and long, luscious legs. His eyes wandering downwards, he noticed her bare feet, scrunched up so that the cute wrinkles were even more pronounced than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood over her, for at least a couple of minutes, almost soothed by the sight of something this glorious and beautiful. Her eyes were still closed...was she even aware of what was going on? He had never tried that spell on someone asleep before. A pang of guilt began to spread inside of him: OK, he was going to Obliviate her anyway, but this was really taking advantage of an innocent woman. This wasn't him: he was decent, kind. Quickly putting her covers back over her, he gently performed the spell to negate her stiff state, before preparing to change her memory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho's eyes bolted wide open. \"What the...? How did ye? Harry, jeez!\" Cho said, her eyes wide with fear and incredulity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...I,\" Harry babbled, scrambling around with his wand to perform the Obliviate spell. He froze, his eyes meeting hers. Feeling almost lost in them, his hesitation gave her enough time to begin reaching around for something. It dawned on him - she was about to use her wand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to focus his mind, Harry Potter pointed his wand directly at his target...</span></div></div>",

Ye do a curse on me...yeah I could feel the duvet come off me...you're sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she launched forward and crashed her bare foot sharply into his testicles, forcing him to crumple instantly downwards so that his face dropped onto the end of her bed, his arms flailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho wasted no time, grabbing his wand, which had slipped from his hand. She held both this and her own over him, stood up on her bed and towering imperiously over him. All Harry Potter could do was moan in agony as hot tears sprang from his eyes: Cho's foot had found its target well. His groin felt as though a sack of potatoes had squashed and crushed against it! The pain was so much that he found himself flapping like a fish out of water. Before he could move, Cho used a bare foot to press firmly on his head, his nose scrunched painfully into her duvet cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did'n ye learn from last night?\" She said angrily, her foot grinding down so hard that Harry felt his breathing become rather restricted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmfff!\" Was the only noise he was capable of making at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did ye get yer wand?\" She said a little more calmly, but still with more than a dollop of menace. At this point she let off him enough so that he could arch his head up and gratefully inhale some oxygen into his lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn broken tones, he told her everything. He was in so much pain that he didn't dare deviate from the truth; he simply hoped that she would take some pity on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So youse were gonna change me memory? That's sick. You're sick, Harry Potter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could he say: he had acted like a total scumbag.

At least the pain in his nether regions was starting to subside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really not givin' up, are ye?\" Cho called down at him, sitting on the end of her bed now, her legs crossed and swinging just over him. She was right: even after yet another humiliating experience, he still wanted her, still yearned for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I love you, Cho,\" He said simply, feeling an almost cathartic effect from speaking the words that he knew to be true for months now, years really if he were completely honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho studied him carefully. It was almost as if she was thinking carefully about what she wanted to do with him. For the first time since yesterday evening, before he professed his feelings for her, she seemed to be looking at him with something other than disgust. Was it....curiosity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do ye love me?\" She said bluntly. Gazing up at this Asian Goddess, Harry felt one of the toes from her swinging feet brush lightly against his lips. Just the merest touch from her made him feel so happy, so right. He let out a small moan of pleasure before deciding how best to answer her...</span></div></div>",

I mean - look at ye! When we were teenagers, I thought youse were brave, strong, cute...Now look at ye!\" She said harshly, a look of superiority adorning her pretty features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stayed silent. Up until now she had been not unkind to him, not this brutal at least. What hurt was that she spoke the truth: he was half the man he used to be: lying on the ground and kissing an ex girlfriend's foot. <i>An ex girlfriend's foot who didn't even love him...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, even when she had denied him last night, he was still quietly confident that she loved him deep down. I mean, he was the famous Harry Potter! She had been so keen to be in touch with him...he really thought that this could be a way out of his unhappy marriage with Ginny! And here she was, standing on his face, making it abundantly clear that she didn't even love him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not only that, but youse a married man!

Finally the Asian Scot stepped off him, resting her feet on the floor. Looking past her, into a mirror, he could see his blotchy, reddened face. Cho had pressed so hard with her foot that he could actually see the imprint of her sole on his face. Too ashamed to even meet her eye, he averted her gaze, wishing that he had never come here. Again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry Potter: The Boy Who Kissed Cho Chang's Feet!\" Cho repeated, letting out a sigh, as if out of pity. \"In case I haven't made meself clear: the only part of me youse gonna get is me feet.

Quite the opposite: her words still echoed inside him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Harry Potter: The Boy Who Kissed Cho Chang's Feet!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You don't deserve Ginny, you weirdo</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell and truly, he had ruined any potential chance he'd had with Cho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In case I haven't made meself clear: the only part of me youse gonna get is me feet. Is that clear to ye?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he should have continued to kiss her foot when the thought had crossed his mind, he thought grimly to himself. Perhaps he should have accepted that as his new place in life: Cho Chang's foot slave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now run yeself back to Ginny. Her feet will need some kissin' too!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't seem the slight bit envious or bitter that he had a wife. He assumed that she would be fiercely jealous of Ginny, desperate to win him back. How wrong could he have been?! As he arrived back home, he felt almost relieved at the sight of Ginny's pale face, her soft, freckled features reminded him that he should have been perfectly happy with what he had. Why did he have to be such a scumbag?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was Hagrid?\" She asked, fairly disinterestedly, it must be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know. The usual,\" He replied, with an apathy to match her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was like many other. Harry had various bits of 'junk' (documents, he liked to call them) to sort out, while he  prepared himself for making a start on the revision. The exams he had to pass and qualifications required seemed like a complex maze to navigate through. Maybe he should perform the Imperius curse on the examiners, or find some remedy to help him remember the information. But he knew that was a pointless thought: the security measures were so intense and punishments so severe that he did not entertain the thought for more than a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he went to bed that night, his dreams were peppered with images of Cho's grinning face. Her look of disgust intermingled with spite haunted him. As did her feet: he dreamt of kissing them, being forced to smell them and lick them up and down like a dog. He felt as if he had memorised every crevice and contour of the soft bare skin of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the first thing he woke up to were images of Cho with her feet hovering over him, her words ringing inside his head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Harry Potter: The Boy Who Kissed Cho Chang's Feet!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same the following morning, and the one after that. If anything, his dreams of Cho were becoming more intense, more vivid. He found himself completely switching off to what Ginny was saying, daydreaming about Cho's long black hair, her beautiful dark eyes, her soft feet and pretty toes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could he do? Carry on and hope that his feelings for Cho just went away? Or would it be better to do some sort of spell or potion after all to quell his feelings for her. Another possibility of course was to see her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Irrational as it seemed, the only conceivable way to deal with the Cho situation was to see her. Straighten things out and try to find some peace with the predicament he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, he had seen spells and potions to remove lustful feelings go awry before. What if something happened to cause him permanent damage? He wasn't prepared to take that risk! There was something else too....the way Cho had spoke to him, the harshness of her words had been out of order. Okay, he had been pathetic and acted like a creep in front of her, but he was still Harry Potter! If it hadn't been for him she would probably not even be alive today! She had basically thrown the love he declared for her right back in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to start as he meant to go on, he knocked firmly on the door. Some of this evaporated the instant he saw he gorgeous, slender frame, her big, dark eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry!\" A surprised and amused expression was on her face. Her black fringe bounced a little just above her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Cho,\" he breathed back. \"I've come to see you, if that's okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends: are ye looking to kiss me feet again?\" She giggled gently, the cute freckles on her nose disappearing as her nose crinkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to blush but pressed on. \"No...no. I just wanted to talk. Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was relieved when Cho allowed him to come in and take a place next to her on the couch. He could not help but admire  how elegant she even looked: even in a black sweater and jeans. He also noticed that she was barefoot again...trying to shake that away from his mind, he attempted to make amends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Cho, I'm...really sorry. What I did a few days ago: coming over to yours and saying...what I said. Being a married man....it was all totally out of order. I am sorry,\" He said as reasonably as he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at him, flicking her black shining hair back a little. \"Ye should be sorry. You're Harry Potter: <i>the</i> Harry Potter. I used to look up to ye, even after we dated, like.\" She said a little awkwardly. \"I won't lie: I kinda hoped that when youse came back to Hogwarts, after the battle with You-Know-Who, that you'd like, wanna spend some time with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sightly resentful expression adorned her face. However this was swiftly replaced with one of amusement: the same, familiar ones from their last meeting and his dreams ever since. \"But now, now...\" She burst out laughing. \"Sorry...Harry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was this? Here he was doing the honourable decent thing by apologising, even though she had spoken to him like a piece of dirt before, and what did she do...laugh?! He had even started to feel some hope returning when she mentioned his return to Hogwarts several years ago. That had vanished the instant she started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho had to clutch her ribs to control herself and wipe several tears away with a dainty hand. \"Harry, I'm sorry. I can't help it: whenever I look at ye now, all I can picture is your face: under me foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself go scarlet. \"I've apologised,\" he said thickly, wishing that she could just let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you also said \"please\" enough times as well, though that were obscured by me foot!\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to say?\" Harry said, detecting some desperation creeping into his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have ye been kissin' Ginny's feet too?\" She said, winking at him and lifting her legs up so that her long, jean clad legs extended out and rested on his, her bare feet in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't know what to do: he couldn't force her off him - anything to risk pissing her off was a no-no! He tried to talk to her but she ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been missin' me feet eh? Is that why youse came over? Give 'em a rub, if yer's really sorry...\" She grinned at him, scrunching her pretty toes on his lap...</span></div></div>",

What would he tell her then?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shook his head.  Cho was not budging.  He didn't want to hurt her of course, she was so absolutely stunning he would never want to do that!  However he needed his wand.  Maybe he could disarm her gently and not hurt her?  He had to try of course, he just needed the right opportunity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cho... please I'm sorry.  I really need my wand back.  If you don't give it back...\"  He started to say and then let his eyes go wide and look out the window.  Cho's natural reaction was to see what was going on and looked out of the window as well.  But it had been a ruse and Harry was on her lightning fast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed her wrist that held his wand and tried to get her to let it go.  He didn't use his full strength because he didn't want to damage her delicate and beautiful body.  That proved to be a mistake as she violently pulled away from him.  He closed in so she couldn't cast someone on him only for her knee to lash out and catch him right in the family jewels!  He fell to the ground as the burning nauseating pain radiated out from his groin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bloody tosser!  How dare you attack me like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho's anger was up and she lashed out with her wand casting a Petrificus Totalus.  Harry was instantly frozen in place on the ground as the body bind wrapped around him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to regret that!\"  Cho said in a menacing voice.  Harry looked up at her with wide eyes.  He was in for it now, what was she going to do now?   </span></div></div>",

You decide to once more shove your face in the shoe, the smell was addictive.<br>\r\n    \"I have to wear them to bed, You know.\" You suddenly hear from behind you. It was the familiar wispy voice of Luna. You quickly drop the shoe, \"I- I was... Just...\" You say, turning to face her. Luna gave a smile, \"it's ok,\" Luna said, walking to the sofa, \"Daddy's written an article about things like this in the Quibbler.\" Luna sat down. \"I never judge other people- although if you like that sort of thing, you should of used a intensionem spell on the shoe.\"<br>\r\n    \"Uh...yeah...\" You say, not really sure what has happened. \"Well, uh here's your shoe back.\" you eventually say, and pass the shoe other.

I know it's the sort of thing you'd like.\" <br>\r\n    \"uh, sure.\" You say, slightly embarrassed by what's happening. Luna smiles and rests her feet on your lap. You take the toe polish and gently paint it over her small toes. You carefully cover every toenail. You can't help but carresse her feet while doing it. \"Your good at this.\" Luna says and smiles, \"You know, I don't mind if you want to do anything else with them after wards.\" Luna says. You smile and look down at the inviting feet, willingly placed on you lap, \"Really? Well, the polish is done now.\"<br>\r\n    \"So, what do you want to do with them?\" Luna smiles, and wriggles her toes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the British government announced the beginning of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Fleur was unspeakably pleased. She herself had long been planning to go to Foggy Albion and look at the famous Boy-who-survived. But she wanted this not because Harry Potter was a hero for her, the famous teenager was of a very specific interest for her - he was an ideal candidate for servants of a young veela: famous, rich, and, most importantly, young and completely inexperienced in love relationships.<br>\r\nIn the ancestral estate, and then in the flying carriage, which was carried by swift and beautiful pegasus above the clouds, Fleur reflected on how to conquer the hero of all Britain and make him obedient slave. Having worked out the plan that had arranged her, the beautiful veela leaned back in her armchair in the back of the carriage rushing over the English Channel and, dreaming about how a golden boy would soon be lying in her legs, she dozed off.<br>\r\nArrival at Hogwarts was noisy and extremely troublesome. Students of foreign schools had to show what they are capable of and demonstrate their skills to the students of Hogwarts who gathered in the Great Hall. The appearence of Durmstrang's students was spectacular, but Fleur was confident that Sharbaton would not give in to his northern rivals, at any rate the male part of Hogwarts, not least thanks to her, the performance of French women, will like certainly more. <br>\r\nWith a proud and elegant gait marching under the arches strewn with stars of the Great Hall, the veela looked for a forehead with a scar in the form of lightning. Finding a suitable forehead, she examined his owner - a small, frail black-haired boy wearing glasses, sitting at the scarlet-golden table of Gryffindor. Well, of course, he does not look like the hero, but as a servant will perfectly fit. When their glances met, Fleur, glaring at him haughtily and coldly, released some of her magic, realizing the first point of her plan: Harry Potter stared at her in all eyes, drooling on his chin. The fish hit the hook. Turning away from the teenager, Fleur walked to the Ravenclaw table.<br>\r\nThe next day, in the Great Hall, a goblet of Fire was set up, in which everyone who reached the age of 17 could drop a sheet with his name. <br>\r\nAnd after a month of agonizing expectation, the day of the selection ceremony came. Looking around the hall, Fleur watched as the bearded Dumbledore stood beside the goblet, that spewed out the blue flame, waiting for goblet's verdict determining who was worthy to participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. In couple seconds the name of Victor Krum flew out, than Cedric Diggory's, after that the goblet spit out a piece of paper with her own name, and then, quite unexpectedly, a fourth piece of paper with a name of Harry Potter appeared.<br>\r\nImmediately in the Great Hall a mess began, also a noise and outraged exclamations, but Fleur could not help smiling: everything was developing in the best way. She could not even dream about the current. Now she not only studies with Potter in one school, but even participates in the same tournament. The boy was already going crazy about her and could not find a place in her presence after a month of unsuccessful attempts to win her heart. It seems the plan is moving into a decisive phase. The rope is already tied on the neck of the Boy-who-lived, it remains only to tighten the noose. And Fleur already had an idea how to do it.<br>\r\nHarry entered the owlery and saw the limit of dreams, the beautiful and amazing Fleur Delacour, which, it seemed to him, was fascinated by Hedwig. Potter could not believe his happiness, did they have a common theme for conversation? After several months of unrequited love, Harry was unspeakably happy that his Goddess paid attention to something that was somehow connected to him.<br>\r\n\u2014 Fleur? \u2014 He decided to designate his presence, taking into count, doe to not the warmest attitude of a french-girl to him.<br>\r\n\u2014 What is it, 'Arry?<br>\r\n\u2014 Is Hedwig all right?<br>\r\n\u2014 Who? \u2014 Fleur finally turned around.<br>\r\n\u2014 Hedwig, my owl. \u2014 Harry answered.<br>\r\n\u2014 Zis gorgeous owl iz yours? \u2014 interest was clearly visible in her voice.<br>\r\n\u2014 Yes. Hagrid gave it to me when it was my first time visiting the Diagon Alley. \u2014 Harry walked over to stroke Hedwig, who seemed to be preening to Fleur.<br>\r\nEverything went smoothly, thought the veela. A little more, and this boy, called a great hero, will faint from a single word of mine. The main thing is not to leave the image ahead of time and bring this comedy to the end.<br>\r\n\u2014 She'z just amazing! I've never zeen such a beautiful owl before.<br>\r\n\u2014 Thank you. \u2014 Harry said proudly, throwing glances full admiration at the veela.<br>\r\n\u2014 I noticed zat she loves attention.<br>\r\nHarry nodded, grinning.<br>\r\n\u2014 She's a little princess. She loves everything to be the way she wants and when she wants.<br>\r\nFleur nodded, still looking at Hedwig.<br>\r\n\u2014 She's a bit like me in zis ... \u2014 Fleur said thoughtfully. \u2014 I would be very glad if someone makes everyzing my way... Oh, just zinking out-loud. <br>\r\nHarry could not help but take a moment. In one breath he blurted out:<br>\r\n\u2014 I am ready to fulfill your every wish! Whatever you want!<br>\r\nFleur looked long into Harry's eyes, seeing in them an endless determination to give her his life completely, without remnant. Become her eternal servant or ... even a slave. She easily smiled, leaned towards the brunette's ear and gently whispered:<br>\r\n\u2014 Good luck wiz ze tournament, 'Arry Potter.<br>\r\nThen she left a light, almost weightless kiss on his lips, and, gracefully unfolding, left the owlery, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts.<br>\r\nPotter stood in the middle of the owlery, like a pillar, not believing that his Goddess had kissed him. A wide smile played on his lips and he whispered after the long-gone girl:<br>\r\n\u2014 Good luck to you too.<br>\r\nThen Harry went to the drawing-room of his faculty. He needed to digest all that had happened and rest before tomorrow's test.<br>\r\nAnd then the day \"X\" came. Participants of the Tournament stood in a special tent, waiting for the organizers, and the crowd buzzed and rustled there, in the stands around the arena, where the champions had to fight the dragon. Harry was staring at Fleur with all his might. She was impeccable: the silver curls of her hair were gathered into a neat tail, and she herself was dressed in a brand-new blue sports suit. The only thing that seemed a little strange to Harry, was that she was wearing old and fairly worn running shoes on her feet. However, Potter had no time to be surprised, the organizers appeared to give the participants the honor to choose a dragon, with which students would have to fight. Five minutes passed and the dragons were chosen. Fleur went to the arena first. The fight took half an hour, but Harry felt that it lasted forever. He shuddered from every dragon's roar and the shout of the crowd.<br>\r\nHe believed that Fleur would surely cope, but he was still very worried about her. But the trial was over and Fleur, still as beautiful as always, but slightly disheveled and sweating, went into the tent, proudly holding a golden egg in her hands. Passing by Harry, she whispered softly: \"I'll meet you today at 8 in the  broomstick cot near the Quidditch pitch.\" Now Harry knew that he would be able to pass the first trial, no matter what. Even Lord Voldemort himself if suddenly he decides to protect the golden egg can not thwart Harry to go on a date with Fleur.<br>\r\nAfter a long and exhausting battle with the fire-breathing monster, Harry managed to get a damn egg, and with a sense of accomplishment went to celebrate, dreaming about the moment when he again can see Fleur.<br>\r\nBy eight o'clock he was standing by a small lodge where brooms were kept. The door to it was ajar and a soft yellow light from the kerosene lamp poured into the street from a small crack. Harry waited a little to get courageous and entered the cot.<br>\r\nFleur was sitting on a bench, lit by a pleasant light dancing behind a glass lamp.  The flames fervently frolicked in her azure eyes and gently stroked her silvery curls. Weila was dressed in a light jacket and light trousers, and on her feet she had all the same sneakers in which she performed at the tournament. Fleur beckoned to Harry, inviting him to sit beside her. When he settled himself on the corner of the bench, she spoke: \"Remember, zen, at the owlery before the first trail, you said you were ready to fulfill all my desires?\"<br>\r\nFleur looked Harry in the eye. He swallowed convulsively, paused for a second, then nodded confidently. The veela's face was lit up by a dazzling smile, exposing her snow-white, neat teeth. She continued: \"If zis iz true, can you swear it?\"<br>\r\nThe silence lasted a minute, and then Harry said one single word that determined his fate.<br>\r\n\u2014 I swear it!\u2014<br>\r\nImmediately, they were seized with a blue glow, a moment later extinguished. Potter looked inquiringly at Fleur. She smiled and decided to explain to the unlucky teenager what he had just done.<br>\r\n\u2014 You zee... You yourself, wizout realizing it, made a magical contract wiz me, swearing allegiance. Now you will be obligated to carry out all my orders, whezer you like it or not. In any case, magic will force you. And, to tell the trus, I always treated you as a humble servant, and not as a boy-friend. At the end of the day you are just a stupid child.<br>\r\nHarry with tears in his eyes looked at Fleur sitting in front of him. How could he have been so deceived? But Hermione told him, she warned him that Fleur needed something from him ... How could he have been so naive, and believe that this veela would really love him?<br>\r\nBut the flow of his not the most pleasant thoughts was interrupted by the voice of his enslaver.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Today was a very busy day and I spent a lot of time on my feet. I zink you should take a little care of my zore soles.<br>\r\nShe stretched out her leg, and Harry, seized by some force, without even noticing it, was sitting on the floor, with veela's sneakers in front of his face. She looked thoughtfully at the black-haired boy and said slowly: \"You know, zeze sneakers I have for the fours year. They are very comfortable and I always use zem for training. But usually I'm so tired zat I just do not have ze strengs to wash them. You should know, I haven't washed zese zings for ages. I just use a charm to keep all the smell in them. I zink now is the best time to put zem in order, but first ... You just have to brease in this divine fragrance.\"<br>\r\nWith her giggling Harry grabs veela's right sneaker and pulls it off. With the removal of her sneaker Potter was instantly assaulted with a foot odor that made him cough. It smelled of sweat, foul cheese, perhaps a small hint of something else Harry couldn't place. Point being he was assaulted by this odor and began gagging. Fleur noticed this and giggled: \"I wore them all the time without socks just for you Mr. Potter! Now it's time to smell the inside,\" \u2014 she grins. <br>\r\nThe leather bottom of her reeking sneaker is torn and ripped, and coated with sweat. Harry put his head into the sneaker and took a small sniff. It was terrible. It had the stench of moldy cheese dipped in vinegar. <br>\r\n\"Do you like it little boy? How's it smell, huh?\" <br>\r\nHarry whimpered, \"It's horrible Fleur... Please, don't make me do this, it's so revolting!\"<br>\r\n\"Shush, zere! It's only the beginning. Now sniff louder and harder!\" <br>\r\nShe sticks Harry's  head down into the sneaker. He feels the heat eminating from deep within. He sniffed loudly and gagged on the stench. The insole reeks of rubber and sweat and lots of wear. The odor had effectively doubled in strength and left Harry shuddering. The cruel veela laughed as the boy coughed and nearly lost what he had in his stomach. <br>\r\n\"Keep smelling it, you, pasetic kid!\" <br>\r\nThe young Potter sniffed and sniffed and sniffed. His eyes watered and his chest began to hurt as he inhaled the semi-toxic fumes of veela's worn sneaker. <br>\r\n\"Now start licking zat dirty insole...\" A cruel smile spreads across Fleur's face as she said this but Harry doesn't get the pleasure of seeing that with his nose deep in a stinky prison and his eyes pressed against the tongue of her sneaker.<br>\r\n \"Are you enjoying that 'Arry? Do you remember zat you promised me to do everysing I ask? Now you have such an opportunity. \" Fleur whispers as she painfully presses Potter's face down into her sneaker.<br>\r\nSlowly Harry poke his tongue out and let it touch down on the slightly damp interior of Fleur's sneaker... The taste overwhelms the tip of his tongue faster than he could have thought possible and an effort made on himself  he has pressed whole tongue flat against the sole of her sneaker. Right as Harry reached the disgusting toeprints in the front of Fleur's sneaker he licked up all the sweat, dirt, and who knows what else and swallowed it with disgust. Fleur watched until she saw Harry start to grow faint. <br>\r\n\"MMmmmmMmmmmMMmMMM!\" \u2014 Harry's mumble of discomfort, rolls out from the back of his throat.<br>\r\nFinally Fleur put her sneaker on the floor near the bench and took off the second one. Her pale slender foot slips out of the malodorous sneaker, bare and very white with slightly tan soles. Harry's eyes starts watering again from the feminine feet odor.<br>\r\nHarry with beg in his eyes looks at the veela holding the funky nasty sneaker. With tears he cries: \"Please, I can't endure this anymore! Those shoes reek like hell!\"<br>\r\n\"Hm? You don't like my sneakers?\" \u2014 Fleur asks with a curious smile. \"Zan, I guess, zat it's time you to smell my tired feet.\"<br>\r\nWith that said,  Fleur lifts up her bare feet so that her long quite dingy soles were directly in front of Harry's cringing face and wiggles her toes. Once again, a raunchy, musty stench dominated his nostrils, making him rather discombobulated. The smell from veela's feet is atrocious and reminds him of across between stale cheese popcorn and vinegar. Fleur places her toes on Harry's nose. He jump back and start coughing. Harry can see the perspiration on Fleur's feet and it makes him sick. Her feet were hot, ridiculously foited, and dirty. They stank horribly, he thought, gagging at the putrid scent. <br>\r\nShe smiles as her pinky toes winding up stretched tightly over Potter's face. Harry's nose is squeezed between two of Fleur's slicky and sweaty toes. She starts flexing her nasty toes and rubbing Potter's face with them. The veela shove young hero's face into the moist skin. The calloused ridge of her big toe dug into his skin as bits of grime and beads of sweat covered his lips. Harry's face has become slick with Fleur's salty sweat and toe jam is being forced into his nose. Still, this was nothing compared to what was to come...<br>\r\n\"God it feels so good to rub my toes all over your face 'Arry, \u2014 she says excitedly, \u2014 I can't imagine how nice zat would be to feel your tongue pressed against my sole.\" <br>\r\nHarry without other chances pulled out his tongue and started licking the salty tasting sweat from Fleur de Lacour's disgusting feet groaning in displeasure as he does so. Placing his tongue against the middle of her putrid smelling sole, his tastebuds were completely violated by the ridiculous salty sour flavour. It was even worse than the smell! Intensely acrid, vinegary tastes bounced and danced nastily all over his tongue. After a couple more licks, he was doing everything in his powers to refrain from vomiting. He passed his tongue on every wrinkle, remebering all the time the stench of her feet. It was like swallowing down a piece of brie that been left out in the sun for hours! Beyond repulsive! His eyes, which creased in disgust, along with a slight recoiling of his mouth, only made Fleur push her foot forward, her toes casually spreading over his face. Because of the pressure Harry was forced to open his mouth and when that was done Fleur stuck her sweat drenched foot in it. The taste was awful and disgusting. Harry could feel the sweat slide down the foot and into his mouth. Fleur was enjoying his servile mouth on her feet. It was both restful and even... sensual. It didn't bother her that he was a young teenager, it made her feel good and that was all she cared about. The boy finished her first foot and then went on o the second. When he completed the task he moved his head away from the still foul smelling feet of his cruel goddess. <br>\r\n\"Oh, zat was so relakzing! \u2014 Fleur dreamily purred, \u2014 But you forgot ze most delicious part.\" After a little giggle she gives Harry a new order: \"Now, tze great boy-who-lived, I want you to suck my toes. Be sure to lick out and swallow any of ze gunk you find between zem.\"<br>\r\nHarry quailed at the command but knew that he can't resist it. The salty vinegar like taste of her toes made him sick to his stomach. Harry bit back a whimper and took one big toe into his mouth and began to suck it scrubbing and eating all the gunk under her nails. He gagged pathetically at the nauseating taste. He sucked on each toe for about 30 seconds before moving on to the next one. When the veela's toes were covered in his saliva, it was time for him to lick in-between them. And Harry's tongue began it's journey in-between those toes in front of Potter's face . As his tongue reachs in, it feels different, somehow \u2014 Harry feels the excessive sweat there, that hasn't had the chance to dry up yet, absorbing itself into his mouth. It makes The teenager retch in disgust, but he knows he must push his tongue further in. And then, he feels something. It feels like a rubbery material of sorts. Harry leans back to see what he's found. He splits up veela's pretty if not smelly toes and gags in disgust. His find was the cheese that has been accumulating between them, and as soon as he sees it's yellowish color and it's smell starts hitting him in the face, he couldn't help but vomited. <br>\r\nFleur glanced at him angrily and asked: \"What does zat mean, you, little  freak?!\" <br>\r\nHarry mumbled: \"Fleur, please... That gunk in-between your toes is just too revolting. I can't stand it, I...</span></div></div>",

You will lick, chew and swallow every bit of it, understood?!\" \u2014 Fleur was really upset due to the behavior of her servant. <br>\r\n\"But, please, I can't...\" \u2014 Harry tried to protest but Fleur rudely interrupted him, \u2014 \"I said you're going to chew and swallow all ze gunk you find! I don't care if you like it or not. You could just swallowed it quietly and be done, but now as ze punishment you'd have to eat each peace of zat dump mass between my toes slowly and zoroughly to feel every shade of its flavor and taste!\"<br>\r\nHarry cried. He couldn't resist the direct order and he slowly leaned closely to the fetid sole, stuck out his tongue... and took the first peace of the foot cheese in his mouth. After he hawked the taste he was about to vomit again. He gagged but continued to chew. That was the worst thing he ever tasted. Harry couldn't believe that such a beautiful creature as veela can produce such a horrible thing. Harry couldn't even swallow the dump mass because he was ordered not to. So he chewed it for about 20 second gagging each time and only than he felt that he can finally swallow the nauseous mass. But that was only the beginning.  Harry had nine more peaces to eat... But Fleur didn't give him the opportunity to finish his work. She came up with an idea how to make this situation even more humiliating. The veela flicked her wand and a small silver spoon appeared.<br>\r\n\u2014 Now you are going to collect all ze remaining junk in zis spoon and put it in your filsy mouth in one fell swoop. \u2014 Fleur grinned evilly. <br>\r\nThat was too much. Harry couldn't have done that in his own will. He even tried to fight the charm and he managed to successfully do this for a minute but than he was broken. He have done what Fleur had ordered him to do. He slowly collected all the foul putrid funky yellow peaces in the spoon and than sent it to his mouth. The taste was disgustingly awful, sour, bitter and salty at the same time... Harry hated that taste, but he had no choice but to chew the filthy grime. <br>\r\nHe couldn't stand it any more. He gagged. Than again and again . He couldn't endure the cheesy taste but the magic hadn't been giving him a chance neither to spit the gunk out, nor even to swallow it. So he had to play with nauseous mass with his tongue to fully coat his tastebuds with the unspeakably salty, sour, vinegary and devil knows what else flavour. After two minutes gagging and coughing he finally was allowed to swallow the mucky trash. <br>\r\nHe being exhausted and panting  glanced at Fleur. She though after saying an arrogant \"Fe\" put her sneakers on and after ordering Harry to clean up the mess left the lodge. Harry was sitting there in a little cot with a putrid scent in his nostrils and a foul flavor in his mouth thinking  about how much his life has changed and yet will change. He took his wand, casted a cleaning spell and made his way to the Griffindor dormitory. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking along the corridors of Hogwarts, Harry felt terribly depressed. First, he was forced to participate in a deadly tournament against his will, because of this he was hated by a large half of the school, then he lost his best friend who considered him a liar and now, when everything seemed to begin to settle, the most humiliating experience in his life happened.<br>\r\nDrowned in sad thoughts of his fate, Potter did not notice how he found himself in the living room. The party, organized in honor of his victory in the first trial, has already ended leaving behind a terrible mess.<br>\r\nAll the students, vigorously celebrating his success, already got to the bedroom to digest a dense dinner, generously flavored with alcohol. A couple of times stumbled in the dark about someone's dropped chairs Harry climbed into his room, where the tenth dream was already seen by the other four-grade boys. Potter lay down on his bed, glanced with a sigh at Ron, who was snoring on the nearest couch,  then covered himself with a blanket and tried to fall into a dream, slipping away from the harsh realities of life.<br>\r\nThe next day, Harry woke up late, skipping breakfast. He was awaken by the noise of classmates returning from the dining room.<br>\r\nRon, forgetting that just a couple of days ago he did not want to hear anything about the \"golden boy, who always gets all the glory,\" patting the black-haired Gryffindor on the shoulder, asked if the newly-baked hero slept well. Harry sat on the bed with a sigh and rubbed his eyes, tiredly staring at his red-haired friend. When it was enough for Potter to recover a little, the events of yesterday struck him with a roaring waterfall. Is that really true? Was this really the case? Or maybe it's just a nightmare, inspired by an excessively large amount of drunk firewhisky?<br>\r\nHarry wanted to believe in the last, but Ron's question about why Harry left the party yesterday, the barely born hope was hacked to the ground. Muttering something illegible about going for a walk, and then drinking tea with Hagrid, Harry went to the bathroom. Refreshed and with his cloth changed, he went down to the general drawing room of the faculty. Looking at the wall clock, he found an arrow on the mark at 12:47 and thanked God that today is Saturday and he win't have to explain to the professors why he was not at the lessons. Seeing Potter in the living room, Ron invited him to play a couple of chess games and Harry nodded absently deciding that this was the best way to kill time and think about what to do now.<br>\r\nPlaying this game that he was found, by Hermione returning from the library. After reading a lecture about the fact that the game of chess does not contribute to the successful passing of exams, the young nerd seated two resisting guys for textbooks. After sitting for an hour and a half and thoroughly studying the structure of the hippogriff, the trio went to dinner. Walking along the steps of the ancient castle, Harry reflected on how he would now appear in the Great Hall. After all, there probably will be Fleur, and the devil knows what else will appear in the head of this crazy Veela. All at once she may come up with an idea to humiliate him in front the whole school ... At the thought of it, Harry shuddered. Meanwhile, friends had to overcome the last corridor, before they are under the sky arches of the Great Hall. Entering the banquet room of Hogwarts, Harry fixed his gaze on the floor and was not ready to lift it even for a million galleons. And especially he did not want to look at the Ravenclow table, where, he felt it very well, a pair of azure eyes gazed at him from under long eyelashes. Having sat down at the desk of his faculty, Harry put on his plate all that his hands had reached, not really thinking about the compatibility of dishes, and began his meal.He was distracted by Ron's grunting laughter.<br>\r\nHarry looked inquiringly at his friend, who was laughing, with his finger pointed at Potter's plate: \"Harry, I understand everything, yesterday was a crazy day and all that, but the herring with the cake, in my opinion, is already an overkill.\" Then only Harry noticed that he was making a sandwich of cream pie and salted fish. Embarrassed, he put aside his culinary masterpiece and decided to limit himself to tea and apple strudel. Ron continued to chuckle gaily glancing at the reddened Potter, and Hermione, staring at the gloomy face of the national hero, laid her hand on Harry's shoulder, as a sign of support.<br>\r\nQuickly finishing his strudel and gulping tea, Harry, without looking at anyone, went to the living room. This kind of his behavior lasted until the Christmas holidays. Potter was locked in himself, spending almost all his free time in the bedroom with books, or just lying and looking at the ceiling, leaving the hostel only for meal or to visit the classes. He began to communicate less and less with Ron and Hermione, and this worried his best friends. But to all their questions, Harry answered that he was just worried about the next assignment, and therefore he prefers to spend more time on preparation, rather than on meaningless chatter.<br>\r\nHermione insistently tried to explain that training and communication can be combined, and that the three of them can prepare more rapidly than him being alone, but Harry only shrugged his shoulders and went to his room to read another book completely incomprehensible for him. Thus, sitting out for days on his own bed, he quite successfully avoided Fleur and did not see Veela ever since that ill-fated day when he signed a magical contract that had changed his life so abruptly.<br>\r\nThe very last week before the holidays, the Veela felt somewhat out of place as well. Harry's behavior in the early days of after their \"date\" she consedered funny. Fleur even thought about whether she should not force the teenager to spend with her all the free from school hours, but the more time passed, the more Veela was worried about the state of young Potter. Being not too impressive with his complexion before, after a last month Harry strongly sank and lost even more weight. He began to miss visits to the dining room, and if he came, he ate very little: a piece of cake or a few sweets with tea.<br>\r\nFleur felt sorry for this frail black-haired boy. In Sharbathon, a few lessons of the history of magic were devoted to the British Magical War of the 20th century, and the young Veela knew about the sad fate of the Potters family. Previously, she wasn't very worried. But the hero, illuminated by the rays of glory, who killed the terrible Dark Lord with his own spell, was only the image living on the dry pages of the textbook. In life  it was not any formidable hero, but an ordinary kid with whom too many bad things happened.<br>\r\nThe death of the parents at the hands of the greatest dark magician of our time, the hard life with relatives, about which she was told by the Hogwarts students, constant attacks from the Slytherin faculty, and now her terrible act - it is not surprising that Harry lost all craving for life. There in the house for brooms Fleur could not even think that her behavior will so much affect the adolescent. At that moment it seemed to her usual prank. But now ... She had long wanted to apologize to Potter, but she had no idea how to begin the conversation: Harry scampered away from her, as if from a fire.<br>\r\nThis desperate situation, the teachers solved announcing the Holy Ball, which will take start on Christmas Eve. The ball was a traditional and integral part of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. But this time the organizers of the tournament decided to depart somewhat from the canon and granted the right to choose the partner not to the boys, as it traditionally was, but to the girls. From the beginning of this year the Ministry of Magic Sports arranged everything for Fleur in the best way. She was more and more into feeling that this was Divine Providence. Anyway, she now had an excellent excuse to talk calmly with Potter and apologize for not having the best attitude toward him.<br>\r\nThe Veela decided to invite him this day already. Fortunately, unlike other girls, Harry won't be able to refuse her because of the contract signed between them. Alas, today she didn't  manage to see Potter - he didn't come to the Great Hall, so the Veela completed her plan the next day only, when the black-haired boy went down to dinner.<br>\r\nSeeing him entering into the high gate of the Hogwarts dinner hall, Fleur immediately jumped from her place and lightly, but with a confident gait, rushed to the teenager.<br>\r\n\u2014 Monsieur Potter, would you do me ze honor of being my partner at ze ball?<br>\r\nHarry shuddered at the sound of the Veela's voice. Really again? He refused to believe it. What else this beautiful, but such a cruel creature wants to do with him? He looked up and his emerald eyes met the azure eyes of Fleur. He looked at the beautiful face of the Veela, and the more carefully he examined her ideal features, the more he understood how he hated her. He hated this beautiful face, eyes behind long eyelashes, her melodic voice ... Her all entirely and completely.<br>\r\nBut Harry could not refuse her. Sighing heavily, he uttered a word he did not want to say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a joyful smile, Fleur elegantly moved to her place, leaving the Dark Lord crusher in a more sombre mood than when he got out of bed. Ron, on the other hand, didn't quite caught what Harry was so worried about. How can you be dissatisfied with the fact that the most beautiful girl in the school invited you to the ball?<br>\r\n\u2014 Harry, well, you're weird. I would immediately quit my partner if Fleur would have asked me to be with her at the ball!<br>\r\nFrom the further lamentations of the redhead, Harry was rescued by Hermione, who actually was Ron's ball partner.Wesley's words seemed so insulting to her that she began to hit the ginger with a weighty volume called \"Magic creatures and where they live\".<br>\r\nThe remaining two weeks before the ball, which for many were the happiest days of life, for Harry turned into a real hell. Not only did he not know how to dance, because of what he had to wander around every day for four hours in a waltz with Professor McGonagall, who decided to teach him this art, so also on the freaking ball he would have to go with a girl whose feet not so long ago he was licking. He would have been better take part at a fight with a dragon a couple more times than he would have gone on this silly feast. But, unfortunately, being the champion Harry had no right to miss this solemn event.<br>\r\nDays before the celebration were passing by unnoticed, and now Harry was arm-in-arm with a hateful Veela, dressed in an elegant dress, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/kPe0ox\" target=\"_blank\">https://ibb.co/kPe0ox</a> in a room specially reserved for the tournament participants, where they were briefly instructed about the arrangement. Well, now they have to open a ball. Lined up in pairs in front of the grand doors of the Great Hall, they waited for the signal.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the doors flew open, the waltz played and they went to the middle of the hall decorated for Christmas and began their dance.<br>\r\nHarry tried not to look at Fleur, pretending to follow his feet and count a step, but he distinctly felt a heavy Veela's look on himself. When the music ended, they went to small tables with drinks, standing along the walls of the hall. Fleur took a glass of champagne, and Harry didn't have the courage to lift his gaze from the floor. The Veela first broke the silence.<br>\r\n\u2014 You know, I wanted to apologize for making you ... Well, you know ..<br>\r\n\u2014 For licking your sweaty feet? \u2014 Harry sharply raised his head and looked at  Fleur being embarrassed. Her face flooded a faint blush. <br>\r\n\u2014 Do you have any ideas how disgusting this was? I think I still have this nasty taste in my mouth!<br>\r\nHarry spoke quite loudly, and Fleur was glad that they were standing at a far table in the very corners of the hall, and thankful to the music of the rock band that replaced the orchestra, hardly anyone could hear their conversation. Meanwhile, Harry continued.<br>\r\n\u2014 In front of my eyes, a crazy warlock killed my parents when I was a year-old, then until I was eleven, I played the role of a house elf living with my crazy relatives! I was so glad when I found out that I was a wizard and received a letter from Hogwarts. I thought my life would change, but in the first grade Voldemort himself nearly killed me, and then in the second grade I had to fight with a fifty meter basilisk! And for all that I was rewarded  with the pieces of gunk that have accumulated between your toes!<br>\r\n\u2014 But 'Arry, zet was just a joke, I didn'tt zink it would act on you like zat ...\"<br>\r\n\u2014 You know, I sincerely want some crazy asshole to kill your sister Gabrielle before your very eyes! I wish him killing her cruelly, so that you can see in detail all of her suffering! Perhaps then you will understand, you will feel on yourself all the charm of my life, which, even without you being included, looked like someone's evil, silly joke!<br>\r\nAnd then Harry realized that he had said too much. Fleur's expression sharply changed from confused to very distant and cold. In a voice that didn't foretell Harry anything good she said: \"Let's go for a walk in ze garden. I have an assignment for you.\"<br>\r\nDespite the fact that there was a Christmas night outside, temperature in the garden was warm like in summer. It was maintained by the special charms so that students after the ball could unwind and walk for fun on the green alleys of strange plants with bright splashes of wonderful flowers. In secluded places there were small sofas, on which sweet couples walking around the garden could talk about their love affairs.<br>\r\nHarry and Fleur also found such a sofa, standing in the most remote part of the garden, hidden from prying eyes by dense foliage of trees and bushes. Veela sat down on the sofa, leaving Potter to stand, head lowered. Having settled herself comfortably, she slowly, stretching out every word, said:<br>\r\n\"So you zink Gabrielle is worsy of deas? I had already began to feel sorry for you, but you appeared to be ze same monster as ze one who killed your own parents. You wished the cruel deas of an innocent nine-year-old girl, and for zis you will bear a fully justifiable punishment.\"<br>\r\nFleur raised the hem of her dress, drawing Potter's attention to her shoes. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/gpQqox\" target=\"_blank\">https://ibb.co/gpQqox</a><br>\r\n\u2014 Zese shoes were bought to me when I was sirteen. In zem I learned to dance, for hours I wandered around in ze waltz in my parents' estate. Today, when I was preparing for ze ball, I wanted to put on my heels, but zen decided zat because of ze dress, zey would still not be visible. So I took out zese old, but very comfortable shoes. I couldn't zink that they would be useful to me today for anysing more zan dancing.<br>\r\nWith these words being said, she took off her shoes and climbed onto the sofa with her feet. Harry, already inwardly shuddering at what he had to do, saw that even today Fleur had put on her shoes on her bare feet. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/eCtUWH\" target=\"_blank\">https://ibb.co/eCtUWH</a><br>\r\nCouple seconds after she kicked of her shoes the stench enveloped the area and Harry gagged. He shuddered and tumbled backward. Potter was mentally indignant: \"Has this Veela ever heard of socks ?!\"<br>\r\nFleur, meanwhile, took up her shoes, and gazing at the teenager, said with a mocking smile: \"Well, monsieur, are you ready to recall ze fragrance of my wonderful feet? Zese shoes for hours saved up ze stink of my soles while I was learning to dance.\" Veela handed him the shoes, and  being unable to resist, he plunged his nose into them.<br>\r\n Inside the shoe the smell was horrific. The horrid stink burns his nostrils and turns his stomach. Coughing from the disgusting odor, Harry recoiled.<br>\r\n\u2014 Well, it seems zat you don't want to do willingly what I asked  you to, so I have no choice but to make you do it forcefully. <br>\r\nWith a devilish smile Fleur picked up her gross dancing shoes and beckoned Harry, inviting him to kneel in front of her. After kneeling Harry looked inside her shoes, he could very well see clear footprints in her insoles which is the proof of how old they are and how many times she has worn them. The Veela then placed his face down in her reeking shoe pushing it into its sweaty bottom  only allowing him to breath her hot foot odor as air. The smell was terrible, it maked the teenager's eyes water and he swallowed trying to stop himself from vomiting.<br>\r\n\u2014 Oh, don't be a drama queen, zese can't be zat bad. \u2014 Fleur teased him. \u2014 Though I have been wearing zem to all my dance classes for ze last two weeks, so yeh, they may reek a bit. But it is even more interesting zis way! I wish to hear you sniffing! Smell zem harder! Inhale zat aroma wiz all your strengs. </span></div></div>",

With each breath, he got another portion of the cheesy stench that came from the depths of the cavern that was Veela's putrid dancing shoe. Harry sniffed and his heart pounded as he was forced to inhale a two weeks' worth of sweat and filth. Fleur seemed to be pleased with that because she started to stroke Hrry's hair like she's petting a dog. The humid air inside the dancing shoes wasn\u2019t giving him enough oxygen and he was beginning to feel lightheaded.That was like hell. Harry could barely inflate his chest at all to breath and the only \"air\" he was getting was a stinky mixture of stenches. <br>\r\nHarry shuddered and squirmed in total agony yet still somehow he kept sniffing the best he could.<br>\r\n\u2014 Zat's enough of you just sniffing, now it's time to make zese stinkers a bit more pleasant. Start licking ze insole! \u2014 With thad said Fleur pushed Harry's poor face further into the humid inside of her shoe. <br>\r\nPotter's face was into the hole of it , directly rubbing against her insole .<br>\r\n\u2014 Eh... So stinky! \u2014 Harry muttered. <br>\r\nHow feet can possibly be that bad, he thought. But the magical bonds didn't let him escape his doom. Harry stuck his tongue out and started licking the dried or sometimes fresh foot sweat and sole gunk out of the shoe insole. The taste was repulsive but he couldn't do a thing about it but to moan in discomfort. Harry's face was buried in a moist and stinky surface, wet by the foot sweat of the Veela. The taste and smell were horrible but magic kept his nose in the shoe and his tongue working. The flavor was truly revolting, it sickened Harry and he gaged a little, even though he hadn't yet attempted to swallow it. He had no choice, but to inhale, inhale, inhale, drink sweat, lick the footwear's insole, inhale. Harry took another lick, hoping that the taste would get better, it didn't though. His body trembled as he tried to swallow his first mouthful of trash. Some of it gets stuck in Harry's craw and he coughed fitfully.The salty vinegary liquid made him want to vomit and he tried to recoil away from it.<br>\r\nHarry was quietly crying. The texture... the taste.. the smell... the pure horribleness of a shoe inside causes his body to spasm. But he continued licking the damp insole of Fleur's one and than second awful shoe. When those were clean, if you can actually use the world clean to describe three years old dancing shoes, and Harry's mouth was fully filled with vinegary sour and a bit bitter taste, the Veela finally let him stop. <br>\r\n\u2014 Enough put my shoes down boy. \u2014 She commanded. \u2014 Zat was fun but here comes ze main event.<br>\r\nFleur than turned on her sofa putting her beautiful feet on a border right in front of Harry's eyes. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/b7s6BH\" target=\"_blank\">https://ibb.co/b7s6BH</a> Her long tan soles filled his nosetrills with a strong revolting scent. He could see every last detail on the Veela's feet. He clearly saw the small amounts of dirt and dust trapped between the skin wrinkles, he saw the gunk between her toes and he even saw the sweat baring down them. The horrible odor invaded Harry's senses like a lightning bolt. Every nerve ending in his body was screaming to get away from the bad smell. The vicious nostril burning lung damaging toxic stench. Harry couldn't help but moan in despair as his body shuddered. Veela smiled and stretched her long soles invading Harry's face and the soul crushing scent sinks into his nostrils with an increased strength.<br>\r\n\u2014 Don't be shy, 'Arry, \u2014 Fleur sent him a wide smile, \u2014 take a nice sniff of zem. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.imagebam.com/image/7a16bd174428183\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.imagebam.com/image/7a16bd1744...</a><br>\r\nPotter got one whiff of her feet and thought he might throw up. Her feet smell across between cheese and vinegar. He could see every fold and wrinkle, every speck of dirt and tiny beads of perspiration. After a couple of minutes having to endure the foul odor Harry lost his balance and nearly fellThough he still continued taking quick shallow sniffs of Veela's foot stink. Every tiny sip of air Harry was getting from underneath her malodorous feet made him want to gag and vomit. <br>\r\n\u2014 Oh, you can't stand already. \u2014 Fleur purred, \u2014 But zat isn't even ze worst part of my feet. Now sniff between my toes, ze smell is ze strongest zere.<br>\r\nVeela then used her toes to cling on to Harry's face and forced him into smelling the foulest part of her putrid feet: the gap between her big and second toe. In-between her toes Harry could see a fair amount of toejam suggesting that Fleur didn't spend much time washing her feet recently. A wave of noxious fumes was rolling over him. Harry tried to get away but one of Fleur's sweat drenched feet was harder pushed on top of his face. Horrible smell of Veela's filthy toes seared Harry's lungs and brought tears to his eyes.<br>\r\n\u2014 This feels good on my toes, keep sniffing. <br>\r\nHarry was taking breath after breath between her rancid toes, taking in her reeking stench as her toes continued to wiggle, making the stench worse. Potter suffered having his face forced between Fleur's smelly toes inhaling sour feminine foot odor repetitively for nearly 20 minutes. Already it was nearly unbearable, but he new, that the next part would be even worse. <br>\r\n\u2014 Now  I want you to give my soles a thorough cleaning make sure you cover every inch of my feet in your saliva. \u2014 Fleur's voice was trembling in pleasure.<br>\r\nHarry started to lick at the perspiration on her feet. The salty substance curdled his tongue as it clashed with the taste of dirty skin. As bad as her feet had smelled, it was even worse having to run his tongue over them. The two weeks worth of filth and sweat had combined into some sort unholy abomination. Several times Harry dry retched and would have puked if he had anything of substance in his stomach. He licked up her soles, under the balls of her feet tasting the sour flavor of cheese and vinegar. It was made worse when Fleur decided to keep her toes on the foot that wasn't being licked over his nose so he had to sniff the atrocious smell even as he serviced her. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img2155.imagevenue.com/img.php?i\" target=\"_blank\">http://img2155.imagevenue.com/img.php?i</a> ... _481lo.jpg<br>\r\nPotter was giving the indent long licks and had to swallow every time to stop his mouth drying out. <br>\r\n\u2014 Rank... Harry muttered. Each lick filled his mouth with the foul taste of Fleur's foot sweat and quite a lot of dirt. He licked at the indent for fifteen minutes, not once did he forgot how awful it tasted. Finally Veela's soles were cleaned up and the time has come to move to her toes. <br>\r\nVeela spreaded her toes and for Harry it looked as though they have spanned the entire horizon in one spread. He gags at the odor and pales at the sight of the tiny particles of dirt in between her toes. <br>\r\n\u2014 Come on,'Aarry. Zose toes won't suck zemselves. <br>\r\nOf course they won't. Harry new that, but remembering the taste of Veela's toe cheese, he couldn't start licking by his own will. Though he knew, that there's no reason of him trying to fighti the spell, so he closed his watering eyes and opened his mouth... To give himself some time he started to suck on her toes and force his tongue under her toenails to get the trash that had been wedged up underneath there. Despite his vigorous cleaning efforts Veela's toes still smelled of funky cheese. Each was a wriggly wormy piece of filth that Harry wished not to see anymore. The smell and taste were abominable! Veela stuffs her toes right into hid mouth. The salty flavor of her foot sweat is disgusting as her toes wiggle on his tongue. Harry tried to think of something else as he was putting his tongue on the bottom side of her toes. The taste curdled it like sour milk. The cheesy and salty flavor of Fleur's dried foot sweat made him want to barf but he forced himself to continue. After five minutes struggling, Harry realized that the only thing that divides him from as he hoped freedom,  was a salty, sour, and sticky mixture between Fleur's toes. Veela curiously glanced at Harry's cringed face. <br>\r\n\u2014 Lick between each toe to get all of my slimy nauseous toejam chew and swallow it and zat would be enough of you for today. \u2014 She then flexed her toes making Harry sick because of the sight.<br>\r\nThe funk was particularly strong around there and Harry had to slide his tongue in between Veela's toes several times to finally remove all of the toe jam. It was like sucking on solid vinegar mixed in with death. He couldn't help but gaged and heard soft laughter from above him. His suffering was amusing to Fleur. After Harry's swallowed all the gunk and Veela's toes became virginally clean Fleur smiled and sweetly said: \"Now, I hope, you've learnt your lesson. If you have any claims, be brave enough to resolve ze conflict wiz ze person directly. And never include in your quarrel ozer people, especially ze innocent.\" <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/cVW55c\" target=\"_blank\">https://ibb.co/cVW55c</a> She then put on her shoe and was going to stand up. <br>\r\n\u2014 And, 'Arry, sometimes it's wors forgiving a person if he has wronged you and hurt you. Especially if he has realized his mistakes and asks you for forgiveness.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It doesn't have any feet stuff but sets up the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1996<br>\r\nRonald Weasley slumbered in the hospital bed, he was recovering from a unintentional poision attack when Harry took him to Slughorn for help with a love potion. Hermione was sat by his bedside, comforting his weakened and sleeping body. Lavender Brown suddenly burst through the doors and strutted over to Ron's bed. \"Oh, my Ron-Ron.\" she said, lovingly. Then she noticed Hermioen granger holding his hand, she gave her an evil stare. \"What are you doing here?' she said, coldly. Hermione stood up, \"I could ask you this same question.\"<br>\r\n    \"I happen to be his girlfriend.\" she said, defensively. Hermione looked nervously, \"I happen to be his ... Friend ...\" she said, unsettled. Lavender took a step further towards them, Ron started to slur; slowly awaking. \"Well,\" Lavender said, \"we'll see who ronny-kins wants with him.\"<br>\r\n    Ron began to slur gibberish only, though these slurs began to transform into more civilised sounds. His eyes lightly flickered, \"h ... Her ... Her ...\" there was afew minutes before each sound. Lavendar was already tearing up, \"Hermione.\" Ron finally slurred out. Lavender ran off in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Lavender ran to her common room and through to the girls dormitory. \"My little ron-Ron doesn't know what he's talking about, he loves me!\" Lavender looks down, a old book had been left on the floor. Lavender didn't really care about it at the moment but still decided to pick it up. It was an old potions book. She flickered through it, specifically looking for a love potion. To make her ronny-kins see sense, who he loved.<br>\r\n    She eventually found two interesting pages. A shrink potion- and the exact instructions for brewing the perfect love potion. Two separate plans began to form. To help her poor misguided Ron-ron </span></div></div>",
