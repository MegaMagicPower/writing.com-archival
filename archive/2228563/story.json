She had been sitting there waiting for one for about an hour, and was already beginning to lose her patience - she was so anxious to go out and fight crime, any call at all would be a welcome gift to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the thought crossed her mind that she had been waiting for a call for quite some time, the landline on her desk began ringing - she immediately picked it up and answered, \"Thank you for calling the DBA, Detective Booty Agency, how can I help you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice on the other end of the line paused before they replied, \"H-Hello, Ms. Daisy - I'm calling about a case regarding--\"</span></div></div>",

The voice was male, and sounded quite young. Booty suspected that he was a college student, living on his own, but decided to ask, just in case she was assuming things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, sir - can I have your name please?\" The voice on the phone was silent for a few moments, before he replied, \"I-It's Tom, miss - Tom Dempsy.\" Booty took out her notepad and laid it on the desk in front of her, and then proceeded to write down crucial info with her right hand, while still holding the phone in her left. After she wrote down Tom's full name, she continued, \"Well then, Tom, thanks for calling today - I gotta say, though, robbery's aren't really what I do. Isn't that more so an issue for the police to handle?\" Tom stammered back, \"W-Well, yes, but... Y-Y'see, this is different.\" Booty paused for a few seconds. What is with this guy? she thought. <i>He seems nervous - maybe I should try and calm him down, ask what's wrong.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tom, you doing alright?\" Booty asked with a concerned tone in her voice. \"Try to calm down - I promise, I'm just here to help you, so you don't have to be so nervous.\" Tom's voice fell silent again, and then he replied, \"I hope so, Ms. Daisy... I really hope so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Geez, this guy's kind of a downer,</i> Booty said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she continued, \"start from the beginning - what was stolen?\" Tom answered, \"It was a piece of jewelry - a necklace, with a ruby centerpiece, and pearls all around.\" Booty wrote down what Tom said before she asked, \"A ruby, huh? Sounds pretty fancy - that some sorta family heirloom?\" Tom answered, \"Yeah, you could say that...\" Booty wrote 'possibly a family heirloom' on her notepad, then asked, \"Any idea who would steal that from you? Anyone who knows where you live?\" Tom just sighed and replied, \"No, I have no idea - but, I have a bad feeling all the same. Like, someone <i>dangerous...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dangerous, huh?\" Booty replied. \"...Y'know, Tom, this <i>really</i> sounds like a job--\" Tom interrupted Booty and said, \"--for the police, I know I know... Sorry, I... I'm gonna tell you something very important, and you have to promise me that this'll only be between us.\" Booty paused, lost in thought. <i>He sounds pretty serious... why wouldn't he want to get the police involved, it's just a case of theft. Then again, maybe he's afraid the police won't help him?</i> After she gave it some more thought, Booty responded, \"OK, you have my word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Tom exclaimed. \"Great... that's great... <i>ahem,</i> OK, so... that necklace isn't <i>actually mine.</i>\" Booty raised her eyebrow. \"What do you mean by that, Tom? Is it your girlfriend's or something?\" Tom replied, \"No - it's not hers, and it's not mine... <i>I-I stole it...</i>\" Booty was about to write in her notepad, when she stopped, her fingers flinching slightly as they grasped the pencil in her hand. Both of her eyebrows shot up, and she yelled, \"What?! What do you mean you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Shhhhhhhhh</i>, shhshshshsh! Listen, lemme explain!\" Tom yelled back. \"I'm part of a gang, <i>the Ravens</i>, and I was told to go get this necklace for the boss - the necklace belongs to the head of GlobeTek, the international telecommunications firm.\" Booty couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"Wait, slow down Tom - you <i>stole</i> from a major corporation?!\" Tom sighed and replied, \"Yes, Ms. Daisy, I did - look, that's not the important part. What you need to know is that my ties to the Ravens prevent me from going to the police with this. Once I report this, and they start an investigation into a missing necklace that matches the description of the necklace that belongs to the CEO of GlobeTek, I'm screwed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then you shouldn't have <i>stolen</i> it, then, huh?\" Booty replied snarkily. Tom said exasperatedly, \"Yes, I know... I know. It was stupid, but I did it for a reason, alright? The ruby on that thing alone is worth a fortune, and can help me pay off the landlord and then some. I was gonna get evicted otherwise.\" Booty said, \"What about your--\" before Tom interrupted, \"I don't have any parents, Ms. Daisy... they died in a car accident a couple years ago, when I was 18. Since I'm a legal adult, and I don't have any other immediate family around here, I was forced to fend for myself - that's when the Ravens took me in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty just remained silent as Tom continued, \"So, I'm backed into a corner here, and I dunno where else to turn... that's when I saw your ad in the paper, and thought you could help me. Look, I know that I did was shitty, and once this whole thing blows over, I'm not gonna steal anything ever again, but I need this. I need you to find the guy who stole the necklace for me, whoever he is. I don't know who it could have been, but if I had to guess, it may be one of the other Ravens - maybe they heard I got the necklace, and came to get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they know where you live?\" Booty asked bluntly. Tom answered, \"No, not the members themselves - the <i>boss</i> knows, though. See, I was <i>supposed</i> to get the necklace for him, but I decided to keep it for myself, and pawn it off sometime soon - when I got to my apartment this morning after my walk, I saw that the door was busted open, and the necklace was missing. I dunno how, but maybe word got out, and the boss sent someone else to grab it.\" Booty put her pencil aside, then leaned on her desk on her right arm. \"Wouldn't he have paid you for getting him the necklace?\" Tom replied, \"You'd think that, but all he <i>really</i> would have done was just make sure I was still in the gang - that's what he does, he gives his boys just enough so that they can get by, but he makes them <i>need</i> him. That necklace was my way out, a fresh start.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty started getting lost in thought once more. <i>This is nuts! I can't believe that this guy is telling me all this! I can't believe... I can't believe that a case this big landed right in my lap!</i> Booty started smiling, as if the concern and worry from before washed away, and was instead replaced with excitement and awe. <i>This is HUGE - a stolen necklace that belongs to some big-shot company executive? A street gang with a leader who keeps his guys around by putting them under his thumb? And there's this guy, at the center of it all!?</i> Booty's smile shifted to a grin. <i>That necklace is the key to something, I can feel it in my gut! I find the guy who stole the necklace, then get him to tell me what his boss wants with it - once I know that, I should be able to bring him down! I'll be all over the papers: 'Detective Booty Stops Crime Boss!' That's sure to bring in more clients!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty stood up from her chair, her arm extended of the desk, and her palm pressed firmly on top. \"Mr. Dempsy, you got yourself the right girl for the job! Just give me your address, and I'll head right over to inspect your apartment!\" Tom was shocked. \"R-Really? Just like that?! Oh, thank you, you're a lifesaver! Here's my address...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Booty arrived at the apartment complex that Tom was staying at. She went to the receptionist in the main building, and asked her for directions towards Tom's apartment - once she got the room number, she proceeded towards her destination on foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way over to Tom's apartment, she came across--</span></div></div>",

The voice belonged to a woman, who sounded middle-aged. Booty stood up straight in her chair, and asked the woman, \"A kidnapping? Who's the victim, ma'am?\" The woman took a deep breath before continuing, \"It's my daughter - she's been taken away by... by my husband...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty paused for a moment, and then slowly slumped back down in her chair. \"Your... <i>husband?</i>\" she asked in an awkward, confused tone of voice. The woman replied, \"Yes, my husband! That bastard took her away from me, no doubt!\" Booty rolled her eyes and sighed, \"So, lady, you're telling me that your <i>husband</i> took your <i>daughter</i> somewhere? Sounds like they're just spending time together--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you listen here, young lady!\" the woman shouted, caused Booty to jump in her chair, and flinch away from the phone. The woman continued, \"He is my <i>EX-husband!</i> He and I got divorced a year ago now - he has no custody of my daughter, and that's final, so don't you go thinking I'm losing my mind over nothing!\" Booty slowly brought her ear closer to the phone and replied, \"OK, OK - sorry, geez! Look, I didn't mean to be quite that rude, I'm just confused - if what you're telling me is true, why not call Child Protective Services, or the police?\" A few moments of silence followed, as the woman was clearly trying to gather herself. \"I'm afraid of what he may do to her - he's never done anything like this before, and I'm worried that, if I send the police or the government after him, he'll get desperate, and... and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries - you don't have to say it. I get it,\" Booty assured. \"...Can I have your name, ma'am?\" The woman on the other end of the line took a deep breath, and responded, \"Yes, of course... my name is Helen Thompson.\" Booty took out her notepad and started writing down important information, all while asking Helen questions. \"Alright, Helen - what's your daughter's name?\" Helen answered, \"Her name is Vanessa.\" Booty was about to write that down in her notes, but stopped. <i>Vanessa, huh?</i> she thought to herself. <i>That's MY name...</i>  She paused for a moment, before snapping back to reality and continued asking Helen questions. \"And your ex-husband?\" There was a string of white noise that came from the phone, before Helen finally answered, \"His name is Richard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Helen - now, where was the last place you saw your daughter, and when was that?\" Booty asked directly. Helen replied, \"The last time I saw her, she was going to visit her friend at my neighbor's house - they live just down the street from our house, so I let her walk there on her own.\" Booty wrote that down in her notes. \"How old is Vanessa, exactly?\" Helen answered, \"She's... she's 10 years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Booty continued. \"So, what happened afterwards?\" Helen was struggling holding back tears, and Booty could tell by her voice. \"S-She never came back home, so I called the house and asked if she was there... t-they told me that she never even showed up at their front door.\" Booty stopped writing in her notes for a second, taken aback by that image. She kept silent for a moment, and then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Now, why do you think it's <i>Richard</i> exactly who took her?\" Helen took some time to breath heavily before responding, \"Honestly, I'm not sure who else it could be - he and I... we didn't leave on good terms, and I know that he was heartbroken by my taking full custody of Vanessa. He <i>loved</i> her, with all his heart... that kind of love makes you do stupid things...\" Booty continued writing down notes on her notepad, and said, \"Alright. I think that's all my questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you please help me?\" Helen asked in a sad, soft tone. Booty paused for a moment, then said back, \"I'll do what I can, Ms. Thompson, and tell you what I find.\" A large sigh came from the other end of the line, as a wave of relief rushed over Helen. \"Thank you, <i>thank you,</i> Ms. Daisy... I truly appreciate it, very much.\" Booty just sat in her chair and smiled meekly to herself. \"Of course, Helen - it's what I do. We can discuss payment afterwards - I'll start looking for Vanessa right away. I just need Richard's address, and I'll go see if she's there.\" \"Of course,\" Helen answered. She gave Booty the address, then he last thing she said before Booty hung up the phone was \"God Bless you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she hung up the phone, Booty gathered all her things, but slowly, as she was thinking about the weight of the task she just accepted. <i>Damn, Booty... what have you gotten yourself into this time? This job was supposed to be fun - catching bad guys, stopping criminals, that sorta thing... but this... this could very well be the most serious case I've taken yet. I'm not sure If I'm ready for this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Booty slowly drove her car up to the house with the address that Helen had given her over the phone, Booty said someone sitting on the porch, next to the front door.

Booty was surprised at just how young it sounded - to her, it sounded like a little kid. Slightly confused, Booty replied, \"I'm sorry, who is this?\" The voice answered back, \"Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't introduce myself - my name is Tanya Nelson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty's eyes widened at the sound of that name. <i>Tanya Nelson?</i> she thought. <i>Like, the child actor Tanya Nelson?</i> Booty asked, \"You mean you play Tootie on <i>It's Been a Gas!</i>, that TV sitcom?\" Tanya couldn't help but giggle. \"Yeah, that's me! I'm happy you watch the show, Ms. Daisy!\" Booty replied, \"Hey, who doesn't, right? Oh, and I gotta say, you do a great job!\" Even though Booty couldn't see it, Tanya was most definitely blushing at the compliment. \"Ohh, thank you! I'm glad you--\" she was interrupted by another voice that Booty could barely hear - sounded like a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry,\" Tanya said meekly, \"I got a little distracted - Ms. Daisy, I have a <i>big</i> problem, and I need your help!\" Booty sat up straight in her chair and grabbed the notepad on her desk with her free hand, and once she put it in front of her, then grabbed a pencil, ready to take notes. \"What can I do for you, Tanya?\" Booty replied in a confident tone. Tanya paused for a sec before saying, \"Well, I think someone is <i>pretending to be me</i>... I dunno who they are, but the producer says it's bad for business, and I need to get it sorted out as soon as possible.\" Booty started writing down notes and asked, \"So, why not go to the police?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tried,\" Tanya said, defeatedly. \"The police told us that there isn't enough to go on - we don't even know the imposter's name, and they look so much like me, that they think I'm just pulling their leg... Plus, the producer told me and my manager that it would be bad PR, and that it'd be best to have this situation handled privately, anyway.\" Booty wrote down more notes. \"Alright, so, when did you first hear about this imposter, Tanya?\" Tanya replied, \"Well, first, my manager told me that I couldn't schedule any interviews or public appearances without express permission by the show-runners - he told me that because he thought I did something I wasn't supposed to. When I told him that I didn't do it, he was confused, but then we all got over it and moved on... but then, one day, I saw someone pretending to be me on Saturday@Seven, y'know, that morning talk show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty stopped writing in her notes, and paused, thinking about Tanya just told her. \"Wait, I saw that interview... wasn't that the one where you farted really loudly, said your catchphrase, and made the whole audience cheer?\" Tanya giggled again, and replied, \"Yeah, that's the one!\" before the other voice said something to her that made her add, \"B-But that wasn't actually me! I'm not really that gassy in real life, honest - it's just sound effects!\" Booty held back and chuckle and went back to writing in her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this person looked like you?\" She asked. Tanya exclaimed, \"She did, she really did - it was actually kinda creepy. I swear, she looked exactly like me, too! She even kinda sounded like me - it's like she was a clone or something.\" Booty let out her chuckle and replied, \"Hey, OK, listen Tanya - honestly, what are the odds of that? Are you sure it isn't just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how it sounds, Ms. Daisy,\" Tanya interrupted. \"But, I <i>promise</i> you, I'm not making this up - I wouldn't do something like this just for fun. It's OK if you don't believe me, but all I want is for you to try and help me... please?\" Booty paused for a moment, taken aback by the sincerity in Tanya's voice. <i>Damn,</i> she thought. <i>Either she's a really good little actress... or maybe she's being totally serious, and there IS some person trying to be her... but, how is that possible?</i> Booty took a deep breath and asked, \"Alright, Tanya, let's say I do take this case - what if I can't find anything?\" Tanya replied, \"That's OK! We just ask that you--\" but before she could finish, the other voice came into sharper focus, and Booty could actually hear the phone being pulled out of Tanya's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can't find anything, then you won't get paid!\" Said the voice of a high-pitched man. \"Isn't that something you should know by now, <i>Miss Detective Booty</i>?\" Booty's brow furrowed, and she asked directly, \"Who is this?\" The high-pitched man responded, \"My name is Rick Coyote - I'm the executive producer for <i>It's Been a Gas!</i>, alright? Honestly, My name's all over every episode, ya think at least SOMEBODY would--\" Booty interrupted him by saying, \"Mr. Coyote, I was talking to Tanya, if you would please--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I ain't finished talkin,\" Coyote interjected. \"Listen, I'll make ya a deal - catch whoever's doing this, and I'll be sure to have you as a special guest star in the new episode of <i>It's Been a Gas!</i> What do ya say?\" Booty paused for a second and thought about Coyote's offer. <i>Wow... a special guest role in It's Been a Gas!? That'll do WONDERS for the agency! No better way to get my name out there than to be on the most popular sitcom there is!</i> Booty smiled to herself and replied, \"Alright, Mr. Coyote, you have a deal - where can I meet you and Tanya?\" Coyote laughed under his breath and replied, \"Great to hear that enthusiasm! Head on over to Perfect Pixtures Studios - that's where we film all the episodes of the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way!\" Booty exclaimed, before she hung up the phone, and rushed to gather all her things. Once she got everything she needed, she got in her car, and headed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at the front entrance to Perfect Pixtures, Booty was stopped by security, and asked to verify her ID. After she clarified that she was the private detective hired by Rick Coyote, the guard let her in, no more questions asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty found a parking space in the lot next to Studio D, which was labeled 'It's Been a Gas!' She determined that this was the studio that Rick Coyote was talking about on the phone. Alongside the wall of the studio, was a poster for the show, showing off the whole cast, with Tanya in the front, playing the role of Tootie, easily the show's most popular character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show was about a family who owned their own gas station/car wash on the outskirts of a small town - since they were located right on the highway going in and out of the town, they were a good pit stop for those on the road, whether they needed a refill on gasoline, their car cleaned, or a quick snack, the family was always there to help. Because of the nature of the show, each episode would focus on either the relationships between the characters, or some new character that happened to stumble into the gas station, usually a guest star meant to be in just that one episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the character that everyone watching grew to love was Tootie, the little girl who was friends with the family's daughter, as well as the gassiest character by far - she was essentially the poster child for the show, and at the end, without fail, the camera would focus on her as she would say \"It's been a gas!\" to end that week's episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Booty was reflecting on the show, daydreaming about how great it would be to be able to star in an episode herself, she snapped out of it, and realized that there was someone waiting for her outside her car.

Booty was initially confused, but decided to roll down her window and see what this woman had to say. \u201cHey, can I help you?\u201d Booty asked in a slightly confused tone. The woman replied, \u201cY-Yes, are you Detective Booty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty was slightly surprised to be called that - despite that being the name of her business, few people ever actually called her that, usually referring to her as either \u201cMs. Daisy,\u201d or just \u201cVanessa.\u201d Booty never paid it much mind before, since she just figured it was her clients being polite, but when she heard this girl call her Booty, it took her a bit off-guard.

One, I recognized you, from the papers. I\u2019ve actually been keeping up with what you\u2019ve done, and I think what you\u2019re doing is a great service.\u201d Booty was flattered, and also a little embarrassed. <i>Great service, huh?</i> She said to herself. <i>If it was really such a great service, why don\u2019t more people call me?</i> Luscious continued, \u201cAlso\u2026 Well\u2026 if you don\u2019t mind me asking, why are you here? Did something happen? Is there a case here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hey, slow down,\u201d Booty replied. \u201cFirst, I want you to answer my question - what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh, right. So, um...oh gosh\u2026sorry, I\u2019m just really-\u201d Luscious was interrupted by an unexpected outburst.<br>\r\n<b><i><br>\r\nBRRRRrrtttttt\u2026</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty\u2019s eyes widened slightly, then Luscious\u2019 face went cherry-red. \u201cE-Excuse me!\u201d She exclaimed, startled. \u201cI-I kinda get\u2026 g-gassy when I\u2019m nervous...\u201d  Booty chuckled to herself and said, \u201cHey it\u2019s no sweat - it\u2019s just gas, after all.\u201d Booty then looked down at Luscious\u2019 lower torso, only to notice that her hips were wider than she was expecting. It wasn\u2019t until then that Booty realized that Luscious had a rather large butt herself, which she wasn't expecting from such a meek girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuscious noticed Booty looking at her butt, and reflexively put her hands on it, as if to cover it up. Booty then responded by saying, \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to stare - still, that\u2019s an impressive derriere you got there.\u201d Luscious was still blushing. \u201cY-You think so?\u201d she asked in an honest tone. Booty just nodded and said, \u201cWell, yeah - listen, I like to think I know a thing or two about big butts, me being an expert and all.\u201d Luscious smiled and replied, \u201cWell, t-thank you, Detective,\u201d before moving her hands away from her rear end and twisting her hips in a way to sort of give Booty a better look at her posterior. \u201cPeople call me Tush because of it - I think it\u2019s a little embarrassing myself, but, I\u2019ve gotten used to it.\u201d Booty couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cTush, huh? Hey, that\u2019s not bad! I like it.\u201d Luscious was surprised, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Booty said, \u201cwhat were you saying?\u201d Luscious immediately stopped smiling and started thinking about what she was going to say next.  After a few seconds, she said, \u201cI was wondering if I could\u2026help.\u201d  Booty was a little confused by that answer. She thought about it for a moment, since this was the first time someone volunteered like this. \u201cLike, help how?\u201d Booty clarified.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I just feel like I could be a big help,\u201d Luscious said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as big as that caboose you have there,\u201d Booty said jokingly. Luscious was less amused. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Detective - I want to help you in any way I can! If you\u2019re here, then\u2026 something serious is going on, right?\u201d Booty\u2019s smirk slowly faded to a more serious expression. Huh, she thought, this girl seems pretty set on this. But, I fly solo - that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been. Booty was about to speak up, when Luscious said, \u201cI could be a witness, after all!\u201d Once she said that, Booty let out a small sigh and thought, <i>Shoot, I didn\u2019t think of that. Well, she\u2019s got a point.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty chuckled. \u201cWell, you\u2019re certainly an open book, aren\u2019t ya? You blurt out what you\u2019re thinking like that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, I just try to not keep secrets...\u201d Luscious said with an honest smile. \u201cSo, please Detective - what\u2019s going on exactly?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a deep breath, Booty started her explanation. \u201cWell, you know the little actress? Tanya Nelson, the one who plays Tootie?\u201d Luscious exclaimed, \u201cYes, of course! I\u2019m a big fan of the series!\u201d Booty continued, \u201cWell, she said someone who looks just like her is potentially impersonating her, and she\u2019s been making public appearances.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Someone\u2019s been taking her place?\u201d Luscious said nervously, with her hands to her cheeks. Booty nodded and replied, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what it sounds like - I don\u2019t like it either, but there\u2019s no way to be sure until I do some digging.\u201d Luscious stood there silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty then turned to face Luscious and asked, \u201cSo, what did you--\u201d Just then, the detective\u2019s stomach made a pronounced gurgling sound. She was getting hungry. Almost as if it were on cue, Luscious\u2019 stomach did the same. Booty chuckled, and said, \u201cTell you what, we\u2019ll talk about what you know over some food.\u201d Luscious was taken aback some, and asked, \u201cReally? You mean that?\u201d Booty nodded, and motioned for Luscious to go around her car, and into the empty passenger seat next to her. \u201cGood work can\u2019t be done on an empty stomach, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, where should we go?\u201d Luscious asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see,\u201d Booty replied. Where to eat was always a big decision for her, so she always gave it some thought, though, she usually always went with junk food, since she loved it since she was a kid. She went over her favorite fast food places, and any nearby gas stations or vending machines, just so she wouldn\u2019t get too far away from the Studio, but also could get something nice and filling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter careful consideration, Booty decided on--<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The voice was a deep, male voice, speaking in a direct tone. Booty's eyes positively lit up at the mention of the word 'homicide,' as images of badass detectives taking down evil murderers flashed in her head. <i>YES, a homicide! </i>she thought to herself. <i>I've wanted a homicide case for soooo looooong - this is it, my chance to prove that I can take down anybody, even cold-blooded killers!</i> A moment passed before she heard the voice on the phone say, \"Uh, Ms. Daisy? Are you there?\" After snapping back to reality, Booty answered, \"Y-Yes, I'm here! Sorry, I was just thinking about something else - how can I help you, Mr...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Terrence McKinley - <i>Officer</i> Terrence McKinley,\" said the man on the other end of the line. Booty's eyebrows shot up. \"Wait, <i>officer?</i> ...Why are you calling me about a homicide case exactly, Officer McKinley?\" There was a pause before McKinley answered, \"First, I'd like to know for the sake of clarity that you are who you say you are, Ms. Daisy - then, I'll tell you who I am, and why I'm calling you.\" Booty replied, \"Uhm, alright, I guess - yes, I am Vanessa Daisy, but you can call me Detective Booty. I'm a private eye who helps clients with whatever they need solving.\" Booty heard a muffled chuckle from the phone. \"OK, and you <i>really</i> own a business called the <i>Detective Booty Agency?</i> That isn't a joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not a joke,\" Booty replied quietly. More muffled chuckling came from the phone, and then McKinley replied, \"Good God, what have I gotten myself into...\" Booty just waited for him to continue. \"Alright, Ms. Daisy - I believe you, as ridiculous as it sounds.\" Booty couldn't help but think, <i>Ridiculous? What, he laughing at my nickname? ... I mean, I guess it is kinda weird hearing for the first time. Whatever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I'm an officer working for the Police Department - I'm calling because I would like to ask for your assistance in finding and apprehending the one who murdered Timothy Roth.\" Booty glanced over at the newspaper lying on her desk, and noticed that the front page had that same name right in the headline. \"The same Roth from the newspapers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very same,\" McKinley replied. \"Normally, this would remain a strictly police issue, but the chief suspects that this is something bigger - if you ask me, personally I think the old man is just being paranoid. Anyway, Officer Burkowitz mentioned your name - said you were a private detective, and that you were good at what you do, and the chief asked me to ask you to help us. He'd call you himself, but he's got other stuff on his plate.\" Booty thought about Roy Burkowitz - he was a close friend of hers, and was a good, honest cop. It flattered her that he would think to recommend her to help with an official police investigation. McKinley continued, \"I'm starting to have my doubts, though.\" Booty replied, \"What's that supposed to mean, officer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb with me, Ms. Daisy - Seriously? The <i>Detective Booty Agency?</i> And you really call yourself that, huh? I'm starting to think Burkowitz was just yanking our chain, because if he <i>seriously</i> thinks some young broad with a big ass can help us with a <i>serious</i> investigation, he's crazier than he looks.\" Booty couldn't help but puff her cheeks. \"<i>Excuse me,</i> Officer McKinley, but I'll have you know that I'm more reputable than I may sound. I've solved dozens of cases, all on my own.\" McKinley just laughed. \"Oh yeah, I'm sure ya have - I bet you've helped plenty of people with their lost pets and missing clothes. Be real with me, Daisy, have you ever been involved in a murder case whatsoever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty paused for a minute. <i>I mean, not really, no,</i> she thought. <i>But, hey, first time for everything!</i> Booty answered, \"No, but I can hold my own just fine - I may not sound like it, Officer, but I take my job seriously, and if Roy says that you can trust me, then he's telling you the truth.\" There was a moment of silence between the both of them, before McKinley answered, \"We'll see about that - come to the Department in an hour, we'll brief you on the case when you get here.\" Without another word, McKinley hung up the phone on Booty. After she heard the click and the humming from the phone line, she hung up as well, then crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerk,\" she said to herself out loud. \"So what, I'm not at all ashamed of my butt - I think my butt is awesome!\" She paused and then laughed to herself. \"Little does <i>he</i> know, girls with big butts happen to be <i>super</i> smart - I'll show him I can handle this case!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty arrived at the Police Department about ten minutes early, and sat in her car, lost in her thoughts. She thought about how she was going to be working with the police on this case, and what that could mean for her - normally, Booty preferred to work alone, as the image of a lone detective sounded cool in her head. But, the more she thought about it, the more she saw it as an opportunity. <i>After this,</i> she thought, <i>my agency is gonna be rolling in clients! I'll be taken way more seriously after this - 'the young woman who helped the police solve the murder of Timothy Roth,' they'll say.</i> She then thought about the case itself, as her mind raced with what could happen. <i>Maybe Roth was involved in some sort of conspiracy, and he had to be silenced by a member of some gang? Or, maybe he was actually supposed to be the murderer, but died in a case of self-defense by his would-be victim! Maybe--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty's train of thought was interrupted by a tapping on her window. She turned to see who it was outside her car door, and saw that it was--</span></div></div>",

The voice was female, and she spoke with a nervous tone, almost as if she wasn't sure if she was supposed to be telling Booty any of this information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty's eyes widened slightly at the sound of 'drugs,' and began asking the woman on the phone questions about specifics regarding the case. \"I see, ma'am - before I can help you, can I ask you for your name?\" The woman replied, \"Yes, of course - my name is Vivian Markham.\" Booty leaned the phone up against her ear, holding it in place between her cheek and her shoulder, so she could grab the notepad sitting on her desk and start writing down what Vivian was telling her. \"Alright, Mrs. Markham,\" Booty continued, \"does this case concern you or someone else you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about my son, Trevor - he's 21 years old, tall, dark black hair. Last night, he went out with some of his friends to go see a movie - his friends said that he went to go use the bathroom during the show, but he never came back. One of his friends went to go looking for him, and he wasn't even there in the bathroom anymore.\" Booty finished writing down what she felt was the most important details of what Vivian said, before she asked, \"Mrs. Markham, what makes you think this is a narcotics case, and not a missing person's case, if you don't mind me asking?\" Vivian continued, \"Well, that's because we did find him - <i>eventually,</i> anyway. After his friends realized he was gone, they left the theater and started looking. His car was still right where he parked it, so they figured they could find him on foot no problem - about ten minutes later, they found him wandering aimlessly up the sidewalk a few blocks down from the theater, mumbling to himself. Once they caught up to him, they did what they could to try and get him back to his sense before they called an ambulance - he was sweating all over, his eyes were dilated, and he was acting deliriously, so they felt it was best. Afterwards, his friends called me, and told me what happened, and i went straight to the hospital as soon as I heard... I'm home now, though, since the doctors told me it'd be best for him to get his rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your son, with you now, or is he still at the hospital?\" Booty asked. Vivian replied, \"No no, he's still at the hospital - the doctors are getting all that junk out of his system, but it's taking time for him to recover - whatever he had given to him messed him up real bad...\" Booty paused before she continued questioning, \"Does Trevor have any prior history with drug use, ma'am?\" Almost immediately, Vivian exclaimed, \"No! Absolutely not! My son is nothing like that, whatsoever!\" Booty asked, \"What about his friends?\" Vivian calmed down some before answering, \"Well, I don't know about his friends - they certainly don't strike me as the type to do that sorta thing, and they never talk about it. Besides, they all swear up and down that they didn't give him anything, and they don't know who would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty continued writing down in her notes. \"Alright, Mrs. Markham, sounds like a case - one last question though, if you don't mind.\" Vivian replied, \"Of course.\" Booty paused, and the asked, \"Why call me, and not the police?\" Vivian paused for a few seconds before replying, \"No offense, Ms. Daisy, but I <i>would</i> have called the police and let <i>them</i> handle it... but, one of Trevor's friends said that you'd be much better for the job, and Trevor agreed. He personally asked me to call you on your behalf before I was asked to leave the hospital and go home - I was hoping you and I could meet at the hospital about an hour to see Trevor. That way, you can ask him whatever questions you need to.\" Booty smirked to herself, and answered, \"Of course, Mrs. Markham - trust me, you won't regret this. I'm just the person for this job, and I promise you I'll get to the bottom of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope so,\" Vivian replied. \"We can discuss the other details, such as your payment and so on once you get here.\" Booty replied, \"Thank you for calling, Mrs. Markham - I'll be right over!\" and then hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooty arrived about ten minutes early, since she was anxious to get started. <i>This is it,</i> she thought, <i>a narcotics case! I bet this is gonna end up being the first step to squashing some drug trafficking ring. Or, maybe it's some new, mysterious street drug that's being distributed by a shady dealer. Or MAYBE Trevor's doctor gave him the wrong medication on purpose!</i> Booty was a huge fan of crime novels, and whenever she got a new case, her mind raced with the possibilities of what may happen, as if she was trying to guess the ending before it even started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but get giddy at any of those prospects - catching bad guys was her passion, ever since she was a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting the car and thinking about the case for a few minutes, Booty took a deep breath and exhaled. <i>Alright, Vanessa, you got this - try not to hype yourself up too much. Who knows, this could be something totally cut and dry, we'll see. I should go meet up with Mrs. Markham now.</i> Booty stepped out of her car, closed the driver's side door, and then locked it before going towards the entrance to the hospital.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">20-year-old Vanessa Daisy is a local private eye, though she's known instead for her alias - Detective Booty. She gets her name from her rather large rear end, something she herself is rather proud of. However, despite her fiery passion for solving crime and catching bad guys, she's not the best at her job - she's clumsy, and because she works alone most of the time, nobody has her back while she's on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, what gives her an edge is her powerful butt - for some strange, unknown reason, Booty's ass possesses some abilities that prove more advantageous than not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Booty's powers include:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Incredibly Bouncy:</b> Due to her butt's roundness, things bounce off of it rather easily. This allows her to use it for a variety of scenarios, such as knocking away objects thrown at her, knocking down assailants by ramming her butt into them, and breaking her fall by using her butt as a sort of cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Powerful Clench:</b> Booty possesses full control of her butt muscles, allowing her to use her butt cheeks to grab and hold onto ropes, as well as other things. However, she cannot manipulate complex machinery, or use firearms - any weapons she can use with her butt only includes simple, blunt instruments, or if the situation calls for it, even a knife or sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Strong Flatulence:</b> While it true that Booty's natural gas comes from her stomach, the large size of her butt increases the power of her farts significantly. Booty's control of her flatulence varies wildly, especially given what she eats and how much of it she eats at one time, but about half of the time, Booty can pass gas on command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed with a clever mind, sharp wit, and an odd derriere, Vanessa Daisy is determined to fight crime wherever it appears, no matter how big or small - and with your help, she can hopefully put another case under her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WARNING: Anyone who who would want to participate and add chapters, bear in mind the 13+ Age Rating - this is there, because the content of this story is not meant to be explicit in nature.
