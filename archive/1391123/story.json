I am well- endowed and know how to use the equipment that God gave me.  We will have at least one orgasm together before I allow her one or two more.   We will lay together and cuddle and then she and I will kiss and make another appointment.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This story line will take place in the anime Rosario + Vampire where monsters try to act like humans so they can both live in the same world together. All of the characters of that anime are most likely going to interact with you but its all up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Description about you</u> (Or you can make up your own character<br>\r\nYou are a God/Demon Lord thought to be dead as it was written in the history books. You were sent to this school by your own choice so you could learn what its like to go to school with monsters. Since you had all the powers a normal god had so you could morph into anyform you want and gain anypowers. You are like Moka and her vampire form but you have 3 different sides to you (Normal, God, Demon) that you can control plus sometimes you can Possess all 3 of them at once. From previous knowledge you don't have any bright point of view of monsters and humans because you both think that they are idiot species that live in this world but that all changes when you meet new friends at Yokai Acadamy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Your part in history</u><br>\r\nYou played a major roll in history that deals with the war between gods and demons but not many people even know about this and even believe it to be true. The only reason why you are half god and half demon is because you ended the war between the two great beings by creating a barrier between the two but the cost was that you had to become half god and half demon which made you like a key if anyone were to break the barrier. This mean't if anyone wanted to break the seal they would need you to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Life after the war</u> (This explains why you hate humans and monsters)<br>\r\nAfter the great war two new species were created by both gods and demons two maintain balance in the world which they created both human and monsters. Humans were made by the hands of gods and monsters were made by the hands of demons. This was the one wish you gave to both of the great beings. Since you were the one to create the barrier you were the only god/demon that was able to rome the earth. But after watching the humans and monsters live with each other you were disgusted by how they treated each other and left them to handle there problems on there own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Now</u><br>\r\nIt's been 2000 years since you've seen any humans or monsters since you spent those years alone and away from humans and monsters. When you came back there was a seperation between the two kinds. You then discovered the schooling that they have created and decided to go to Yokai Acadamey a school for monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>More Information about your forms</u><br>\r\n<b>Normal</b>: This is form was made to keep your powers as a Demon lord and God hidden from anyone. <br>\r\n<b>God</b>: Has more of a bright and wiser side unlike your Demon form you aren't as destructive and you like to be more assertive. But if needed you will show his wrath to put everything back in its place.<br>\r\n<b>Demon</b>: Not very bright and can be very intimidating like Moka's vampire form. When fighting you will be more destructive and like to be more aggresive. But you can control your temper and you are also still wise in your Demon form.<br>\r\n<b>God and Demon</b>: Everything from you God form and Demon form balances out with you having the powers of the Demon and God.</span></div></div>",

Then the bus began moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you look a little short to be a 1st year\" he said look at you through a mirror. \"Correct, its because I was able to skip middle school and they allowed me to come here\" you said. \"So you must be one of those smart kids\" he asked. \"I'm not to sure sir\" you said. \"Well ok then. Anyway just call me bus driver, sir sounds a way above my pay roll\" he said. \"Ok bus driver\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you guys passed through the tunnel you say a whole bunch of dead trees and a look out on to the ocean. \"Ok were here\" he said opening the doors. \"Oh, thank you sir- I mean bus driver\" you said walking off the bus. \"Well you be safe now going to this school\" he said. \"Well what do you mean\" you asked. \"Lets just say its not exactly normal, anyway I guess this is good bye for now\" he responded. \"Yes farwell\" you said then the door closed and the bus left. \"I guess I follow the pathway to the school then\" you said then you made your way to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reached the school you went straight to the Administrators office.

Anyways, can I ask you a question\" you said. \"Of course, what is it\" she asked. \"Well I have no idea where I'm going. Do you know were I must be right now\" you asked. \"First you need to go to your dorm which is right here on the map and we are currently right here\" she said showing you the map of the school layout. \"Thank you ma'am\" you said. \"Oh please call me nekonome sensei\" she said. \"Ok nekonome sensei\" you responded. \"Haha, anyways today there are no classes going on, so I'd suggest you try getting familiar with the students and the school itself\" she said. \"Ok thank you Nekonome sensei\" you said then left the room with a map of the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking through the hallway near the class.

Before you came into the human world you read how to be respectful to humans and mosters so you didn't get in to a battle with them. \"It is but were friends right. And friends don't always need to bow each other\" he said. \"Friends\" you mubbled in a confused tone. \"Oh what was that\" he asked. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH HEY TSUKUNE\" you heard a girl yell then you saw </span></div></div>",

I believe everything on my check list has been checked oh wait one more place\" you said. \"Oh ok what is it\" Moka asked. \"My classroom is the last place\" you said. \"Oh ok lets get a move on then\" Kurumu said. \"Ok but first, what class is it Kamutori\" Tsukune asked. \"Oh its was this one right here\" you pointed on the map. \"Well, heres the way\" Tsukune said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you all reached the classroom. \"Oh wow you have the same classroom as me, Moka, and Kurumu\" Tsukune said. \"Oh thats great, at least there some people I know in my classroom then\" you said. \"Thats strange how are you in our class weren't you a first year\" Moka said. \"Correct, but wait how is that strange\" you asked. \"Well your a first year and its all of our second year at the academy, they usally have  students in different levels in different class rooms\" Moka explained. \"Wait, all of you are my upper classmen\" you asked. \"Thats right me too\" Yukari said. *If I learned name titles correctly then aren' upperclass men called-* you thought to yourself then said \"Wait if you are all my upperclass men then I must call you Senpai\" you said. \"WAIT WHAT WE DIDN'T TEACH YOU ANYTHING\" Tsukune said freaking out. \"YEA WE JUST SHOWED YOU AROUND THE SCHOOL YOU DON'T NEED TO CONSIDER YOURSELF A STUDENT OF US\" Moka said. \"Yes, but if your my upperclass men I will have to or else-\" you said then the thought of war came to your head. You remembered some battle from gods and demons came from one wanting respect. \"No I have to, I don't want that happening again\" you said. \"Wait what happening again\" Kurumu asked. \"Oh its nothing sorry Kurumu-Senpai\" you said bowing. \"Wait what\" Kurumu said. \"Kamutori you don't need to call us Senpai\" Moka said. \"Yea Kamutori its ok just call us by our first name\" Yukari added. \"Please, Moka-Senpai and Yukari-Senpai allow me to do this for my sake\" you said then bowing to both of them. \"Sake of what\" Tsukune asked. \"I very sorry prefer not to say sorry Tsukune-Senpai\" you said then bowing to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOSH\" they all said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of the guys were about to attack Yukari and you knew you had to do something this. \"HEY BACK AWAY FROM HER\" you yelled at them. \"Oh great it's the same guy from earilier\" the guy black haired guy commented. \"Quick Kamutori get help you can't take them on by yourself they're both warewolfs, which is S-ranked monster\" Yukari yelled. \"There's no time\" you said stepping forward. \"Ha, does this guy really think he can take on two S-ranked monsters, how pathetic\" the brown haired guy said. \"Lets just finish him now why don't we\" the black haired guy siad then they both took a step forward then...</span></div></div>",

When you turned around you saw Tsukune, Moka, Kurumu, and Mizore running toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you all doing here\" you asked them. \"We saw Yukari being chased and you running after her, so we knew something was up and came here to help\" Kurumu said. \"So where did this wall come from\" you asked. \"That was me\" Mizore said. \"Well I must thank you for helping, however I don't know how this will make anything better\" you said. \"Why\" Moka asked. \"I've heard from Yukari that there both warewolfs\" you answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT BOTH S RANKED SUPER BEAST\" Kurumu yelled. \"HEY WHATS GOING ON\" one of the warewolf guys yelled. The ice wall turned into spears and were thrown at the 2 warewolf guys. \"WERE HERE TO GET OUR FRIEND BACK. Don't worry we can take them on, right guys. Tsukune if you can\" Moka said walking up to Tsukune. \"Yea, no problem\" Tsukune said then pulled off Moka's necklace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Moka's form change right before your eyes. Her hair turned white and her body seemed a little bit more muscular. \"What's this\" you said. \"This is Moka's vampire form\" Mizore answered. \"Isn't that also considered an S ranked super beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me start this off\" Moka said walking up to the two warewolfs. \"Can we get this over with quickly so we can get our friend back\" Moka asked the two guys. \"If you want then you'll have to get through us\" one of them said. \"Very well\" she said then ran toward both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst attacking the warewolf who looked like the brown haired guy. She was able to successfully kick down on his head. \"WHY YOU\" he said then attempted to grab her. Moka then, jumped on his head to dodge his attemped, but the other guy hit Moka fast and made her hit a tree. \"MOKA\" Kurumu said flying toward the warewolfs and Mizore joined her by creating ice spears come out of no wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, their attacks were also unsuccessful. \"You think you got, well not yet. Its time for you to know your place\" Moka said getting up knocking one of the warewolfs off their feet then punching the other. Kurumu quickly got up and cut the rope wrapping Yukari to the tree. \"Hey they freed Yukari-Senpai\" you cheered from the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice I think were done here\" Kurumu said. \"HAHAHA\" the two warewolfs laughed getting back up. \"Do you feel that man\" one of them said. \"Yup, this power\" the other one said. \"OH NO\" Yukari said. \"Its a full moon tonight\" Mizore said then everyone looked up to see a huge full moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon guys lets finish this\" Moka said charging at them. She attempted to hit one of them, but he quickly dodged her and the other one punched Moka so hard she slammed and made a whole in the ground. \"HOW DARE YOU HURT MY FRIEND\" Kurumu said flying them. But one of them quickly grabed her neck and rasied her in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT SO FAST\" Yukari said about to swing her wand. Then the other warewolf came behind her and broke her wand. Following by throwig her against a tree, then went to attack Mizore, but she blocked with her ice. Sadly it didn't work because he broke through it then grabbed her neck as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the warewolfs then tossed both Kurumu and Mizore aside. \"Now its time to finish you two off\" they said running toward you and Tsukune. \"RUN KAMUTORI\" Tsukune said. \"WHAT\" you yelled freezing up. You saw Tsukune open his arms as if he was going to protect you. \"What do you think your doing that won't make a difference, you'll just get hurt\" you said. \"Don't worry it'll give you enough time\" he said sounding desperate in your ears. \"YOU FOOL\" you yelled a change came intot he tone in your voice. You could feel the demon part of yourself coming out. \"Kamutori-\" he said, but getting cut off by one of the warewolfs pushing him to the side making him hit a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn\" one of them said grabbing you then throwing you hard in a different direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe throw was so hard it made you crash through the forest at least a few yards down from where every on else was. \"Nice throw, that probably killed him\" the blacked haired warewolf said. \"Thanks\" the other added. \"KAMUTORI\" Moka, Kurumu, Mizore, and Tsukune yelled. \"Don't bother he's gone\" the brown haired warewolf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you began to feel yourself turn into your<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
