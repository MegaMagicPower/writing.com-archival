Well, now you have that opportunity!<br>\r\nThis will is an interactive game where you decide what happens next in the world of Naruto.<br>\r\nNow, just to be clear, I have layed down a set of rules and guidelines that must be followed, and I will be very strict about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsolutely no explicit (adult) content (i.e. sex, nudity, bondage, etc.). Only softcore is allowed in this field (i.e. characters wrapped in a towl)<br>\r\nYou can choose whatever character from the show to be your main character.<br>\r\nYou can make your own character, but they must be a ninja (you can make them any skill level you want).<br>\r\nIf you choose to, you can use characters from other anime or a video game. If so, that character must be able to fight.<br>\r\nYour chosen can either be good or evil; I don't care which.<br>\r\nBattles are encouraged, so don't be shy. (Just make sure you make it interesting. I don't want see 'I win and you lose' -none of that. I want badass.)<br>\r\nOnly mild vulgarity language-wise is allowed.<br>\r\nIf you choose to have a character die in your chapters, try to keep the gore level to a minimum.<br>\r\nNo less than 10 sentences to a chapter (I will delete if I see this- like I said: strict) However, there is no maximum sentence limit, but you must make it interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not permitted to force the reader to go only one unless absolutely essential. Period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any questions on any of these rules, just messege me, and I'll answer them as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat about wraps it up. So be creative, have fun, and show me your ability.</td>",
