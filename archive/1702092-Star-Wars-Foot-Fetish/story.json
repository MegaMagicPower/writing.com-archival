As predicted, she unwillingly obeyed your orders, rapidly walking her way towards your private quarters. You stood in place for some moments, enjoying your achievement; you could already feel the heat of her feet in your fingers while you massaged her perfect soles in your mind. However, you couldn't just imagined it, your wishes impelled you to act in reality, so you head back to your quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you opened the door of your room, Zena was sitting in the bed, staring at her hands with a vaguely blank expression in her eyes. You once more waved your hand and, this time, instead of releasing the order out loud, you recited it inside your mind. As she could not resist your advanced mind skills, Zena lean over the bed's pillows, putting her boots over the bed, completely at your disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fun just began\" you thought, showing wide smile in your face. Your eyes rushed towards her brown-colored boots and your hands instinctively removed the right boot. Your hands passed over her sock, pulling it at once and throwing it across the air to a corner of the room. The sock's removal revealed a beautiful pink-colored, medium-size foot. As you slowly rubbed the surface of her sole, you could feel the heat emanated by them. Continuing to massage Zena's perfect foot, you could not found a single imperfection. It was perfect, like the feet of a goddess, awaiting to be worshiped. You kept massaging and rubbing her foot against your hands and fingers, feeling the intense heat, the <i>perfection </i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes passed, and you could not tell how many time did you rubbed Zena's right foot with all your love. Eventually, your eyes dropped over her left foot, in which your repeated the same process of removing the boot and socks, showing off her equally beautiful foot. You once more massaged her foot, her perfect, beautiful, smelly soles which had hypnotized you with their beauty. You couldn't think about anything else but rubbing them. Massaging them. You had to massage them! Even though <i>she</i> was the one being controlled, you had to worship her. Her and only her. She was your goddess and <i>you</i> had to satisfy her. And so, you suddenly left the process of massaging her mesmerizing soles. It was like something struck you out of nowhere, prompting you to...    </span></div></div>",

Your skills with the force and the lightsaber were praised by your instructors...that is when they weren't scolding you for being vain and greedy. As you grew older you became more and more irritated with the lifestyle of the Jedi and realized it was impossible for you to follow, so you escaped from the Jedi Order. After that, you came into contact with a Sith Lord who offered to teach you the ways of the Dark Side of the force, you accepted, believing that being a Sith would give you limitless freedom...but again like the Jedi the Sith had a ridiculous lifestyle that you loathed. Things like love, compassion, or mercy were looked down upon by the Sith who opted to instead act like stereotypical card carrying villains. When you were still with the Jedi Order you almost didn't believe how cliche the Sith were and just believed that the Jedi were exaggerating...oh how wrong you were. However, you endured the absurdity of the Sith lifestyle to learn certain skills from your master, who you later killed with a thermal detonator when he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you live your life how you want to, with no ancient and absurd doctrine dictating your every move. But now, something may threaten your lifestyle. You have sensed an incredibly powerful Sith in the Galaxy, a man who you discovered was called Darth Tyranus. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, you'd just avoid him but the problem is that Tyranus is the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and may very well change the face of the galaxy. You liked the way things are now, the Republic is corrupt and incompetent which allows you to steal easily, and the Jedi are too full of themselves and foolish to catch you. Tyranus was up to something, and you wanted to put a stop to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou learned that apparently Tyranus had ordered the death of some senator from Naboo who was an outspoken critic of the Military Creation Act, you didn't really care much for Republic politics but you did your best to ensure the Senator survived. You discovered a bomb had been placed in a landing pad where the Senator's shuttle would have landed and passed this information on to the authorities who quickly disarmed the bomb and foiled the assassination attempt but you knew this assassin would try again. You grabbed your speeder bike and waited outside the Senator's apartment. Sure enough, a droid went to the Senator's window and deposited what looked like kouhuns inside the Senator's room. You sped towards the Senator to save her but were surprised to see Jedi barging into the room, one of the Jedi killed the bugs while another spoofed the droid and was about to jump to catch it before it went back to its owner. You didn't need Jedi interfering with your plan so you force pushed this meddlesome jedi back into the room and followed the droid alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you soon discovered the droid's owner, a female in a purple bodysuit. She quickly spots you and grabs a sniper rifle from her speeder and fires a few shots at you, you easily deflected her blasts and one of them even destroyed her droid. The assassin was clearly panicking now, she put her rifle back into her speeder and drives off. You give chase, you had to know who she was and what she knew. The assassin pulls out her blaster pistol and begins firing at you, you easily deflect her shots and began closing in on her. You could sense her fear growing, but you didn't need the force to know that. Her driving became erratic and she began firing faster and with less accuracy. You realized that if you kept this up she would crash and probably wind up dead, you slowed down a little while deflecting more of her shots. The assassin then dove and turned sharply to the left and out of sight. But you still sensed her and followed her without being seen, you could sense the assassin was calming down, she probably thought she had eluded you. You kept your distance from the assassin's speeder and then saw her land, the assassin stepped out and removed the veil from her face and then entered what looked like a night club. You land your speeder bike close to the club and enter, despite the large crowd you easily sensed your prey and closed in. You saw the assassin at the bar picking up a shot with shaky hands and quickly gulping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned around to see you standing right behind her, her eyes widened and her mouth opened as if she were silently screaming. She reached for her blaster but you used the force to take it from her and then flung her across the room, she hit the wall with a loud thud and laid on the floor unconscious. You see the other bar patrons staring at you, you had to think of something quickly. You could claim you're a Jedi, after all these idiots probably couldn't tell the difference between a Sith and a Jedi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, this is jedi business.\" You pick up the injured assassin with no trouble from the bar patrons who were either too scared to oppose you or bought your lie. You carry the assassin to a back alley and lay her against a wall, she was still out cold and you took this time to examine her body. You noticed that she was barefoot and only wore toe rings and an anklet on her feet. You examined the jewelry pieces and found symbols on them, symbols you recognized as Mabari symbols. This woman was a Mabari warrior, she may be of some use to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to wake her up to interrogate her, you pull out some smelling salts from your bag and put them under her nose. She begins to stir, and her eyes open but she begins groaning in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good you're awake. What do they call you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you with fear but she answered your question. \"Zam...Zam Wesell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice name, now Zam let's get down to business. Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?\" You begin the interrogation immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunts but begins answer. \"It was the senator from Naboo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who hired you?\" You wanted to confirm your suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just a job...\" She winced and moaned in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, her wounds weren't even that bad. \"Here, this will help with the pain.\" You placed your hand on her chest and used the force to dull the pain in Zam's body and also start to hypnotize her. Zam's breathing became shallower and her eyes became glazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, tell me who hired you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it was a bounty hunt-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sensed something. \"Hold that thought.\" You immediately use the force to stop a projectile from hitting Zam's neck. Zam looked in shock and awe, you looked up to see an armored figure staring at you before flying off. You examined the dart but then placed it in your sack for study or later use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying?\" You looked back at Zam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...it was a bounty hunter called Jango Fett that hired me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bounty hunter hired you to kill a senator?\" This didn't seem right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sub-contracted me...but I guess the person who really wanted to kill the senator was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyranus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not important, do you know why he wanted the senator dead? She's a critic of the Military Creation Act and I doubt Tyranus wants the Republic to have an army to threaten his Confederacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...I'm just a bounty hunter, I don't care too much about politics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, Zam didn't know much but she may still be useful to you. Now what were you to do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two of you were hunting a smuggler who had arrived on Coruscant to receive a shipment of Death Sticks, the hunt went well and the Galaxy had one less smuggler in it. Still, you wondered why you were still on Coruscant even though you had completed the hunt. You assumed that Zam had other business here but you haven't seen her mention anything of the sort. Still, you didn't complain. The hotel you and Zam were staying in was more comfortable than what you were normally used to, but you feared that such luxury would dull your skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you looked out the hotel window at Coruscant's afternoon sky, suddenly you hear the doorbell ring. You and Zam weren't expecting anyone, you carefully make your approach to the door with your hand hovering over your blaster holster. You press the button and the doors slide open, before you stands a woman in a blue bodysuit that covered her body from neck to ankle, she wore no boots but had a breastplate and a blue veil that covered the lower half of her face. Despite the woman's face being obscured you knew exactly who she was, you smiled and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meera! It's good to see you!\" Meera was your girlfriend and Zam's niece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thought I'd drop by for you 19th birthday.\" She said as she removed her veil and hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I almost forgot.\" You said as you hugged her back and led her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zam!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sure thing.\" You said casually, like Meera asked you to hug her. The two of you were very close, you've been friends with her for as long as you can remember but only recently have you two decided to take your relationship to the next level. Meera was taller than you by a few inches and she was also two years older than you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeera kissed you on the cheek and sat on the couch, propping up her size nine bare feet on the table. You start by gently rubbing her feet, causing Meera to coo softly and melt into the chair. Unlike you, Meera didn't normally wear boots or any other kind of footwear besides an anklet and toe rings with Mabari symbols, she said that not wearing boots helps her fight and move faster. You can certainly attest to this fact, Meera was almost unstoppable in close quarters combat, the only person that you've seen beat her was Zam but that's because she was the most experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of rubbing her feet, you then begin kissing her soles. Despite rarely wearing footwear, Meera always kept her feet clean and took good care of them. Meera closed her eyes and sighed in content when she felt you licking her soles, she enjoyed these little moments the two of you shared, the life of a bounty hunter was dangerous and few lived to retire. Despite having a cheery exterior, Meera knew that the life she chose to lead could lead to her death or worse, so she cherished these intimate moments. She looked at you one last time and smiled before closing her eyes and falling asleep. Her face then changed back to its natural clawdite form, most clawdites found it difficult to maintain their different forms while asleep. Zam was one of the few clawdites who could keep her different forms while asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Meera and smiled, most found changelings to be repulsive but you found Meera to be beautiful no matter what form she took. \"That was adorable.\" You hear a voice behind you, and turn around to see Zam standing on the stairs grinning. She was fully dressed in her usual purple outfit except for her boots, she used to normally wear boots but then she saw how effective Meera was at close quarters combat barefoot and stopped wearing her boots. You grinned right back at her, \"You sure did take your time getting dressed, thought you said you'd be down in a minute.\" You said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to interrupt your little moment you had with Meera.\" She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how considerate of you, you going soft on us?\" You joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, you wish. I was just wondering if you could give my feet some love, they've been aching for awhile. Care to do your old friend a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" He gestured to the couch Meera was on. Zam sat on the couch and kicked up her feet, like Meera she also wore toe rings and an anklet with Mabari symbols. You went to work, rubbing her feet. Your thumbs caressing and warming her arches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooaah...damn, you're better than I thought.\" Zam said as she, like Meera, melted on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try my best.\" You say as you begin kissing her soles. This causes Zam to start breathing deeply as she laid her head back. Then she starts moaning when you start sucking on her toes and licking her arches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...you sure do know how to treat a lady, Meera is one lucky gal.\" Zam says a bit jealous. It's been too long since she felt this relaxed, she had a million and one things to worry about but for right now those problems simply melted away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, think I'm gonna take a nap...\" Zam says as her eyes close and she slowly drifts off into sleep. Unlike Meera though, she retained her human form even though she slept. You grinned but then wondered what you were going to do next.</span></div></div>",

Your parents were no longer a part of your life, they were bounty hunters like you and taught you the basics and what it meant to be a Mandalorian, but a year ago they just disappeared while on the hunt. You've given up assuming that they're alive, if they were they would have contacted you somehow, besides your family taught you to accept loss. While you still mourn for your parents, you won't let it affect your life. For now, your life is good and you shouldn't let your parent's disappearance ruin that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid your head back and went to sleep, thirty minutes later you awoke. You noticed that Meera had laid her head on her shoulder and Zam was snoring slightly. You sit up, your movements awoke Meera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...oh!\" She quickly changed her form back to that of a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, sleep well?\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the best nap I've had in a long time!\" She said as she hugged your arm. You hear groaning, and then see Zam waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...how long was I out?\" She said as she rubbed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 30 minutes give or take.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, well I guess it's about time I give you your birthday gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it come with a pretty bow?\" You joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. See, here on Corscant there's a gang leader by the name of Nadia Roake and she's wanted alive, her bounty is worth 75,000 creds, and it's all yours. Course you have to catch her first, she's holed up with her all female gang in an abandoned warehouse on level 1313, so this won't be a walk in the park.\" Zam said as a matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry!\" Meera piped in. \"Zam and I will have your back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, Meera and I will help you but ultimately this is your show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" You said with barely contained excitement. \"Now what do we know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell us boss.\" Zam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss?\" You said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You're the boss, boss!\" Meera said chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop calling me boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing chief.\" Zam said with a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...let's stick with boss alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir boss!\" Both of them said with mock salutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and get to work gathering information. You obtain the layout of the abandoned warehouse and even the layout of buildings surrounding Nadia's base. A nearby abounded office building overlooked the warehouse and could serve as an excellent sniper nest. While you knew the layout, there was other information you had to consider such as the resources you had and your allies. You had a jet pack, one Whipcord Launcher, two pairs of Laser Cuffs, one Stun Rifle, five flashbang Grenades, and two Stun Pistols. Zam had her KYD blaster, her KISteer sniper rifle, a universal key that can open any door, and explosives. Meera had a small blaster but mainly relied on her skills with close quarter combat. Meera was skilled with this form of combat, but her skill with firearms were mediocre at best. You were an excellent shot but you were horrible with hand to hand combat. Zam however, was skilled with both and was definitely the one who was going to be doing the heavy lifting for this mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you've assessed all of this information, it was up to you to figure out what your next move is. You could either use stealth or go in blasters blazing.</span></div></div>",

Heh, one Jango is bad enough, but an entire army? I almost feel sorry for the Republic...almost.\" Zam smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would the CIS need a clone army when they already have a droid army?\" You queried. \"Why would Dooku go though the trouble of starting a Clone army when he already has an army?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he wants to ensure the Republic will be outmatched?\" Meera shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Zam interjected. \"Look kid, we're bounty hunters not senators.

The two of you were hunting a smuggler who had arrived on Coruscant to receive a shipment of Death Sticks, the hunt went well and the Galaxy had one less smuggler in it. Still, you wondered why you were still on Coruscant even though you had completed the hunt. You assumed that Zam had other business here but you haven't seen her mention anything of the sort. Still, you didn't complain.

Zam used to wear boots before, but she stopped wearing any kind of footwear after learning a new Mabari fighting style that helped her fight in close quarters and run faster. You didn't complain, in fact, while you'd never admit it, you loved how Zam was now barefoot virtually all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, you've been polishing your armor for days, keep it up and you and your shiny armor will be an easy target for snipers.\" Zam had always used the nickname kid for you, even though you had just turned 19 today.

Zam snickered and pulled you in closer, \"Come on, I don't bite. She said as she put an arm around your shoulders, now you felt like your face was going to melt off. In addition to being older than you, Zam was also taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to relax kid, being a bounty hunter means you have plenty of free time between contracts. So it's a good idea to spend some  of that time relaxing, wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's also imperative that a hunter keeps his skills sharp and his equipment tidy.\" You tried to keep your cool but Zam was making it hard. You then found yourself staring at Zam's feet, Zam seemed to have found out you were staring at her feet and began wiggling them for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like what you see kid?\" She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly tore your eyes from the spectacle, as much as you hated yourself for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZam began chuckling. \"Relax kid, you can go ahead and play with my feet if you want. It is your birthday after all. Consider this one of my gifts to you.\" She said as she laid her head back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what you were hearing, Zam had given you permission to play with her feet.

Course you have to catch her first, she's holed up with her all female gang in an abandoned warehouse on level 1313, so this won't be a walk in the park.\" Zam said as a matter of factly. \"This is your hunt, you make the decisions from here on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" You smiled widely and tried to contain your excitement. \"What do we know of the target?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me boss.\" Zam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss?\" You said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for this hunt you're the boss, boss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop calling me boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing chief.\" Zam grinned smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...let's stick with boss alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir boss!\" She gave you a mock salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and get to work gathering information. You obtain the layout of the abandoned warehouse and even the layout of buildings surrounding Nadia's base. A nearby abounded office building overlooked the warehouse and could serve as an excellent sniper nest. While you knew the layout, there was other information you had to consider such as the resources you had. You had a jet pack, one Whipcord Launcher, two pairs of Laser Cuffs, one Stun Rifle, five flashbang Grenades, and two Stun Pistols. Zam had her KYD blaster, her KISteer sniper rifle, a universal key that can open any door, and explosives. You were an excellent shot but you were horrible with hand to hand combat. Zam however, was skilled with both and was definitely the one who was going to be doing the heavy lifting for this mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you've assessed all of this information, it was up to you to figure out what your next move is. You could either use stealth or go in blasters blazing.</span></div></div>",

I've reviewed the layout of the place and I've also studied Nadia's gang, I've come to the conclusion that the best course of action is to sneak into the building and find our target. Our enemies are lightly armed, undisciplined, and ultimately shouldn't be a challenge for us.

You holstered your stun pistols, grabbed a pair of laser cuffs, and also grabbed some flashbang grenades just in case. Zam grabbed her blaster, her universal key, and some explosives then attached her veil across her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zam, how come you wear a veil even though you're a  shapeshifter? It's not like you have to conceal your identity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZam shrugged. \"Because it's cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, good enough for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then head out, leaving the hotel room. You look up at the sky to see that the sun had finally set and Coruscant was alit with bright lights. You make your way to Zam's Koro-2 Airspeeder, and sir in the passenger seat while Zam drove. It would be about 30 minutes before you arrived at your destination so you have time to chat with Zam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Zam, what's Jango been up to?\" You said as you looked at Zam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jango is still on Kamino, training those clones of his.\" She said as her speeder skillfully evaded traffic and zoomed through Coruscant's air space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do those clones belong to anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, all I know is that a man named Tyranus made him the offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyranus? As in Tyranus Dooku?\" You were shocked at this revelation. \"Tyranus Dooku is the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. IIf he was the one who made the offer to Jango then that means the army probably belongs to the CIS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, then they're probably preparing for their coming war with the Republic. Heh, one Jango is bad enough, but an entire army? I almost feel sorry for the Republic...almost.\" Zam smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would the CIS need a clone army when they already have a droid army from the Trade Federation?\" You queried. \"Why would Dooku go though the trouble of starting a Clone army when he already has an army?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Zam interjected. \"Look kid, we're bounty hunters not senators. There's no point in worrying about the Clone army on Kamino, if a war does happen then that just means more business for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who would we support?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The highest bidder, we're bounty hunters kid, we don't involve ourselves in politics.\" She said as she descended down to Level 1313. \"We can talk about politics when we're back at the hotel, for now let's focus on the job.\" She said as she landed her speeder.</span></div></div>",

Your head reflexively turned to your superior 'Fetish' in search for answers. To your surprise, a compact whipcord launcher rested in the female trooper's arm, most certainly belonging to experienced bounty hunter due to the scratches and cuts in the metallic surface of the object, consequence of the extensive punishment it withstood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Fett sure knows how to handle all kinds of <i>unpredictable</i> situations. \" joked 'Fetish', examining the launcher detailedly in front of her deep green eyes. You started an opposing reply that as silenced by Honey's intervention. She calmly approached you, pressing two fingers of her right hand against your mouth, uncovering it only to plant a gentle kiss on your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" We're clone troopers, we know what we're doing. \" whispered 'Honey' softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Even if we are females... \" added 'Babe' by her turn, passing her hand against her foot's arch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" And specially because we are females. \" concluded the Clone Captain, putting aside the curious whipcord launcher and heading back to you as the two remaining women sat in front of your tethered body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill stunned by Honey's kiss, you attempted to reply, releasing an unstructured group of words in a quick succession. 'Fetish' leaned her head slightly against her shoulder, smiling widely and releasing a short giggle, before pushing her right foot against your chest, prompting you to lay immobile in the floor. Showing little resistance, you sighed deeply, resting your body against the facility's cold floor. With a short laugh of joy and fun, 'Fetish' released a last statement before landing her right foot over your face:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey, Sigma, just remember clone training is very exhausting for our feet, alright? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again you tried to answer the phrase but, as the female clone's feet dropped over your unsuspecting head, you were again silenced. A strong mixture of sweat and the typically-feminine odor stroke your mind as the first whiff came up your nose. The blood pulsed in carotids, heading to your brain to help processing the sudden amount of olfactory information that now rushed through your mind, slowly possessing every single nerve in you. Her feet were warm, a thin layer of sweat covering it. And the smell seemed to become deeper and deeper at each breath, the lust for more running freely through your veins. The deep, heavy yet soft smell of Fetish's was surprisingly pleasing, as a hand that stroked your brain with a strong scent that certainly proved her anterior statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, at every second the soul and blood and life and lust in you clamored for more, clouding the mind further at every breath. A light dizziness began to affect you, yet, your lungs reflexly accepted to suck another and another whiff of air. The warm feeling of her feet against your skin had an almost magical capacity, you would say. And one more time did the profound scent strengthen its notoriety. Your mind as very near from disruption however, in an abrupt second, the light hit your eyes, forcing you to blink at the sudden illumination as 'Fetish' pulled both feet away from your head.                               </span></div></div>",

But what you liked the most is the fact that she appears to be blushing. <br>\r\nShe took a first aid box from the desk and opened it. She took some band, cloth and liquid out of it.

Her toenails were painted black and occasionally wiggling. They looked soft and silky. It looked perfect.

Soon, he was licking both her soles up and down. It was amazing feeling for both Anakin and Ahsoka. He really appreciated the taste and smell. She was moaning constantly, not wanting this to stop. <br>\r\nAnd her master didn't really seem to either. He started to suck her big toes, making togruta gasp loudly.

She'll have some fun with her. <br>\r\nVentress entered the cell, seeing Ahsoka Tano, sitting in the corner. Ahsoka looked at Ventress furiously. <br>\r\n\"You!

You don't sound like Jedi, you know, little one?\" Grinned Asajj, sitting nearby. <br>\r\n\"Stop calling me \"little one\", you...\" - Shouted Tano. <br>\r\n\"You who, huh?\" Asked Ventress. Good, very good. The girl let her emotions took control of her. <br>\r\n\"You...

She tried to punch Sith, but found herself unable to do something. She was like frozen. <br>\r\n\"Yes, I used the Force. You can't do anything, until I want so\" Answered Asajj. <br>\r\nThen Ventress lifted both Ahsoka's bare feet to the level of her face to examine them. <br>\r\n\"I still... Don't really understand what do you want...\" Said Ahsoka uncertainty. <br>\r\n\"Oh, little one, you'll understand soon everything\" Grinned darksider. \"By the way, you have beautiful feet. So gorgeous. Aww, look at these little tootsies...\" Ventress cooed, staring at Ahsoka's feet. She really liked what she was seeing. Smooth orange heels and soles were alluring. So are her wighgling toes. She let Ahsoka move only her feet, so she was flexing them slightly, frowning at Ventress. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure...\" Asked Ahsoka.

Ahsoka started to moan silently. <br>\r\nAfter making sure that Tano's toes on her right foot were covered in saliva, Asajj raised Ahsoka's foot a little higher, stuck out her tongue and slowly licked all the way up her arch from the bottom of the heel to balls. <br>\r\n\"Aaaaahh!\" Young Jedi moaned loudly, making Ventress smile. <br>\r\n\"Looks like your feet are your erogenous zone, huh, little one?\" She continued worshipping orange foot. She started to make more short licks across Ahsoka's sole. Ventress really loved the taste of young soft skin and sweat on her tongue. <br>\r\n\"Ohhh.... mmmm... \" Jedi Padawan turned into the jelly, moaning constantly.

Then she did everything that she did with her other sole... <br>\r\nAfter half an hour, Asajj looked at Ahsoka's feet, soaked wet. Then, her eyes met with the Jedi.

They all looked pretty messed up and there even were some wounded troopers.<br>\r\n\"Aura you hear me?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course I Do! And now we should wait until night to capture here silently!\" <br>\r\nBoba didnt mind answerering her. He didnt like her and had an other Plan anyways. He allready left his Position a while ago to scout the camp and He found what he searched for. A clone trooper armor. He could easyly go undercover because He was a clone himself. Even auro had n\u00f6 chance to detect him. When the clones and ahsoka arrived they send a scout to find threads like him but He killed the scout and was now taking his role and ran back to the camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comander, there is someone arround. Sehe seems to be a bounty hunter and she is after the Jedi! I could listen to her speaking with possibly her customer\", He shouted when He reached the tent of the commander. Ahsoka was there to. She was beautiful and seems to have left the field unharmed. The count will deffinetly appreciate that. But to his luck She Was pretty exhousted after the fight.<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Go and grab a few man and get her out of here. Bounty hunters rarely work alone. Everyone else, the battle isnt over yet! Get ready for a fight!\", the captains orders werde exactly what He had hoped for. To create a bit more of a Chaos in the Camp He detonated a few explosive he Set off earlier.<br>\r\nWithout hesitating he grabed ahsokas arm and pulled her out of the tent. Just like he had planed everyone was running around and no one was ready for another fight. He almost lost Ahsoka because of her sweaty skin.<br>\r\n\"Man She really has to been through alot today\", boba thought to himself. When he attempted to sneak out the Camp a few clones joined him. He would just take them out as soon as they were far away enough. <br>\r\n\"Where are we going now?\", Ahsoka asked. <br>\r\nThey had left the Camp behind and were walking through a little valley. <br>\r\n\"We should leave the planet\", one of the clones replied. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we have no shuttle here and there isnt any city near Our Camp\", another one said. <br>\r\nBoba looked at them and smirked under his helmet.<br>\r\n\"Well actually I have a ship. But there is only one of you that will come with me.\"<br>\r\nWith that a took out his blasters and shot two of them. He immediatly rolled away from the blasters bolts of the others. Then Ahsoka jumped behind him and shot He force wave at him but He dodged and it destroyed the rock behind him. He fired at him with his stun pistol but She used her lightsaber to defend herself. <br>\r\nAllthough he didnt have his equipment and his jetpack he still build some of it in his trooper armor. With some of his hidden gear he quickly elliminated the clones. But Ahsoka still put up a hell of a fight. After She dodged or deflected all of his stun bolts She even managed to destroy his pistol and blasters. So he engaged in hand to hand combat. As hard as he had trained and now fought he was no match for Ahsoka. Allthough He hold his own for quiet some time he finally got smaked to the ground by her.<br>\r\nHe wanted to get up again but was held down by her using her foot. <br>\r\n\"You little son of a bitch! What should I Do to you now? Cuz I cant just kill you because of the Jedi Code but after what you did I cant just arrest you neither\", Ahsoka thought out laud, \"Well, I am not really into pain but you shall be punished!\" <br>\r\nShe walked over to some stones and sat down. <br>\r\n\"So you know what will hapen to you when you get arrested, right? Buuut if you will be a good boy now... I may let you go, hm?\"<br>\r\nBoba knew he got completly defeated so he just agreed. <br>\r\n\"Very well. Now get on your hands and knees and crawl over here!\" He did as She demanded allthough he still felt all the pain after theire fight. When He arrived He knelt down and watched her crossing her legs.<br>\r\n\"As you should know I have been fighting and running all day now\", She said and began dangling her booted foot in front of his face, \"and as you also know we are on a damn hot Planet. So now you shall slowly take of my way too hot boot and massage my foot because it really hurts after all this fighting.\"</span></div></div>",

But he hated it to be dominated so allthough he would enjoy something like this normally and still was a punishing and humiliation for him now.<br>\r\nSo he grabed her brown lether boot and pulled it down her foot and leg. Slowly he revealed her lower leg and was a little shocked when he saw that even there her White tights where wet from her sweat. When he had completly removed her boot he wasnt sure if he really wanted to this. Her white sock were allready partly yellow to brown at the soles and soaked with sweat. It also laied so tight on her foot that her toes were perfectly shown. And than there was this smell coming from her boot and foot but he loved it. Because He was into feet it wasnt disgusting for him at all. He decided that this turned him on and was glad that he had the armor covering his erection.<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for? Go ahaed and massage it\", Ahsoka demanded. Boba gave her an angry gaze. If this little bitch just wouldnt force him to Do this! Allthough she stripped him from all his weapons He still had his whip launcher. He just had to catch her off guard.<br>\r\nHe grabed her foot and almost lost it again. Her socks were just as wet as they looked like. When he started to massage it He felt his hands getting wet from all her sweat.<br>\r\n\"wow! You are doing great. I should keep you as a slave. Kiss it!\", she demanded. <br>\r\n\"Fuck you, girl!\", Boba thought but placed his lips on the ball of her foot. He would have liked the feeling of wettnes on his lips but not in this situation. When he wanted to end the kiss she pressed her toes all over his nose. His face got covered with a thin layer of sweat and his breathing stopped.<br>\r\n\"Now take a deep breath through my sweaty toes, slave!\" <br>\r\nHe did and wasnt surprised by the strong smell. <br>\r\n\"Mmmh. That feels good. Now go back to massaging my foot. You will lick them clean later.\"<br>\r\nAhsoka thought she had the full power now but after a while she did a big mistake. She enjoyed the massaging and domination so much she started to lay back and close her eyes. But suddenly her feet were pressed together and tied up. She immediatly tried to get up and grab her lightsabers but Boba was faster. He had allready taken them and pushed her down now. She fought back but now Boba had the upper hand. He managed to put her wrists together behind her back and tied them up too.<br>\r\n\"Fuck you! You wont get away with this you little scum! You know they are allready looking for me and they will find me\", she yelled at him. <br>\r\n\"We cant have that, right? So I guess I'll have to keep you quiet. Sadly I dont have a gag. Tell me what should I stuff in your mouth to keep you quiet?\"<br>\r\nBoba knew exactly what He could use but he wanted her to suffer a bit more. <br>\r\n\"We should use something really tasty! How about your socks. You would deffinetly like the salty taste of it. I think you did not only sweat at your feet, right? Maybe I could use your panties? Yummie! Or better I use my own socks. I will let you decide\"<br>\r\n\"You son of a...\", Ahsoka stopped when she saw Boba started taking off his boot, \"than take my sock. But know you will regret this.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay. So your sock. Than beg for it!\"<br>\r\nAhsoka looked at him with disgust and hate. Laying on the ground and with her legs and arms tied up she begged him to gag her with her own sock.<br>\r\n\"Please use my own sock to gag me\",she said quietly.<br>\r\n\"What do I use?\", Boba teased her. <br>\r\n\"My sock, you...\", Ahsoka pressed her lips together. <br>\r\n\"Okay. If you really want it...\", took her feet and pulled her sock off her foot. And wasnt so easy because it was so sticky but he got it anyways. He then turned back to her.<br>\r\n\"And what should I Do with them now?\", he asked her. <br>\r\nAhsoka couldnt believe this humiliation. <br>\r\n\"Gag me with it!\" <br>\r\n\"I dont understand. Can you repeat that?\" <br>\r\nAhsoka closed her eyes then said: \"You shall stuff it in my mouth.\"<br>\r\nBoba looked at her in played surpise. <br>\r\n\"But it is so sweaty and dirty. Why would you want that?\" <br>\r\nAhsoka struggled at her bonds and tears began to fill her eyes. <br>\r\n\"Just do it!\"<br>\r\nBoba looked at her and raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n\"Please\", she whispers and starts crying a bit. <br>\r\nBoba finally moved to her face and she opened her mouth. He slowly put it toes first in her mouth. Immediatly she felt the salty sweat fill her mouth. The sock tasted like salty dirt. The toesection pushed directly on her tongue and she knew this was the worst Part of her socks.<br>\r\nShe barely felt him putting her boot back on and carrying her back to his ship. </span></div></div>",

They stood in a small valley with one entrance. The droids must have known they would Come through that one and prepared an ambush.<br>\r\n\"Shhhh! Boba, Do you hear that?\"<br>\r\nBoba stood still and listened. And After a few seconds He realised the Sound of blasterfire and... Lightsabers.<br>\r\n\"That has to be her. Come!\" He shouted and begann to ran in the direction the sounds Came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds Came from the other side of one of the Hills so Boba used his Jetpack to fly up to the top of the hill and walk to the other end of it.

Her back against a wall she gave her best to deflect All the blasterfire But she wouldn't hold out long because she Was realy exhousted so Boba decided to go in.<br>\r\nHe jumped over the edge of the fifteen meter high cliff and used his jetpack to fly over the droids. He blew up 3 with a rocket shot out of his wrist and landed behind the droids to Ahsokas left side. When he tried to defeat them with his flamethrower he realised they were completly immun to fire.<br>\r\nThe droids turned to him and opened fire But Boba Was able to Hit a Button on his wrist to activate a shield just in time. He than just dashed into them and activated an EMP built into his armor that wouldn't harm his equipment.<br>\r\nWhile He fought that droids ahsoka Was able to use her last power and Took out the droids left infront of her. She glanced to her left to see who helped her in the last second and was surprised to see a boy somehow looking like the clones and wearing a madelorian armor.<br>\r\nShe watched him suddenly dash into the six droids infront of him and just a second later she saw them All falling to the ground.<br>\r\nAfter checking for any droids left He looked at her wich made ahsoka Vera uncomfortable. She breathed heavily her trousers and top were soaked with sweat and she felt like walking on mud in her shoes.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\", she asked when she cought her breath.<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter to you. But I recommend to you that you stay down. You will Come with me.\"<br>\r\nAhsoka didn't move but hold her lightsaber ready in her hand.<br>\r\n\"Give me your weapons and you'll be treated well... at least by me. I can't make promisses for the Count.\"<br>\r\nAhsoka congealed.<br>\r\n\"You want to hand me over to Count Dooku?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep, thats my assignment. Come on now. You wont keep up another fight.\"<br>\r\n\"I am a Jedi!\" Ahsoka ignited her lightsaber and ran towards Boba.<br>\r\n\"All right then. This was your choice.\" Boba dodged her first strike easily, the second too. When she executed her third strike aimed to Boba right He blocked her blow with his right Hand and she lost her saber. Boba jumped back with a backflip using his jetpack and kicken her in the chest. Ahsoka fell onto her back wasn't able to get up anymore.<br>\r\nBoba went up to her and tied her hands on her back.

Her name is Waji Endarag, 24 years old, born in Zeltros.\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"And?\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"She b-\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Wait, you said she was one of ours?\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"In fact, she was, agent. However, she recently became rogue on the Republic and has been ever since running away from us with critical intelligence on Coruscant and Kamino's defense systems. Because the Director of the SIS, Separatist Intelligence Service is said to have over two million pairs of eyes and ears peeking around, the Confederacy has found out and is trying to make contact with her.\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I presume you want me to track Waji down and arrest her.\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Rather intuitive, young boy. There are a few problems, though. First, there seems to be an entire Corps of the Armed Wing of the SIS stationed in Dantooine, where Waji is believed to be hiding. Second, several entities around the Galaxy seem to have their eyes on her. The three most important are the Separatists, of course, Zeltros Defense Ministry which would be most interested in having Waji back on their ranks, and the Corporate Sector, who dreams of an alliance with the CIS. By capturing her, they would have an excellent start of relationship with the Confederacy. Third, as you may know from your previous incident in Zeltros, Zeltron female have powerful pheromones that make males of various species, namely the Human race, submissive toward them. But I trust you will handle this three problems.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed intensely upon remembering of your 'incident' with that Zeltron Military Intelligence agent, that had ever since left you slightly attracted to female feet... you put this bad memories aside and answered the middle-aged bat you called \"Boss\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Of course, ma'am.\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Good. All other information is in your Infopad. Good luck, boy.\"   </span></span></div></div>",

You entered the elevator but, as its door began to close, you saw a cascade of red hair flying into the small compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Oh, hi you!\"</span> she said with cheerful smile, straightening her disproportionately large t-shirt, that ended well below the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Una Fer\" you thought. A <i>petit</i> lady, part of the Information Procurement Bureau, she was often seen around your department, likely delivering fresh intelligence to our field agents. In spite of her well-taken-care-of feet, which you had had the opportunity to observe during one of the few parties of the RIS in the sandy coast of Naboo, her somewhat strange and childish behaviour prevented you from give her much attention. Also, you had heard some rumours about her dating a Counter-Intelligence's \"muffler\" ( an agent whose duty was to make sure no leaked information would find its way to the media, sometimes with the use of <i>ad hoc</i> solutions like censuring all information companies until the story died out, or filtrating transmissions at planetary relaying nods ).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you meditated about this, and Una continued to straighten her clothes and hair, a robotic voice resonated inside the elevator: \"39th Floor: Censure &amp; Propaganda\". The doors opened a few more employees of the RIS entered in the metallic compartment. This continued on and on until finally the voice said \"Ground floor: Entrance; Main lobby; Internal access to the Spaceport\". You then exited, and ran toward the hangar, almost bashing a short Twi'lek in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you at last reached it, you had to stop abruptly to locate your fighter among the sea of V-Wings ( for some reason, the RIS really liked these kind of small, swift fighters ). Eventually, you found the blueish freighter you usually took for undercover missions, running madly to it before jumping in a pointless hurry. You left the on-vessel computer trace an Hyperspace lane to Dantooine and verified that you had all that you needed for the trip. Some 7 minutes later, the freighter rose toward the skies of Coruscant, leaving the RIS's spaceport behind, before entering Hyperspace, with a multicolour vortex forming around the ship's windows as it did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Twenty-one hours and two naps later</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up suddenly, with your Infopad on your lap and a small line of saliva pending from the corner of your mouth. Handler's \"important information\" turned out to be a twelve pages detailed report of the events previous to the precise day. As your eyes opened you still remembered some topics such as Waji's presumed whereabouts and routines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you did not have much time to think about that, for an acute beep resonated through the ship, signalling an incoming message. You hurried to answer and...</span></div></div>",
