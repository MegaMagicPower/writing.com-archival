He tried to spit it out, but it refused to move from his lips.  He was suddenly very awake and he tried to sit up only to find straps around his chest, stomach, and ankles kept him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand shot to his mouth. Not only were his hands covered in thick fingerless mittens, but his mouth was also filled with a pacifier. He thrashed and squirmed, knocking his arms against the bars of the crib he was in. In the midst of his struggles, he heard crinkling below his waist. He froze and reached down with his mittened hand and felt his crotch. Through the mitten, he could feel multiple layers of diapers and the crinkle of plastic pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry heard a door open. He watched as a blurry blond figure made its way toword the crib. The figure reached over the bars and placed his glasses on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How shall we begin the day, my new baby boy?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cPerhaps you need a little help, baby?\u201d Draco asked as he pointed his wand at Harry and cast a non-verbal spell. Harry immediately lost all control over his bladder. His eyes began to tear up at the humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, isn\u2019t that better? To just letting it go instead of holding it all back?\u201d Draco asked in a soothing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded unintentionally. Draco laid a hand on Harry\u2019s cheek and used his thumb to dry the tears. Harry found even this to be very soothing and also comforting.<br>\r\nDraco then removed his hand and picked up Harry in his arms, he walked over to an adult sized changing table. That made Harry squeal in protest as he was sat down on the table. Draco simply put a pacifier in Harry\u2019s mouth which effectively shut him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you can\u2019t wear a wet diaper all day, can you? I promise you, Sweetie, you will feel better when I\u2019ve changed it for you.\u201d Draco whispered in Harry\u2019s ear. Harry did want to get out of the wet diaper, but he was not sure how much he liked the idea someone else changing him, and would he let Draco Malfoy, of all people, do it?<br>\r\nBut before he could find an answer, Draco put a hand on his chest and gently pushed him down on his back. Harry blushed when Draco removed the diaper, exposing him in the process. That blushing intensified as Draco began to clean his crotch with a baby wipe, applied baby powder on his skin, and finally putting Harry in a new, all clean diaper and helped the boy to sit up. Draco placed a kiss on both Harry\u2019s cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, isn\u2019t that better?\u201d Harry didn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t want to admit that it did indeed feel good to have the soft material placed on his crotch. Or how nice it felt to have that baby powder put on his (usually) private parts by Draco\u2019s gentle fingers. Or the relief of getting cleaned after wetting the first diaper. Harry could only compare it all to when you put on a newly washed pajamas after getting out of your sweaty clothes and had a nice warm shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was thrown out of his thoughts when Draco lifted him up and walked over to an armchair. He placed Harry in his arms so his head was supported by his shoulder, basically how you held a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like you, Harry. I know I haven\u2019t shown it that good, but I do, I really do. And you\u2019ve never had an easy life so far, I know, I\u2019ve seen you. Please, could you let me take care of you now?\u201d Draco had placed a bottle of warm milk on Harry\u2019s bottom lip, Harry could accept it, or deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which he would choose would show of his choice on this matter, he understood. He could deny the bottle, and thereby saying \u2018no\u2019 to Draco\u2019s request of taking care of and babying him. Or Harry could take the bottle, and agreeing to Draco\u2019s offer, with all that it meant. Diaper changing, cribs, drinking warm milk from a bottle and over all being taken care of as a baby by Draco Malfoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he accept it?</span></div></div>",

The big baby began to suckle, and the warm milk slowly slid down his throat. All the while, Draco continued to quietly praise Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry couldn't help but relax in Draco's arms. He never expected this to ever happen, nor did something even close to this ever even enter into his wildest dreams! Even so, it was nice. He didn't realize how much he needed this, until he got it. Soon enough, the bottle was completely drained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco replaced the bottle with a pacifer and silently held Harry in his arms. After a few minutes of quiet, Draco finally spoke up. \"Do you want Daddy to read you a story, or do you just wanna play with some toys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blushed as Draco referred to himself as daddy. It suited him though. After thinking it over, Harry decided, \"Daddy I want...</span></div></div>",

Once upon a time\u2026~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~and forever after, the statue of Babbitty remains on top of the stump, and no witch or wizard is ever hurt in that kingdom ever again.\u201d Draco smiled as he looked down at Harry, who\u2019s eyes had become really heavy and was about to shut. Draco rocked him a little while lulling quietly until Harry was fully asleep. Draco ran a hand over the front of Harry\u2019s diaper, making the boy moan in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry woke up a few hours later, back in the crib. At first he was a bit disoriented but then remembered the events earlier that day. Harry looked around quickly and found out that someone, Daddy Draco most likely, had carefully tucked him in with a warm and cozy blanket. Harry tried to think of the last time he had woken up after being tucked in. That had never happened at the Dursley\u2019s and at the Weasley\u2019s he and Ron had always gone to bed by themselves. His conclusion being that it hadn\u2019t happened since his parents died, Harry decided that he liked being tucked in.<br>\r\nAs he lied in his crib and sucked on his pacifier, after suddenly realizing he had a pacifier, Draco entered the room. He stopped trying to be quiet when he saw Harry awake.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, baby boy! Had a nice nap?\u201d<br>\r\nHarry nodded, then Draco removed the pacifier.<br>\r\n\u201cUse your words, baby, always use your words when Daddy ask you a question.\u201d Draco whispered with a stern voice. \u201cLet\u2019s try again. Did you have a nice nap?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Daddy, I had a nice nap.\u201d Draco smiled and put back the pacifier in Harry\u2019s mouth with a little plop. Harry gratefully started to suck on it. Draco then removed Harry\u2019s blanket which made the boy shiver a bit when the cold air hit his skin. Draco felt the diaper, it was wet again. Draco smirked.<br>\r\n\u201cThe spell worked, I see.\u201d Harry got confused.<br>\r\n\u201cWohat swell, Daddie?\u201d Harry asked, the pacifier made it a bit difficult to speak properly.<br>\r\n\u201cThe spell I put on your bladder earlier prevents you from trying to hold your pee.\u201d Draco explained as he picked up Harry in his arms and walked over to the changing table. This time Harry didn\u2019t fight back, he laid down as soon as he was sat on the table, wanting Draco to remove the diaper as fast as possible. These things got a bit uncomfortable when he had wet them. Draco smiled at Harry\u2019s cooperation and unstrapped the wet diaper. Harry moaned in relief when it was removed. After Draco had thrown it away he opened a drawer in the table and took out a pack of baby wipes. He grabbed Harry\u2019s ankles and held his legs above them, giving Draco better access to Harry\u2019s bottoms. Harry closed his eyes and enjoyed the touch as his lower region was being cleaned. He had made up his mind, it felt good to use diapers, not as good once he had wet them, but the process of changing them was more that worth it. Draco started powdering him once his bottoms was all clean. Seeing how much Harry ad seemed to like it when he had cleaned him, Draco used his finger to gently spread out the baby powder all over Harry\u2019s crotch, purposely giving some extra attention to his genitals. Harry moaned loudly.<br>\r\n\u201cAww. Does my baby like that?\u201d Draco cooed smirking.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Daddy, me like it.\u201d Harry panted in his baby voice. He had never been given a hand job before but this felt sooo good. Draco stopped and bent forward to plant a kiss on Harry\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re being a good baby for Daddy, you\u2019ll get more of that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd more stories too?\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t help but ask as he remembered the tale Draco had told him earlier about the animagus who had fooled the king and saved all witches and wizards in the kingdom. That fairytale was much better than the muggle fairytales aunt Petunia had told Dudley when they were younger.<br>\r\nDraco giggled in amusement as he put a new diaper under Harry\u2019s bottom, folded it over his crotch and taped it close. He helped Harry sit up and peaked his nose.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my baby. I\u2019ll tell you more stories too.\u201d <br>\r\nDraco put Harry in a cozy green onesie and carried him out of the room he turned into Harry\u2019s nursery and went to the dining hall. Sucking on his pacifier Harry looked around a little surprised. He had just assumed that they had been in the room of requirement, but apparently not. This must be the Malfoy Manor. Harry whimpered and clung to Draco, hiding his face in the blonde\u2019s neck. Draco stopped.<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be scared, Baby. My father have been sent to Azkaban and my mother\u2026\u201d Draco smiled a little. \u201cWell, my mother already know about my fetish, and which gender I prefer. She\u2019s much more open minded since the war ended. No one will hurt or judge you. I promise.\u201d Harry relaxed a bit. Draco put him in a high chair and fed him some pasta carbonara after shaving it for him.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you liked the story about Babbitty?\u201d Draco asked as he fed Harry a spoonful of pasta. Harry took his time to swallow before answering.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Daddy, me liked it very much!\u201d Harry said still using his baby voice. \u201cThere\u2019s an error in it, though.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d Draco replied. \u201cAnd What might that be?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhen Babbitty hid under the stump and spoke to the king, she must have still been a rabbit, but animaguses can\u2019t talk while they\u2019re animals.\u201d<br>\r\nDraco smiled. \u201cYes, perhaps Beedle didn\u2019t know that much about animaguses, or he changed that detail for the sake of the story. Anyway, that is a smart observation of you.\u201d Draco poked Harry\u2019s nose, making the boy giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Draco became serious.<br>\r\n\u201cHarry, I have to ask you if you want me to owl your friends. They will probably get worried otherwise. Do you want them to know you\u2019re here?\u201d<br>\r\nHarry thought for a moment.<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy, I\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

He placed Harry on the floor and went to choose an outfit for his baby.<br>\r\nHarry was a bit confused until he took a look at himself and realized that he was completely naked except from the nappy covering his (not so much anymore) private parts, and the mittens on his hands. He had basically been fully naked in front of Draco Malfoy while he had been changed just minutes ago, but except from a faint blush on his cheeks, Harry couldn\u2019t get himself to care that much.<br>\r\nDraco came back with a green onesie that snapped in the crotch. So he wouldn\u2019t need to remove it completely when it was time for the next changing, Harry realized. It was put over his head and Draco helped him with the arms before having Harry laying on his back for Draco to snap the onesie closed.<br>\r\nAs Harry lied on the floor in the onesie Draco gently rubbed his crotch through the diaper.

If you disobey me I might have to punish you, understood?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Daddy.\u201d Harry replied, knowing better than to nod again. He laid his head on Draco\u2019s chest to let the steady heartbeat calm him down.<br>\r\nDraco ran his hand through Harry\u2019s unruly hair and placed a kiss on his forehead.<br>\r\n\u201cGood baby. You would like to cuddle now?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Daddy, me would like cuddles now.\u201d<br>\r\nThey spent the following hours on the armchair with Harry nuzzling into Draco\u2019s chest and Draco placing kisses all over Harry\u2019s face.

His clothes felt strange, he looked down and despite how blurry everything was; he could tell he was wearing, what seemed like, a baby's onesie! Nervously he looked around and saw blurry whitish bars surrounding him, show that he was in an oversized cot(crib)! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shifted from his spot and heard the loud sound of plastic pants, the type that'd go over nappies! Nervously he felt around, to his growing horror, he noticed he had thick padding around his crotch. That wasn't the worst part though. It seemed that it had been used as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, baby boy. Did you have a nice rest?\" A voice cooed mockingly. Harry frowned, he knew that voice. \"Get me out of here, Malfoy!\" He exclaimed, not knowing that it was Malfoy who put him there in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco (Malfoy) simply smirked, though Harry couldn't tell. He took his wand out and muttered a quick spell. It was a pretty common spell, generally used on people who lost their glasses or something like that. Harry thenblinked then opened his eyes, suddenly able to see clearly. \"Malfoy, hurry up and get me out!\" He insisted, standing up in the cot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Potter, had an accident in your nappy?\" Malfoy mocked. Harry looked down with a blush, unintentionally answering Draco's question. \"I'll tell you what, Potter. Promise to be a good boy whilst I baby you, and I promise you won't regret it.\" He offered with a cocky smile. Harry weighed his options. He could swallow his pride and let Malfoy treat him like a baby without a fuss. It'd ceartinly be easier.

In Dennis' opinion the fourth year was nothing special and if he were completely honest nothing more than a first year in fourth year clothing. His proof of his thought was when he asked Harry for help with his homework on the levitation charm and Harry responded that he honestly didn't remember the charm and when Harry went to try the charm he completely botched it multiple times before giving up and when Dennis went to try the charm in his room he performed it on his first try, which started his current thought process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he needs a big brother to put him in his proper place.\" Said Dennis. And as this thought started it festered soon Dennis went crazy searching through the library searching for ways to become Harry's big brother and found it hidden in an older part of the library hidden by all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<b><i>Vestimentum mutationem of ctatus</i></b>~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following enchantment is used to bind someone to someone else using an article of clothing. The binder uses the article of clothing to change the reality and/or status of a person i.e: a friend to a brother or preference of something and etc. Be warned this will permanently bind the two to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<b>Incantation</b>~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Mea est ultio, <br>\r\n<br>\r\net ego te esse <br>\r\n<br>\r\nte mihi in perpetuum</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking what he thought the most appropriate for this out, Dennis pulled from his satchel Harry potters boxers. Soon he repeated and the ritual was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking an evil grin Dennis thought he should test it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start with a little humiliation.\" Holding the boxers he thought of changing it and slowly it did. The boxers slowly started to shrink in on itself slowly shrinking losing color and fading from red to white until soon a pair of tighty whities was left but it didn't stop there. the trim of the tighty whities soon became baby blue in color and little childish pictures of golden snitch's and broomsticks started appearing all over the front and back. But the changes didn't stop there as dry yellow stains soon appeared in the front and light brown skid marks appeared in the back. Soon all that was left of the once teen boxers were a teen-sized child patterned underoos with stains questioning potty training status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all I will change for now just his underwear preference, I wonder how his year mates will react?\" Laughing Dennis returned to his room where the rest of his roommates were sleeping thinking maybe after some more humiliating changes another member might be added to the first years. Soon he fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Maybe you should invest in some nice nappies, seeing as baby briefs don't seem to work for you!\" I said, as I took quick notice of the heavy pee stains and what looks to be fresh skid marks. I shake my head as Harry stands their blushing, obviously thinking of an excuse as to why he is wearing baby briefs, but the proof that they are most definitely his is that the name 'Harry' is stitched in to the baby blue waist-band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I\" Harry stutters, as he tries to think of something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, a thought comes to me I could use this as blackmail, I have always been his sidekick so with this I could become the hero and him my sidekick.

Harry let out a squeak of pain as the younger student gave him a wedgie.  \"See I knew it would be here,\" Dennis said pulling the briefs a little bit away from Harry's body so that looking down the boy-who-lived could read in his own handwriting his name written on the inside of the kiddy briefs.  \"You know I never really understood why you did that as from what I understand the rest of your dorm mates either wear boxers or boxer-briefs.  Though I guess you would not want the laundry to get them mixes up with the underwear of a first year,\" Dennis said still holding Harry's brief in the wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Dennis could you let go?\" Harry asked almost on the verge of tears due to the pain of the wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right I am sorry,\" Dennis lied as he let go and laughed as Harry began to dig the wet undies out of his crack.

That whole situation had just been a bad dream. Now he could start his day afresh with no worries. <br>\r\n\"Good morning, little one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry jumped as he heard the female voice. He opened his eyes and realised things were not quite as they seemed. He was in bed, that much was true. But it wasn't his bed. He was lying on a blanket splayed over a thick plastic mattress. Around the bed were tall plastics bars that reached far up over his height. He sat up in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...\" He cried. \"I've been shrunk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female figure loomed over him, casting a long black shadow across the crib.

It felt soft and clean beneath him, but compared to his small stature, the diaper was enormous on his! As she taped it up, it puffed out at his crotch and butt, making him look even more like a baby.<br>\r\n\"There we go, my baby boy.\" She smiled, picking him up off the table and holding him close to her, hugging him to her breast. <br>\r\n\"Now then, do you know what it's time for?\" She asked with an excited grin. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How was he gonna get out of this? Harry looked up to see that Bellatrix was no longer looming over him. He looked around, and chills moved down his spine. It was a complete nursery, painted a bold emerald, accented with silver. How much spare time did Bellatrix have on her hands anyway? Harry tried to wake up from whatever weird, disturbing dream this was, but he couldn't. Just his luck; Bellatrix walked back into the room, humming something. It sounded dark and mysterious. It took Harry a moment to realize it was the Hogwarts school song, only in a minor key. \"What's your angle here, Lestrange?\" he asked boldly. Bellatrix looked up from her song, and looked Harry dead in the eyes. \"What?\" she asked, walking over to Harry. \"Yeah, you heard me. What's your angle? Are you going to turn me into a defenseless baby and then call in your precious Voldemort to destroy me once and for all?\" Harry asked, looking at Bellatrix with a serious expression. Bellatrix's forehead wrinkled with rage, her eyes looking mad. \"Do you dare to say his name, Potter? You're nothing but a filthy Halfblood!\" Bellatrix spat. She was about to slap Harry square on the cheek, but stopped herself. \"No, don't be silly. What I have in mind is going to be much more enjoyable.\" Bellatrix replied, a smile forming on her red lips. Harry's eyebrows dipped, forehead creasing with worry. \"Don't worry, we won't hurt you.\" Bellatrix told him. \"We?\" Harry choked out, not liking the sound of this. As if on queue, in strode Lucius Malfoy, cane in hand. He sported his signature smug smirk, his ivory hair shining in the light. \"Hello, Potter.\" he spoke, standing beside Bellatrix.

She continued laughing sadistically and taunting the teenager all the while. Harry fired a stunning spell after her, but missed the witch by several inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix took that as a sign to head for cover. She quickly ducked behind the fountain and turned towards Harry. The young wizard knelt down by the fountain on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peeked over the ledge and mumbled through gritted teeth \u201cThis is the end of the line.\u201d<br>\r\nShe chuckled maniacally and retorted \u201cFor you, maybe. You really think you can take me on by yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t THINK,\u201d Harry yelled angrily, \u201cI KNOW I will. I\u2019m putting you in the ground if it\u2019s the last thing I do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sound determined,\u201d Bellatrix muttered cheekily, \u201cLet\u2019s see if you have the ability to carry out that threat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGladly,\u201d Harry spat heatedly. He rose to his full height, pointed his wand at Bellatrix, and shouted \u201cCrucio!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the witch dropped her wand and collapsed onto the ground. She started shrieking in agony and writing erratically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled in pleasure and gradually walked around the fountain towards Bellatrix. All the while, he kept his wand pointed directly at her. Overtime, she appeared to be in greater and more intense pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Harry was standing directly over Bellatrix, and he kept the Torture Curse on her. He reveled in her misery; it brought him inexplicable delight and satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Bella?\u201d he commented scathingly, \u201cAm I hurting you? Oh, I\u2019m so sorry. Let me help you ease the pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he said that, he kicked Bellatrix in the side. She was already in so much pain that the blow from Harry\u2019s foot only added marginally to her pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled in amusement and pronounced \u201cI\u2019m going to make you feel the kind of pain you\u2019ve made so many others feel. Including Sirius. And me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Harry had his way, he would have continued torturing Bellatrix until he killed her. However, he had gotten close enough to her that there was barely any space between the two of them. Also, he was focused entirely on Bellatrix\u2019s upper body, meaning he had left his guard down on everything else, including her lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst her bout of anguish, Bellatrix managed to realize this. So while Harry\u2019s attention was diverted, she swung her legs under his, causing him to trip and stumble onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Harry had a chance to recover from his fall, Bellatrix moved in. She raised her hand and struck the young wizard hard on the forehead. He fell backwards and hit his head against the fountain. As a result, he was knocked unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix needed a moment to compose herself. Once she felt the effects of the torture curse wear off, she picked up her wand, rose to her full height, and gazed down at the boy with glasses.<br>\r\nShe smirked in satisfaction and remarked \u201cWell, the tables have turned unexpectedly. The Dark Lord will be pleased.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry was out of commission for quite a while. Eventually, he managed to regain consciousness.<br>\r\nHe felt a tinge of pain in his forehead, and he felt a little cold all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was fully awake, Harry slowly opened his eyes. Everything around him was blurred. This was primarily because he was not wearing his glasses. However, even if he was, he doubted they would have made much difference. He was currently in a very dark room. There was no light to be seen anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to his left and to his right, and he was unable to make out anything about his surroundings. He could not help but wonder where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed he was lying on a flat surface. It felt like a counter, a table, or another hard surface. All he did known was that it was too hard to be the floor or ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured he may as well get up. However, when he tried to sit up, he found he was stuck. His arms and legs felt stiff and rigid. He could not move them at all. Also, every time he moved even the slightest amount, he heard a faint crinkling sound, like plastic rustling. It seemed to originate from somewhere below his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only part of his body that Harry was able to move was his head. He managed to lift it up enough to gaze downwards at his body. Despite the darkness and his defective vision, he was able to see his entire body. His arms and legs had been strapped down onto the hard surface. He was fully restrained and unable to budge his limbs at all. They were so tight that he did not have room to wiggle free at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs unsettling as that was, it was not the most startling thing Harry noticed. That honor went to why he felt cold and the source of that crinkling sound. He was no longer wearing his school uniform. He had been stripped completely naked of his clothes. Even his shoes and socks were gone. However, that is not to say he was entirely naked now. He was wearing one article of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround Harry\u2019s waist was a large white disposable diaper. It was very thick and very bulky. It had been taped onto him perfectly; almost as though it had been made specifically for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry\u2019s eyes widened in shock and he yelled \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was what he tried to yell. It came out as \u201cWhbbb dhe hlllb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Harry realized that he had been gagged, as well. A long scarf had been placed over his mouth and tied at the back of his head. He tried shaking it off, but it had been knotted very tightly. He mumbled angrily, but the gag was very effective. All he could get out was some gibberish.<br>\r\nHarry struggled to break free of his bonds, but he was tied up very tightly. Ultimately, he just sighed and mumbled in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered; how could he have possibly gotten into this situation. The last thing he remembered was confronting Bellatrix Lestrange at the Ministry of Magic. He could have sworn he had her at his mercy, but he vaguely recalled taking a blow to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could speculate on what happened after that, he heard soft footsteps. They sounded as though they were approaching him from the right. Harry turned his head in that direction. By squinting his eyes and carefully focusing, he managed to spot the far wall. There was a single door on it, and a figure seemed to be nearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the door was opened up completely, causing a bit of light to slip in. Harry continued squinting, and he realized that the person standing in the doorway was\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, Harry was only able to determine that the person in the doorway was tall, female, and dressed in black. After concentrating a little more closely, he realized she was the last person he had seen before he lost consciousness. It was Bellatrix Lestrange herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Harry discovered this, he felt his earlier anger resurface. He vigorously shook himself in effort to break free of his bonds, and he tried shouting death threats and other hostile remarks. However, his restraints prevented him from getting up by even a marginal amount, and his gag only allowed inarticulate mumbles to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loudest sound he made was produced by his sole article of clothing. Every move Harry made caused his thick diaper to resonate a loud crinkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix just smiled and commented \u201cOh good. The baby\u2019s awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly entered the room and began approaching Harry. The closer she got, the harder Harry tried to break free of his bonds. But they were very effective; he could not free himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute, Bellatrix had reached Harry. She was standing right over him. He glared up at her, looking as though he would kill her if she got any closer. He knew he could have appeared very threatening at this time, what with him being tied down, gagged, and diapered. That did not cloud the hate and malevolence he felt for this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Bellatrix was not the least bit intimidated by Harry\u2019s gestures. She smirked and teased him with \u201cYou look so cute right now, you know. I\u2019m glad I decided to do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was still infuriated, but he had room to feel perplexed, as well. When Bellatrix saw the look of bewilderment on his face, she decided to explain the situation. She enlightened him with:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI managed to knock you out mere moments before you could torture me to death. At the time, it was tempting to finish you off myself. But the Dark Lord gave us explicit orders to capture you alive. And unharmed, if possible. Aside from the bump I gave you and a few bruises, you had no blemishes. At any rate, the Dark Lord told us he would arrive at the Ministry shortly after we did. I thought about waiting around for him, but by staying there, I ran the risk of encountering your friends first. So I chose to bring you here instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment, and then she continued with \u201cNaturally, I couldn\u2019t afford to leave you unrestrained, hence the bonds and the gag. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering about your current apparel, as well. Well, I also decided to free you of that lousy school uniform of yours, too, and get you into something more comfortable and appropriate. So I stripped you and put you in nappies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of disgust came across Harry\u2019s face. Bellatrix scoffed and leaned against the table. She remarked \u201cI never would have imagined you\u2019d be so adorable in them, though. Then again, I never thought I\u2019d find you adorable in ANY way. Guess anybody can be adorable under certain circumstances. Even you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then placed her right hand on the front of Harry\u2019s diaper. The teenager tried to shake her hand off, but his feeble struggles barely made any difference. Bellatrix softly rubbed the front of Harry\u2019s diaper, as if she was checking for wetness. Strangely, this action had a minor pleasing effect on Harry. A moment later, Bellatrix relented and observed \u201cLooks like you managed to stay dry. I\u2019m glad for that, even though I wasn\u2019t expecting you to use these. So soon, that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had no idea what that last statement was supposed to imply. Just then, he heard another pair of footsteps approaching the room. He and Bellatrix both turned back towards the entrance, and a moment later, another person appeared into the doorframe. It was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since it was still very dark and Harry was not wearing his glasses, he could not see who the person was at first glance. He got a glimpse of Bellatrix's face, and she seemed to be smiling at that person, though her smile appeared to be a little uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry returned his gaze to the doorway, and the new figure began to enter the room. This one was cloaked in black, as well. The face was little more than a blur to him. However, he quickly realized that the figure was bald. He did not know that many bald people, and he knew even fewer bald people who were affiliated with Bellatrix Lestrange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the figure was halfway between the door and the table, Harry could begin to make out the person's face. He quickly discovered that the figure had narrow eyes and slits for nostrils. Immediately the diapered boy realized who was standing before him. It was the very person who had made him famous, as well as the very person responsible for all the grief in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Voldemort stopped right in front of the table. He stood next to his subordinate and gazed down at the bound boy. He grinned in both amusement and satisfaction. Then he turned to the woman and stated \"Very good work subduing him, Bella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix lightly nodded her head in acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoldemort looked back down at Harry and stared into his eyes. That stare could have frightened anyone else, but Harry had already faced the sinister wizard several times and lived to tell it. He refused to be afraid or to even appear to be afraid. Even if this was to be his last day alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Voldemort shifted his attention to Harry's lower body. He reached out his hand and pressed it against the boy's diapered crotch. Even though Voldemort's hand did not come in direct contact with Harry's skin, Harry was overcome with discomfort anyway. One could hardly blame him; all that stood between Voldemort's hand and his privates was a thick lair of white padding. He tried to shake away the older wizard's hand, but he was tied up too tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Voldemort removed his hand from Harry's padding and thought aloud \"This is rather ironic, Harry. When you and I first met, you were in nappies at the time, too. And you were just as helpless then as you are now. The only real difference was that you were considerably younger back then. And, of course, there is no one here to sacrifice themselves for you. So now I could kill you without my own spell backfiring on me this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry mumbled through his gag, trying to claim that he did not fear death. If he was to die right then, he was not going to give the Dark Lord the satisfaction of seeing him beg for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However...\" Voldemort muttered tentatively. He looked around at the bound and diapered boy, and then he announced \"I'm not going to kill you. Now that I see you, I find that I like you better in this position. Now you know what it feels like to be disgraced, powerless, humiliated, stripped of all your greatness. That is just how I felt when you defeated me fourteen years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInwardly, Harry was a little relieved that he was not going to die. At least not yet. Regardless, he could imagine that what Voldemort had planned for him would not be much better than death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to keep you like this,\" Voldemort revealed, \"Tied to a table and wearing nappies like a helpless baby. You'll be treated like a baby, as well. Bellatrix will be 'taking care' of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix leaned on the end of the table and grinned wickedly. She remarked \"It'll be just you and me, 'sweetie.' Imagine what 'fun' we'll have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing Bellatrix had tied down Harry's legs, otherwise he would have kicked her squarely in the face right then. Alas, the most he could do was shake his body and mumble through his gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoldemort scoffed at Harry's futile struggles and disclosed \"Bella has always wanted a child, but her husband has never been especially 'cooperative' in that pursuit. But he's landed himself back in Azkaban, and you're in a nappy. So this works out for us all. Oh, and you can forget about getting rescued. This house is located in a place no one will ever think to look. Dumbledore, the Order, and your precious little friends will not find you anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused for a minute, and then he continued with \"Needless to say, we'll be holding you in secret. But only for a while. Once I've taken over the Ministry of Magic, I'll finally present you to the public. Odds are almost everyone in the wizard community will submit to me straightaway. The few who don't will be discouraged from resisting when they see what their greatest 'hero' has been reduced to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry would have given almost anything for his wand just then. If he had it, he could break free, finish off Voldemort and his sadistic servant for good, escape, and never speak of this again. Alas, he could do nothing but listen on hopelessly.</span></div></div>",

She tied a bib around Harry's neck as he struggled and fussed. After the bib was secured around the boy's neck, Bellatrix opened one of the jars of baby food. The puke green mush was watery. Harry gagged. Bellatrix took a heaping spoonful, and guided it to Harry's mouth. He clamped shut as tightly as possible without breaking his jaw. \"Open up, Potter, or you'll get a spanking so bad you'll feel as though you've been Crucioed right on the arse.\" Bellatrix warned.

I'm sure he'd get a good laugh at you in your nappy.\" Bellatrix said smoothly. No way in hell was Draco Malfoy going to see Harry like this. It was humiliating enough for Bellatrix Lestrange and Voldemort to see him, he didn't need his sworn enemy joining the club. Harry opened his mouth a small amount, and Bellatrix placed the bottle in. Harry reused to drink its contents; until Bellatrix threatened him again, that is. Bellatrix smirked as she watched as the young Gryffindor in her lap nervously sucked down the warm milk. After Harry was finished, he assumed Bellatrix would just put him back in the playpen and go off to do something else, but she didn't do that. Instead, she turned him in her lap, resting his chin over her shoulder. She proceeded to pat his back, eventually causing him to burp. Harry blushed, and Bellatrix turned him around. She stood, and carried Harry back over to the playpen. He fussed. Sure, he wanted to go back there before being burped, but now that Bellatrix was actually putting him in there, he wasn't gonna let that happen. Bellatrix meticulously smacked the back of his thigh, causing Harry to yelp. \"Hey!\" he whined, looking angrily at Bellatrix. \"Shush.\" Bellatrix demanded, popping a pacifier into the boy's mouth.

'It must have been something in that damn milk.' he thought. He groaned angrily. Felling his eyelids droop, he fell back onto the thin mattress of the playpen, falling asleep in seconds. <br>\r\nSeveral hours later, Harry awoke to find the room dark. He looked out the nearest window, and saw how dark it really was. He looked around again, his eyes adjusting to the lack of light. Soon enough, he could see. It was then that he realized that he was't in the sitting room, but once again in that damn nursery. He sighed. He finally noticed that he still had the pacifier in his mouth. Fed up with this, he spat the object out, and sat up. He stood, and climbed out of the crib. As soon as he did, we walked to the door. Reaching for the doorknob, he tuned it, opening the door. He froze when he saw Bellatrix standing there. \"And what is the little baby doing out of bed so late, hmm?\" she asked patronizingly. Harry stood there, silent. He knew he should not be scared of this woman, he should not! But he was. He was so scared, he felt like crying. And that's exactly what he did. Harry began sobbing, wishing he had just stayed in the damn crib. Bellatrix picked him up, and carried him back to the crib. She put a new pacifier in his mouth. She cast a quick charm on it so that it could only be removed by her. Harry calmed down once he was laying down, and fell back asleep. Bellatrix stayed there for a few minutes, leaving once she was sure Harry was asleep.</span></div></div>",

It seems that his current fame and fortune were still not enough for the precious boy who lived, so Harry had somehow cheated himself into the Triwizard Tournament and became the Forth Champion to stand out even more. What a selfish move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter suppressing his jealousy for so long, Ron eventually broke and decided to take Harry down from that high horse as quick and effective as possible. So with some help from his big brothers Fred and George, who he fooled into thinking he would prank Malfoy, Ron managed to spike Harrys breakfast with powerful laxatives. Let\u2019s see how proudly the boy who lived would swagger through the halls after he messed himself in front of his classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoincidentally it was midway through their next Transfiguration class as the laxatives kicked in and screwed the Potter heir up from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief struggle, Harry quickly realized that there was no chance he would be able to fight it off until the end of class. Swallowing his pride, he slowly raised his trembling hand. \u201cPro-Professor McGonagall\u2026 Excuse me, but I really need to go to the toilet right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stern Head of the House Gryffindor looked at him in utter disbelief. \u201cAre you kidding me, Mr. Potter? We are in the middle of an important magical theory. I might allow to go as soon as we start practicing the spell, but for now grit your teeth together and hold it, understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But Professor! It is really urgent, can I please\u2026 ugh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon could barely suppress his laughter as the boy who lived suddenly jumped up and started to perform what could best be described as a potty dance. Hermione stared at Harry as if she saw him for the very first time. The rest of the class was split between utter shock and amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Potter, control yourself!\u201d Professor McGonagall ordered frantically. \u201cYou are a proud lion of Gryffindor, not to mention Hogwarts Champion. Stop behaving like a little baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was already too late. Only a short moment later the laxatives succeeded in overwhelming Harry\u00b4s resistance and he started to pee and poop himself right in the middle of the class.</span></div></div>",

For the utter disgrace Mr. Potter just brought upon our school, I call upon my position as Deputy Headmistress to ensure he receives an appropriate and immediate punishment. Hogwarts doesn\u2019t have any room for naughty babies who are still messing their own pants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to silently debate for a moment what punishment would be fitting before a sinister smile spread over her thin lips. \u201cWell, drastic situations are calling for drastic measures. Let this be a warning for every single one of you to always keep your bladder under control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Professor McGonagall swung her wand and started to transfigure the various items on her desk into the necessary equipment. One after the other she created a set of diapers in Harry\u00b4s size, cream and baby powder, mittens and booties, some baby clothes, a matching bonnet as well as a pacifier. Last but not least she tipped onto the desk itself which promptly turned into a giant changing table. The whole class was stunned by her casual display of magic and continued to watch curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow strip yourself and get onto the table, Mr. Potter. I don\u2019t have the whole day to take care of immature students like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment Harry was scared beyond his wildest dreams. Was his Head of House seriously trying to put him into diapers in front of the entire class? This could not be happening, there was simply no way. \u201cB-But Professor\u2026 This is crazy, you c-can\u00b4t do that. Please, just give me detention for a few weeks, we both know this will never happen again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least we agree on one point Mr. Potter\u201d Professor McGonagall replied emotionless. \u201cThis will indeed never happen again. I will make sure of that personally.\u201d One wave of her wand later most of Harry\u00b4s clothes were vanished into thin air, leaving the poor Hogwarts Champion in nothing but his soaked underwear. \u201cDo you really want this to go the hard way? Get onto the table now!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry had been living with the Dursley family for 4 years after his parents passing. He asked about his parents, they told him car crash, you know the routine. Harry was still undergoing potty training. So pull-ups were a must, though he had to learn how to change himself, since the Dursley's wouldn't do it, now that he seemed compitent enough. But he had little to no training on how to use the potty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during this time period that the family was in London, spoiling Dudley, as usual, and caring little of what Harry was doing, as long as he didn't make a scene. Wondering off, since the Dursleys seemed to care less, harry accidentally had bumped into a stout Giger haired woman. When she saw him, it wasn't one of anger or disgust. In fact, she seemed to have a very caring look about her. Rose cheeks, a motherly smile, and clothes seen on most middle-class families in Great Britain. \"Oh, beg your pardon little dear,\" She stated, as she helped Harry back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ma'am,\" Harry responded, scared she may start scolding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not to worry my dear, you've done nothing wrong. Now what's an adorable little boy like you doing here, by yourself. Where are your parents dear?\" Molly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. They not with me anymores,\" Harry responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know it, but Molly already knew who he was. She just had to be sure she hadn't mistaken the scar on his forehead for something regular, and his admission just confirmed it. \"Well, who looks after you dear?\" Molly asked. She wanted to know where the Dursley's were, knowing they were \"supposed\" to be his caretakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to them, off a distance, with his cousin, before he said, \"My Uncle Vewnon and Auntie Petunia, but dey don't weally care abouts me. Dey always pay attention to Dudley over der.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly couldn't believe her ears. Harry was being mistreated severely by the very family who was supposed to take care of him. It was no wonder he seemed so timid, but she was thankful he was opening up to her. Then she pondered. Sure, she had her own children to care for, but they would be over the moon if they were to become Harry Potter's siblings. Adopted of course, but still siblings. And the Weasleys had been close with the Potters before his parents were killed. So, if she made her plea to the Ministry's council, Molly could become his new mother. \"Well, it may take a little time dear, but, would you like to come and live with me and my family?\" Molly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked at Molly. \"W-Weally?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were full of hope. He was so excited, he hadn't realized he had hugged her. \"Of course dear, just let me talk to your Uncle and Aunt, and then to some others, and we'll get things settled,\" Molly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(We're gonna skip the whole undertaking of Molly adopting him, and say that she got legal custody, after some long discussions, and now is officially his new mother, and Arthur, his new father. Ronald was basically his twin brother, Ginnie his little sister. and the rest of the family, his older siblings.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was amazed at how big the Weasley's house was. They could fit a small army in this place, if need be. All the Weasley siblings were trying to talk wit Harry, excited, he was their brother now. He was a little shy, but opened up quickly. In all the excitement, Harry hadn't realized he had wet his pull-up. Molly was understanding though, and explained to the older siblings, not to give Harry a hard time, since his potty training was under developed, and they understood, seeing as how Ron was a rebel himself in getting potty trained. Perhaps their mom would ease off on him getting trained so fast with his new twin brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly soon took Harry upstairs to his own new room now, which was across from Ron's room. In this room, it was...........</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Harry entered the new room that would be his, which as next door to Ron's, Ginny's, and his new parents rooms, he was surprised. Everything was a nursery in here. As if he were still a baby. He had vague memories of a nursery's looks, based on what he could remember, when his \"former\" cousin had a nursery. But he never got to use one. All he got was a makeshift crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Weaslys wanted to show he was part of their family now, and he wasn't going to be treated any differently then his new siblings. There was everything here, from Diapers and pull-ups, to a child decorated television with movies for kids his age group, to a crib his size, or a bed should he want to lay there, or have one of the parents sleep with him, if he felt scared, to toys, both for what was considered to be for tots younger then him, and toys for his age group. And the floor, walls and furniture had been pushed up, so avoid causing him any injury, a luxury the Dursleys never provided. With magic, it was not trouble getting this together. And when other witches and wizards who knew Harry's parents, or at least of what had happened to him originally, donations came flooding in generously, even those who were across the Great Atlantic Ocean in the U.S. The Weaslys had gone from a Poor family to perhaps one of the richest families in the Wizarding World, Granted, some of the Wizards who considered themselves \"purebloods\" and \"Nobles\" did not contribute, due to their stuck up nature, but this bothered the Weasly's little, and they did not spend the money on meaningless things they all wanted that they'd probably toss out in a couple years time. They used it to repair the house, and now, it looked almost like a castle that would make the Royal Family of the Muggles Buckingham Palace envious. And the Weaslys agreed that much of this money would be used to keep all the children well looked after, and that meant Harry could get spoiled here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Harry's and Ron's and Ginny's rooms had been made bigger, thanks to all the money, so these nurserys could do well for sleep overs. After Harry was able to take in the surroundings of his new room, he asked, \"Um..... Mommy, what are the rules of me being your son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly smiled, \"Well Harry dear. Your just an adorable little tot, and I know that while the Muggles may have tried to hurry you into growing up, here, you don't have to try and act so grown up. I know I was trying to get my little Ron to get potty trained, but, I was being a little to speedy with that. If you wish to wear training pants or a diaper dear, just let me know, and I'll change you into one. And let me know if you need a change once you go. And if you're hungry, just let me know, and you can choose between drinking my mommy milk, like Ron and Ginny do, or you can have whatever we cook for meals dear, it's up to you, and your siblings won't give you grief for it. Do be aware though, when I say it's time for a nap or for bed, you do as mommy says. Oh, and if you want to play with Ron or sleep with him in his room, that's perfectly fine, since we let Ginny sleep with her big brother sometimes. They both may come to sleep with you in your room too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Harry giggle a bit, knowing he wasn't the youngest in the family, but he also didn't have to act like a big grown up so quickly. He was also amazed Molly was willing to breastfeed him. Petunia spoiled Dudley with breastfeeding, but not him. He was given a bottle or real food, but now he had the choice of mothers milk. And he could choose what kind of padding he would want to wear, and his siblings wouldn't mind in the slightest, or tease him about it. He was then told what he could wear in public, but had the choice of going pantless at home, as Ron and Ginny often did, and he was given a run down of how things happened around the house, and when they went into town. It was all a lot more lenient then before the Weaslys adopted him. He was now Harry Potter Weasely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Harry asked for a diaper this time round, wanting the extra protection, now that he had the choice......</span></div></div>",

The war of the wizarding world was over at long last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter years of eluding the Dark Lord at every turn, after facing numerous challenges and problems that had been thrown his way, after spending several months on the run in the search for the Horcruxes, after facing Voldemort off at Hogwarts and finishing him personally, peace had finally been attained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it had not been acquired with cost. So many good people had perished in the war against Voldemort. Albus Dumbledore... Sirius Black... Alastor Moody... Remus Lupin... Nymphadora Tonks... Colin Creevy... even Fred Weasley had fallen victim to that tyrant's cruelty. Harry could not help but feel as though he had been responsible for all those deaths, and that they all could have been avoided if he had been more careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, none of his friends blamed him for any of those deaths. Especially not the Weasleys; they would never turn against him, and they would never accuse him of being responsible for Fred's death. To prove this, the Weasleys had offered for Harry to stay with them after the Battle of Hogwarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Sirius' old estate in London now belonged to Harry, he did not want to go there just yet. Instead, he wanted to spend some time living with people close to him. So he accepted the Weasleys' offer and moved in temporarily. He assured them that he would not stay too long, as he did not want to become a burden. They asserted that they could never regard him as anything of the sort. Even so, to express his gratitude, he decided to aid the Weasleys with their financial difficulties by letting them access his bank account in Gringotts. They had been hesitant to accept, but Harry insisted, claiming it was the least he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had already been a couple weeks after the death of Voldemort. Harry had been living at Godric's Hollow for that entire time. Fred had been buried a week beforehand, and the family was still in mourning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Arthur and his sons Bill, Charlie, and Ron were at Diagon Alley. They were helping George expand the twins' joke shop as a way to honor Fred's memory. Percy was busy working for the Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Ginny was spending the week with Hermione and Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo at present, Molly Weasley was the only one there. She enjoyed spending some one-on-one time with Harry. In the six years she had known him, she had come to think of him as one of her own children. He had grown attached to her family, as well. They were the closest thing he had to a real family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, Molly looked outside and noticed Harry was at the garden, chasing away the gnomes. That was one of the things he did to be helpful around the house. Molly appreciated that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed that while Harry was able to successfully clear the gnomes away, he seemed distracted. It was as though he was depressed or saddened by something.</span></div></div>",

I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly stepped close to the boy in glasses, placed her hand on his shoulder, and remarked \"Could you tell me why? Does it have to do with... recent events?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhat,\" Harry revealed, \"You know that legend that helped us defeat Voldemort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly winced at the name, but nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry continued with \"Well, one of the three relics mentioned was known as a 'Resurrection Stone.' Its purpose was to bring people back from the dead. While the legend did not exactly portray it as a pleasant object, I was holding out hope that if I managed to acquire it in real life, I... well, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, sweetie?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed again and illuminated \"I was hoping I could bring back everybody we've lost. Primarily my parents. I ultimately DID find the Stone, but it turns out all it can do is bring back the projection of someone's life force for a short time. It was incapable of bringing them back permanently. Although I was kind of expecting that to be the case... I can't help but feel depressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly frowned and hugged the teenaged boy. She whispered \"I'm so sorry, honey. I... I had no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lightly hugged back and told her \"It's alright, Mrs. Weasley. I'm used to being disappointed. It's just... I was really hoping that just once in my life, I could know what it's like to having a parent who loves and cares for me. Don't get me wrong; I'm grateful for everything you and your family have done for me. But still... I don't know what it's like to be cared for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly almost felt as though she was going to cry. She could not imagine what growing up must have been for this fine boy. After everything he'd been through, he deserved to be loved and taken care of. She wished she could fulfill his desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she got an idea. Perhaps she could...</span></div></div>",

Having lost one of her own children, he could only imagine how much pain she must have been in. Maybe if he agreed, he would be able to make her feel better, as well. He knew he could never replace Fred, but he would enable Molly to be a mother once more. Aside from that, maybe wearing diapers and acting like a baby for a while would actually be fun. It could also help him alleviate some stress and forget about his troubles. Plus, he and Molly would be alone for the next several days.

If you don't mind, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly grinned again and asserted \"I don't mind at all, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then helped Harry out of his clothes. She started by untying his shoes and pulling them off with his socks. After that, she unzipped his jacket and slipping it off his shoulders. She had him hold up his arms and then she took off his shirt. After that, she removed his pants and boxer shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was a little embarrassed about being fully naked in front of Molly, but she did not seem uncomfortable in the least. She assured Harry that everything was alright, and that he had nothing to feel embarrassed about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all he had on was his glasses. With some assistance from Molly, Harry hopped onto the changing table and laid flat on his back. He looked up at her and stated \"I guess this is it. I'm ready when you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Molly avowed. She then reached underneath the table and pulled out a pair of fluffy, thick white cloth diapers and four safety pins. She also brought out a bottle of oil and powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly then proceeded to diaper Harry. She started by covering his private area with a thin layer of baby powder and rubbing it in. After that, she poured some oil on her hands and gently massaged it into his skin. Then she picked up the cloth diapers, lifted Harry up by his ankles, and slid them underneath his bottom. After setting him back down, she spread his legs and pulled the front of the diapers up between his legs. She then used her right hand to hold the front in place, and she brought up the left side of the diapers and pinned it in place with two of the pins. After that, she hold onto the front of the diapers with her left hand, and she brought up the right side and pinned it in place with the other two pins. She made sure to pull them tight and snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blushed a deep red as his best friend's mother diapered him. After the diapers were secure on him, Molly helped Harry off the changing table and got him back on his feet. Harry gazed down at his diapers and used his hands and eyes to examine them. They fit him perfectly; they were neither too loose nor too tight, and they were surprisingly comfortable. They were very thick and bulky though; he could hardly put his legs together. He actually liked the feel of wearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done looking over his new attire, he looked back up at Molly. Ironically, Harry was now a couple inches taller than the red-haired woman. He softy mumbled \"Well, uh... thank you, Mrs. Weasley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled again and told him \"You're welcome, sweetie. And please, just call me 'Molly.' Or 'Mommy,' if you prefer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was perplexed by that, but given the circumstances, he could get in to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly then took his hand in hers and pronounced \"Now come with me. It's time for the Baby to have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry scoffed at being called 'Baby' and left the attic alongside Molly. He tried to walk, but he ended up waddling due to the thickness of the cloth diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they arrived back in the first floor. Molly kissed Harry's forehead, patted Harry's diapered bottom and asked him \"So what would you like to do now, Harry?\"</span></div></div>",

Dudley had enough for both of us, but the word 'share' wasn't exactly in his vocabulary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie,\" Molly said sincerely, hugging the boy and giving his diapered bottom a few pats, \"Luckily, as a mother of seven, we have plenty of old toys around here. Would you like to see them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Harry told her gladly, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly then left the room and returned with two crates' worth of old baby toys. They looked like ordinary playthings, only with a hint ofmagic to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else you need, dear?\" Molly asked the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I've got everything I need, Mrs. Wea- er... 'Mommy,'\" Harry revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly grinned again and kissed Harry on the forehead again. Then she pronounced \"I'll go ahead and make some lunch for us. You just relax and have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded his head and watched as the red-haired woman went to the kitchen. Once he was alone, he turned to the toys and began playing with them. There were fake wands, building blocks that could stack themselves, coloring books that changed hue or made themselves blank again, wizard dolls that moved and talked, and a multitude of other interesting objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry got in some time with all of the objects. As he played, his attention kept shifting to the thick padding between his legs. It was amazingly comfortable and soothing, and it smelled very sweet. In an odd way, the diapers felt very reassuring to him. He was happy to wear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he was a little self-conscious that the diapers were the ONLY things he was wearing apart from his glasses, but since Mrs. Weasley was the only other person there and she had been the one who diapered him, he could put up with that. In fact, he found that he liked having no clothing on other than his diapers. It made him feel less constricted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry had fun with his toys, he could hear the sounds of cooking in the next room, and he could smell food being prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout forty-five minutes later, Molly came back into the room and pronounced \"Lunch is almost ready, sweetie. Where would you like to sit while we eat; in the dining room, or out on the porch?\"</span></div></div>",

So if anyone came by while he and Molly were outside, it would produce an extremely awkward situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, Harry had been outside when Molly first gave him the idea to be her baby. He knew it was a very lovely day. The weather and climate were too pleasing to spend the time indoors. Plus, people rarely ever visited the Weasleys without prior notice. So the odds of them having company that day were very slim. In addition to that, Harry had developed a bit of a fondness for daring activities. Going outside in just a diaper would certainly be a thrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some consideration, he declared to Molly \"Let's eat outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and responded with \"Alright, dear. Just a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly left the room and returned a few minutes later with a highchair that was large enough to fit Harry. She gestured for the diapered boy to follow her outside, and he waddled after her. As stepped out through the door, Harry felt the cool summer air on his bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly placed the highchair on the center of the porch and told him \"Get on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry obediently went over to the highchair and climbed onto it. At one point, his thickly padded bottom was sticking out conspicuously; Molly took advantage of that and gave him a few gentle pats on the back of his diaper. He felt them, but just barely; he was diapered very thickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Harry was comfortably seated in the highchair, Molly closed and locked the tray. The fit was a little tight, but Harry could put up with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly left again and came back outside with two plates of food. She set one of them down on the tray to Harry's highchair and she put the other one on an adjoining table. After that, she looked to the diapered teen and asked \"Would you like me to feed you, honey? Or would you rather feed yourself?\"</span></div></div>",

Once she was done, she picked up a forkful, held it up to his head, and cooed \"Open up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry giggled and opened his mouth, allowing Molly to feed him the first bit of lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few minutes, Molly alternated between eating from her own plate and feeding Harry from his. Before too long, both plates were empty, and Harry was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you care for a drink, Harry?\" Molly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized he was quite thirsty. He lightly nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly then got out a baby bottle filled with milk. She held it up to Harry's lips. In response, he latched on and began suckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him two or three minutes to drain the bottle. Every now and then, Molly gently patted him on his bare back, telling him how good a boy he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, Harry let out a soft belch. He blushed and murmured \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly just giggled. \"That's perfectly normal, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly then wiped Harry's mouth and removed his bib.

There was nobody else around, and it was very peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Harry felt a slight ache in his bladder. He instinctively tried to hold it in, but then he remembered what he was wearing. Still, just because he was wearing a diaper, that did not mean he had to use it. Even so...</span></div></div>",

Ultimately, he decided to stop trying to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, he lessened his hold on his bladder, and allowed himself to let go. There was the soft hissing sound as he began to wet his diaper. A warm, moist feeling began to spread throughout his padded crotch. To Harry's surprise, it was not that unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finished soaking his diaper, Molly grinned and said \"Good boy. Now, let's get you into a fresh nappy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly took Harry's hand and led him back inside.

She left and returned a minute later with the changing supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly proceeded to change Harry's diaper. She had him lie down on a towel, and she unpinned the wet padding. After wiping his crotch, she sprinkled in another layer of powder. She slid two more cloth diapers under Harry's bottom, pulled them up between his legs, and pinned them securely in place. She examined the nappies closely, and patted them when she was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" she muttered in satisfaction. She gathered up the used diaper and stated \"I'm going to do some cleaning.

He was not expecting anyone to come by today. He wondered who it could have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found out a moment later, he heard a feminine voice called out \"I'm home! Mum, Harry, are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the voice of Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister and Harry's crush. Somehow, knowing that just made him even more anxious. By the sound of her footsteps, she was on her way to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here, Ginny,\" Molly called out from the kitchen. To Harry's relief, Ginny's footsteps began to fade away, meaning she was now headed to the kitchen instead of the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mum,\" Ginny greeted her mother, \"What's that smell? Smells like baby powder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Molly remarked, \"Listen, Ginny. There's something I need to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever she said next must have been a whisper, as Harry could not hear her speak. Even so, he could imagine what Molly was telling her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Ginny appeared at the entrance to the living room with her mother. Harry noticed her immediately, but he promptly looked away, his face red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny seemed stunned, but she did not taunt or ridicule Harry. All she did was snicker a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to Harry and knelt beside him. Harry felt a soft hand on his back, and she said \"It's alright, Harry. Mum told me about your 'second childhood.' I'm not going to make fun of you or anything like that. Surely you know me better than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was surprised and relieved at the same time. He gradually turned to face his crush. She was smiled sweetly at him and said \"Truthfully... you look adorable, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blushed again. He fully realized that while Ginny was fully clothed in jeans, a shirt, and a light jacket, he was still only wearing his diapers. Their difference in clothing really unsettled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny did not seem the least bit bothered, though. In fact, she hugged him. He happily returned the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you're having fun,\" she observed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally regained his voice and told her \"Well, I... I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I could join you,\" Ginny suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join him how?\" Molly inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wanted to know that answer himself.</span></div></div>",

He already viewed Ginny as one of the most beautiful girls he knew, and in her current getup... she looked gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny must have noticed Harry was staring at her, as her cheeks turned slightly pink and she gazed awkwardly off to the side.

Seeing this, Molly chuckled and said as she walked closer to them \"No need to be embarrassed. It's sweet that you two are so close. You are adorable together. And not just because of the nappies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mum,\" Ginny said appreciatively, still somewhat embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mummy, sweetie,\" Molly reminded her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mummy,\" Ginny corrected herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly smiled and held her hands out to the two diapered teenagers. They each took one of her hands, and she pulled them to their feet. She announced \"Come on; let's put you both down for a nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Ginny were by no means tired, but since they were going along with this babying routine, they agreed it could not hurt to take a short nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly held their hands as she led them upstairs. They waddled alongside her, sneaking a casual glimpse and grin at each other every few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the three of them were back up in the attic. Molly used her wand to enlarge the crib so that it was big enough to accommodate two young adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she declared, \"It's a little drafty up here, so perhaps you two would like to wear something over your nappies? Or, if you'd prefer to wear just your nappies, I could get you some extra blankets to keep you warm. Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do Harry and Ginny do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry and Ginny stood thinking for about a minute. As curious as they were about baby clothes and although they wanted to wear them at some point, they both felt it would have been more fun to sleep in a crib in just their diapers, first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially since they'd be together. Harry thought there was something inexplicably appealing about seeking Ginny in nothing but her cute padding. Likewise, she appears to have similar thoughts about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Harry turned to Molly and said \"I... I guess we'll just sleep like this for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we'll be fine in just our nappies,\" Ginny agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly smiled and nodded at their decision. \"That is perfectly alright with me, darlings. But first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, she took out her wand, pointed it at Harry's diapers, and muttered a soft incantation. Then she pointed it at Ginny's diapers and did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try taking them off now,\" she beckoned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs odd as that suggestion sounded, Harry and Ginny decided to indulge the latter's mother. They discovered that their diapers were somehow locked in place. They were still comfortable and still fit comfortably, but the pins could not be undone or ripped off, and the material could not be slid down or torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do... Mummy?\" Harry asked, a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little insurance,\" Molly revealed proudly, \"Only I can change your nappies now. While this spell is active, you cannot remove your own nappies or each other's nappies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that, Mummy?\" Ginny asked, also a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To ensure that you two won't get up to TOO much mischief in bed,\" Molly replied, in a somewhat devious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum...\" Ginny groaned, blushing furiously. Her mother gave her a somewhat displeased look, and then the red-haired girl rolled her eyes and corrected herself with \"Mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was blushing, too. He could understand Mrs. Weasley's concern over the two of them sleeping together, but he wished she could have been a little more subtle than THAT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to embarrass you,\" Molly assured them, \"You'll thank me for this in time. Believe me, I want grandchildren someday. But before you two decide to have babies of your own, enjoy your own time as babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mummy,\" said Harry. Ginny just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly Weasley then helped her daughter and her daughter's boyfriend into the large crib. Not only was it big enough to hold two of them; there may have even been room for a third person. That was intriguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly covered Harry and Ginny with some soft blankets. After that, she brought up the rail of the crib and locked it in place. There was a roof on this particular crib, meaning Harry and Ginny were trapped inside. Of course, they could Apparate out, but they were pretending to be babies, and babies did not know how to Apparate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two teens were settled down, Molly turned out the lights to the nursery and headed to the door. Just before she stepped out, she turned back and said \"I'll be back in a couple hours. Sweet dreams, you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Ginny were all alone, stuck in a crib, cuddled up with one another, wearing nothing but thick white cloth diapers, which they could not take off by themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid they get some rest, or get \"friendly\" with each other?</span></div></div>",

Let's do it.\" Then they passionately kissed each other. During the kiss, the toungs were connecting and having a love fest in the mouths. Then the kiss broke and Harry gave neck kisses, in which Ginny moaned. Then Harry went to her breasts, and started to suck on one, drinking the milk. Ginny leaned over to her other breast, moaning, and sucking on her breast as she is also drinking the milk. They both drink the milk and then they touched the diapers. Their love is so strong, the diapers came off and Molly's spell wore off. Harry goes and puts his wiener into Ginny's girl spot, breaking the wall, and blood, just for the first time. Ginny said \"Ow.\" Harry said \"Sorry. I didn't know.\" Ginny giggled and said \"It's ok. I believe this happens to first timers.\" They smile. And soon pain was replaced by pleasure. Then Harry goes in and sticks his wiener into her butt, then he humps her and they both moan. Ginny says \"Harry. Yes. Keep going. Yes. Harry Potter. Do it. Fuck me.\" Then they did it. Ginny said \"Harry.\" Harry said \"Ginny.\" Then he releases into her and they lay down. Then Harry goes to her girl spot and licks it, and Ginny puts Harry's wiener into her mouth, sucking on it. They both kept going until climax. Then they both shoot out their serums, with both licking and swallowing it. Then they put their diapers back on and layed back to normal. They breathed and smiled at each other. Ginny says \"I love you, Harry Potter.\" Harry said \"I love you too, Ginny Weasley.\" Then, they kissed and sleep cuddling t for a half an hour. Then gurgles woke them up, the milk took its effect. They have to poop. Harry said \"I have to poop.\" Ginny says \"I have to poop too.\" Then they both said \"But we have diapers on, so we will use them.\" They both smile and pushed. Harry and Ginny grunted. \"Hmp...\"<br>\r\n\"BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAART!\"<br>\r\n\"BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAART!\"<br>\r\nHarry and Ginny sighed and said \"Ah...much better...\" Then they sat down and felt their mushy mess warm and pleasure their butts and privates. Harry says \"So warm.\" Ginny says \"And feels good too.\" Then Harry got on top of Ginny. Then they hump with their messy diapers, enjoying it. Harry says \"Yes. This is great. I love it.\" Ginny says \"Me too. It's amazing.\" They kept humping for a few minutes, enjoying their messy diapers, the pleasure and each other. Then they collasped and breath. Harry says \"I love you, Ginny.\" Ginny says \"I love you too, Harry.\" Then they kiss and fall back asleep in each other's arms, cuddling and enjoying the feeling of their messy diapers. They wake up a few hours later, they smile at each other. Then Molly came in. Molly says \"Hello, my sweet babies.\" Harry and Ginny says \"Hello, Mummy.\" Molly sniffs the air and says \"Looks like you enjoyed your nap and you both need a change.\" Molly excitedly changed them both. Throwed out the dirty diapers, cleaned their butts up, powdered them, and got them into new clean diapers. Molly says \"All set. I haven't changed a mess this big since you were little. I'm so glad you two are my babies.\" Then she happily got them to the play area. Harry and Ginny says \"Us too, mummy. Us too.\" They all smiled and she leaves them to play. Ginny says \"Pregenancious.\" And a pregnancy test shows up. Harry says \"Ginny?\" Ginny says \"I just wanna see. Just in case.\" They both smile and they did the test and it came out as...</span></div></div>",
