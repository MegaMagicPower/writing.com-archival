            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Have you ever wished you could trade your old, boring life for a brand new one?  That was the question posited by the numerous advertisements for a company called New Horizons.  The company had been around for just over a year; some Silicon Valley startup.  I\u2019d never it to my family, but I sometimes found myself looking at the site; tempted to click on the button to set up a free consult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you get the wrong idea, I love my family very much; my mom (Abigail) is great and my twin sister (Kelsey) is great too.  But ever since I turned 13, I\u2019ve found my life to be rather boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose it might have something to do with the fact that I\u2019m not very popular at school; my only two friends being Kyle Williams and David Beltran.  The three of us were a popular target for the bullies, and members of the popular clique, at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe one of these days, I\u2019ll finally have the courage to click on that button\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today started like any other Saturday morning; I woke up at 7:45 to the smell of bacon and sausage coming from the kitchen downstairs.  Getting out of bed, I trudged downstairs to find that Kelsey and Mom were sitting at the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe looks they were giving me, as I took a seat at the table, were rather off-putting.  It was like they had something they wanted to tell me, but couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it.  After a few moments of them looking at me like that, I finally relented and said, \u201cWhy are you guys looking at me like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Kelsey turned to face each other; after getting a nod of approval from Kelsey, Mom turned to me and said, \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that you\u2019re unhappy with your life, Kevin; you feel like you\u2019re meant to be somewhere else.\u201d Getting up, Mom grabbed an envelope from the counter and handed it to me.  \u201cYour sister and I feel this might boost your spirits a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the envelope, I pulled out a pamphlet and other items from New Horizons.  Shocked, I looked at Mom and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you know what it is, sweetie.\u201d Looking sad, Mom said, \u201cThis is your chance to create a better, happier life for yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what I did about the company, I was genuinely surprised that Mom and Kelsey would do this.  \u201cI appreciate the gesture, guys; but I-I can\u2019t do this.\u201d Looking at them both, I said, \u201cIf I go through with this; chances are that I\u2019ll never see you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust knowing that you\u2019ll be happy will be enough for me.\u201d Embracing me, Mom said, \u201cIf nothing else, you can always email us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way I could ever properly thank Mom and Kelsey for what they were doing for me.  Despite the risk involved, that I\u2019d probably ever see them again, they were willing to make the necessary sacrifice to ensure that I was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tears coming down my face, I got up and hugged them.  \u201cThank you guys, y-you have no idea how much this means to me.\u201d Looking at them, I said, \u201cBut are you okay with the thought of never seeing me again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been happy for a long time, Kevin; that\u2019s pretty obvious.\u201d Smiling, tears coming down her face, Kelsey said, \u201cIf doing this means you\u2019ll finally have a chance at happiness, then we\u2019d be crazy not to go through with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have an appointment at their local office at noon; which should give you plenty of time to tie up any loose ends.\u201d Wiping tears from her eyes, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you so much, Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, mom.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI-I\u2019m going to get dressed; then I\u2019ll go talk with Kyle and David.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Kevin is an unhappy teenager, often imagining what it would be like to lead another life.  One day his mom and sister give him a gift to do just that - a reservation with <i>New Horizons</i>; a company that specializes in giving people the life they've always dreamed of.  There is, however, a catch; if Kevin goes through with this, there's a chance he'll never see his family again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. Use proper grammar<br>\r\n2. No descriptive sex scenes (keep it PG)<br>\r\n3. Be creative with storylines but keep close to the original idea.<br>\r\n4. Use the 1st person perspective (I, I'm, I'll, etc) - keep it from Kevin's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere will be an outline of the characters.</td>",
