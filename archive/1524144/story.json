Juliette is wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt and short panties and she's barefoot, so you can delight yourself watching her nice slender feet.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Juliette says: \"I'm thirsty... I'll go to take a drink.\" She gets up and walks towards her house's front door and meanwhile you contemplate her gorgeous bare feet while they softly crush the grass.<br>\r\nWhile you're waiting, you suddenly feel a little strange... then you notice that you're shrinking! You don't know why this is happening, but you do know this is really happening!<br>\r\nWhen you're about 1cm tall, you stop shrinking and you notice that the grass is now higher than you...</span></div></div>",

Then the intense view of your girlfriend about to squash the both of you was almost your end. Somehow, you managed to leap and scramble up between your girlfriends toes. Beneath her enormous sole is the crushed remains of your enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliette doesn't think twice about the spider she just stepped on. After all, she's always out here, barefoot and crushing bugs in her garden. It's just yet another one, trampled into the dirt by her. She spins, and sits down on the bench. Taking a long sip of her lemonade, she looks around. Where have you gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly crawling, you start realizing what it's like to be a bug. On your girlfriend's beautiful skin, you're a pest. At least you'd be seen as one if she felt you moving around. But what else could you do? On the ground you'd be at risk of being beneath those feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the moments drag on with you not deciding what else to do, Juliette decides for you. Her other foot raises. For a brief time, you're lost staring at the soft, slender sole of the woman you love. Her toes wiggle ever so slightly and cascades of dry dirt fall free from her skin. Instinctively you duck down, pressing your body flat to the top of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her toes point down toward you and the truth becomes obvious. She's about to rub her foot on the one you're on! Juliette's smooth sole drops from above and presses you down. By some miracle it's soft enough to just press the air out of your lungs. It's hot and humid beneath her foot too. The heavy weight upon your body also makes it hard to breathe. But then, she moves her gigantic sole back and forth. Rubbing you against the top of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted and wishing she'd just let up, you can't help but admire the scent. It's a welcoming smell. Pleasant, even though it's from your girlfriend's sweaty feet. They're still crushing you though!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her foot raises for a moment, cool air rushes in around you. If you're going to escape, now is the time.</span></div></div>",

It seemed they had just opened up a new entrance and many of them were pouring out. They began to move the dirt about and clear up debris, while other disappeared, presumably to forage food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant hill must've been a good four hundred feet away, but you knew that soon enough that some of the ants would go in your direction and attack you.

Looking back toward the grass beneath the bench, you see a few ants still milling about. One stops suddenly and seems to perk up. Waving it's antenna in the air, it's contemplating something. A moment later it looks in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the pounding, enormous feet of your girlfriend heading your way, and an ant that has just taken notice of you for whatever reason, you're trapped. Sure, you could trust Juliette, if you could get her attention. She might just think you're a bug too. Which of course, you'd be stepped on by those pretty feet you love so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option would be to just run into the grass at the side of the path. But what dangers lurk in there?

As you wait and innocently think of what Juliette's feet would smell like at that size, a few of them turn toward you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're about your size. Relatively small ants, but still like horses to your one centimetre height. Before long they surround you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's pretty terrifying. Their clacking mandibles. Dark unfeeling eyes. What did they want? As images of bugs tearing apart carcasses in time lapse play through your mind, you question, \"Do ants do that?\" At this size, you were nothing to them though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne lunges forward and snaps it's pincers right in front of you. The view is horrific and you instantly drop down, crawling along the ground under another ant and planning to scramble away. At their size, it's awkward to try and maneuver around to get you. If anything, dashing under this one saved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and preparing to run however, you stop cold. Looming high above is someone gigantic.

Then, the two giantess stops right into a table with a jar of orange juice.<br>\r\n\"Let's see if there is some juice\" Juliet said.<br>\r\nYou still running and stops right in front of Hannah's heel. It's so smooth, so soft... so... Adorable... You wonder about the ant, the mushroon, and the poor mantis, all of them crushed by a soft and cute sole.<br>\r\nWait! You need help!<br>\r\nThen, you see that yells for help are useless. You will...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, her feet were just as cute and beautiful as Hannah's. You always thought being the boyfriend of a girl with adorable feet who was always barefoot in warm days was your greatest luck.<br>\r\nMaybe there was something positive about being shrunk: those four lovely feet were now bigger than a car, so the pleasure was bigger too. They were also feet who stomped, destroyed and killed, but this seemed to make them just more exciting.<br>\r\nStroking and kissing without stopping, you finally make Hannah notice something... a shadow covers you, and you are slowly grabbed by Hannah's huge hand. You are being lifted higher, and higher, and higher...<br>\r\nFinally, you reach Hannah's face and you can see your reflection in her pupils.

Hannah murmurs: \"This is... not... a bug! Look!\" Juliette recognizes you too and makes the same expression.<br>\r\nBingo! They understood!

Can you get Juliet please?\" You rushed through your words, stutering at your next sentence. A finger rested on your mouth, gental and swift. <br>\n\"I understand. But... Juliet smooshes anything small, i might not manage to stop her in time... \" She paused, looking past you at a flower. You noticed she was as shy of you as you were of her. A tongue stuck out and ran along closed lips. \"You need a place to hide so... um...\" looked up, taking a sip from her water. You waited patiently for her response, watching the cool liquid vanish. \"Anyway... a place to hide... i... liked it the way you woke me up.\" Your face dropped, and your mouth hung open as her signature grin spread across her face. She looked too the side and smiled. \"I know you want to be there too and.. well.\" You waved your arms and yelled out no but she was too caught up in her words, \"I'll like it too! So... thats fine, right? Your just so soft and warm...\" She talked with her head in the clouds, thnking back as she slipped you into the mountains. The white fabric squeezed you against her boob, stopping your protests. \"It's ok right?\" She waited for your response. When no response came she shrugged her shoulders and slipped you in, slapping you lingtly in place. <br>\n\"En-joy! I - Know i will!\" She sang in a sing song voice as she skipped into her house, happily.</span></div></div>",

At least it'd take almost no strength to hang on to this, the welcoming fibers adhering to his sweaty hands. Then a thought struck him. Had the teenager even realized Alex had fallen out? He could be left hanging here (no pun intended) forever if he didn't muster the energy to climb into the pocket. Even then, what would happenw hen Hannah sat down? Surely she'd have to realize he fell...<br>\r\n\"Alex? Alex, you still in there?\" The blonde giantess reached into her cleavage, fingering around for Alex but gripped empty air. \"Oh no! He must have fallen down!\" Alex yelled at the top of his lungs, but he was now too far down to be heard by Hannah. She retraced her steps, watching the ground. She even nervously examined her foot, but found no evidence. \"Maybe he just fell... lower, not off.\" She examined the bottom of her shirt, her arms, and finally her pans. There, clear as ever, was her sister's boyfriend. Dangling from her pants pocket. It was laughable. She didn't laugh.</span></div></div>",

After all, you barely even grabbed hold before you plummeted to the floor. Hannah grabs you, gently this time and places you evenly on her shoulder. You shift to a more comofrtable position next to her neck. This way you won't fall very easily and she'll be able to hear you well.

The sleep-memory fog lifts and you remember the past day's events. You'd been shrunk to about a centimeter's height and had nearly been crushed several times by his friends who were then giantesses to him.

Maybe someone else found you while you slept. Your tiny body shudders at the prospect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear Hannah shifting in her sleep from the bed, which as you look you realize is very far away. You are to the right of the doorway, a dresser to further right. The door is closed, and you can see morning's light seeping through the frame. Still in awe that you'd been placed in shuch an odd area, you try to climb the walls of the flip-flop. You discover you're too short to see over them and  they don't have any holds. Someone who'd put you here had intended to trap you. You hoped it was just Hannah playing a little joke. She'd been so nice to you the night before it seemed unlikely she'd mean to harm you. The words appeared genuine. But back the problem at hand. At just a centimeter tall the flip flop rose high above his head. Of course he could walk through the part where the toe openign was. You're dismayed as you realize that side is blocked by the dresser. The back then. It is also covered, by the corner of Hannah's room. Yeah, this was definately a trap.

Not Juliette or their mom. Younger, more to Hannah's age. With terrifying recognition you find that it is Hannah's Hispanic friend, Rosa. She probabably had no idea you were small, and to make things worse you knew she owned a pair of white flip-flops! You'd seen her wearing them a few days before at Hannah's birthday party where'd she'd turned seventeen. The teenage girl above you didn't look at the shoes, so you hope they belong to Hannah or anyone else but Rosa. Trying once more in vain to grab the strap, you resign to watching the scene unfold. Hannah lay sleeping on the bed, where you'd last seen her, and Rosa tiptoed to her side, which to you sounded like a waterfall. \" Hannah, I didn't wanna wake you, but I just came to say hey and pick up my flip-flops I left her at your party. Hannah?\" <br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, sure Rosa. They're right by my door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Hannah,\" Rosa said, already advancing toward the shoes and more importantly you. If she puts them on, you're dead. Just then Hannah snaps fully awake, shouting at Rosa to stop. Rosa hangs her foot in mid-air, the sole of the tan foot hovering over you. Rosa looked back at Hannah, wondering why her friend had just screamed at her. \"Just, um, you wanna go to schoolw ith me today? Like, I can drive you if you want. Don't bother getting your shoes on yet, we can chill for a few more minutes.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, Hannah. I'll pick up my care later if you'll drive me after classes.\" Rosa brings her foot back to the floor, a foot away from your prison. <br>\r\n\"You just go get ready, you can have the bathroom first.\" Rosa walks through the door, agreeing.

Hannah had tripped on one of the brick in the patio! Alex yelled in surprise and pain as he was barraged by Hannah's boob. hannah also screamed, considering she was about to fall onto a brick pavement headfirst. Juliette heard her scream, and she dashed to the patio in with adrenaline coursing through her veins. She crushed a few bugs on the way but barely noticed, her senses in 'emergency mode'. She arrived to see Hannah, bruised and bleeding, but nothing serious. Oddly enough, though, she was not even seeming to notice. All she was doing was looking at her hand. No -- something IN her hand.<br>\r\nAfter getting a closer look and asking if Hannah was alright, her sister showed what was in her hands.

It was wriggling around in her grasp, but she didn't see anything on it that'd identify it as a bug. In fact, it almost looked like a tiny human. Hannah laughed at the prospect and kept eying her new bug friend.<br>\r\n\"Why were you tickling my toes, little guy?\" A warm smile covered her face. At first she'd been bored here, but now this was interesting. Just then it dawned on her. This WAS a man! A tiny one at that, btu a man. Not just any one either, she deduced. it looked a lot like... Juliette's boyfriend! Alex!<br>\r\n\"So this is where you dissapeared to, huh Alex?\" Hannah giggled once more, scarign Alex with her new habit. \"It's okay. I'll get you help...\" A smile of pure mischief danced on her lips. \"... eventually.\" Alex tried to say something, but Hannah couldn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet Juliette wouldn't eb happy to know that you were having fun with my feet would she?\" Hannah teased. Alex yelled again.<br>\r\n\"What's that? Put you down? I bet you'll wanna rephrase that. Look how high up you are!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm kinda bored, so I'll let you play with my feet a bit more.\" Still holding Alex, the blonde goddess liften her enormous foot up and placed Alex between her big toe and the other one. \"Hahaha, this must be so degrading for you, Alex, but I bet you like it. it's not every day you get to be my little slave.

In normality Juliette always got the better boyfriends, first picks, etcetera, etcetera. Now it was Hannah's turn to have a little fun, and Alex was her ticket. Not only would she leverage over Juliette but she'd also get to play with her boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was thinking these things she felt Alex dislodging himself. Panic of losing him came to her brain. She looked down, just in time to see him leap from her foot and into a clump of iris. \"Damn, how will I find him now?\" she called sarcastically. Hannah lifted herself from the lawn chair and stodd over Alex, hands on her hips. The leaves had cushioned his fall, but he was still in plain sight. Hannah wondered what she should do. Should he crush him right there as disobedience? That wouldn't be as fun. Pluck him from the iris and show Alex who's boss? Sure. In a quick movement she garbbed at where she saw Alex fall, her hands groping air and leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you wanna play hide and seek? Sure, but let me warn you this isn't exactly a fair game for you.\" Hannah laughed at the little man's plaight, sauntering over the iris and letting her shadow cover the hiding place. The titaness squatted down on top of the spot, just an inch from the ground. WIth Alex at about one centimeter tall she was right above him. \"This is just too fun,\" she said to herself. Hannah once again stood up, one foot on either side of the iris clump.</span></div></div>",

You know how Juliette feels about insects. As if on cue, you hear another rumbling to the side of your clump and see it is Juliette, wondering what Hannah was doing.

There was only one option, and you run to Hannah's foot. She saw you and pretends to scratch her foot, in fact picking you up and placing you in her shirt. From there she could hear you.

Juliette, now fully recovered from the shock of nearly murdering the one person in the world she loved the most, listened intently, cringed, gasped, sighed at the parts of the story appropriate, and looked ready to hug me as tight as she could once my story was finished. Hannah, on the other hand, looked down guiltily as she realized that the prank she pulled on Juliette could have ended in my death, and by the end of my story was a bit misty-eyed and had a slightly quivering lip. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   After recounting the tales of my adventures with my girlfriend and her sister it occurred to me that I really had no idea how this happened, and while retelling the day served no obvious purpose it did help to clear my mind a bit. I knew a few things: one, whatever happened to me happened without obvious purpose, two, the effects were sudden and severe, and three, neither Juliette or Hannah had the slightest idea of what happened to me or how it happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Immediately after that train of thought ended I heard Juliette boom out,<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"> \" Oh sweetie, \"</font> as she reached out to grasp me. While my instincts told me to run, I chose to stay and let the goddess that was now my girlfriend pull me into a gentle embrace with her chest. It was the first comforting thing that had happened to me all day, And I was loving it: her breasts were warm, soft, and smelled of jasmine, her heartbeat melted the fear I had, and her comforting words of, <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\" I love you so much,\"</font> gave me the strength to get to the bottom of this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   At that moment, while caught up in my girlfriend's embrace...      </span></div></div>",
