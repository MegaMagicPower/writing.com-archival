As light begun to cast over the Pride lands all of thee animals begun to stir, ready for the day that was about to begin as the cycle of existence begun anew as it did for every day. There was one lion whom couldn\u2019t wait for this day to begin for he was going to the watering hole with one of his closest friends, this was a rare occasion for the past couple of months they couldn\u2019t go to the watering hole in quite some time due to the frequency that hyenas begun to stalk the Pride lands it was becoming more a nuisance of late, Mufasa told his son Simba that he couldn\u2019t relax at the local watering hole due for him not knowing how to defend himself against the much larger hyenas. He knew that he was just a cub and had no chance against the larger more daring hyena\u2019s but he wanted to see his friend Nala, it was a long while since they have seen each other since her mother Sarafina has been sick of late and Nala has been taking care of her ailing mother the best that she can, Rafiki the wise old baboon has looked at Sarafina and stated to the young cub \u201cDon\u2019t fret my dear your mother will be just fine, go out and play now.\u201d Still worried about what was to become of her mother she didn\u2019t know what exactly what do to, taking the old monkey\u2019s advice seemed to be her only choice at this moment, Haven\u2019t seen the daylight in quite some time due to being in her den for weeks the light blinded her with the shear force of its rays. Trying to get used to the brilliance of the sun Nala slowly took her first steps out of the cave and into the Pride lands.<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\tAwaiting her arrival was her good friend Simba, it was so unlike him to be so patient with anything that he didn\u2019t want to do but he must have know how hard of a time it was for Nala as her mother was so ill and she didn\u2019t know what to do about this, trying to hide her worry she begun to smile a tender smile as the two of them made their way to the watering hole. \u201chow is she doing\u201d Simba asked, concerned for Nala\u2019s mother and what was to become of her as she was one of the main provider of the Pride\u2019s food supply, Sarafina was one f the fiercest lioness around, she could take a hippo down by herself if she ever wanted to. \u201cshe is actually doing great Rafiki said she will be up and about in a week or so\u201d Nala said confidently, she believed the monkey and hope that what he has stated be the truth.<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Finally at the watering hole it seemed as if Nala\u2019s fears had all but subsided she began to seem like her old self again as she laughed and played with her best friend Simba. Splashing and enjoying themselves with the occasional power mach they hardly realized that there were a couple of animals that were stalking the two cubs, hearing in the distance a hyena\u2019s laugh all but stopped the play date between the cubs, fear entered their minds as a run in with one of those wild dogs was a sure fire way to end their peace and quiet, from out of the brush came not one but three hyenas came out of the brush peering upon Nala and Simba, the all too familiar gang of familiar of hyenas of Banzai, Shenzi and Ed. \u201cWell, Well what do we have her\u201d chuckled Shenzi as she and the other compatriots circled the two cubs ready to pounce upon Nala and Simba. Not knowing what to do Simba tried his best to protect Simba from the assault that was going to come from the Hyenas, not even thinking some one would come to save them from the Hyena attack, a large shadow of what seemed to be a lion came to the cub\u2019s aid, but who was this lion.</span></div></div>",

Sarabi was as big as a hippo and the biggest lioness out of all. On the way to their destination, sarabi had to stop multiple times to take a breather,\" I always think twice about being this big but I do enjoy my softness\" she said as she rubbed the bottom of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the destination,\" so this is where will be staying, it looks just like pride rock\" Nala said,\" its suppose too this is where we go if pride rock is taken by outlanders\" sarabi said as she walked over to nala,\" so why are we here?\" the cub asked,\" you will be the next queen and just like me, u must be like me\" sarabi said,\" I don't understand, what do u mean like u?\" Nala said,\" u must be a fat queen, u will have a great belly just like mine and still be able to have cubs\" sarabi said.\" So what your saying is that I will be simbas wife and be fat just like you are?\" Nala asked, sarabi nodded her head yes.\" How am I suppose to get as big as u, eat a lot of food and drink a bunch of water than usual?\" she asked. Sarabi laughed and said,\" no you will get nursed by me and eat when I do and how much I do and when the time comes we will both return to pride rock and you become the queen of the pride lands\",\" so do we start now?\" Nala asked? \" if u want to\",\" yes\" Nala said so she walked over to the fat lioness and started sucking breast milk from sarabi, sarabis breast milk was filled with fat and supplied nala well. As Nala continued to get sarabis fatty milk her belly started to grow,\" she's doing better than I expected, sarafina should most likely come here to help Nala gain weight I'll tell rafiki\" sarabi said in her mind.\" Ok that's enough you don't wanna become immobile\" she told nala, so Nala stopped and looked at her new belly,\" wow how much did I drink?\",\" not a bunch, I still have plenty for to grow, now time to eat\" sarabi said. So they both found some antelopes and started eating. Twenty minutes later they were both full, Sarabi ate five antelopes and Nala only ate two,\" how could you eat all that? I feel like I'm about to burst\" Nala said,\" I have a bigger body than you so I can eat more, and you just need to fart a little bit and you will feel fine\" sarabi said before letting her farts out. So Nala would do the same and find somewhere to sleep, she laid down on her side so her belly could stick out,\" you did well Nala, be ready for tomorrow because we will be doing the same thing\" sarabi said to Nala as Nala fell asleep then rafiki showed to see the beginning steps to the next fat queen,\" so how much does she weigh rafiki?\" Sarabi asked the monkey. So he went over and touched Nalas belly and said,\" Nala weighs..........</span></div></div>",

Ever since they were cubs, they had been sharing meals together, playing together, even finding mates together. Nala consoled Zira when Mufasa had announced Scar as a traitor, his assassination attempt having failed. The two lionesses had, by adulthood, become quite obese- to the enjoyment of their mates. Having an overweight mate was something, in recent times, seen as a good thing, and this was thanks to a new policy that Mufasa had to put in place before he died. Scar was waging a war against the lions, leading the Hyenas with their jaws powerful enough to break a lion's leg in a single bite, in many attacks. Mufasa, although having narrowly survived Scar's assassination attempt, died in battle with Hyenas, acting as a distraction to give his forces a chance to escape. Before he had died, though, Mufasa had put a new policy in place in order to get more recruits for the war: \"One shall hunt for their own families feed unless one is to swear service under me or any future ruler as a warrior of the Pride Lands, in which their families shall be given food gathered by the Pride as a whole.\" Nala, with Simba, was given a great amount of food, being queen of the Pride Lands, and Zira got large amounts of food from the great service her mate was giving. Nala told Simba and Rafiiki of her expansive desires and he gave her 10 gourds filled with potions which allowed her to gain twice as much weight from anything she consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala and Zira were kidnapped by poachers, Zira first, then Nala, and they used them to test a serum which was A: cheap to produce, B: quick to produce, and C: was incredibly fattening. They wished to use the serum to cure world hunger, but were worried about side effects, and so here we are. When they gave it to Zira, she immediately began to balloon, layer after layer of fat being added to her frame, her limbs quickly vanishing under her expanding mass. Nala, who had just drank all ten potions at once instead of incrementally like Rafiiki had told her to, exploded, her mass rushing forth in a tidal wave of flabby, flabby flesh.</span></div></div>",

Nala bore twenty, thirty, forty chins and counting as her body began to fill the room completely. Zira looked on in amazed frustration as she also expaned, bearing five, ten, fifteen chins and ever so slowly counting. She was immobilized before being captured, both of them were, but Zira was the first to leave the ground entirely, resting solely on her stomach. Her body was like a water balloon, filling with more and more fat as she grew. Her stomach remained relatively small, or at least smaller than her. Her weight didn't go to the same places it did for Nala, primarily focusing on her face, chest, and back. Her rear end, though, was the largest of all of her being. Each cheek was large enough to fit a tire, and it showed no signs of getting smaller. Comparatively, Nala's weight was almost exclusively going into her stomach. Her stomach was now holding her five feet off the ground, no make that six, now six and a half. Her chest was bulging forward, propping her head up and putting her now hundred-and-eighty, ninety, two-hundred chins on display. Her back fat would have given her the illusion of being hunch-backed if the rest of her wasn't just as saturated. Nala's mind was completely consumed by pleasure, to the point that she wasn't breathing correctly. She passed out from hyperventilating, and when she awoke she found...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And that was even without their special serum. But at least for this lioness, it put the scientists ahead of schedule. For the other darker colored lioness however, it seemed they could do with giving her another dose of the serum. And now they could begin to start feeding them their stored special food. It was in a paste form of various meats. Two giant constant producing vats with long feeding hoses for two fattening lioness blobs, they were likely hungry by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are ready, send them in.\" Ordered one scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor each lioness, two young adult human males, 18 years in age, entered each giant enclosure, both enclosures were each the size of ten football fields in length and width, while they were as high as the tallest of skyscrapers. Each young man carried a feeding hose to the front of each lioness, climbing up either of the lionesses' flab of rolls and oozy blubber of the lionesses' pooling chin rolls and up higher until they got to the circling mass of their neck rolls where the lionesses' fat head blobs rested for now. If the lionesses' got any more fatter, their heads would be engulfed and sink back into the masses of fat that is their neck rolls, at first making a cavern then that caven becoming a fat tunnel of jiggling and undulating mass of neck rolls while the lionesses' fat head blobs would sink deeper farther back, their chin rolls and face cheeks oozing and flowing out through the deep neck roll tunnel to spill out and pour down the lionesses' fat fronts to spread wider. Their face cheeks blimping out once exiting the neck roll tunnel entrance and on the floor while the chin rolls widening to form a lake of rippling chin rolls out in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was then when she felt her rapid fattening all over her body begin slowing down but still fattening at a pace of Zira's body. Then the deep hunger and gluttony for food came, along with it a loud echoey growling from her huge stomach. Her stomach had grown as well to hold uncountable tons of food to be rapidly digested. It wasn't long when she felt something climbing up her slowly fattening lioness blob body until she saw it was a human carrying something. Perhaps to feed her? Yes, that is what it was. So without hesitation, she opened her fat maw as big and wide as she could to accept the hose to feed her. Nala now has an overwhelming desire to get fatter endlessly, not just the gluttonous hunger. And right now her gluttonous hunger knows no bounds and might never be satisfied, as long as she continued to get fatter and be a fatter lioness blob, more beautiful and gorgeous. She wondered if Zira felt the same, briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two young adult male humans, now feeders and new mates to the lionesses', thrust their hoses into the respective lionesses' fat mouth. Not even a short moment went by when the food began to flow through the hoses and into both of the lionesses' hungry mouths. And the sounds of loud gulping could be heard in both rooms.</span></div></div>",

But little do the scientists and Zira know is that Nala had got Rafiki <br>\r\nto make her a rapid weight gaining potion for her but instead of drinking only one gourd a day, Nala <br>\r\ndrinks the entire batch of potions of gourds that was a total of a hundred altogether. Because right after <br>\r\nNala had arrived at the laboratory, she'd begun rapidly fattening until she was the fat blob size of a <br>\r\nhot air balloon fully inflated. Thanks to the potions Rafiki had made for her, she'd always be healthy and <br>\r\nhave no weight related problems, except becoming immobile but her digestive stomach had been <br>\r\ngreatly enhanced, as for every pound Nala would digest, she'd gain a ton rapidly in seconds. But <br>\r\nRafiki also somehow shows up to also help Zira and gives her some gourds of the rapid fattening <br>\r\npotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo begins the interactive story where you can do Nala's point of view or Zira's point of view.<br>\r\nNo gay/lesbian, no gore, no slob, no killing (squishing &amp; smooshing allowed), burping allowed, <br>\r\nno farting, no limit to how fat and big Nala and Zira can gain; slow or fast is allowed but overall <br>\r\nhave fun and be creative. Enjoy.</td>",
