If I can do that then I'll be able to win once in awhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot: But why just Sonic why not with his friends too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: Because Sonic is the real threat the others I can take them down easily. The real problem is how are we going to pull that off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot: Well I don't know about you but we are out of groceries again can you go to the market and get some more please?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman snatches the list and growls. Later at the market Dr. Eggman was checking over the shopping list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: let's see eggs, butter, milk, all we need now is some makani Nia nuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Eggman was grabbing a package of nuts. When a baby's cry begins to get on his nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: (annoyed growl) Can someone quiet down that baby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother: Sorry, sir. He just tried that's all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggmen getting an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: Wait a minute. That gives me an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle later back at dr. Eggman's headquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: (To his robots) Riddle me this: what is the most useless and creature on the planet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot: Uhh, Amm, is it a Beebot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: No!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCubot: Is it Big Bot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: No!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot: We give up. We're out of guessing ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: On the whole planet there is only one useless creature that I know of and also the most annoying of course. (Turns the dry erase marker board over.) A Baby! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dry erase marker shows a picture of Sonic making look like an infant. The two Robots were confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCubot: I have a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: (To Cubot) Save it till the end! The answer here is obvious. The reason why I can't keep Sonic from fighting is because he's in a proper age to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCubot: (sarcastically) Oh sure that makes more sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: So it comes to reason if I can make Sonic back into a infant again he won't be able fight and we'll do whatever we want and without him getting in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman turns the board over and to reveal the plans for a laser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: This could take some work but it will be a lot faster with a montage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot: (singing) Oh Mooon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: And no singing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot was disappointed. Now that Montage song begins. First Doctor Eggman starts to hammer and drill the piece of metal. Then he used a blowtorch to mail them together. And the Machine flips over Eggman opens the door by pushing a button then place a burrito inside and then sets for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: As soon as my breakfast burrito is done we'll get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen later Eggman who uses his telescope to look for the beach and there he sees Sonic and All His Friends having some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: (evil chuckle) The preparations are ready!  (To the Robots) You two get the laser ready!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot and Cubot: Yes sir, right away sir!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey get the laser sticking out of the roof of headquarters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot: I think we should point the laser more to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCubot: No! I want to point the laser more to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot: I insisted we move it more to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCubot: well I insisted we move it more to the right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: (annoyed) Both of you, knock it off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot and Cubot: Sorry, sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: Get ready. Aim. Now, fire! (He notice he is not here in the laser being fire.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCubot: I want to press the firing button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot: No it's my turn to press it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCubot: But you did it last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot: No I didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCubot: Yes you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The laser shoots but misses Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot and Cubot: (At the same time) Oops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: \"Oops?\" What's an \"oops?\" What happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot: (worried)No-now, please don't get mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCubot: We miss, Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: (Mad) What!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbot and cubot make themselves scarce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman: One thing.
