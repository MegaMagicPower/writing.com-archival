Combustified!\" he said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just making words up at this point,\" Viridi replied. \"Anyway, we're here looking for something that looks like a TV remote, so let me know if you find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit finally cut the webbing off of him with his bow, dropping gracefully to the ground. \"What's the remote for? Changing intergalactic TV channels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. They say it has the power to switch people's bodies,\" Viridi explained, \"and considering that Palutena's probably being possessed, it seemed like a good thing to track down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that might come in handy!\" Pit remarked. He looked at all the webs sprawled across the walls of the chamber. \"I guess I'll just... get started then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you will! I'm not gonna sit here and watch you cut through webs all day, so just tell me when you find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Viridi did whatever the telepathic equivalent of hanging up is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit shrugged, then decided to cut a circle around his feet to start. He peeked the area he cut out and with great luck, the remote had been sitting right in front of his feet the whole time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurred to Ol' Flightless, though. Could he really trust Viridi with access to something with this kind of power? They called a truce, but t<br>\r\nSkyworld and the Forces of Nature were still at war. For all he knew, she could just be using him to get her hands on it and use his body to finish Palutena off!

In fact, she stopped moving entirely, staring right in front of her with a blank expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Viridi?\" Pit asked.

Please nod your head or something if you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViridi nodded, her expression returning to her as she did so.

In fact, she simply stared at Pit for a second, and then put a hand to her cheek in thought. \"Shoot... what was I just doing?\" Viridi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settled it for Pit, though he probably should have realized what it would do from the name In retrospect. \"Command\" let him give commands that the target has to obey!

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">A Kid Icarus Uprising character will come across a remote. This remote comes with a set of instructions and gives them the ability to perform seven functions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Aware Swap: The user selects two targets, at which point their bodies will be swapped. This is the traditional Freaky Friday-style body swap, in which both parties are aware of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware Swap: The user selects two targets, at which point their bodies will be swapped. Everyone but the user of the remote will believe that the targets have always had the bodies they swapped into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPossession: Turns the user into a ghost-like entity. When the user flies into another person, the user possesses their body until they use the remote to leave. The user leaves a copy of their consciousness into their original body who acts as if nothing happened, and the remote follows the user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShapeshift: A first target is selected, and the target's body (and clothes) are saved into the remote's memory. When a second target is selected, the second target's body morphs into that of the first target. The first target is unaffected. Multiple people's bodies can be saved and switched between on the remote, and there is also an \"undo button\" for this function specifically that restores a target's original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality Swap: Self-explanatory. The user selects to targets, at which point their personalities will be swapped. Likes, dislikes, mannerisms, thought processes, behaviors, etc., are all switched. The targets may or may not notice that their personality has changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClone: Like possession, but the copy of the user possesses the target's body - not the user themself. The copy is just as aware of the circumstances as the original. Up to 10 targets can be possessed by clones, and any targets possessed after the tenth will release the earliest target from possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommand: Found in a hidden compartment on the remote and not mentioned in the instructions. The target's mind will go completely empty until the user gives them a command, at which point they will carry the command out. They will be aware that they were performing the action against their will, but will not know why they are doing so. They will not know anything happened if the command is a mental change, however (i.e. \"forget about that argument\", or \"you now like pizza\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is also a reset button in the same hidden compartment as the above. This resets all swaps, shapeshifts, or commands, returning everything affected to the state it was in before the remote was first used. (This does not rewind time. Everything that happens before the reset takes place still happened.)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't do anything that wouldn't be allowed under KI:U's age guidelines. That means no sex, drugs, graphic violence, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo endings. Even if a plotline is resolved, the path should be allowed to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo character death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower shouldn't corrupt. If someone's going to use the remote in a world-domination scheme, it should be someone who would have wanted to take over the world beforehand in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShips are okay, but there must be an option to avoid it. Try not to force any plotline if it can be helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo excessive use of OC's. OC's, if any, should only exist to further the plot of other characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything that breaks these rules may be deleted and replaced without warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMessage the story owner if anything is unclear.</td>",
