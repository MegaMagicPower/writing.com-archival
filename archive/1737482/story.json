Zeke accepted, because if he didn't then kojo would never let it drop how \"zeke the awesome\" couldn't even accept an eating contest. Zeke turned up in:</span></div></div>",

He also put on his silver studded belt, because he had worn it when he nearly got eaten by dogs and he made it out alive, so he figured it was his lucky belt. It had 7 holes in it with silver around them and he fastened it comfortably in the tightest hole. He looked in the mirror and examined his butt. He thought his butt was great, and the jeans he was wearing showed it off. He then reallised he was going to be late for the contest, so he ran to get his skateboard and went straight to don's donuts. He got there to see a crowd of people around two tables, at one of which sat kojo. The other was empty, apart from trays of food. Little did zeke know, kojo had sprinkled a special powder over zekes food. The powder was designed to relieve the stomach of feeling full, allowing you to eat more. It also lowered metabolism, so zeke would gain weight faster.</span></div></div>",

He looked down at his belly, which was pressing against his now tight shirt and threatening to pop the buttons off. He looked over to kojo to see that he had unbuckled his belt, so zeke saw that it would be ok for him to do the same. He unbuckled his belt and immediately it shot apart to the point that if he fastened it comfortably it would be 3 holes looser than before. He pushed his belly out to see how far he could, and the button popped off his jeans. The bottom 2 buttons also popped off his shirt, leaving his exposed belly hanging out. Kojo finally finished, but since zeke finished first, he had won. </span></div></div>",

The first thing he noticed was that his shirt had ridden up to his belly button, revealing a slight belly. He bent over to pick up an empty bag of chips and his pyjama pants split down the butt seam. He then noticed his butt had grown considerably, but he liked it. He liked his belly too. He got dressed, but when he got to his shorts he couldn't get the button fastened. He tried and tried, but he couldn't. He decided to go look in his dads wardrobe to find something to wear, but the biggest things he could find were a 34 inch waist. He measured his waist and it came up as 36. He decided to try these shorts, and he found that if he sucked in his stomach he could get them fastened. He put on a plain black formal belt to hold the button so that it didn't pop off. He would have put on his silver studded belt, but he couldn't find it anywhere. He hadn't worn this belt since his great aunts wedding last summer, and it was a bit snug, but it would do.</span></div></div>",
