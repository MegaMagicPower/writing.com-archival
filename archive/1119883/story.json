Drusilla approached the table and plucked the Dawn panties into the air. Buffy watched in horror as she proceeded to pull Dawn all the way up and tug on the fragile waistband. Next came Faith, Buffy again could only watch as her friend was pulled tight around Dru's modest breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope Will and Kennedy think of something soon' Buffy thought to herself as the dancing began again.

She watched as Dawn's fabric body was pulled aside and her tip was gently eased into the fleshy cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the smells hit Buffy at once and she wanted to vomit. The further she was slid into Dru the more she wanted to. Dru began to cum almost immediately and her juices soaked both the dildo and panties alike.

She had been trapped in darkness for over 12 hours and was finally coming to accept the futility of clinging to the hope of rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy could feel something happening.

Out for a little evening stroll are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy's 'heart' was in her throat at this moment. 'Spike, she thought to herself, what would he be doing talking to Dru?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away Spike, Mummies busy! Can't play with the big demons anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy could feel Dru turn as if to leave but she stopped as Spike put his hand on her shoulder. \"And what of the slayer and her friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're my toys now. Think of it Spike, with no slayer the world is ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy felt hope surge through her plastic body. 'If Spike knows what's going on then he must be here to rescue me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy heard Spike's first punch connect as Dru's body rocked backwards.Dru quickly began to fight back and the resulting onslaught of blows caused her to be jostled around slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'EWW, Buffy thought to herself, she's getting off on this' Sure enough as each blow was delivered and parried, Dru became gradually more wet. 'Vampires are messed up!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike eventually won the fight, his hand tightening round Dru's throat as she delivered a final knockout blow.  As her body slumped to the ground Buffy could hear nothing but silence. \"Well let's see what we have here.\" Spike tore off Dru's dress, revealing the women underneath. He swiftly removed Faith and Dawn then turned his attentions to her crotch and his trapped flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy felt something rather forcefully tug her until in the dim moonlight she was looking into Spikes eyes. He had a cigarette in his mouth as he turned her over inspecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the new look love, he began, but I thought you might not enjoy the previous accomodations\" He turned and handed her to someone. Buffy looked up and saw she was being cradled by Kennedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for all your help Spike, she began as she pocketed Dawn and Faith, I need to get them back to the magic box now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come with you, if Dru found out about the mojo then you don't know how many other nasties will be poking there noses around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy let out a metaphorical sigh of relief.

'Where's Willow?' Buffy finally notices that Kennedy is wearing what Willow was wearing earlier, but Willow's shoes and socks are on the floor where she fell. As if reading her mind, Kennedy approaches the table and carries Buffy, Dawn and Faith into the bathroom in back.

She saw light above her but that was quickly blocked out by an eye the size of a house. Willow looked on in horror as she finally figured it out. She was tiny inside her own sock. Judging by the size of Kennedy's eye she must have been about the size of an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was several hours ago, Kennedy had put the sock down and Willow had quickly left it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, Willow and Kennedy were relieved to see Faith slowly grow bigger and resuming her human form. However, she didn't stop growing when she reached her normal height. Faith now naked and starting to shiver continued to get bigger. Realizing that she was growing into a Giant-sized slayer Faith said, \"Hey, I know that I've said in the past that I would like to be the BIG slayer in town, but Willow isn't this getting to be a little ridiculous?\" Willow just stands there totally mesmerized by Faith's enlarging body. She didn't come out of her trance until Kennedy nudged her so hard with her elbow Willow fell to the ground. By then Faith had finally stopped growing. She was now exactly twice her normal height. Everything else about Faith's body had also proportionally doubled in size. A fringe benefit from the spell that Faith wasn't going to complain about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Faith's shivering had grown quite intense. To thank Willow for her nice BIG new assets, Faith walked over to Willow and picked her up. She had intended giving Willow a nice BIG hug as a thank you. However, just as soon as she touched Willow, Faith sneezed very, very loudly. Faith heard herself sneeze a very plain and ordinary sneeze. However, to everyone else there including the still transformed people her sneeze sounded like a jet airplane taking off. Covering their ears from the intense sound, Willow and the others were stunned to see Faith's body split into two bodies. She now stood there at her normal height. Faith still had her brand new much MORE pleasantly looking hour-glass shaped figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first words out of Faith's mouth were, \"Well now, how about that. Because she has a sister, I've always been jealous of Buffy. Growing up an only child can be very lonely at times. I guess this is a different way to solve THAT problem.\" Willow then starts stuttering, \"F.F.F.F.. Faith. I've got to fix this mistake RIGHT NOW! We can't have TWO Faith's going around town.\" \"Why not.\" both Faith's yell back. Continuing on they then say, \"I swear Willow, IF you try anything to get rid of my twin, We'll make sure that you die a very, very, VERY slow and excruciating death.\" Knowing that Faith was capable of doing that, Willow cowers in the farthest corner from the now enraged twin Faith's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Faith's then grabs the book of spells from Kennedy's grip. Demanding to know which spell Willow had used on her, Kennedy reluctantly points it out to her. They are all surprised to see the other Faith go over and pick up Dawn. They then recite the same spell at her. The exact same thing that had happened to Faith, now happens to Dawn. However, when she sneezed after her growing had stopped, Dawn didn't become 2 girls like Faith had a few minutes earlier. Looking at the now over 10 foot tall Dawn, Faith said, \"I'm sorry about that Dawn. I know that you've often felt invisible around Buffy. So I thought she wouldn't be able to ignore TWO of you.\" \"That's alright Faith\" Dawn said. Now looking squarely at her toad of a sister, Dawn continues saying, \"At least your heart was in the right place. I think I'll go outside now and try catching some nice flies for Buffy. I'm sure that by now she must be getting hungry. I know, I sure am.\" Taking Willow's spell-book with them both Faith's then said, \"Wait a second there, we're going to join you Dawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the three of them went to Buffy and Dawn's house and had themselves a merry feast while Willow and the others just stayed at the Magic Box too stunned by the recent events to do anything else. About 2 hours later, the three girls returned. Each Faith was holding a jar with many flies captured inside, just waiting to be fed to Buffy. By now, Buffy was really starving so she gulped all of them down just as fast as her extra-ordinarily long and narrow tongue would catch them. So to rattle Willow's cage even more, both Faith's then said, \"Willow we think that you need to know how the other half lived.\" Figuring this can't be good for her Willow dashes in the direction of Kennedy. Before she can even ask them what they're talking about, Dawn starts reciting a spell from a different spell-book they had found at her house. Willow now starts glowing pretty much the same color as that demon's beam had been. Because in her flight, Willow had stumbled and she was touching Kennedy when Dawn started reciting the spell, BOTH of their bodies start transforming. All that is heard from either girl was Kennedy saying, \"Oh, that's just great. What are we going to now be changed into NOW, Willow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Using a synthetic version of that demon's transformation beam, Dawn and both Faith's were a little surprised to see what Willow and Kennedy were transforming into. As their transformation continued, Dawn started feeling sick to her stomach and she told Faith about it. Seeing how green Dawn was becoming the twin slayers hustled her out of the Magic Box before anything else happened. Which was a good thing, because seconds after they got outside Dawn started growing even bigger. Realizing that she can NOW be in TWO places at once, one of the Faith's stayed with Dawn while the other went back inside to see how far along the transformation had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith was quite pleased to see that Willow and Kennedy had finished transforming into extra long and thick candy apple red dildos. Of course, Kennedy wasn't at all pleased with this turn of events. Faith apologized to Kennedy about what had happened. She then promptly said the right spell to return Kennedy to her human form. Once that was done Faith handed Willow to her and said, \"Here Kennedy have all the fun you want.\" And boy did she. It was quite late that night when Kennedy finally collapsed from the intensity of all the orgasms Willow had so 'kindly' provided her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside Dawn was going through her own form of ecstasy. Dawn's height along with the rest of her body had now TRIPLED in size. This time though, when she sneezed instead of splitting into twins Dawn became sextuplets. When she realized what had happened to her Dawn said, \"WOW, I suppose it's a good thing that I only ate half a dozen donuts for dessert. Faith, just think how many more COPIES of me there would be if I had finished off that entire bag. Faith was unhappily thinking that very thought. Buffy the toad, after seeing what has happened to her \"little\" sister during the past few hours gets very nervous when she sees one of the Dawns and both Faiths approach her jar. Does Buffy end up being happy with what now happens to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The main reason for Buffy's nervousness was when both Faith's and one of the Dawn's approached her jar after Dawn had sneezed and split into 6 bodies Dawn had become a little over 16 feet tall. So Buffy was understandably concerned about what Faith and Dawn planned on doing to her now. Right then, Buffy was really wishing she had stayed in bed that morning. This time one of the Faith's started saying a different spell from the book. She also waves both of her arms in wide circles. The other Faith said, \"Don't worry Buffy, I'm pretty sure we're using the right spell this time.\" Buffy thinks to herself, \"Well now, that WOULD be something different for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds after Faith had finished with everything, Buffy's toad body flashes back into ALMOST her previous human form. Buffy would have been very happy with that outcome if she had not still been only as tall as a toad. Giving the Faith that had performed the spell a real angry look, Buffy was still thinking about what to say when she was picked up by Dawn. Buffy then was stunned when her sister put Buffy's entire head into her mouth and started blowing real hard. With each puff into her, Buffy felt more and more like she would explode! After over a minute of Dawn blowing into her, Buffy suddenly shot of Dawn's mouth. When she hit the far wall of the Magic Box, Buffy's body bounced several times before stopping near the center of the store. Buffy then started growing taller and bigger in every way a girl should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking at first, that she was FINALLY returning to her normal human size, Buffy thanked Faith. Both Faith's said in reply, \"Buffy, after all you've been through today, I thought you would enjoy being changed the same as I am. Believe me, you'll REALLY enjoy all of the sensations that we've been feeling since splitting in two.\" Buffy looked at Faith with a very quizzical look (she's not sure about what Faith meant). She then walked over to Dawn to hug and kiss her sister. Kissing Dawn turned out to be a VERY BIG mistake for Buffy. Buffy didn't know that she still had her very long and flexible toad tongue. When Buffy kissed Dawn, she quite by accident french-kissed her sister. Buffy's now 16-inch tongue went completely into Dawn's mouth and past her tonsils startling Dawn. The unexpected sensation of Buffy's tongue wiggling uncontrollably inside her esophagus caused Dawn to involuntarily gag trying to get it out. Her gagging reflex caused Dawn to blow air well over a dozen more times into Buffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Buffy was able to extract her tongue from inside of Dawn, she had already returned to her normal height. Mind you, Buffy's bust was now a 40 DD with a supernatural bounciness that really thrilled Buffy. Thinking to herself, for once one of Willow's spell has worked out right and I've got a figure that'll be noticed by everyone, Buffy sported the biggest grin of her life. It only lasted for a few seconds. Buffy then noticed that her chest was still slowly expanding. Dawn's unplanned additional puffs of air into Buffy had entirely changed the spells intended effect on her. Buffy's bust soon grew past volleyball, basketball and then finally stopped at the size of a VERY BIG beach-ball. A minute later things continued getting worse for Buffy when her body started shrinking completely INTO her boobs. While that was happening, her boobs started merging together as they grew larger and her tongue transformed into a one-way valve to keep her body fully inflated and taunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than 5 minutes time, Buffy's entire body transformed into a single sphere the identical color as her sun-streaked blond hair. Buffy had grown to be twice the diameter that her boobs had been just before they began merging together AND her bodies bounciness had also doubled. While Faith stood aghast with what had happened, Dawn cheerfully seized the opportunity. Saying, \"Buffy, I know being a slayer is a big job but you don't PLAY with me anymore. So now I think I'm going to enjoy playing with YOU!\" Seeing all 6 Dawn's surround her Buffy trembles at what she thinks is about to happen. One of them picks her up and within seconds they're all heading outside for the beach. Soon, Beach-ball Buffy will be bouncing back and forth over a sand volley-ball court net. Playing two-on-two volley-ball with themselves, the 6 Dawn's rotate playing until a hour or so after sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She says, \"Thanks for the offer, but I decided I wanted to try restoring Faith first. I think by now she might be getting tired being your sole support (such as it is).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny Willow\". Buffy replied. She then said, \"No Willow, I'm going to keep wearing Faith for a while longer. I tell you, she and this thong I found this morning are without a doubt the most comfortable lingerie that I've ever worn. The funniest part about it all Willow, is that this lingerie is giving me a massage.\" At this point Buffy starts giggling from the ongoing sensations that she's feeling. [Faith and Dawn don't realize that while Buffy can not hear them talking to each other she is really feeling their conversation. The more they talk, the antsier Buffy feels]. Noticing Buffy's increasing discomfort in front of her Willow then asks Buffy, \"Are you SURE, that I can't help you with ...... you know?\" Emphatically Buffy says, \"NO Willow. Why don't you try restoring Kennedy with that spell. Pouting a little Willow agrees with Buffy and sets Kennedy on the floor and starts casting the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds after Willow finishes the spell, Kennedy starts glowing the same color as the beam the demon fired the previous evening. The dildo's body starts growing bigger and taller. It takes her about 2 minutes to return to her normal height. Just as her body starts transforming back to normal a beam shoots out of Kennedy's eyes hitting Willow dead center. As her body becomes human, Willow transforms quite a bright red colored dildo with a far more interesting and useful shape than Kennedy had been. Willow then starts shrinking down to a far more useful size for Kennedy. Seeing Willow's face when she was zapped by that beam really made Buffy's day. But before Buffy can ask Kennedy anything, she takes off running for the bathroom. Kennedy plans on taking a VERY long and HOT shower. She really needs to do it right away to get all of Willow's fluids washed off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe better part of an hour later, Kennedy returns feeling really refreshed. Buffy then asks Kennedy, \"Do you have any idea at all what happened here?\" \"Not really\" she replied. \"Although considering what just happened to Willow I would suggest leaving all of our transformed friends alone. You wouldn't want the same thing happening to you that just happened to Willow now, would you Buffy?\" Buffy said, \"No I guess your right Kennedy\". Buffy remembering that she has been wearing Faith for over an hour gets a very worried look on her face. Which grows even worse when she discovers that no matter how much she tries, she CAN NOT take Faith off. Faith, the bra, now seems glued tight to Buffy's body! Not knowing that Dawn is the thong she's wearing Buffy doesn't try taking it off. Which she wouldn't be able to do anyway now either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

I'm not a sex toy!\" When her mind over matter approach failed to return her to normal. She took one more look in the mirror before Buffy carried her out. \"I have to admit though...\" Dawn stopped that line of thinking, and listened as her sister carried on both ends of a conversation. As she listened, she realized she could taste and smell Buffy's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like its time to have THE TALK with Dawnie,\" she stopped and wrinkled her nose, \"God, that won't be at all awkward,\" she said squinting her eyes. \"I can't believe she had this in her room,\" Buffy remembered her younger sister's recent bout with kleptomania, and corrected herself,\"Well, I refuse to believe that she paid for this anyway.\" She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never have any faith in me!\" Dawn screamed, suddenly wishing Willow was here.

If Dawn had retained the capacity to be sick, she would have been losing her lunch right now. She felt nauseous all the way down to the pit of her... well, batteries she supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn could only watch as her sister put two fingers in her mouth and then slid them down to her pussy. She gasps as they slide in. \"Angel...\" she moans, to Dawnie's astonishment. She can't believe Buffy's still hung up on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... that's right Angel...I want you inside me.\" Dawn keeps trying to yell, but its no use. To Buffy she was nothing more than an inanimate... she felt Buffy spin a dial on her bottom, and her entire body started to shake... okay semi-animate, object. Interesting metephor for our relationship, she thought as she watched Buffy's slit move closer. She could already smell Buffy's sex and it was making her gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which until now, I didn't even think I could do,\" Dawn would have said wryly had she been capable.

Surprised by the dildo's motion, Buffy brings Dawn back up to her face to look it over a second time with greater scrutiny. Temporarily reprieved from a fate worse then all of her nightmares, Dawn starts shaking even stronger from joy. She mistakenly believes that Buffy has FINALLY realized that Dawn has transformed into the dildo she's now holding. Which unfortunately for Dawn's immediate future with Buffy is totally wrong. Giving the dildo a very long second look, Buffy notices that Dawn's base is very different from every other dildo that she has ever seen. Twisting Dawn's bottom, Buffy sees that the dido doesn't have any batteries! So now talking out loud to herself Buffy says, \"How on Earth is this thing vibrating without a battery?\" Dawn starting to cry and then shouting uselessly at Buffy says, \"Buffy its me, I'm the battery. Please take me out. I'll be a good girl. I'll even return EVERYTHING that I've borrowed from EVERYONE. I really REALLY mean it this time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy is now not \"in the mood\" but as she goes to put Dawn on her dresser she notices a transistor radio sitting there. Clicking it on Buffy says, \"Well let's see if there is any music on that'll get me in the mood.\" Upon hearing Buffy say that, Dawn starts desperately yelling at the top of her lungs (if she still had them), \" Come on now, twenty-four news.\" Dawn's luck this day is running 100%, all bad. The radio comes on and some commercials are playing. Dawn's now yelling, \"Come on weather channel. Why don't we have a thunderstorm today.\" The final commercial ends and the disc jockey returns saying, \"Alright everyone the mighty 990 is now back with today's 24-hour block of Sixties singing sensations from England.\" Dawn lets out a long sigh of relief. She knows that Buffy doesn't like any of that moggy music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe DJ then continues, \"Here we are back with a whole hour of Petula Clark and we'll start with her chart topper \"Downtown\". Buffy then squeals, \"Oh yeah, Spike's favorite song!\" Totally stunned, Dawn says, \"What?\" and before she knows it Buffy's super-fast slayer hand has grabbed Dawn, fully inserting Dawn into Buffy's vagina. The absolute darkness that she was plunged into unhinges Dawn. Dawn has now become catatonic. Or at least as much as a dildo can be. Her mind has now gone blank and her body is now instinctively vibrating inside Buffy as fast as it possibly can. Dawn doesn't even feel herself being squeezed tighter and tighter in the middle like a tube of toothpaste. By the time the song finishes, Buffy's supernaturally strong abdominal slayer muscles have permanently changed Dawn's dildo body, transforming it into a longer, slinkier and much more desirable shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Her musciles tenced as her eyes shut tight as she drenched poor Dawn with cum. The slayer let out her breath and colapsed in bed, her eyes zoned out in bliss as she listened to the radio.<br>\r\n\"Spike...\" Buffy smiled happily, weakly sliding out her friend. Dawn could only groan as she slid out with a 'shlerp' that only she could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy brought the toy to her zoned out face, her eyes showing signed of bordom as she slowly opened her mouth, her tongue lulling out to tease Dawn before she was tenitivly licked.<br>\r\n\"N..no more...\" Dawn whined as Buffy continued the drag her up and down the warm, wet tongue, drenching her in saliva before Buffy lay her friend on her stomach as she thought about what was going on in her life. Her eyes pierced the ceiling as she subconciously continued to swallow remaints of her own cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer slayer hand occasionly shifted or stroked poor Dawns body as she yawned and checked the time. Before long she had pushed herself to get up, casually tossing her toy to the side as she slid out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs buffy slid her panties on, she heard a knock at the door. Her lips pursed as she quickly tossed her other clothes on,<br>\r\n\"Be their in a second!\" She called, wandering out of the room while tugging a top over herself. Dawn didn't bother calling out as she heard her go. She simply lay still, drenched in Buffies sweat, saliva and cum. Her mind was complaining but her body felt kind of weird when buffy licked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D..did I enjoy that?\" Dawn whimpered to herself, noticing just now how crushed she felt from the slayers strong muciles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Dawn heared the small booms of footsteps on the stairs, soon accompanied by the socked feet that accompanied them. Dawn vibrated slightly in joy as the socked feet wandered around the bed, revieling Willows expressionless face.<br>\r\n\"Hm..?\" She wondered, glancing down at Dawn with a blush (Much to Dawns dismay). She wrinkled her nose slightly before looking up with a smile to Buffy as she entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn lay on the ground, scowling at the two sets of feet that surrounded her. She'd been laying there for what seemed an eternity as the two girls chatted. Buffys bare foot had embarrasingly rolled poor Dawn under the bed after the two friends had settled down. Dawn's eyes slowly drifted closed as she slept in her new body, only to be woken later by Buffies lustfull hand,<br>\r\n\"Dawns still not home\" She mused, fiddling with her vibrator before hearing the door knock once more. Buffy gazed over her shoulder, tossing Dawn at a gentle roll onto her bedside table as she went to answer it once more. Dawn mentally screamed as she slowly rolled to the edge of the bedside table. She held her breath as her view shifted over the edge of the table, straight into the confines of Willows bag just as she heared Willows voice on the stairwell,<br>\r\n\"Sorry, forgot my bag\" She spoke, grasping Dawns curiousity as she glaired down into the depths of Willows open bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could vibrate slightly.. I could go to Willows\" Dawn mused, hearing footsteps near the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, stay with a horney slayer while in Dildo form or go back with someone who tampered in magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was obvious as Dawn tried to vibrate, but couldn't seem to manage it. She held her breath and tried again as the footsteps came closer... </span></div></div>",

In her panic Dawn accidentally re-activated the transformation spell <u><i>AFTER</i></u> Buffy had carried her into the attic.

Help me get my human body back.\" All that Buffy could hear was, \"Roar, Roar, Roar\" so Dawn was quite startled when just as she's about to touch Buffy, Buffy let out with a blood-curdling scream. Which woke up Willow who promptly rolled <b><i>right out of bed</i></b> onto the cold, hard floor in her bedroom. The reason Buffy screamed was that the one thing in this or <i><b><u>any World OR Dimension that the absolutely fearless</u></b></i> Vampire Slayer was terrified of <b>were stuffed animals!</b> It all went back to a long, forgotten incident that occurred when Buffy was just 7 years old. It was during a time when her parents were still deeply in love and happily living together in Los Angeles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill very groggy and with a big throbbing knot on the back of her head, Willow set out to find the source of the scream that had woken her from a <u>really, REALLY sexy</u> dream involving her, Tara and some magical super-charging to their bedroom activities. By the time she had dragged herself down the hallway to the ladder leading to the attic Willow was in a very foul mood. Immediately after screaming, Buffy had started backing away from Dawn. Unfortunately for her, because she kept both eyes on Dawn, Buffy didn't notice where she was stepping so within seconds she stumbled falling backwards on the attic floor knocking herself out. When Willow poked her head into the attic all she saw was one of Dawn's stuffed animals out of its box. (Buffy couldn't be seen from the attic door.) Turning to leave Willow quickly turned back when Dawn started 'Roar' ing again, repeating what she had earlier said to Buffy.

Otherwise the author of the spell, <i><u>\"Couldn't be held responsible for the subject not completely AND SOLELY returning to its former SHAPE AND SIZE.\"</u></i> Usually a spell is written solely on a single page in her book, but this one was spread <b><u>across TWO (!)</u></b> pages. Having never conjured up a spell written in that fashion before, Willow didn't know <u>(but Tara did)</u> that TWO witches were required to read the alternating lines from the separate pages for the spell to work correctly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the spell-book stated that the return transformation wouldn't immediately occur, once she had finished her casting, Willow calmly went downstairs made some dinner for her and Buffy while they waited for Dawn to transform back into a 13-year old girl. Just as Willow finished cooking dinner, Tara arrived unexpectedly. Asking Willow, \"Say Willow, did you find out anything more about that demon we all faced last night?\" Willow replied in a strained voice, \"Ya, you know we're all lucky that Dawn was the only one that was hit by that Demon's beam. Otherwise we would've been changed into stuffed animals like her.\" Tara then said, \"You're kidding now, aren't you?\" \"Absolutely not, <u><i>however</i></u> if you want to see Dawn before she transforms back, you better dash up to the attic right now. I already said a counter-spell and Buffy's up there waiting for Dawn to change back. It should be happening any time now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Tara was always interested in learning new spells, she asked Willow to show her the one she used. When Willow pointed it out to her Tara {a bit hurt} asked, \"Willow who said the spell with you?\" \"What do you mean, who said it with me? I cast it <u><b>ALL by myself.\"</b></u> Tara then inquired, \"Didn't you notice those tiny footnotes at the bottom of the page.\" \"YA, so what.\" Willow shot back. \"DO you or DON'T you want to see Dawn as a cute, cuddly, full-sized stuffed tiger before she changes back? Tara then said over her shoulder as she dashed upstairs, \"I'm a whole lot more interested in seeing just how you managed to screw up THAT spell, Willow. Don't you even know that for a spell like that to work correctly <b>TWO witches</b> cast it simultaneously by alternately saying the sentences. Each witch speaking from ONLY one of the pages.\" Just then both witches hear steps coming down the hallway from the attic, Buffy at the top of her lungs screamed, <b><i><u>WILLOW !!</u></i></b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For although Dawn was upstairs talking with Tara, Willow didn't know just how much improved Dawn's newly enhanced feline hearing had become. Because Dawn wasn't yet 14 and so still a virgin, Tara played a children's board game with her rather than a more adult activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter happily spending well over an hour with Tara, Dawn's stomach started purring from hunger. Moments later, Dawn had buckled over in pain, clutching her stomach and screaming at the top of her amplified lungs about her sudden intense hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara yelled for Willow and Buffy to help her with Dawn. It was fortunate that while Buffy was now a full-grown panther her strength had tripled so it wasn't all that difficult for her to drag Dawn downstairs to her car. Of course, in her current condition she wasn't planning on going with them. Instead, Tara drove the 3 of them to the Sunnydale Mall parking near the entrance closest to the Food Court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow dashed in to get a whole lot of take-out using her Witch Bank card with its magically unlimited credit line. Just as soon as Willow returned, Dawn tore into the food with wild abandon. It took 3 trips to <u><i>finally sate</i></u> Dawn's hunger. For the next month and a half at the same time every afternoon, like clockwork, Dawn's hunger returned. It grew a little more each day and after a few weeks Dawn had fully transitioned into a carnivore. As she started vomiting up her veggies, fruit and bread Willow quit buying it for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of each meal, Dawn's stomach would protrude out as if she were just a little pregnant. As the weeks progressed, Dawn's belly grew larger and larger after her daily meal. The problem was while she ate until she was stuffed Dawn's hunger didn't entirely go away. It was always there in the back of her mind and in the pit of her stomach. Of course, with all the food she was consuming Dawn grew bigger all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the 47th day after Dawn's original transformation, Glory showed up looking for her <b><i>\"KEY\".</i></b> It had only been a few days earlier when Willow, after long study and consultation <i>finally</i> returned Buffy her human body. Buffy was so happy she could again walk on 2 feet, she didn't complain about still having cat ears, a very fine coat of fur and a very fluffy 3 1/2 foot long tail. Glory's first look at Buffy got her laughing so hard she temporarily forgot about Dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't last long and soon she carried Dawn away. Arriving at the place where she intended to sacrifice Dawn to open the gateway to her home, Glory began the ritual. Catching up with her Buffy started fighting back with all of her enhanced strength. She quickly managed to slice off Glory's right hand just above the wrist. Tossing it in Dawn's direction, Dawn perked up saying, \"Oh goody, Ladyfingers.\" What happened next was the most surprising sight Buffy would ever see in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So a short time later when Buffy tossed Glory's severed hand near Dawn she eagerly grabbed it for a quick snack. Unfortunately for Glory as Dawn munched away Glory screamed out in bloody murder from the pain of each of Dawn's crunching bites on her hand. Buffy and the others stood there absolutely stunned, when right after she finished eating Glory's hand Dawn leaped at Glory yelling at the top of her lungs, <u><b>DINNER TIME!</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than 10 minutes, the only evidence left that Glory had <i><b>EVER</b></i> existed, was the glowing blond hairballs Dawn had started coughing up. Saying, \"Yum, yum that really hit the spot.\" the now enormous Dawn fell into a deep sleep that lasted over 2 1/2 days. Seconds later, finally snapping out of her trance Buffy leaped at Willow yelling, \"Willow, I'm going to kill you for turning Dawn into a cannibal.\" As bad as she was, even Glory didn't deserve to be <u><i>eaten<b>ALIVE !!</b></i></u> Tara then yanked so hard on Buffy's tail she loosened her grip and Willow quickly poofed herself out of Buffy's sight. Turning her attention back to Dawn, Buffy decided to let sleeping Dawn's lie. She wasn't looking forward to talking to her now even more enormous \"little\" sister. Three days later and with still with no sign of Willow, Buffy finally confronted her sister after she had been awake for several hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn was quite upset with Buffy for leaving her outside. It had been a rare slow moving late Spring thunderstorm that drenched Dawn while she slept giving her a really bad case of the sniffles. Not liking the expression on Dawn's face, Buffy warily approached her. Asking in a strangely quiet voice for her Buffy said, 'Uh, Dawn do you know what happened before you fell asleep?\" Dawn happily said, \"Of course I do, Buffy. I ate Glory and boy was she ever delicious. It's too bad there isn't another one of her around. She really hit the spot. And you know what else Buffy. That hunger I've had in the pit of my stomach since becoming a tiger-girl is all gone now. You've got to admit I sure found a different way to get rid of her. Oh, and Buffy if you don't let me go demon hunting with you now, I'll do the same to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now weighing over a quarter ton and topping out at a little under 8 feet tall, Dawn Summers was truly a spectacular sight to behold. She was in fact such a sight that since her transformation, Buffy had done everything she could possibly think of to keep Dawn under wraps, so to speak. Dr. Willow Rosenberg had written a <i>VERY</i> convincing note about why Dawn had to be excused for the rest of the school year.  And the few friends that Dawn had made in school were very forgiving. Throughout her entire absence they did maintain contact with her either by telephone or the internet. The most surprising change to Dawn from eating Glory was revealed by her first sneezing spell. Dawn along with the others were surprised to learned that Dawn was now able to change her own appearance from her current super-tigress form to her previous fully human form AND a few others in between <i><u>without</u></i> the use of any witchy glamour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow by eating Glory, Dawn acquired her transformation ability! While Dawn had absolutely <u><b>NO</b></u> intention of ever eating Buffy, she enjoyed watching how much Buffy now sweat-ed around dinnertime every day. Eating Glory had filled the whole in her that had pained her and her appetite returned to normal. Well, as normal enough that a fully-grown tigress would have and Dawn had now permanently become a carnivore. With Willow gone along with her unlimited bank card, Buffy was forced to say, \"No more tuna for you, little sister.\" Dawn had developed quite a taste for sushi that Buffy could no longer afford. It took Dawn a few months to master her transformation ability. However once she did learn how to control it, Buffy happily let her join in all her hunts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple nights after Glory's demise while Dawn was still sleeping off eating her, Buffy was utterly thrilled to learn she had acquired a new ability. Apparently when Willow had succeeded in only returning Buffy to a feline-human hybrid, Willow hadn't de-clawed her. While cleaning out a nest of vampires Buffy swung her fist at one and when it leaned away from her Buffy tried stretching her arm a little further. SO she and the vampire were quite surprised when her fingernails suddenly shot out an extra 3 inches nicking its throat. Seizing on this new opportunity Buffy quickly swung at the vampire again this time cleanly severing its head. Buffy was lucky that everyone was so busy right then so she decided to keep this new surprise to herself. Buffy did secretly show her sister a few days later. Over time both Summers girls new abilities became lethally instinctive. It would be several years before they learned their children would inherit these capabilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While Dawn did that, Buffy spent her days focusing on increasing the distance her newly enhanced finger-nails shot out when she wanted. She also learned over time that her sense of smell was also radically improving. So by the time Labor Day came around, Buffy greatly cheered Dawn up by inviting Dawn on her nightly patrol. Tara was stunned by how well the Summers sisters worked together on their first patrol. She was even more stunned when Buffy unveiled her new claws. They made short work of the pack of demons who had recently taken up residence in Sunnydale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy Christmas, other than Spike all the vampires, demons and any other evil creatures living within 40 miles or so of Sunnydale had been dispatched. Shortly after the next vernal equinox, Dawn became a woman when her cycle began. Buffy felt it occur simultaneously with Dawn. <u><i><b>Another</b></i></u> one of Willow's \"little\" presents. Willow returned after hiding out for nearly a month, Buffy had totally cooled off about her accidentally feline hybridization. She thoroughly enjoyed the expressions Vampires gave her when she decapitated them with her finger-nails. To make things up with Tara, Willow had gone and done it again. This time it was a very powerful spell to synchronize their (Tara and Willow) monthly cycles. Unfortunately for all involved, Because she was the alpha female it ended up synchronizing all of them to <b>Buffy's</b> cycle, much to her great annoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter bringing Dawn down from her unexpected feelings, the expression on Buffy's face reminded Willow that she needed to be somewhere else <u><b>right away!</b></u>  In fact, Willow would've been exiled from the gang <i><b>FOR GOOD</b></i> if things the following month had worked out differently for the Summer's sisters. Because they now mystically shared their blood, when their next cycle occurred, something wholly unexpected and absolutely wonderful occurred. It happened while they were cleaning out a nest of Vampires and some very tall demon friends living near Lake Tahoe. When Dawn had focused on increasing her height to becoming 11 feet tall, Buffy <i><b>AND</b></i> Tara's bodies simultaneously duplicated her action. Once the nest was filled with just vampire dust and a few left-over demon bodies, Dawn returned everyone to their normal respective heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was mystified by what had happened to her friends, Willow was much more miffed about being left out of the effect. It wasn't until years later when the Slayerettes had moved to Britain that Willow learned from the coven why she hadn't been effected by the spell. And boy was she really steamed about the reason. Unlike Tara, Willow hadn't been born with magic within her. Her magic had come to her by a different mechanism. To make things even more interesting, it turns out that because she was magically linked to Buffy as a sister slayer, Faith <b><i>had also fully</i></b> benefited from Willow's tampering with sexual magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of months later, when Buffy and Dawn were in the area, they visited Faith in jail. When Faith recounted to Buffy the intensely violent, fulfilling and erotic dreams she had recently begun experiencing it didn't take Buffy long to figure out what was happening. Quickly recapping her new abilities Faith (out loud) said, \"Boy, Buffy you sure have all the fun things happen to you. You know, I wish something like that would happen to me.\" A few minutes later, when Dawn started to demonstrate her new abilities they also fully happened to Faith and she fainted from joy. While they were at the prison, Buffy and Dawn dispatched a few minor demons that had been jailed there with Faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple years later right after Dawn graduated from High School, the Summers sisters took their show on the road. During Dawn's Senior year a new face had joined the gang, a boy who wasn't intimidated by Dawn's size or tail. He quietly tried to get her elected Homecoming Queen and <b>DID</b> ask her to the Junior/Senior prom. Dawn was reluctant to go but Buffy insisted that Dawn deserved to have that particular night away from patrolling. Buffy even said, \"Don't worry about it Dawn. I'll make sure to save a few vampires or whatever we find for you to dust the next night.\" Curiously, Dawn and her date were voted best couple at the prom. And NO Willow didn't do anything magical to rig the vote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the side-effects of being a living \"mystical\" key for Dawn was her increasing facility with all spoken human languages including math ( a language based on symbols). Her date was a history freak and they were literally made for each other. In fact they got along SO well at the prom, it wasn't long before he had totally surprised Dawn by proposing marriage to her. After he revived her and unsure of what to say, she asked him to wait for her answer which he gladly did. When she told Buffy and Aunt Tara they both insisted Dawn say yes immediately. She did and they married [appropriately enough] on the next Summer Solstice. Their father wasn't all that happy about his not yet 17 year-old younger daughter getting married but Buffy insisted he approve it or as she said, \"You'll never see either of us alive again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Buffy's 25th High School Reunion came around, the Western Hemisphere and all of Oceania were no longer infested with ANY Vampires and the demon population had also been severely reduced. It was then she decided to retire saying, \"Well, I should leave some for Faith to take care of. Now that she's being paroled for good behavior I wouldn't want to take away <i><b>ALL</b></i> of her fun.\" And so she didn't. Then again Xander wouldn't wait forever. For although Buffy, Faith and oddly enough Tara were immortal, in a way, Xander and Willow were aging normally. Besides Dawn was going to be a grand-mother soon and they were all anxious to see how long her eldest daughter would be pregnant. Because she was now fully a blended feline-human all <i><b><u>FIVE !</u></b></i> of Dawn's pregnancies had barely lasted 5 1/2 months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It was like her features were made out of the leather, even her rapidly darting eyes. She wanted to scream to this evil-her and ask why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll tell you why.\" She said. Willow froze, thinking \"Oh shit, she can hear my thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only when you vocalize them like that, and if I actually care to hear them. Anyways, everyone in my dimension was such a bore. Always study this, prepare for that, no sex till marriage, no fun at all. So I started studying, and learned how to turn people into objects.\" The doppelganger began. \"It started innocently enough. I turned that brat Cordelia into a dildo and showed her how to have a good time. Then I turned buffy into a pair of panties and did the same for her. It was just addictive. Soon I had all my friends in my drawer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you actually saying that all my friends are in your closet in your dimension???\" Willow cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... see, that's the problem. Turns out that when I turn someone into my clothes, their lifeforce burns out in 5 years or so. I needed my fix, so I turned everyone in the world into a pair of nylons. One person per thread. They were so sexy and arousing, but unfortunately, they got a run one night while I was... enjoying... myself, so I was left with no one to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole world!?\" Screamed Willow, unbelieving she would be capable of that in any dimension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course the whole world. You don't understand the rush. Of having someone totally at your mercy, to be able to destroy or enjoy them at will. I couldn't help myself. Not that I wanted to. So I did a little more studying, and saw the possibility of other dimensions. Now I just hop around them, take almost the whole population over about 15 years, then pop over to another dimension so that they can repopulate. You know, in case I ever need them again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evil Willow smiled diabolically as she removed her knee high boot in preparation of putting her goody two-shoes self inside. \"I learned something very nice too. The other versions of me survive for much longer. If you weren't such a bookworm, you'd be joining your otherworldly sisters in my dildo collection. However, you, you little nerd, remind me too much of all the wet blankets in my home dimension, so you get to suffer under my smelly toes while they have fun. You'll stay under there until my raunchy feet until you've been completely worn away and don't exist anymore. Speaking of which, it's time for you to go to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood Willow watched as she entered a dark, rotten world. She barely saw any light from the outside, so she assumed her eyes were in the toe section. Then she saw 5 manicured toes enter the boot and settle upon her face. The smell sky rocketed, and she was amazed that all of a sudden she could see within the boot as if it was as bright as day. \"Oh, that's just a nice effect I added for you. Normally, that's what you'll see normally when I'm wearing you. However, when I'm transforming someone else, you're view will switch to the outside so you can see one of your friends go from person to accessory. Just a nice little gift for you. Speaking of which,\" The evil witch pondered first, \"who should I go after first?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A minute or so later, Buffy entered her bedroom and was surprised to see an unusual pair of panties lying on her bed. She didn't notice that it was the exact same color as Faith's hair. Looking closely at it, she immediately realized that it was European. The size band read 99cm which would be 39 inches in the U.S. So now Buffy was puzzled over not only who would buy her this but also why not buy something American. Digging out the conversion chart her mother had given her for her 16th birthday, Buffy was dismayed when she worked out that the panty was way too large for her. Since it felt so exquisite Buffy decided to put it on anyways, so she stripped off her pants and underwear. Sliding it up her legs, once she gets it fully on Buffy starts to feel different down there. With her free hand she even starts to fondle her breasts. It's only takes Buffy a couple of minutes before she brings herself to a fully unexpected orgasm. She promptly faints from the intensity of the sensations still flowing through her. Waking up quite a lot later, even-though there was no one around to see what she had just done for relaxation Buffy embarrassingly blushes over what had happened to her. Just as she finishes taking off Faith she hears the back door slam shut. It's Dawn coming home from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn yelled upstairs, \"Buffy are you home? Did you find the gift I bought you at the Mall yesterday?\" Buffy now thinking that the lingerie was from her kid sister doesn't reply to her call. Dawn was actually referring to something completely different. Thinking that Buffy isn't home yet Dawn goes straight to the refrigerator, getting out the fixings for a very large sandwich. Since her cycle started Dawn gets extremely hungry at that time each month. It's starting to really weigh on the Summers family food budget. Buffy then decided to surprise Dawn in her bedroom, wearing Faith and nothing else. So she strips her remaining clothes off and quietly (which is almost second nature to Buffy) enters Dawn's bedroom fully closing the door behind her. After a couple minutes standing in almost only her birthday suit Buffy grew very tired and so she laid down on dawn's bed for as she said, \"Only a minute or two.\" Over a half hour later Dawn has finished her meal and washed the dishes. She then starts for her bedroom but the phone rings when she's at the bottom of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ringing telephone wakes Buffy and now she's in almost the same predicament as Faith. The only difference between them is Buffy has transformed into a bra that matches the style and absolutely exquisite material that Faith had become. Buffy also has no way of knowing that she's now a size 109 (43 inches)DD. She now also realizes that the panty was probably one of her friends. But Buffy, of course, had no idea who it was. When Dawn answers it, Willow's on the phone. Dawn said, \"Hi Willow, what's up?\" She replied, \"Ah Dawnie, you know that gift you got for Buffy. I intercepted it before she returned home. There's something about it that I have to show you. Don't leave home until I return. Also, I left you something that I've recently noticed you needed for school.\" Dawn then hung up after saying, \"Alright Willow, I'll just go upstairs and start doing my homework. Good bye.\" Dawn then dashed up to her room expecting her present to be there. Dawn completely bypassed the living room where Willow's gift was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBouncing into her bedroom Dawn thinks nothing about her door being closed tight. She just figures that Willow had done it. At first, Dawn's disappointed that nothing is sitting on her desk. She figured that THAT is where Willow would've put her gift. Not seeing it there, Dawn turned on the light and she saw the set of lingerie lying on her bed. She was puzzled why it was laid out on her bed. It was already out of the bags they came in but they WERE different colors. Even more intriguing to her was the placement of the two items. They were exactly where they would be if she wore them to bed. Not looking a gift horse in the mouth (Dawn has mostly outgrown all of her underwear) she happily strips. Dawn takes only them with her into the bathroom. She plans on putting them on after a very leisurely bubble bath. She figures that Buffy can't complain about her wasting time for schoolwork if she's not home. Taking her time drying herself after the bath, Dawn doesn't realize that the two transformed slayers are way, WAY too big for her. They slide on her body as tho they were both custom fitted for her. Actually it was the other way around, because Dawn's body magically expanded. When she finished putting them on, both pieces were now comfortably snug on Dawn's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn again calls out for Buffy. When she doesn't reply, Dawn goes down the hall to Buffy's bedroom. Because they are a very tight fit, Dawn just can't wait to see how they look on her. Not having even bothered to look at their size Dawn is stunned by her suddenly very enhanced hour-glass figure. Seeing themselves in Buffy's mirror both slayers become sexually aroused. It's not long before Dawn's face is now quite flush with sexy, guttural moans emanating from deep down in her throat. Buffy now becomes quite concerned about Dawn. Dawn's reacting the same way as she had after putting on the panty. Buffy now worries that Dawn will soon be trapped like her and Faith. Noticing that the bra was the exact same color as her hair, Buffy had correctly deduced that the panties were Faith. She then thinks to herself, \"Boy, I bet when I apologize to Faith about all this she'll want it done someplace very private. I just hope that somehow we're able to keep this a secret from Dawn. If she realizes what's just happened to HER was caused by US, she would probably freak out over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It takes Willow nearly an hour to return to the Summers home. Walking into the living room, she grows quite concerned about Dawn when she sees that Dawn hasn't touched her purchase. Yelling upstairs Willow said, \"Dawnie, why you didn't you open your present?\" Hearing Willow downstairs, Dawn freezes. Now thoroughly drenched in sweat she panics. Dawn is positively glowing now and she's now so weak from being stimulated she can barely walk into the hallway. So Willow then said, \"Dawn, In a minute I'm coming upstairs and I'll bring your present with me. I'll leave it in front of your bedroom door. You really, REALLY need to use it right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Dawn has crawled back to her bedroom. Dawn's body is now glowing so brightly she has to shield her eyes from its intensity. She hears Willow from near the bottom of the stairwell, several times lustily scream, \"YES\". Dawn then hears the continuing loud thud of something rolling down the stairs. Now very frightened about everything that's happened, Dawn very cautiously crawls toward the stairs. She's quite surprised to NOT see Willow anywheres near the stairs. When she sees a vibrator (that's the exact shade as Willow's fiery red hair) lying at the bottom of the stairs, Dawn starts laughing. Instantly recognizing what it is from her sex education class in school Dawn said out loud, \"Ya Willow, you sure knew the right thing to get me. I'm putting it to REAL GOOD use right now.\" As soon as she returns to her bed Dawn does exactly what she had learned in her sex ed. class. She completely forgets about Willow mysteriously disappearing from the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, Dawn starts wondering where everybody has gotten to. She's used to eating dinner alone but normally SOMEONE would call and tell her that they'll be late. Wandering back into Buffy's bedroom, Dawn notices Faith's clothes piled up at the foot of Buffy's bed. Now worried, Dawn starts looking for any clues that any one else had been in the house that day. Finding Willow's clothes near the stairs frightens her and she drops the phone a couple of times before she successfully calls Giles. Telling him all that she knows Giles tells her, \"Dawn don't move or do anything. I'll call the coven in England to see if they can figure out what's happening there. As soon as I hear anything from them I'll come over there with the rest of the gang.\" Giles hangs up before Dawn can tell him that she's only wearing her new lingerie in the downstairs hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By now, Dawn has become so agitated about being all alone in her home she hasn't realized that using Willow caused her body to grow even BIGGER. More specifically, she's now grown to be 203 cm (6ft. 8in.) tall. The rest of her body has now caught up with her previously enhanced figure. In fact, the only part of Dawn that hasn't grown yet, is her hair which now looks ridiculously short on her. Not that she's noticed it yet. Right after Dawn hangs up the phone she kneels in the hallway. She was starting to feel a little dizzy and out of breath. Half an hour later her body is still flushed from her upstairs activities with Willow. Now suddenly feeling the need to go real bad, Dawn quickly crawled into the downstairs bathroom to relieve herself. Taking much longer than she normally would, Dawn crawled back out to the hallway after finishing her business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she had finally gotten herself real comfortable there, the front doorbell rings. Thinking that it's Giles with some answers for her, she yelled out, \"Come on in, the door's unlocked.\" Dawn is quite surprised to see that it's a couple of kids from school. They're very tall, twins and Dawn knows the boy. Before she can get anything out of her mouth the girl says, \"Oh good, it's pretty much worked out just as I told you it would.\" She then mentions that Dawn's hair is still short. Now specifically talking to her brother, \"You didn't believe me when I told you her body was FLEXIBLE enough. You now have absolutely no reason to NOT ask her to your birthday party.\" He's now become so embarrassed over the whole situation he starts stuttering incomprehensibly. Dawn is now of two minds. On the one hand, she's quite angry to learn that THIS girl is the cause her of recent growth. On the other hand, the boy IS cute and awfully dreamy AND until earlier this evening he had been way over a foot taller than her. So Dawn had never even had the nerve to ever once TALK to him at school, so she's now flabbergasted to learn that he is REALLY interested in HER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn now gives an Oscar-worthy performance pretending that she doesn't know ANYTHING about magic. The girl whose name is name Sally Long (which she has hated since 5th grade when the kids at school in another city started calling her, 'LONG, TALL, SALLY' like in the children's song) spent the next 20 or so minutes explaining things to Dawn. Still stunned when Sally finishes, Dawn as meekly as she can asks about the party. So Eric Long tells her, \"Since we'll be turning sixteen tomorrow, it's just your basic coming out party. We're each allowed to invite one OUTSIDER and Sally has been teasing me really bad about you for several weeks now. I suppose I shouldn't have mentioned to her just how BEAUTIFUL you are Dawn.\" Dawn like any other normal girl, is quite taken by his sentiment. In fact, she's so touched she fainted from his declaration. Shortly after they revive her, the mood is broken when Giles appears at the front door with a worried look on his face that Dawn has never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
