Not that you needed to be told, you saw it every day. You saw how he struggled with even the simplest tasks, how he strained to do anything. Feeding himself was practically a workout. Standing up was impossible without a great deal of assistance from you. Walking wasn't even feasible. At...at this rate...you were terrified  Zack might not even make it to age 12, let alone adulthood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Thompson!\" the doctor who'd been speaking to you suddenly spoke up, \"Please, I understand your fears but you need to try and calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took in a careful breath, a few of them in fact, slow and steady ones, then nodded, looking at the doctor, \"Y-You're right, I'm sorry for freaking out so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Mr. Thompson, the possibility of losing a younger sibling and having no way to stop it would tear apart anyone. You want nothing more than to do something, ANYTHING, to help him, isn't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I really do! I don't want to lose my younger brother. I can't stand seeing him this way.\" you reply back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there may be a way.\" he holds up a hand before you say anything, \"Now while I can guarantee his safety, as in, what I am about to say will not cause him harm, I cannot guarantee the results. So it may very well do nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course before I do anything there will be other forms to fill out. Waivers, medical forms, other legal things. But, that said, what we have is...\"</span></div></div>",

I don't want Zack getting filled with a bunch of unsafe steroids or anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No no, nothing like that. I assure you, that, at WORST, Zack will gain nothing from this. And at the least, if it works, he'll be back to a normal size for his age, but I suspect that it won't stop there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc, this is my brother we're talking about!\" you say, getting frustrated with him beating around the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I'm sorry Mr. Thompson.\" the doctor let out a sigh, \"You see, this isn't going to beat or cure the MD. At all. He'll still HAVE the MD. But as such, we'll need to continuously inject him with the drugs each week for the rest of his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok....what's the part you aren't telling me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to grow, Mr. Thompson. Not just a little, but a great deal. In fact his life will be all about fighting against the MD. You'll need to feed him, have him lift weights, and so on. He can't ever stop that or the injections or the MD will come back, I guarantee it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....he'll be able to actually do normal things again, right?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heavens yes! He'll be your own little athlete to raise really. Your own personal bodybuilder to help grow. He won't have to spend every waking moment training, he can do normal 'kid' stuff, because he'll be able to do it as well. Just understand Mr. Thompson you can't slack off bringing him in for injections, no matter what happens, he HAS to have them from now on, and the only way he'll get them is by coming in for them, we can't let you do these at home, they are simply too experimental to be out in public, we need to measure his growth rates and such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now the doctor had you fill out the forms needed, and told you to go home. The initial process would take the better part of a week to do, and there was no sense in having you stay there. It was hard to leave, so very hard to leave. But it was for the best. Why stay there and be a burden or a bother to the doctors as they tried to work? Being there did nothing for Zack. So you kept the figurative 'stiff upper lip' and tried to go through your week as best as possible, but the MOMENT you got that call to come to the hospital you RUSHED over, and found him....</span></div></div>",

So you began preparing things. You bought equipment, weights, that sort of thing, but also food, lots of food. The doctor told you that Zack was gonna be HUNGRY, not just when he got home, but all the time. He was gonna be a very, very growing boy from here on out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow once the call finally came you rushed to the hospital quick as you could and found Zack....normal. Not buff, not massive, but...normal. Even so, normal...normal was good, normal meant Zack would live, that he'd thrive. You ran over to him and hugged him tightly, kissing his forehead and keeping him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack...Zack I'm SO glad you're ok! I don't know what I'd do if I had lost you...\" you say, trying not to cry.<br>\r\nHe just smiled, hugging back, \"It's ok big brother! I'm alright now! Though the doctor's say I'm gonna have to come back every Monday for another injection. But they also say I'm gonna grow really big and strong too.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah....yeah you will Zack. You'll be the buffest, strongest, fastest kid EVER. You don't ever have to worry about going back to how things were before ever again.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks big brother!\"<br>\r\n\"You're welcome Zack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm glad you both are happy, but we do need to talk before he's released.\"<br>\r\n\"R-Right, of course.\"<br>\r\n\"Now, first off, Zack MUST come in each Monday for testing and another injection. Things won't be as serious as they were the first time, it should take no more than an hour each time. However, the other important thing is that Zack MUST also eat plenty of healthy, muscle-building food and train for at minimum, 2 hours a day, though we recommend 4 hours, but no more than 6 until we can ascertain more about how the drugs are affecting him. Do you BOTH understand?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir!\"<br>\r\n\"Good, good. Now, you two are free to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, once Zack was wheeled out and you both got in the car, his new life began. After a few weeks he was...</span></div></div>",

You note the weekly dose of injections at the hospital which Zack needs to receive. You go online and buy a parking sticker for the whole year so that parking in the hospital\u2019s parking garage becomes less of a chore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you put the two-hour daily workout regimen for Zack on your smartphone\u2019s calendar. You set reminders so that no workout will ever be skipped or forgotten without a very legitimate reason. At least, you won\u2019t be the one forgetting about it! Zack can forget stuff since he\u2019s the kid, but you won\u2019t forget because you\u2019re the big bro and the responsible one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the first week, Zack get into the basement where you installed the workout bench and a few dumbbells. You were surprised how quickly he figured out how to use all the equipment. He started lifting right away and he was able to bench about 70 pounds without too much effort. Not bad for a little kid! He also managed the 15-pound dumbbells pretty easily during the first week, doing curls, squats, lunges and of course sit-ups and push-ups on the mat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the third week, he was benching 100 pounds on the bar, he was using the 25-pound dumbbells and his reps were going from 10 to 15 for each set! And the results were totally amazing! When you went down to the basement at the end of the last workout, he was becoming a buff, little man before your very eyes. His muscles were growing like crazy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack\u2019s arms were becoming thick and muscled with veins running over his forearms and across his bulging biceps. His pectorals were forming on his chest, neatly standing out from his chest like two bulging spheres of muscle and his abdominal muscles were clearly visible now! His quads were growing like crazy, becoming thick, hard, wide and forming thick cords of muscle above his knees. Lastly, his calves were becoming hard, round footballs of vein-covered muscle on the back of his mighty legs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you struggled to open a brand new jar of peanut butter one evening, you had to call on Zack to help you. He just strolled up to you and took the large jar out of your hand. Then, he placed his hand on the round lid and gave it a mighty twist, unscrewing the lid for you without any effort at all. He handed it back to you, without the lid. All he did was smile at you. Clearly, he enjoyed showing off his strength! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, big guy! I can tell how big and how strong you\u2019re becoming!\u201d you say to him on that Sunday night. \u201cTomorrow is injection-day at the hospital!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack just frowned. Then he made an ugly face and stuck out his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlehhh\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! You wanna get bigger and stronger, right?\u201d you say, as you make 4 sandwiches for the big brat. \u201cYou surely don\u2019t want to get sick and weak again!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, no! Noooooo!\u201d he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then! Back to the hospital you go, tomorrow, Hercules!\u201d you chuckle as he groans when you give him his stack of sandwiches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eats his sandwiches and then, while watching TV, the little muscle guy dozes off while leaning against you on the couch\u2026 You find it so adorable, but you let him sleep until you go to bed. You wake him up because he\u2019s become too heavy to carry by now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack seemed a little glum that morning as you drove him to the hospital, but he didn't complain or protest even once.  Clearly your reminder last night of the alternative to these shots sank in.  You were pleased with how stoically he offered  Dr. Williams his left arm, even as you marveled inwardly at the transformation that once-feeble limb has undergone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as long as you can remember, your little brother's arms and legs were little more than pipecleaners, so thin and brittle-looking just seeing them made you want to cry.  Now, however, Zack's bared left arm was visibly healthy and exceedingly thick with chiseled, rippling muscle!  if you didn't know better, you'd swear it was the arm of a high school varsity jock instead of a mere preteen boy!  Zack grinned proudly at you, an expression which changed to a wince as the needle penetrates his skin for the first time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finally finished Dr. Williams placed three small band-aids neatly over the puncture wounds and told him, \"Okay, that's it for this week, young man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack hopped lithely off the examination table, and you felt an unexpected catch in your throat at this simple, graceful movement, one which would have been utterly beyond Zack's physical abilities only three weeks ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" he announced enthusiastically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'd like to speak with your guardian in private,\" Dr. Williams interjects.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, man!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go out to the waiting room, Zack; I'll be with you in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to stay there?  Couldn't I do a few laps around this floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter so many years of being wheelchair-bound, you could hardly blame Zack for wanting to exercise those solid, newly-powerful legs of his.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but be careful!  Don't go too fast and don't run into anyone!\" you cautioned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I got you,\" Zack says, out the door and gone in a flash.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Williams clearing his throat brought your attention back to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong, is there, doc?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.  I just wanted to update you on the results of our measurements. It seems in the last week Zack has gained seventy-seven pounds, almost all of which is purely muscle.  He's added five inches to his upper arms, eight to his calves, and another fifteen inches to his chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you replied.  You'd seen the results yourself firsthand, but somehow hearing it in concrete measurements still had an impact.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, so far I'm pleased to say the drugs have been performing even better than our computer models projected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God for that!  Doc, you'll never know how much this means to us.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can imagine,\" he told you with a small smile.  \"And once these trials are finished, we'll be helping thousands more boys in situations just like Zack's.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake hands with Dr. Williams, telling him you'll see him tomorrow, and then head to the hospital corridor to find Zack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were looking both ways up and down the corridor when a blond blur shot at you from the right.  You instinctively threw your arm up, but Zack skidded to a halt right before impact.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you not to go too fast!\" you scolded him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Jake,\" he apologized sheepishly, shrugging his considerably broader shoulders.  \"I just kinda got into it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, it's okay,\" you say ruffling his golden hair, to his annoyance.  \"As long as you didn't run into anyone.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou halted and turned to look at him.  \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou DIDN'T run into anyone, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course not!\" he denied indignantly.  \"I maneuvered around them, like a fighter jet!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm.  That he would reach for that particular comparison told you something about just how fast he was going.  Still, you put it aside as the two of you walked to the elevator.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, think you can manage to stay still long enough for us to get down to the ground floor?\" you teased him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better idea,\" Zack offered, his brown eyes lighting up.  \"Why don't you take the elevator, I'll take the stairs, and we'll see who gets there first?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're on the fifteenth floor,\" you protested as the elevator door dinged and opened in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Zack called back as he darted for the stairwell door.  \"I might even be out of breath by the time I get there!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you stepped into the elevator.  It stopped twice before opening at the ground floor and when you got out, Zack was waiting for you, a cat-who-caught-the-canary smile on his youthfully handsome face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I was wrong; not out of breath in the least,\" he informed you smugly.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to ride with me in the car?  Or do you want to just sprint the twenty miles home?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack pretends to think it over for a minute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll ride with you.  That way I can put in a really hard work-out when we get home!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of my work-outs . . . \" Zack began as you head onto the highway on-ramp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" you prompted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna need some heavier weights.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, you shoot a glance over at him, but see no sign that he's kidding.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack nodded rapidly.  \"Yes, everything we've got is way too light for me now\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Williams did emphasize the importance of Zack's work-outs.  If he needed more weights, then that's what you have to get him.  Besides, it's not like you can't afford it.  Between what your parents left the two of you and court settlement for their deaths, neither of you will ever have to worry about money.  That's how you were able to afford such expensive, experimental medical care for Zack, not to mention all the tutors and caretakers who have been helping you with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if that's what you need, that's what we'll get,\" you promised him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" he cheers.  \"Can we pick them up on the way home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, kid.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou detoured to the mall, where Zack quickly went overboard on the amount of extra weight he needed.  Still, you figured he'd likely eventually grow enough to use them, so you indulged him.  The salesmen detailed two employees to help you get the weights out to your car.  Once it came time to load them into the trunk, however, Zack made a production of doing it all by himself, visibly impressing both grown men, and you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you didn't pull a muscle showing off like that,\" you grumbled to him as the two of you fastened your seat-belts.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck, no!  These muscles are way too strong now to be strained by a little weight like that!\" Zack bragged.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you won't mind carrying them to the basement by yourself?\" you needled him gently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, bro, I'll do it,\" he assured you, surprising you.  \"You just rest in your chair, maybe take a nap and I'll wake you when it's time for lunch.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to swat the brat, but he ducked too quickly for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got home Zack was as good as his word, his enlarged biceps visibly bulging under his tight shirt-sleeves as he boyhandled the mass of weights down into his basement gym.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your position behind the bench-press as his spotter while Zack loaded up the bar with two big fifty pounders and two smaller twenty-five pounders.  He slipped under the bar as you readied yourself to catch it before it crushed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack lifts the bar from its struts and an expression of strain disfigured his face.  You were already starting to life the bar when he barked \"I've got it!\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your shock, Zack raises the bar up before lowering it again.  Although you remain in position, Zack pumps out fifteen full reps with the two hundred and fifty pounds!    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, panting a bit, Zack grins mischievously up at your slack-jawed face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you I needed the extra weight!\"  he gloated cockily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess you did,\" you replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack continued his work-out routine with fifty-pound dumbells, one in each hand.  Then two hundred push-ups and four hundred brisk sit-ups.  He kept going, his exertions so strenuous that simply <i>watching</i> him is making you tired!  When at last you're able to tear yourself away from watching him, you look down at your watch and see that the two of you have been down here for two hours and forty-one minutes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey, Energizer Bunny!\" you called out to Zack.  \"You've been working out for more than two hours!  You're done already!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golden-haired, twelve year-old musclekid looked up from his third session with the dumbbells.  He really was pumping iron like a freaking pro now!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can keep going!\" he insisted, his very developed musculature pumped up even bigger with blood and raw, pure physical power!   <br>\r\nHe looked like a junior Olympic gymnast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can, but let's take a break for today.  Aren't you hungry?\" you suggested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man, I'm<u> starving</u>!\" Zack confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a shower and I'll get your lunch ready.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack hesitated for a moment before giving in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" he proclaimed before sprinting up the stairs.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did he do it?  you marveled to yourself.  It was like he still had all the energy he hadn't used while was suffering from muscular dystrophy and now it was practically bursting out of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd man, was he ever <b>STRONG</b> now!  You can't imagine bench-pressing two hundred and fifty pound even once, much less over a dozen times.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a whim you reach down and grab one of his fifty pound dumbbells, and it takes you both hands to lift it off the floor.  Quickly putting it down you hurry upstairs to make Zack's lunch.  His appetite has become voracious in the last few weeks and you hope you have enough hamburger in the house to satisfy him.  <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Too slow, bro!\u201d he crowed, grinning triumphantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrat,\u201d you replied affectionately. You reached out to pull him into a hug, but the extremely buff eleven year-old stood strong, like an immovable pillar, and you ended up pulling yourself into Zack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t mess up my new threads!\u201d he fussed, freeing himself with a casual shrugging of his newly large, broad shoulders.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course all of Zack\u2019s clothes were new now.  With his dramatic, continuing increase in muscle mass your little brother had outgrown his old wardrobe a week and a half after his treatments had begun!  Now, only four days later, his red golf shirt and beige shorts were already looking tight on him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, model boy, get in the car,\u201d you quipped to him and he dashed out of the house.  You followed, reflecting that Zack always seemed to go everywhere at top speed these days, like he was trying to make up for all of his years of relative immobility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your Kindle from the hall table, you left the house, locked the door, and slid in behind the wheel of your Honda.  When you pulled into the parking spot, your little brother instantly undid his seatbelt and flung his car door open.  He launched from the passenger seat like a missile, zooming toward the entrance to the park.  As you followed him at a more sedate pace, you took a moment to appreciate the beauty of this particular Sunday morning.  There was a slight cooling breeze to mitigate the heat of the sun, and the only clouds dotting the azure sky were white and fluffy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when he was sick, Zack liked coming here.  You remembered all the times he stared so raptly at the other boys playing touch football, or soccer, like a group of them were doing now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Zack was in front of you again.  \u201cCan I join in?  Please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over at the game, at how roughly the participants were playing, taking advantage of the lack of a referee to push and shove one another, and had to choke down your instinctive \u201cNo\u201d.  This is what Zack had been waiting for, dreaming of, for so long: simply being able to act like a normal boy.  You determinedly fought down your overprotective urge and told him, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud cheer Zack sprinted over to the game.  After a brief discussion, he was recruited for the shirts team.  The beautiful, beaming smile on his face made something catch in your chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your little brother excitedly took his place, you carefully selected a bench deliberately distant from the field, not wanting to embarrass him by hovering.  Settling down at the bench, you flipped on your Kindle and brought up the latest novel in Will Wight\u2019s fascinating Cradle series, \u201cUncrowned\u201d.  You were quickly drawn into the story, glancing up to check on Zack only at the end of each chapter.  Every time you did, you saw Zack was either in possession of the ball or hot on the heels of whoever was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fourth chapter, you glanced up to see Zack score a goal, the ball rocketing past the goalie and between the two trees.  His teammates crowded around him, and you were just about to turn back to your novel when a tall, dark-haired boy of the other team aggressively shoved his way into the group, his anger apparent from his sharp movements and loud voice.  You were already standing up when this jerk took a swing at your little brother!  Fortunately, Zack ducked the blow with lightning speed, but the attacker only fired off another, and another, forcing your brother back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou broke into a run, cursing your choice of bench.  Pressed back now against his teammates, Zack took a blow to the stomach, but it didn\u2019t seem to phase him in the least.  He answered by slugging the thug in his own torso, but the effect of this hit was startlingly different.  The other boy doubled over immediately, a stream of vomit bursting forth from his mouth onto the bright green grass.  He collapsed next to the puddle, hugging his midsection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reached Zack\u2019s side.  His wondering gaze kept shifting from the prone punk to his still-clenched right fist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d you asked him urgently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words seemed to shake him from his daze and his bright blue eyes met yours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m great!  I don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing so good, though,\u201d he said, gesturing toward the crying teen writhing on the ground.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew him,\u201d you said coldly.  \u201cWhy did he go after you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was mad cause I scored three goals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked in surprise.  Three?  You only saw one!  In twenty minutes\u2019 time Zack, who has never played soccer before, scored a hat trick?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the boys were staring wide-eyed at Zack, but a few of the skins were glaring at him.  You decided it was time to leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Zack, we\u2019re going home for lunch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walked away, but a few boys chased after the two of you, virtually begging for Zack\u2019s email address.  He was happy to give it to them and you were more than happy to see him making friends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home, Zack excitedly relates all three of the times he scored, and how easy it was to maneuver around and outrun the opposition.  \u201cIt was like they were little kids, and I was the adult!\u201d he relished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you had such a good time.  I\u2019m sorry it had to end the way it did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith that idiot attacking you,\u201d you clarified.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, bro,\u201d he reassured you.  \u201cThat was fun too!  I barely felt him hit me, and then I totally creamed him with just one punch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, a little disturbed at how happy Zack seems to be at having won that fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at home Zack again consumed over two thousand calories for lunch.  An hour later, you watched from his spotting position as he triumphantly benched his new max of three hundred and twenty-five pounds.  Racking the weight bar, he rose up, faced the mirrored wall, and FLEXED!  His bronzed, exquisitely chiseled musculature gleamed with perspiration, his pumped, cannonball biceps almost touching his iron forearms.  His proud pec protruded from his deep chest, overshadowing his defined cobblestone, six-pack abs.  In spite of the changes you witnessed in him recently, you were still shocked at what an imposingly ripped musclekid Zack has turned into!  He looked like a professional boy bodybuilder!  You couldn\u2019t help wishing you had muscles even half the size of his!           <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening Zack came into your room while you were on the computer.  He was clad in only shorts, his statuesque upper body and thickly-muscled legs on full display.  There was an air of seriousness about him which caught your attention at once.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a decision, bro,\u201d he tells you firmly, almost as if he\u2019s the older brother and guardian instead of you.  \u201cI want to . . . <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you have to use this week preparing not worring.

Thompson your brother well be out in a few minute were running a few final test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakes : ( relieved) So is there anything I should know before seeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor:  Hmm well in the past week the drug has increased his height reaching the 6ft mark and his gain weigh's 100 pounds in pure muscle, so overall he well look a bit different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake: What about his MD were you able to cure it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor: I'm sorry Mr.Thompson we couldn't cure him, but the drug temporarily stopped it's effects and I would like to tell both of you what happens next.So if you follow me we can go see Zake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the doctor to see finally see Zake. \"So your brother is right behind thsee doors\"said the doctor.pushing the doors open to find Zake now towering over you, but you didn't care trying and run over to hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake : Zake I'm so glad to see you ( cries)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZake: it's ok bro I'm fine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor: Sorry to interrupt but I have to tell you both something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Zake: what is it ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor : Since you all ready know the drug only pause's the MD effects , so every Monday Zake has to another injection.<br>\r\nTwo Zake has to eat healthy and work out everyday ,so the MD doesn't come back and after that point there's nothing we can do.

Basically we can make someone, say, as strong as Superman, without making them hugely buff, with the mind of Hawking, and the looks only a master sculptor could produce, and so on. The thing is, once it's done, there's no undoing it.\"<br>\r\n\"So what will that mean for Zack?\"<br>\r\n\"It means he won't ever age. That's the one side-effect of the process that cannot be gotten around at all, once we go in and work on him, it stops the aging process, forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was an unexpected twist, one you did not see coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So will Zack be fine regardless? And can you use the machine on him again after that?\" you ask next.<br>\r\n\"Yes to both questions. Even just a brief run through the machine will fix what's wrong with him, he'll never be sick again. But he will live forever an 11 year old boy, never aging, never dying.\"<br>\r\n\"How far enhanced can you make him?\"<br>\r\n\"Honestly...in every simulated go of it, we've never found an upper cap. That's why I am only offering this to you because I know you're desperate, but this is also for a selfish reason, we NEED data from it to see if it actually works. It's never been tested on a real person before. On the other end though, if Zack ends up too powerful, he could either destroy the machine and us, or use it to become almost godlike, or maybe even actually a God, I really don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat kind of revelation was like a bucket of cold water to your face, this was all too much to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Zack's only hope of survival?\"<br>\r\n\"It's either this, or death for him, there's nothing else that can be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a moral dilemma you were not expecting to face today. On one end, if you did nothing, Zack was dead, period, full stop, end of story. On the other, you would forever tie him to life itself. Life that would last for thousands...nay, probably millions of years. What would that do to him, to his psyche, when you were long buried, and he still lived on for decade after decade and century after century? Forever trapped in a body that would not age, never able to grow up, live a normal life, and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if you enhanced him, what would that mean as well? Would he be a slave to his own mind and body, trapped in an eternity of hedonism? Oh sure he might end up the strongest, smartest, most famous person in history, but then what does that mean for him really? What would be his purpose and goal in life if he was already the greatest? Where could he achieve more, how could he become better when there was nothing higher than him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of taking action, you look back at the doctor and say, \"It's Zack's decision. Whatever he chooses, and tell him honestly about that machine, I will support, even if he chooses to die.\" Thus you take the easy road out, you didn't want to make that moral choice, so now Zack, your own sickly little brother, has to determine his own fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor sighs and stands up, leaving the room, but tells you to go home for the night, and return the next morning. You do so, and are soon brought in to meet Zack, where...</span></div></div>",

There, he laid out several charts on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hospital has received a special grant from the state university about eight years ago to initiate an elaborate research project in the study of bionics, nanobots and cyborg-to-human integration and operational procedures. We have a special team of medical students and surgeons who can perform an operation on a special patient where this subject will transform into a human with the latest technological implants and capabilities. I think your little brother is a great candidate for this!\u201d Dr. Jones said excitedly as Jake listened in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Whoa! What\u2026. What does this mean? What\u2026. What are you going to do to Zack?\u201d Jake said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically\u2026. Zack will become a half-human and a half-robot!\u201d the doctor explained. \u201cHe will be rid of all traces of this horrible disease in his body\u2026. His body will still grow like normal\u2026. He will have to have small surgeries from time to time, but\u2026 He will live a happy, normal life, and he will enjoy all the benefits which come from having nanobots and bionics inside of him!\u201d the doctor replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhmmm\u2026. What kind of benefits are those?\u201d Jake wondered. \u201cWhat do nanobots and bionics do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well\u2026. He\u2019ll be bigger and stronger than normal\u2026 MUCH stronger! He\u2019ll be able to lift a car\u2026. And, even MUCH heavier things than that! He will become practically superhuman!\u201d the doctor grinned. \u201cHe won\u2019t be that weak, little brother anymore!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u2026.\u201d Jake smiled. \u201cYes\u2026. I like the sound of that\u2026 I REALLY like the sound of that\u2026 He deserved that after everything he has been through!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, Mr. Thompson! Let me get you the paperwork. I will make a few phone calls and we\u2019ll round up the team. The surgery will take between twenty and thirty hours. We\u2019ll do it starting tomorrow!\u201d the doctor replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor left the room and returned with a binder filled with 28 pages worth of forms for Jake to initial, date, sign and read through. It took him over three hours to go through all the paperwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he returned to Zack\u2019s room, but his little brother was sound asleep. All he wanted to do was tell him the good news, but Zack was just too weak to stay awake. So, Jake just tapped his head until Zack opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake? Are you there?\u201d Zack said in a weak voice. \u201cAm I gonna have\u2026 Another operation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! But\u2026 I got some good news!  They\u2019re gonna give you nanobots and bionics! You\u2019re gonna get rid of this stupid MD sickness and you\u2019re gonna become STRONG! You\u2019ll be like a super-kid!\u201d Jake said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2014What? Are you\u2026. Serious?\u201d Zack sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES! No more weak, little Zack! I can\u2019t wait! You\u2019re gonna be awesome, little bro!\u201d Jake grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zack had closed his eyes and dozed off again. The poor kid was just too weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis has just GOT to be the last day that I have to deal with this\u2026\u201d Jake cried as he walked out of the room\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jake returned to the hospital the following day, Zack\u2019s bed had already been rolled out of his room. He was gone. They had already taken him in to prepare him for surgery. Jake then turned around and left. He went home and played a game on his laptop. He visited the bagel shop down the street and he watched some sports on the large TV screens at the sports bar down the street, just to get his mind off things. Then, he finally went home and tried to fall asleep. He tried to study for his college classes, but it was no use. All he could do was think about his little brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dreaming about Zack playing football in the park\u2026 Running around in the yard\u2026 Playing soccer on the street\u2026 Swimming in the pool\u2026. He couldn\u2019t do ANY of these things with Zack. Life had been so unfair. Would this finally change? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jake finally got a phone call from the doctor the following morning, he ran to grab his phone from the dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi? Doctor? How\u2019s Zack? He\u2026 He made it? He\u2019s still recovering? GOOD! I\u2019ll be right over!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake put on his tennis shoes, shorts and a t-shirt and he leaped into his car just to race to the hospital as quickly as possible. Once he arrived, he was so relieved to find the doctor talking to Zack, who was awake and ALIVE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi bro!\u201d Zack grinned, while sitting straight up on the bed. He seemed so different! He was awake, energetic, happy and\u2026 healthy. Not only that, but\u2026 He looked fit, young, and\u2026 MUSCULAR! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZ---Zack?\u201d Jake gasped at the sight of his brother. His little bro looked like a whole different person now. He looked like a young athlete, not at all like the sickly, little boy he had been around with all his life. Zack now had broad shoulders, bulging arms, ripped abdominal muscles and well-defined pectorals! He looked like a young, 11-year-old junior bodybuilder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold still, Zack, I need to download your settings\u2026\u201d the doctor said as he placed a laptop next to the boy while connecting a cable from the laptop to a small USB port in Zack\u2019s wrist. There was a small metal lid that opened on Zack\u2019s wrist which allowed Zack to directly connect to any computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d Jake sighed as he watched how his brother was connected to a computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026 He can go home tonight! He needs to be back every two weeks for follow-up!\u201d the doctor ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was so thrilled. Finally, finally, his little brother would leave a normal life! A life of a super-strong kid, that is! Jake couldn\u2019t wait! Finally, he could have FUN with his little brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Usually, it was Jake who would check up on Zack since Zack was always feeling sick and asleep. Now that Zack was feeling so much better, he couldn\u2019t wait to get out of the house and have some fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake? Jake!\u201d Zack smiled as he quietly crawled in bed next to his older brother, who was sound asleep. And, no wonder. For all these years, it was Jake who had to take care of Zack all the time. Jake had to feed him, dress him, wash him, cook for him and clean up after him. So, Zack was feeling a little guilty right now. On the other hand, Zack was never able to do anything, so this was his very first opportunity to go out and do all the things all OTHER boys would do and just run around in the park and have FUN like a normal kid! Of course, Zack was no ordinary kid. He was a bionic, super, cyber-kid. So, why was Jake still asleep? It was time to wake up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhmmmm\u2026 Zack? It\u2019s 7 in the morning\u2026.\u201d Jake groaned. \u201cLet me sleep in!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we go to the park today? I wanna get out of the house!

Come onnnnnn!\u201d Zack said impatiently! Next thing you know, Zack grabbed Jake by the torso and he just lifted his big brother out of bed! He just picked him up and carried him out of the room, down the hall, and into the kitchen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUghhh! ZACK! Take it easy! Put me down, bro!\u201d Jake shouted as he was helplessly being carried around by his now MUCH stronger little brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Zack set Jake down by the kitchen sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we having breakfast, yet?\u201d Zack asked him impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, YES! Settle down, boy!\u201d Jake groaned. \u201cSet the table and I\u2019ll get us some cereal to eat!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake prepared two bowls of milk and cereal and toast. Zack joined in and the two boys had a quick breakfast before they got dressed and headed out to the park which was just across the street from their house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their arrived, there were a bunch of older boys tossing a (American) football around. Jake had caught the ball and he casually tossed it to Zack, who caught it with two hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, toss it to the boys over there!\u201d Jake told him, pointing at the boys who were standing just a few feet away. But, Zack was looking at two other boys, who were standing more than 20 yards away, and who were looking to catch the football as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna throw the ball to those guys over THERE!\u201d Zack indicated as the pulled his right arm back all the way, holding the football in a tight grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful, Zack! You must throw the ball hard in order for it to reach THAT far and you can\u2019t reach that\u2026. Don\u2019t hurt yours\u2014\u201d Jake began to warn him when Zack launched the ball into the air with a mighty pass which rivaled that of professional football players! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball soared across the sky and blew past the boys, landing in the grass over 30 yards beyond them! Both boys started to RUN for the ball as the other kids looked on in complete awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Did you see THAT? What a THROW!\u201d one boy gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan! That kid threw the ball out of the park!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap! I have never seen a kid throw a football that far!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake stared in awe as he looked at Zack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Watch it with the muscle, little bro!\u201d Jake whispered. \u201cYou practically threw the ball out of the park!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the two boys returned with the ball, but not after ten minutes of searching and running for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ball was out on the road\u2026 Past the fence!\u201d the boy explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoaaaa!\u201d the other boys all sighed. \u201cYou got one heck of an arm, bro!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack could only blush since all the kids were staring at him in awe\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake rushed his cybernetic younger brother home, so excited to have him alive and well. He held off on asking questions, as he had something he wanted to do first. Namely give his brother the strongest hug he can once they were inside, just holding him close, glad to have his brother finally beating this terrible condition which had plagued him for so long. Zack just hugged in return, understanding that's what you needed first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking Zack over, Jake saw how different he looked from up close. From far away nobody could tell the difference, other than the fact that he was pretty buff for his age, like a young athlete who'd been training hard for much of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp close though it was clear that Zack had technology through his whole body. There were lines of circuitry and such intermixed throughout him, even beneath the skin. There was a prominent vein going across one bicep that was not really a vein, but also was. It pumped not only blood to his arm but also clearly was moving the nanobots that had changed him so drastically. Even his nerves were more akin to wiring as well now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....err....ummm...how, how do you feel?\" Jake finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like me, bro.\" Zack replied, \"or do you mean something more like...how does being so different feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not sure what I should ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't feel human anymore, that's for sure.\" He held up his hand to stop Jake from saying anything yet, \"By that I mean my biological parts are so advanced they may as well be technology, and my fully technological parts are so advanced they might as well be biological.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like...the USB port in your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's a good example. I can connect to computers, which not only increases my processing power while I am connected, I can also download information directly into my mind, or use programs and play games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you can do stuff with your mind with a computer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Like if you opened up an art program I could create a picture that I imagine, and it would get made on the computer, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" was all Jake said. But to not get overwhelmed, he continued and asked, \"Well, what about the rest of your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said it's both biological and technological, so I have to give the requirements of both. My biological parts need food and rest like always, while my technological parts will need maintenance and repair. That's why I have to go in for surgeries. Most of all they have to drain and filter my blood temporarily and extract the used nanomachines, as they just are not able to last that long currently, so I will need new doses of them. Think of it kinda like dialysis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialysis? Like when you have no kidneys? Well...that makes sense I guess. But keep going, Zack. I wanna know everything I can about the new you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My reflexes are approximately 10 times more responsive than an average adult's, while my speed is about 20 times, and my strength roughly 100 times higher....currently. They said as time went on I would only continue to improve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing Zack! So, then I shouldn't have a chance if we armwrestle, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked, \"Not in the slightest bro.\" He then put his arm on the table, \"But feel free to try if you don't believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two locked hands and began to push. Or rather Jake pushed, and Zack just sat there, smirking. He encouraged Jake to push harder, nothing happened. He told Jake to stand and even use both arms, and nothing happened. Only when Jake was sweating and exhausted did Zack finally pin his arms casually to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-da~\" he said, with a confident, if playful, smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, some time passes and...</span></div></div>",

Zack was....well he was just so much 'more', not just compared to how he was before, but to everyone else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was 'superhuman' in every sense of the word. He was absolutely brimming with energy, only needing about 4 hours of sleep a day to function, could run and move faster than anyone else, lift more than anyone else, and react more quickly than anyone else, not to mention being able to quite literally download and retain vast quantities of information and knowledge just by gaining access to the Internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say it took some getting used to was an understatement. He was just so much 'more' than everyone else Zack had gotten a bit more confident, but it wasn't unjustified, considering he DID have strength, speed, reflexes and more far away and above everyone else. But he wasn't cruel or petty with his new-found ability, but he also wasn't against showing off, especially to Jake, answering a question he had before he even finished asking it, lifting and carrying him around, running an errand faster than he could, and so much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even so it came a time when they had to return to the doctor for a check-up, and Zack sat down, eager to begin, knowing he'd get even BETTER from what happened today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Thompson.\" the doctor said to Jake, \"Are you sure you want to be here?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, why wouldn't I be?\"<br>\r\n\"Well the check-up and upgrades today...they might be a bit disturbing and off-putting to say the least, I do not want to cause you to panic\" he explained.<br>\r\n\"What, are you gonna open his head up or something?\"<br>\r\n\"No no, nothing so macabre, Mr. Thompson, but I do feel you may not like what we do. I assure you he will be fine however.\"<br>\r\n\"Anything you do, you can show to me.\" Jake said firmly.<br>\r\n\"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor hooked Zack up to the laptop like before, inserting a cord into the USB port on his wrist, then typing a few things out, then...Zack slumped over. Jake's heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Z-Zack....\" he said quietly. \"Wh-What did you do?!\"<br>\r\n\"Mr. Thompson, I warned you in advance. All I did was turn off his higher brain functions while we extract the old nanomachines and update his software.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, Jake was so shaken by this he had to be escorted out of the room, the nurse sitting with him to help keep him from freaking out completely. Meanwhile, Zack had the old nanomachines taken out, and new ones injected in, while the doctor worked on updating his software. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the nurse, Jake asked, \"So...he'll be alright, right? Like...he'll be better than before?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course Mr. Thompson, we would never do something so horrible as to downgrade your brother. It's simply a necessary part of how his body is now. I'm sorry it was so frightening, but we have to do so. I assure you he'll be perfectly fine, and better than before.\"<br>\r\n\"How much is he going to change? He'll still be my brother, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. His personality files aren't altered at all. It's more everything else about his software that's updated, along with the new nanomachines. In fact with everything today he'll...\"</span></div></div>",

We have to evolve his entire mind and body to a certain point, without exception. So we can't just say evolve only his muscles to no longer have MD, we have to evolve the rest of him. Also, we kinda have to decide now if this is what you want, and how much more evolved you want him to become.\"<br>\r\n\"How evolved CAN he become?\"<br>\r\n\"As far as i know, there's no limit, but let's keep your options simple and say a hundred years, a thousand years, or ten-thousand years.

You\u2019re about to decide something which will affect the rest of your little brother\u2019s life! You think about the risks involved in this experiment and you\u2019re hopeful that at the very least there is a glimmer of hope that Zack can be cured of this horrible disease. On the other hand, you don\u2019t want him to come out of this experiment as a freak of nature. So, you make the decision to take the safest route. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just evolve his body by a hundred years. I don\u2019t want to turn him into a freak. I mean, if we need to evolve him more, later, then we can bring him back over here, right?\u201d you ask the doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely! If this attempt is successful, and I think it will be because we tested it on dozens on animals in the lab already, then we can always re-do the test on him and evolve his muscular structure even further and see how he develops from there! He can only get better and stronger from this point going forward, Jake!\u201d the doctor responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe main thing is that he gets cured from Muscular Dystrophy! That\u2019s all I care about! I want my bro to have a normal life! Is that possible?\u201d you ask him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he\u2019ll be able to walk, jump, run, swim, and play around like all other boys who are eleven years-old. If his life will be normal\u2026 That is another question which will remain unanswered until we do the experiment and see the results!\u201d he responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? What are the side-effects?\u201d you ask, feeling a bit worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Jake, by evolving Zack\u2019s body, you will discover that your little brother will no longer be small and weak. He\u2019ll probably grow in stature and he will add a lot more muscle to his frame. The thing is, we won\u2019t know how much\u2026 Until we turn on the Gamma Ray and aim the ray on your brother for a few minutes. According to my calculations, he will come out of it cured of MS, but he will also be a lot stronger than he is now. Are you prepared for that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder what he says and considering how Zack has always been so sick and so weak, you welcome the idea of Zack now being strong and muscular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if Zack comes out of it with some muscle added to his body. He deserves it. As long as he is no longer stuck in a wheelchair!\u201d you reply. \u201cI just want him\u2026. Him\u2026 To be\u2026 To be\u2026. Freaking\u2026 NORMAL!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to sob loudly as you look at Zack\u2019s still body which is on the white stretcher. It just seems unbearable to you to have to spend the rest of your life caring for a sick brother who is an invalid. Or, even worse, to see your little brother wither away and to see him die a slow, horrible death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna take care of him, Jake. We\u2019re gonna make him big and strong\u2026\u201d the doctor says as the nurse pushes Zack\u2019s bed into the special room. You\u2019re not even allowed into the room. You can only watch from behind a huge, glass window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026 how strong\u2026 How strong will\u2026 will he become?\u201d you stutter, with tears rolling down your cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI estimate that he\u2019ll be stronger than two-dozen adult men combined\u2026\u201d the doctor whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre\u2026 Are you serious?\u201d you sigh, wiping the tears from your eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA hundred years from now, people will be much bigger and stronger than we are today\u2026. And Zack will show us what boys in the future will look like!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calm down. You just lift your head and you walk over to the large, glass window. The bed holding Zack\u2019s body is wheeled into a large, metal chamber. An oxygen mask is placed over Zack\u2019s head. An IV is stuck in his arm. The door is shut. A large Gamma ray gun is aimed at his chest from the ceiling. Two technicians operate a very large instrument panel. You observe a big flat screen TV monitor before you, hanging from the ceiling. It shows Zack\u2019s body, as seen from above. He looks so frail. You almost start to cry again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to evolve Mr. Thompson\u2019s body by one-hundred years\u2026 Engage process\u2026\u201d the nurse shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProcess engaged!\u201d the other technician repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine suddenly started humming loudly as a bright beam of light fired from the tip of the large machine, which was suspended from the ceiling inside the steel chamber. The light engulfed Zack\u2019s body, making him groan loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhhh!\u201d Zack moaned briefly, as his body spasmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZACK!\u201d you scream as you watch the monitor. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to him?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis muscular structure is evolving rapidly!\u201d the doctor explains calmly while pointing at the flat screen TV. \u201cLook!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see his chest bulging before your very eyes, causing his shoulders to grow wider during the process. His arms balloon along the sides of his body, as thick biceps and triceps suddenly swell up on his arms. You\u2019re seeing muscles, which Zack never had before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! He\u2026 He\u2019s growing!\u201d you notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis torso grows wider as thick, well-defined abdominal muscles appear below his big pecs, forming in neat rows and columns like tiles on the kitchen floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly smoke! He\u2019s got abs now!\u201d you utter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you see his very thin legs grow thicker and wider and deeper\u2026. All at once. Muscles which Zack had never used before now grow to amazing proportions, giving him the appearance of an Olympic marathon runner. Thick cords or muscle form from the waist to the kneecaps. His quads grow even wider than his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoaa!! His legs! Look at his LEGS! Ohmygod!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you see firm, round calf muscles form at the back of his legs, below the knees. The calves are so big, that they raise up his feet slightly off the bed. His muscles are HUGE in comparison to what he used to have before the operation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis body has evolved by one-hundred years!\u201d the tech shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine suddenly shuts off and the loud humming stops. The bright humming quiets down. The room becomes silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it over? How is he? What happened? Is he okay?\u201d you ask the doctor nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurses open the steel door. They disconnect the IV and they remove the oxygen mask from Zack. Then, they slowly push the bed out of the chamber. The door to the room opens and Zack comes out. He is still unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZack? ZACK?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive him a few minutes to recover. He\u2019ll be very sleepy and very hungry. And\u2026\u201d the doctor explains. \u201cHe\u2019ll feel heavier and much stronger than he was before. Plus, you\u2019ll need to help him get used to the idea of walking on his own two feet! He\u2019ll no longer need his wheelchair!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Really?\u201d you respond happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026 Get ready for him to be a LOT stronger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look at your buffed-up brother. The fact that he was muscular was the least of your worries. In fact, you were looking forward to him being the muscle guy in the house. You just wanted him to be cured. It looked like your wish was about to come true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The nure that moved him in left the room and sealed it, while the doctor and techs running the machinery began the sequence that would change Zach's life, forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject's vitals are stable.\" said one tech.<br>\r\n\"Evolution Ray is prepped and ready.\" said the second.<br>\r\n\"Very well, begin at 10% power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machinery began to do it's work, Zach's body was infused with a bright light, which kept anyone from seeing the changes to him as they happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject's vitals are holding. No sign of rejection.\"<br>\r\n\"Subject is evolved 10 years and counting.\"<br>\r\n\"Up the power to 25%\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright light got more intense, requiring the large window into the room to be dimmed in order to block it out. Still, the techs kept reading off Zach's vitals, he was good, he was healthy, the machine was working, that's what mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still holding steady on vitals.\"<br>\r\n\"Subject has evolved 100 years. No signs of rejection.\"<br>\r\n\"...50% power then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light was so strong now that the window had to be sealed off from the room, letting no one view it anymore, not that it was allowing much to be seen anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No changes in vitals.\"<br>\r\n\"Subject is now 500 years evolved. Still no signs of rejection.\"<br>\r\n\"I....well, I'm glad he's fine.\" the doctor says, it's clear he was highly concerned about this whole project harming Zach, \"Then no more holding back, full power, to be stopped immediately once the subject has evolved 10,000 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaution alarms began to go off in the room, as the full power was unleashed. The light from the room with Zach was so powerful now that even with the room sealed off, it was still leaking out into the other rooms around it. A humming sound also began to be heard, it's source unknown, the only thing heard over it was the tech calling out numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1,000 years!...2,000 years! 2,500 years! 5,000 years! 7,500 years! 9,900 years! 9,999 years!...10,000 years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine then turned off, and everything went dark for a moment while backup lighting turned on.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Your younger brother Zack has had 'muscular dystrophy' for as long as you can remember. He's always been frail and weak, so small and sickly. He's wheelchair bound and can't do much of anything. At the rate it's progressing he's going to be this way for the rest of his life, and may not even live to see adulthood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...until one fateful day on a visit to the doctor's he tells you about something. It may not even work, but if you want to see your younger brother live long enough to grow up, you might just have to go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack Thompson. 11 years old, short blonde hair, brown eyes, 4'10\", barely 75 pounds on a good day. He's been so frail and weak because of his MD all his life, he cannot do much. He mostly sits in his wheelchair when he isn't sleeping or doing his homschooling. But that will change, in a BIG way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake Thompson. 19 years old, darker blonde hair, green eyes, 5'6\", about 150 pounds, average build. Zack's worried older brother, and who you play as within the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack is the only one who grows, that's the idea. Maybe at some point I might allow others to grow, but for now, it's Zack only.<br>\r\nMuscle and/or height growth only. I'm not looking for anything else in this please. However the two are not mutually exclusive, so Zack can grow buffer and not taller, or taller but not buffer, or he can grow in both ways at once. That said, due to the nature of both kinds of growing, strength-related stuff is fine, and can be a focus as well.<br>\r\n not all at once. He 'can' have growth spurts, especially depending on how he ends up growing.<br>\r\nNo limits. Like, not just on how big he can grow (again as long as it isn't done uber fast. Don't make him go from normal to miles tall in one shot), but on his personality as he grows. He can act however you want him to act.<br>\r\nQuality. Adding a few lines and calling it a chapter is not a chapter. If you can't at least come decently close to the length of other chapters, please don't add at all then.<br>\r\nSexual stuff. I get the nature of the story might lend itself to that, but try not to give that too much focus, as that's not the idea of the story.</td>",
