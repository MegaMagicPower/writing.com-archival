And to make matters worse.... you appear to be only half an inch tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what world are you in....?</span></div></div>",

It was Zeldas pajama pants dropping to the floor exposing her white panties to you as she changes into her day clothes. You watch in wonderment as Zelda removes her sleep shirt now in just a white bra/panties just as you can't think how it could get better she lowers her panties exposing her ass. Her butt is big and white eclipseing your vision to a full moon. Her butt also came included with a triforce tatto next to come was the bra not much from the back but you get what you get.

Princess Ruto was practicing her stealth skills in preparation for a game of hide and seek that would occur in two hours. During her tiptoe walk, her stomach rumbled, causing her to look around for any possible food. Seeing a river in the near distance, she slowly tiptoed to the stream of water in search for a fish to eat. Upon seeing a Hearty Bass, she immediately rushed toward the river...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you only heard a very subtle noise, noticeable but not that dangerous. Thus you continued to stare at the river until a Hearty Bass came swimming by. As soon as you saw that fish, the noise increased and got dangerously close. Turning around, all you saw was light blue and very small spots of dark blue and 5 appendages that looked like a mix between toes and flippers. (You have no idea what is going on. Imagine that you knew nothing about Ruto, Zoras, or LoZ.)  (Also note that ALL Zoras are naked, exception with King Zora.) (As a last note I\u2019ll add a new feature to the Zoras. Their bodies are slippery for the most part. When they are out of the water for more than three minutes however, their bodies get sticky. Not enough to impede their movement, but enough to be felt and even glue people like you to them. Their bodies also smell good while in the water. If they are out for more than 5 minutes, it causes them to smell slightly bad. Not noticeable by normal people, but those like you who are shrunk smell it mildly at 10 feet (Normal Size Measurements) away, slightly bad at 5 feet, bad at 2.5 feet, and horrible When directly on their feet or skin.)</span></div></div>",

As your end unfolds, all you can wonder is why the author took so long to update the storyline. However, the pressure soon raises off, and Mipha\u2019s foot is no longer on you. Unfortunately, Mipha noticed an odd feeling under her right foot and paused. She turns around, looking at you. She quickly determines you as a bug, and raises her foot. This time, she brings it down with full force, her heel slamming into your tiny form. This succeeds in causing quite a considerable amount of pain, and winding you, But you remain alive. You hope that Mipha will walk away, thinking she\u2019s squashed you. You have no such luck, as the princess check her foot for your remains. After failing to find you, she looks toward where you were, and sees you stuck to the ground. Her expression is now one of childish anger, and now she intends to finish the job. Taking about 10 steps back, she start running towards your location, and once 2 steps away, jumps into the air, both heels poised to land on top of you, with minimal chance of survival. They definitely land on you, cracking many bones in your body, but leaving you alive. Mipha, unaware that you are still alive, starts stomping both of her feet on your slowly breaking body. Finally jumping back, she notices you still struggling, though barely, on her heel. Grinning, she slowly lowers her heel to the ground, before smearing it in the dirt. From there, she applies more pressure every second. You feel your bones collapse as your body slowly gives way to the foot of the Zora princess. Finally, she presses down full force, and you suddenly burst into a bright red stain. Mipha, feeling a crunch, checks her feet, and this time, sees only a bright red stain. She giggles at this event, and then smears your blood all over her foot, before going off to one of the lakes to relax.</span></div></div>",

I have never seen, nor heard about you before...\" she said as she walked across the castle halls, still holding you on her gloved hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been spending the day playing on my Nintendo Wii...\" you said, trying to omit the fact that you were playing the game they were on right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you must be from Earth, then!\" she said, kind of surprising you on how she was self-aware that she was a video-game character. However, before you could ask, she got to the main square of the castle, where Toadsworth and two other Toads were standing, noticing the princess. \"Oh, good morning, all,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, your highness!\" the three Toads responded. However, Toadsworth noticed the odd way that Peach held her hand, and inched closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Princess, may I ask if you are holding something?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was going to show you three this...\" she responded. You weren't sure how Toadsworth would react to, neither you did about the Toads. Expectingly awaiting a response, the universe answered you, as Toadsworth replies.</span></div></div>",

You were about to tell them that you saw a painting of your room and that you could jump on it, but you were interrupted by the other Toad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Professor E. Gadd knows! He's on the castle laborotories right now,\" said one of the Toads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you spoke up, to get the others' attention. \"While I think E. Gadd can fidugre out why I got here, I don't think he may be able to get me back to normal size. Besides, there is a painting of my room past that hall. I can just go through it like in Super Mario 64 and I'll be home,\" you said. But Peach then shook her head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, little guy, but when Mario got the 120 Power Stars and defeated Bowser to rescue me then, the power of the stars sealed away the ability to go through paintings, so it won't be that easy,\" she said, causing you to sigh in dejection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, wasn't Starlow comming here again to discuss about a certain matter of converting the old Fawful Express tracks into routes for shipping products towards other kingdoms by train? We could ask her if she could try to help the shrunken gentleman,\" noted Toadsworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I believe she and another representative of the Star Sprites were comming here, though it will take some time until they arrive,\" replied Princess Peach. She lifted you up for you to face her. \"Well, would you want to spend the time with the Professor to see if he can help you in the meantime, or...\" she asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in one hand, being with Professor E. Gadd, while it might not help you grow to full size or get home, but at least it might reveal some points, such as how you got here in first place, though it might not be a safe experience. Hanging with the Princess and the others is safer and may even give you a chance to meet the Mario Bros., but it might be actually kind of boring. Well, what will it be?</span></div></div>",

The organic prison that is Princess Peach's stomach begins to gurgle and groan around you, putting a halt to your escape attempt. Suddenly, your surroundings wobble even more violently. You lose your balance and tumble into the digestive juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Peach is giggling and swaying her torso from side to side, sloshing you around inside her. She seems to enjoy having you at the mercy of her digestive process. With a merry sigh, the Princess gently rubs her stomach, then walks off toward her bedroom to sleep off her snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, are in searing pain due to the stomach acid you're floating in. However, you've used up all your strength beating at the stomach walls earlier. Drained of all hope and might, you fade into unconsciousness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what feels like an eternity, you slowly awaken looking at what appears to be a ceiling of a room. A bedroom, specifically. You peer around in place and notice that this area looks nothing like the innards of the Princess! You then look up and notice Peach's sleeping face, though from your viewpoint it's upside-down. Does this mean you've been freed somehow? Are you back to your normal self?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to run, but no movement occurs. Next you try moving your arms...but that doesn't do anything either! You can't even see your physical body...what gives?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach?\" you attempt to speak, but nothing comes out that the sleeping woman can hear! This is certainly weird...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes or so, Peach's eyes slowly open, and with a brief yawn she adjusts her position so that she's sitting up on her bed. For some reason, YOU feel the movement of her abdomen as she sits up. But why is this so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach, wearing only her pink bra and undies, gets out of the bed and walks over to face a mirror in the room. Your sight is level with the reflection of her slim, bare tummy. The Princess then pats her tummy, and strangely enough, you feel this, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tiny man was delicious!\" says Peach to herself. \"I wonder where his nutrients ended up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute. Unable to move? Unable to speak? Feeling the impact of Peach patting her stomach? This must mean...you've been digested completely and absorbed into her abdominal muscles! You can't see your physical body, because you no longer HAVE a physical body! Your consciousness is permanently trapped within the torso of Princess Peach. No matter how badly you wish you were a normal-sized human again, you will feel the force of this gal rubbing her belly and digesting what she eats for the rest of her life. You're one with her now, and there's nothing you can do about it.</span></div></div>",

The walls are pulsating, and a nearby lake bubbles with acid -- a liquid you should NOT swim in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the last of the applesauce cup, Daisy pats her belly with satisfaction, unwarily shaking up your current residence and almost causing you to lose balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" you yell. \"Careful, I could've fallen into the juices!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops!

Apparantly Toadette interpreted the strange feeling as having to use the can. She ran towards her bathroom, keeping her rear clenched tight to keep whatever it was inside. You were in hell as this all went on. The crushing pain as the walls pressed tighter made you squeal in pain. Thankfully nothing was broken, but that was hardly a consolation when the pressure and the smell kept up. Finally the shaking stopped and the walls around you relaxed. You weren\u2019t sure what happened but you were thankful... until you felt the walls shift and push in a different manner. Slowly everything was fircing you down... outside! Oh no! You realized what she was doing. And while you were happy that you were being removed, you feared that she wouldn\u2019t notice you after releasing you... or worse if there actually was anything else in there. It seemed pretty clear when you were in there but the fear still lingered as you were slowly expelled. Finally falling out and landing in cold water with a loud splash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could finally move your limbs again. Although the sight of her bare ass overhead filled you with dread, the most that came out besides you were a couple farts signaling to Toadette that whatever was going on is taken care of now. You did your best to stay afloat, coughing a few times at the odor that you were trapped with. You saw he try to wipe her already clean ass before standing back up. Now a new fear came over you. If she doesn\u2019t see you now, you were going down the pipes. And you certainly didn\u2019t like your chances down there. You try yelling up to her but can\u2019t tell if she noticed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the titanic mushroom girl's expression seemed to calm, your fears and tensions also seemed to lessen quite a bit. Of course, even though she wasn't actively shooting you death glares anymore, you were still quite nervous about just what this fungi giantess has in store for you. As she contemplated what to do with you, your eyes slowly shifted back down, trying to take in what this girl looked like. She honestly looked pretty shortstacked. Were you not so tiny right now, you'd probably be the one towering over her. An amusing thought, but not one you dared to dwell on right now. Looking further down, you saw her massive brown shoes which presumably contained equally large feet within. Being so close to them caused you to pick up on the faintest odor that was seeping out. It was a humid cheesy scent that you'd probably expect from foot or shoe odor. The fact that you were smelling it already both scared and somehow aroused you at just how potent it must be inside the heavy brown containment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back up to Toadette's face just in time to see a smug grin crawling across her face. She spotted you staring at her shoes and knew exactly what to do. Without saying a word, she held down the heel of her left boot with her right foot and with a few grunts, pulled her bare sole out from its tight confines with a loud damp noise. The mushroom creature's bare foot landed next to you with a squishy thud whose tremors knocked you onto your rear. The foot was pretty damp. You could imagine it would get sweaty inside such footwear on a day like this, but even then, this girl really seemed to work up a real sweat. There was already a puddle forming underneath it as the toes wiggled and enjoyed their freedom. Before long you hears an identical set of noises and the other sole pressed down next to its companion. The feet themselves were wide and meaty. The toes wiggled causing some of the soft looking flesh to jiggle slightly. It was almost mesmerizing. Then the smell hit you. You were right about earlier, this girl's dogs had a REALLY potent musk to them that being confined to those boots only amplified to you. It was overpowering, almost intoxicating. Being in it seemed to drain your energy. Toadette only smiled at how the mere proximity of her feet was enough to overpower you. This next bit would be even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react, the sole suddenly stepped forward pinning you underneath tons of, soft, sweaty, musky foot flesh. You struggled beneath it trying to free your body, but Toadette's sole would not budge. She wasn't even trying to pin you. She was just that powerful compared to you. As your squirms tickled her, the mushroom decided to have a little more fun, rolling your helpless form across the ground, back and forth, back and forth. The sweat and grime that covered the bottom of her foot was now all over your entire body and the smell was beginning to cling as well. Suddenly the foot lifted up causing light to flood in. As your eyes readjusted to the light, Toadette grinned and smashed her foot back down on you, amused with her new toy. When she lifted it up once more, she was surprised to see that you were gone. Looking around to see where you could have possibly run off to, she soon felt a strange tickle. Looking back Toadetts saw that you were now sticking to the bottom of her sole. Though you couldn't see since your face was pressed against the flesh, Toadette was barely able to hold back her laughter. You looked so hilarious, so pathetic, so... perfect. The normally short girl was having one hell of a power trip from being a giant to someone but as her attention shifted back to you, she pondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Their actions seemed like some sort of predator having fun toying with their prey. You backed up a bit only to bump into the mushroom girls discarded boot. That sense of helplessness once again set in as she grinned down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot started to inch forward, positioning itself so that the big and second toes would be comming right for you. You had nowhere to run and could only watch as the massive, sweaty, and pudgy digits closed on on you. With one powerful squeeze you were once again at their mercy. You felt the air being forced out of your lungs as the foot waved back and forth. You felt lightheaded once again but could not pass out.

Realizing this was going nowhere, Goombella decided to pick you you and move you someplace where someone won't end up stepping on you.

Yoo-hoo where are you little fella?\" As she gets up and started searching for you everywhere except underneath her assets which you unfortunately were stuck \"Hmmm I wonder did he by chance sneak away in the middle of the night? How very rude of him to leave without saying goodbye maybe I should go look for him....\" Just then who should appear but the Mario Bros themselves \"Starlow Princess Peach wants to see you right away,she says it's important!\" Mario said \"Okay Mario tell her I'll be right there after I find what I'm looking for.\" Both brothers are curious \"So what are you looking for Starlow?\" She begins sweating(strange as if a star could sweat)not really wanting anyone except her yo know of your existence \"Ummm something important....it's my....my....my shoes yeah I lost my favorite pair of shoes some time ago and I'm going to try and find them.\" Even underneath her butt you knew this was a pretty lame excuse as did Luigi as he muttered \"Momma Mia I didn't even know stars cared about wearing shoes do you need help finding them?\" Starlow shook her head \"No thanks guys I can remember the last time I saw them thanks anyway I'll be at the castle shortly.\" As they departed Starlow continued her search for you does she end up discovering where you are?</span></div></div>",

This was not how you expected your day to go. After a time you felt pressure being released as she took her heel off, though amusingly you stuck to the foot. You felt a lurching motion as she must've swung her foot to look at when she saw you weren't in the heel. You definitely heard some giggling too. \"Do you like my foot that much, boy? I hope so because you'll be spending more and more time with it!\" She peeled you off, dumping her into her palm and staring hungrily at you. The sight was...intimidating.

She walked towards the door, locked it and put a towel at the bottom so you couldn't climb out under. She close the windows and locked it. She even close the bathroom door so you can't even go the disgusting route out. \"Ok, now that I've made sure there is no possible way for you too escape this room.

You run towards the counting Harriet and arrive just under her dress. You get a running start and jump up, lucky for you it wasn't that far of the ground so you actually manage to grab it.

Everything around you was absolutely gigantic. But as you, as a character, slowly started to take in these drastic changes, you noticed something else seemed off about your surroundings. Though you were clearly inside some sort of structure, it still seemed rather unsettling in some way. The room was empty. The floor seemed rocky. If not for some lighting and a few structures like a desk and some doors, you\u2019d swear you were in a cave rather than a building. \u201cWhere the hell am I?\u201d You spotted a window, but you couldn\u2019t possibly reach that. Not without wasting the day climbing up the desk. Still you had nothing else to do, and weren\u2019t too fond of waiting around for whoever lives here so you made your way to the desk. You spotted a tiny splinter which you might be able to begin your ascent from. Still it was a bit high up so you\u2019d need to jump. And when you did jump you were in for a bigger surprise. Your body seemed to float past the intended target as if it were weightless. You would have been more concerned if you weren\u2019t so focused on getting up to see just where you were. The first jump pushed you maybe a quarter of the way up the desk leaving you to kick off it and the chair to try to propel yourself even higher. As you finally reached the top you were greeted by a shocking sight. Right there, dead center of the window, was Earth. You were shrink to roughly 3 inches tall and somehow in space, in some sort of... moon building thing. You could only stare blankly, uttering a flat \u201cWhat?\u201d Before the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith very heavy thuds, a massive rabbit like woman entered. You were completely speechless at her visage. This woman was utterly gigantic, even if you weren\u2019t shrunken. She was massive, fat, and incredibly tall. The sight of her approaching her desk made you feel even more insignificant then you were already. Though she might be your best chance of survival, you were so utterly terrified of her that your insitictive response was to hide under some papers.</span></div></div>",

Your rush to get into place managed to kick a few things up and knock a few papers off her desk. The gigantic rabbit woman certainly took notice of that as well as something shaking behind her remaining papers. Not wasting a second, a massive, fluffy, and pudgy hand plucked you up from behind your less than effective hiding spot and held you up to the massive face of the enormous lagomorph. Your entire body was literally vibrating in terror as the menacing looking giantess eyed you closely a somewhat sinister looking smile seeming to naturally show up on her face. Suddenly her smile seemed to warm up a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww. Now aren't you just the most adorable little thing?\" she cooed talking to you as if you were a puppy. \"How'd a little cutie like you end up in mama's office?\" the baby talk continued. Honestly, this scared you a little more than the menacing smile. Madame Broode found your apparent shyness to be even more adorable as you suddenly found yourself being pressed against her cheek to be hugged and nuzzled. You squirmed helplessly against the... admittedly soft and comfortable cheek of the giant rabbit woman. Almost as suddenly as you were pressed into her, she pulled you back and quickly planted a massive kiss on your face, managing to envelop your entire head in her puckered lips. \"Well don't you worry. Mama will take very good care of you from now on. In fact, why dont you help mama relate while she finishes some work so that she can get right to taking care of her precious little boy.\" she said in her baby talk as she gently moved you towards her...</span></div></div>",

Under normal circumstances it wouldn't have been a big deal, but her clothes left her midriff exposed... Oh, what would people say if they saw her like this? She couldn't stand to be the center of attention under normal circumstances; something like this was sure to draw people's eyes and questions!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWringing her hands, Olivia shook in place as she wondered what to do.

The sound of her voice did manage to calm your shaking nerves slightly. If she did have any negativity towards your sudden arrival she surely would've acted out by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi.\" you meekly reply while giving a small hand wave to follow.

Do you happen to be some sort of ape?\" the question alone did manage to spark a sudden realization in your brain. Everyone here must've been apart of some sort off anthropomorphic animal class.

As you listened, you found her voice...was suprisedly lighter than what you expect it to be. It even had a slight melodious quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Ms Aran...I only just appeared. Honest.\" You begged with fear soaked through your voice. Hoping to God that her being a hero will make her merciful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second or two, the bounty hunter quickly examined him. Instantly her shoulders relaxed, and the pistol was put on top of the drawer. The kid wasn't dangerous in slightest. He didn't have the same look that space pirates or the various other fiends she had faced in the past have. He probably just some scientist's kid who messed with something he shouldn't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, kid, until I reached a Federation base. You are effectively in my custody. So I expect no fucking all round.\" Samus calmly explained as she turn her back the boy. There she removed her zero suit and undid her ponytail, and put a rather meager looking white t-shirt and blue shorts. Once finished, her head snapped back to you.\"Is that clear <b>boy</b>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou who was back from reality from both having a near death experience and  watching Samus undress, only stupidly nodded at the woman.

Fitting of her stature, her feet were large...<i>very</i> large. The narrower heels were slightly flattened, had noticeable callouses. It has to be due to all the hectic activity Samus finds herself often doing. Her wide soles give her feet a more \"paddle\" shape, it's skin was thick and very firm looking. With a fleshy calloused pad them, her strong looking toes were long, in fact, the second toes were actually a little bit longer than her big toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the occasional scrunch, she revealed her unpainted nails. Which were slightly longer than normal. Surprisingly on her right fourth toe and left second toe. She had thin little rings on them, the former being gold and the latter was silver. A surprising touch of femininity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your diminutive hands pressed against the firm surface. An almost almighty aroma made your nostrils burn and eyes water quite a bit. It was a volatile odor that consists of a rich cheesiness, a very spicy vinegar, with a strange earthy sweetness. With some small coughing, your hands pressed up her feet. Blood slowly start to flow to your ground with every stroke you make. Tentatively prodding at any soft spots you can find. Your dick getting harder as your little fingers carefully pull and spread on her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the feet of a some girl nor common woman. These belong to warrior...a <b>hunter</b>. They had been though countless hardships and trials<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe right corners of Samus' lip curled upwards as she made a silent sigh. And her toes eagerly spread with every single touch he made. Damn, the kid's doing an <i>much</i> better job than what she expected from him.

Your attempts to get her attention seemed to have the opposite effect as the gigantic girl turned away without even glancing in your direction, her stern face puffed out a sigh as she stepped backwards. Suddenly realizing what was happening you skidded to a stop right as the tight blue suit hurdled towards your tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head slammed backwards into the bed before the enormous weight of the bounty hunter pressed down on you. Your body groaned with the bed springs as you were burried under her cheek, unable to yell or struggle as you were slowly compressed under the zero suit.

As such, your punishment for this will be cleaning my shoes and feet when I go outside and play!\"<br>\r\nKirby didn't like the sound of that one bit. He was already full with Tiff's foot sweat, toejam and dirt from her feet, not to say all of the months old foot sweat in her shoes. For nearly a full hour now, the only smell he smelled, was the dense, musky, extremely cheesy smell of Tiff's feet. Since he was so tiny, every smell was multiplied by 10-20 times more. Imagine then, how Tiff's already extremely sweaty feet must have smelled to Kirby! The only things he tasted for the last hour or so were the products of her feet. Sweat, toe jam... And he was supposed to now eat more, in Tiff's hot, smelly, sweaty shoes? Screw that! Kirby flew as fast as he could, to get out of her shoe. However, that didn't matter much. Kirby was only one inch tall! His speed was hopelessly outmatched by anyone. The distance that to Kirby was miles upon miles, would take a few seconds for Tiff to slid her foot in. She watched, as Kirby hopelessly tried to fly out of her shoe. That look gave her immense satisfaction. Then she said \"remember to do a good job there, bug\" and slid her foot in.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't no hero anymore, just some bug, and a slave to his former friend. He was using his ability to suck up her sweat and other products of her feet very quickly, which she liked. But sometimes, she wanted to just look at the satisfying look of him timidly kneeling and licking the inbetweens of her toes, enjoying the feeling of him doing so, so she sometimes ordered to do just that. It was one of those times.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kirby.\" She suddenly said. \"Do you know what day it is? It's the one year anniversary of you becoming my foot slave!\" She said enthusiastically. Kirby was less than enthusiastic about this information though. A whole year?! Without a clock to check time on, Kirby has lost the count of time long ago. Every single day of his was the same anyway, just spent at Tiff's feet or shoes, obeying her every command. It was a very monotonous life, filled with the abhorrent stench and taste of her feet.<br>\r\n\"As such.\" Tiff continued. \"I decided to reward you for all your efforts!\"<br>\r\nReward?!

Maybe it's because you stayed up way past proper sleeping time playing video games. Maybe it's because you stayed up for so long, that your body had to force itself to shutdown just for you to finally switch to sleep mode! Regardless of the reason, the sleep was uncomfortable and you had a nightmare about evil killer robots that wanted to take over the world and experiment on your vulnerable organic shell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough to be fair, you kinda recall hearing a really nice jazzy tune for the robotic overlords' anthem. Seriously, it was a very uplifting, tune sung by a very lovely voice that could really lift one's spirits despite even the worst kind of inhumane experimentation. ...Hm\u2026 how did it go again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOBLE HALTMANN, WE ADORE HIM. NOBLE HALTMANN, WE ADORE HIM!\u201d YEAH, that's it! \u201cEVERYDAY\u2026 WE WISH\u2026. HIM GLORY!\u201d Yep, truly a catchy melody. Yep, this Haltmann fellow sure has some fine taste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWAIT. ARE YOU STILL HEARING THE SONG?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMigraine ignored, you wake up with a sudden jolt of shock and astonishment. You felt wide awake and up with the chickens, yet you still heard the alluring melody from your dream!<br>\r\nNot only that, you werent in your bedroom anymore. You find yourself trapped like a rat inside a huge stuffy glass container. You barely had enough air to breathe fine thanks to the tiny air holes from the lid up above!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if being trapped inside a jar wasnt terrifying enough, the source of the melody came from the voice of the colossal red-haired figure not far from where you were. As she sings, you observe her more carefully. White astro helmet, white blazer top over a black dress, and um\u2026 hovering yellow gloves that seemed to act in sync with her body despite having no arms attached!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-S-S-SUSIE?!!\u201d you blurted out louder than you had planned what with being so dumbstruck that you were staring at an enormous antagonist from one of your Kirby games! You covered your mouth, realizing way too late you screamed with shock a little too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE IMPLORE YOU, DEAR HALTMANN! WE IMPLORE YOU, DEAR HALTMANN!\" thankfully, she was too immersed in her song to notice your outburst. The gigantic alien/android(?) twirled about with her huge shiny blue eyes of her faceless face staring up to the heavens as she sang with all her heart and soul, \"BLESS... OUR WORK... AND BE AT EASE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe certainly did have a wonderful singing voice, even if it's strictly meant for propaganda purpose. It surprising you werent wondering where the rest of the orchesta is coming from. What you SHOULD be wondering is how you ended up here the size of a bug and trapped in a giant mason jar. She must already be aware of your presence, since SOMEBODY put you in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell you certainly had no interest in staying and seeing what fate the colossal robotic secretary has in store for you! You needed out and fast. You check your pockets in hope that you brought along SOMETHING to break the glass. Sadly you didnt have anything on you. Your only hope at the moment would be to kick the glass until it cracks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you delivered heavy kicks to the glass, hoping for at least a teensy crack to work with! A couple of tries, no luck. You kick some more. And kick some more!<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon! C'mon!\u201d you mutter to yourself, kicking and kicking over and over. Not even the teensiest sign of a crack. But you dont give up. Instead, you increase the tempo and strength, kicking as hard as you can! You kick and you kick until finally...</span></div></div>",

Then it hits you...you've been transformed into a helpless piece of candy! Some disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" you panic telepathically. \"Let's talk this over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be protected in my stomach,\" responds the goddess. \"My powers of light will shield you from being digested for about...ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't do this! Don't eat me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's too late. Palutena parts her lips and places your candy body in the dark cavern of her mouth. Closing her lips, she uses her tongue to roll you around, apparently tasting you. But this doesn't last long - your captor's tongue flicks you into her throat, and like that, you're swallowed. One would be able to view a small lump - your sugary form - sliding down her throat until it disappears past her chest area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only takes you seconds to land in the slimy, warm, soft depths of Palutena's tummy. You are coated in saliva and paralyzed with horror. You don't plan on spending the rest of your life within the goddess of light...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a quick instant, the gloomy organically belly of Hell itself changed into complete and utter darkness. Another quick instant, the complete and utter darkness faded and you found yourself back in your regular human form... but sitting in a rather small prison cell. The cell was well cleaned, nice beautiful white marble walls and flooring, plant life and little marble statues of the goddess set atop greek-style pillars, and a well organized bookshelf full of loads of books (none of them written in english, unfortunately), and a few decorative Mycenaen-style paintings, and a well lavished king sized bed, so it was a rather luxurious prison cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittingly, it was an infinitely better setting than Palutena's stomach (especially now that you were no longer a yummy piece of candy), but you still felt incredibly confined. There was no window to the outside (uh, if there was an outside to begin with) and the only way out was blocked by an out of place steel safety door with the door handle and lock on the opposite side. There was a small little window to see through but all you could make out that awaited beyond your cell was an empty hall of white walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where in the hell am I?\" you wonder to yourself out loud. And in no time at all, the answer quickly came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock knock!* \"Hello? Tiny friend of Lady Palutena? Are you awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly get up off your oh so comfy bed and rushed to the steel door and looked through the window. Behind your door stood what looked to be a chibi cartoony-style version of Palutena wearing coke-bottle glasses with swirls in them smiling back at you. Part of you thought you were having some sort of bizarre near-death hallucination from the lack of oxygen inside Palutena's tummy, but you were most definitely conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, tiny friend of Lady Palutena!\" smiled the cartoony Palutena, \"did you manage to get plenty of rest?\"<br>\r\nYou were in no mood to talk about your day or how your sleep was. You just wanted to cut right to the chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" you asked, \"I thought I was in your... uh... Palutena's stomach just a minute ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically you still are,\" she corrected, \"this happens to be the storage area of Lady Palutena's stomach reserved for prisone-I mean special guests that her Lordship doesnt wish to be digested and absorbed as proper nutrition. For safe-keeping, if you will.\" Normally, you'd find this outrageously odd, but you remember the level where you end up in HADES' stomach, so you have to admit it makes sense. Besides, it's actually no stranger than most of the stories based on actual Greek mythology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" was all you could come up with responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm one of Lady Palutena's loyal white blood cells, #338291!\" she introduced herself, \"I'm in charge of this storage facility withing her Lordship's stomach. I and my fellow white cell subordinates will make sure youre well protected and well looked after inside the belly of our Goddess.\"<br>\r\n\"It's um... quite a nice place you got here,\" you admit, \"it's very... cozy. But a little confined.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh dont worry, I'm sure you'll get used to it,\" #338291 said with a smile, \"this is the Top Level Max Security Unit of Solitary Confineme... I mean Luxury Suite reserved only for Lady Palutena's most important guests.\" Youre gonna pretend that didnt just creep you out a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, listen, I really like this place, seriously I do,\" you tell her, \"but I'm not really interested in staying. I would appreciate it if I was let out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry we cant do that,\" the cartoony white blood cell said with a frown, \"Lady Palutena said it's far too dangerous outside. What with Viridi declaring war on humanity, you wont last very long outside of her Lordship's body.\" Ok ok. You understand. She makes a good point. However, youre not gonna enjoy being couped in here for too long despite how fancy it looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I see your point,\" you give her her propers, \"but after that whole Viridi thing is settled, I'm free to go, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Absolutely not!\" #338291 shakes her head, \"after Viridi is dealt with, my lady predicts that it'll be even more dangerous on the outside! She predicts that the end result of the war will attract a new war with the accursed Aurum followed by a hunt for the illusive Chaos Kin which escaped Viridi's Reset Bomb depot. And then there's a matter of dealing with Hades himself.\" Ah right. Just like in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course of course,\" you nodded, \"then after that, I can go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the blood cell shakes her head, \"No, not at all. Then comes the earthly wars.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" you squinted your eyes, \"earthly wars?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she states, \"the wars fought against those from the vast unexplored regions of the world. The parts of the world who worship heretical gods and unfamiliar deities.\" What?! This wasnt part of the game! \"The first of many, her Lordship predicts, will be against the Empire of the Farsidians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Farsidians?! What the hell are...\" before you could even finish asking the question, the wheels in your head began to turn. You thought outside the box. Considering your knowledge of Greek history, you had a good guess. \"...are you talking about the Persians?!\"<br>\r\n\"No. The FARSIDIANS,\" she corrected you, \"the prediction says it may take at least half a century (like the actual Greek-Persian wars), so please bare with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HALF A CENTURY?!\" you shouted with disbelief, \"youre telling me I have to sit in here for half a century?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's possibly much longer than that,\" she continues. \"let's see...\" she puts a finger to her chin and looks upward, \"...the predication says the next earthly war will be against the great Moran Empire.\"<br>\r\n\"...The Roman Empire?\" you groaned.<br>\r\n\"No, the MORAN Empire,\" she corrected, \"hm... that'll be followed by a civil split, possible influence to a faith taught by a carpenter (yeah, THAT one), I think it'll be safe enough to leave by then.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, but-\"<br>\r\n\"No, wait! I was wrong!\" she wasnt done yet, \"if I remember correctly, what comes next is Round 2 with the descendants of the Fasidians... Oh oh oh!! Then that's when the REALLY bad earthly wars start!!\"<br>\r\nYour heart sank, having a good idea what she's talking about \"Please dont tell me youre talking about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agrabahian conquest under the Omayuud Paliphate!\"<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth with sheer irritation. \"The Arabian conquest under the Umayyad Caliphate?\"<br>\r\n\"Please stop interrupting me,\" she politely scolds you, \"there's a few Agrabahian wars there alone! Omayuud... Bassabid (Abassid), Taminid (Fatimid), then the Yuyyubid sultanate (Ayyubid sultanate) those might take a while to deal with. Very vicious warriors, I heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your head as you rubbed that aching migraining side, \"...Then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think...\" she scratches her chin, \"..ah! Our final stand with the Awesomans! I think everything will finally be peaceful and quiet by then.\" No it wont. It most certainly wont. Not for the Palutenians. Not that it matters for you anyway. \"So let's see... by my estimates, it should take no later than 2000 years for your immediate release!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not funny anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I'm going to be dead long before then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I certainly hope you'll enjoy your stay for the remainder of your lifetime!\" she said with a sweet smile, \"now if you'll excuse me, I will summon your morning breakfast over! Please let us know immediately if you'd like anything else!\"<br>\r\n\"I'D LIKE TO LEAVE!\" you shouted<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, we dont serve any of that,\" she gave no fs as she trotted off with a spring in her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once again you were alone. No companionship. Just a cozy bed and a ton of books you cant read to pass the time. This clearly cant be your fate! All you wanted to do was play a game and THIS is what you get?! Somebody needs to sue the crap out of Nintendo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed hard and lied down in your incredibly comfy bed, wondering what you should do...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...Slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word slips from between her lips like a serpent. When juxtaposed against the soft features of her face, it feels incredibly odd. Despite its massive size, Palutena's body bears all the beauty and dignity of a Renaissance sculpture - but exploding with life and energy. Her dress flutters and ornaments tingle together with each great step across the stone. Her ample bosom, wrapped in fine fabrics, wobbles gently, showing their weight. Faint, sweet fragrances float into your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, despite the refined surroundings and the sophisticated air, Palutena doesn't show any sign of haughtiness or malice. The complete opposite, actually - the wide-stretching smile and round eyes carry a casual nature, as if she were speaking to a friend. As she approaches, the full details of her body becoming clearer, it seems like the goddess of light is a little confused by your reaction. Like declaring you her servant was a completely natural thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little shrug, she finally comes up to the side of your cushion, looking down. Her crotch area is level with your platform, a glimpse of her leg peeking out below. After a moment of scrutinizing your body, she lets out a little laugh. A massive arm reaches down, pointing a slender finger towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Kneel before me, mortal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unable to do anything but stand dazed, taking a quick step back. It's still very hard to register all of Palutena at once. From the white cloths stretching around her mountainous torso, up to the round curve of her pinkish, bare shoulders, and the acres of fluttering green hair, the deity overwhelms you. Each subtle movement is completely apparent. Blinking, she kneels down slightly, waving the huge finger at you. It's nearly your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The goddess of light commanded you to kneel, and she doesn't perceive much kneeling down there. Has the All-seeing Eye of Palutena gone blind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer index finger and thumb wrap around your chin. You're surprised at the care she's putting into this movement - it feels soft to the touch. They slowly move downwards, stroking your body gently. The tips go over the curves in your torso, squeezing it gently as if to feel it up. You can't help but blush a little at the movement - causing her to laugh. As the slender pillars of flesh and muscle wrap around you, they feel warm as clothes from the drier. Now, she gently brushes her pinky finger over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or perhaps her slave isn't in a worshiping mood? Don't worry, Palutena is always willing to help humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the finger presses down with immense, crippling force on your head. Almost instantaneously, your collapse under its pressure, brought to your knees and hands. It feels like your spinal cord is ready to break. You try to look up to read the goddess' expression, but the strong finger presses down on your neck each time, tilting it to the sheets. You whimper gently under the sharp pain. Your arms start to get sore from the weight she's applying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one quick movement, the finger slides off the bed - essentially flicking you to the ground. You look up at the enormous woman. She leans over your body with a hand to her hip, lifting an eyebrow. All the decorations on her robes clash together, making gentle chiming sounds. Her legs are wrapped with the straps of a her footwear - she wears a white sock under one, while the other is bare underneath. Palutena moves the latter foot towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour senses returning, you dart away. With a quick glance back, her expression has changed from joy to exasperation and disappointment. The footsteps echo close behind - her leg movements don't look particularly strong, but each step nearly sends you flying up from the ground. After a quick scan around the elegant room, you spot a hiding place - under the bed. And soon, it seems like you might actually make it underneath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flick of the wrist. A gentle hum behind you. You duck. Palutena's scepter comes flying from the door, swiftly swiping away the bed's legs. The entire structure groans for a moment, before falling down. From your perspective, it lands inches away; the tremendous amounts of shaking and noise toss you on your back. You make an attempt to get to your feet- but, with a snap from Palutena's fingers, you find yourself floating inches above the ground. Your legs are unable to do anything but move desperately as the woman approaches, a hand on her cheek. Her gaze looks fairly aloof, eyebrows in a flat line, frowning in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, your display didn't impress the goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Millions of mortals for me to torment - er, bless with my presence - and fortune chooses you. Why would fortune choose someone so unskilled with worship? Maybe I've plucked up a little non-believer? Someone with no idea what I can do? I should just snuff you out. There are plenty of humans down there. Nobody will miss one or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight twist of the ankle, her leg lifts into the air. The brown sole of her shoe is completely clean and smooth. Palutena's spell fades, and you drop to the ground - her heel following close after, pinning your body to the ground. The blunt force drains the wind from your body, leaving you gasping and squirming. You struggle against it, but she just presses harder, squeezing your spirit out. If she keeps up, your chest will collapse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hums a little, grinding her heel down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *do* enjoy teaching haughty humans their place, and seeing their pride turn to humility and shame. Thus, the Goddess Palutena blesses you with a second chance. Kiss my foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the brown wall lifts off you, you let your breath return to you. Knowing the price for delay, you immediately leap to your legs. The shoe floats just above your head. With only a second of hesitation, you leap upwards, wrapping your arms around the shoe, and kiss it profusely. The taste isn't particularly agreeable, but fear of your mistress' wrath floats over you - so you continue kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her foot shakes a little, wobbling out of your reach. You fall a slight distance from it. Palutena now looks absolutely furious - you didn't do a good job, it seems. Knowing that you can't escape, you simply stare upwards and beg as the goddess slams her giant foot down next to you. The force is even greater than the bed's collapse. Her glare floats over your pathetic body, followed by her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly smile creeps across her face. Slowly, her narrow eyes widen again, only to close in happiness as a chuckle erupts from her mouth. It eventually transitions to full-out laughter. The goddess of light suddenly collapses to the bed, giggling madly. Leaning over the side of the bed, her grinning face looms over you, speaking with a noticeably louder tone:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahah, you actually fell for it! 'Kiss my foot' - seriously, who says that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your gaze, she coughs a little, waving a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry - but I can't help it! I didn't think I could pull off an evil goddess routine, but look at you - squirming like a little Nettler! Well, I shouldn't be so surprised - blood relative of Medusa and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, putting you in a close encounter with death is this woman's idea of comedy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwirling her hand around casually, you find yourself magically lifted off the ground, and carefully deposited on the white pillow. Palutena, lying on her back, looks at you, her massive, beautiful face upside-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, did I go a bit overboard there? You look pretty shaken. I didn't mean to hurt you, little one! Let me make it up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches her hand to the side of the pillow, like a platform. Taking careful steps, you move over to it, feet sinking into the small wrinkles in her flesh. Gently, she wraps her hands around you in a warm caress. Her hands bring you over her face, before letting go. You find yourself floating to her massive lips - fear takes you again for a moment, before a sense of relaxation comes over your body. Her soft, pink lips wrap around you, giving an ever-so-gentle kiss that covers your whole face with moistness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand snatches you from the air, moving you against her massive breasts. You find yourself inside the soft confines of her cleavage, spreading like mountains on either side of you. Her hand comes down to pat you, stroking your body, fingers running down your back and body. Despite the constant movement, it's almost relaxing - like a massage. The warmth from her bust and the rhythmic sound of her breathing help to calm your nerves. Slowly, you find your shaking calmed, as you rest in her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this helps. Poor thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth hands squeeze softly against you in a massive cuddle. The Goddess of Light engulfs you in a hug. The sound of her gentle sighs and faint, sweet odor wash over you, surrounding you with... Palutena-ness. It's wonderful. As her warm arms move away, you reach out, trying to get them back. In return, you hug her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything better now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, to see her face looming above, a quiet, concerned pout on her lips. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Ready for your next task, slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare blankly at her for a moment. Didn't she just apologize for her behavior? You couldn't understand this. Seeing your expression, the comparatively huge woman puts a hand on her mouth, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did I forget to say? You're still my slave. I don't exactly want to do this, but - you see, goddesses can't really live without some worship. And when I look at Earth, I don't exactly see many people making sacrifices to Palutena. So, you'll be my food source.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering her smile, you can't tell how true that is. It seems like she's enjoying you quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But to make it nicer, you can choose how to worship me! What would you like?\"</span></div></div>",

Very well, honestly I was a little worried you'd choose something indecent, but it's good to see you're a human who understands their place, you'll be an excellent source of worship for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She closes her fingers around you, blotting out the light and pressing your face up against her fragrant skin, your fear about what is going to happen to you is mitigated by the calming smell that seems to naturally spill off of her.  You soon feel yourself moving again, and a sudden change of pressure as the hand seems to descend to the ground, and sure enough her fingers release you, causing you to suddenly tumble onto the hard floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly look up, the sky has been replaced with the bottom of a table, Palutena leaning under it as her hand lifts away from you.  She smiles warmly as her hand makes some motions, and with a few sparkles the straps on her right heel snap away, and she pulls her foot free, stretching her toes out as she enjoys the cool palace air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright slave, there's a pillow next to you, bring that over here so I don't need to rest my foot on the cold floor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to look behind you and sure enough there is a giant (to you) white pillow with gold trip on the ground.  Realizing you won't have a chance to escape yet, you hurry behind it and begin pushing with all your might, managing to move it under the divine ped.  Without fanfare it plummets onto the pillow heel first, proudly displaying the massive sole to you, the toes scrunch all at once and then relax, and Palutena sits up, her face and bust disappearing behind the table that has become your sky, her dress billowing about her her legs like a graceful cloud as she adjusts herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job with the pillow slave, as a goddess I'm too busy to spend all day watching a little mortal like you, but don't worry, I'll make sure you always stay close by.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another sparkling gleam of light, you suddenly feel something around your neck, and instinctively grab at it, discovering something hard and cold.  You do your best to look down and find a gold collar that extends on a golden chain, which itself is connected to an anklet that has appeared on your master's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way no matter where I go you'll always be with me, I'm *sure* you're also glad that there's no chance you'll get away...er...get separated from my feet.  Now get a move on with the worship, don't be shy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that any attempt at escape is now impossible, and feeling more than a bit annoyed about how you're now expected to kiss the feet of your kidnapper, you nonetheless know what you have to do.  Walking over to her gigantic pale sole, you're struck by just how clean it is, not a single speck of dust, well, she is a goddess.  The same comforting smell is here too, but it is joined with a distinct musk, having been in those heels probably didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be berated by the goddess, you delay no longer and begin kissing her sole, peppering it with quick pecks.  You're pleasantly surprised again at just how soft and warm her skin is, and without thinking begin to lick.  She scrunches her toes, wrinkles appearing in the perfect skin as you industriously move your tongue against it, and you climb up onto the pillow in order to be better able to reach the ball of her foot, hopping up against her instep.  Her foot gently sways from side to side, pivoting on her heel as you work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure to get between my toes, you can't be doing a lousy job your first day right?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans her foot down a bit further, and you scramble up the back of it, facing her flawless toenails that sparkle just a bit in the ambient light under the table.  You quickly lower your head between them and begin licking them with all your might, shrugging off the sudden increase of musky odor that hits you as you do.  They stretch out, affording you more room to lean into the crevices between them, occassionally relaxing and clamping your face gently between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter at least twenty minutes of crawling over her feet and licking every last inch of them, from her pillowy toes to her solid heel, you hear her speak up again...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good job slave, I think you deserve a rest in my shoe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel pressure removed from your neck. The collar dissipates into a flash of light, which scatters around the air. High above, Palutena leans back and yawns, brushing slender finger through her hair. It comes out as an ear-splitting roar. As she reclines, you can see her white dress fluttering above, against the table. Her feet, still moist from your saliva bath, tilt backwards - before, in one sudden motion, she slams them down onto the pillow. The impact sets you off your own own feet - you find yourself on your back, staring up at the divine woman's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalutena peeked down at you. Her soft bosom swayed gently with her robes, as her massive face leaned in to get a better look at her worshiper. One hand rested on her lap, the gold ornaments chiming against each other. Her eyebrows have turned upwards slightly, and there's a strange smirk across her face, gleaming with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne great hand reaches down, swooping you into the sky. She cups it, letting it act like a little bed. Your head rests on your fingers - if you look down, you can see her shoe's mouth open on the floor far below. Did she really intend to put you in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chuckle from Lady Palutena brings your attention back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, slave. It's my duty to protect humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand floats a little closer to her face, as the hand squeezes you gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I understand that humans are pathetic, fragile creatures that just fall apart into little teensy pieces if you push on them even slightly too hard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this, her thumb taps you on the head, a little bit more roughly than usual. She lifts another hand to her mouth to hide a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Just like retractable pencils! I want to make sure you have a nice, relaxing break, so you don't break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her hand slides into a steep slope over her shoe. You struggle to hold onto the flesh, but the flawless surface left no folds to grab on. You soon find yourself dropping, hurdling towards the ground. The details of the room whir past your face into an incomprehensible blur of white and gold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, suddenly, you stop. You float in midair for a moment, a light aura surrounding you. Palutena's using the power of flight to help complete your journey into her shoe. Far above, she grins to herself, as if your initial reaction from the drop amused her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you land on her insole. Your backside falls into a faint imprint of her heel. A little further in, the brownish material is worn down in the shape of her toes - from this, you can see the footwear has been fitted perfectly to the shape of Palutena's sole. Her heels mean that the whole surface is sloped downward. Hints of the musky odor from before float around. If you were to lie down, it would be able to comfortably hold your whole body, with some of the loose straps covering most of your torso. The straps that once went up her knees now lie haphazardly across the marble flooring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalutena seems to be folding her kneesock into an even, rectangular shape. Looking over you, she turns her head away, as if the goddess of light was slightly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't be permanent, of course - unless you want it to be. Rack up points with the goddess of light, and you'll be able to gain something a bit more glamorous. A nice bed, your own little room, or a chance to sleep on my body, perhaps? Something befitting of your status as Palutena's worshiper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen eyes twinkling, she puts one finger on her cheek, winking. Suddenly, that finger starts making complicated twists above your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, try to disobey me again, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd tingling arises from your chest. Suddenly, the ceiling seems just an inch higher. Your breaths become shallow - and even quiet sounds seem to echo in the back of your head. The shoe's insole below you seems softer, but the sides seem to stretch further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe traces of moisture soon become puddles, wetting your feet. The straps around extend like roadways. Walls and decorations in the room, including the table and bed, become nothing but a memory, outside your field of view. As you shrink smaller and smaller, the puddles become rivers, and raging oceans, dragging you in. The shoe becomes its own world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can still recognize the unbelievably strong voice above:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll make your entire existence a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face looms right above the shoe, bearing an innocent smile wide enough to swallow thousands of people in a nibble. It's soon replaced with a wall of flesh, as the ball of her foot hovers over the shoe, sliding in and trapping you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one blink, it all disappears. You're back to 4 inches tall, resting in her shoe. The room still spins around a few times before you can get your bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding the same expression as always, Palutena tosses her kneesock to you, folded in the shape of a bedsheet. With one last glance towards you, she steps away, calling over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I have some - er, some important affairs to handle. Goddess stuff, you know. Sleep well, slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman twirls her finger one last time, attaching a new shoe to her sole. She leaves for the room's door, far in the distance. You can hear her footsteps echoing until she exits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sock's fabrics, too, hold that welcoming smell. You can't tell what they're made of, but at this size, you can see the pattern on it quite clearly. Whoever made these knew what they were doing. After spending all that time with worship, you decide regaining some energy would be wise. The materials wrap around your body, and you slowly float into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange images swirl through your dreams. Some of life before Palutena - memories of friends and family. Others predictions of what might be to come. At some moments, the woman treats you gently, giving beautiful, sparkling gifts and otherworldly experiences; only to take them away the next second, berating you for messing up something you didn't understand. Her footsteps keep on echoing - she's chasing you. No matter which way you turn, she's in every direction; sometimes with a disappointed frown, other times with a carefree smile, or a concerned gaze. Soon, even your legs stop moving - you fly through the sky, unable to control yourself. The path of flight leads you to the goddess of light herself - swirling around her arms and legs, bouncing off her backside, then her chest, then her nose. You pause in front of her eyes, before floating away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she becomes more distant, the world around changes from a vague void to something breathing and living. A village bustling with life, peasants moving around this way or that. You could swear they look like some of your companions - in fact, the geography very closely resembles your hometown, with much more marble and less development. In the center, Palutena, taller than any building, leaning down. You can't see what she's doing, but people are moving around her chaotically. You fly closer in, trying to get a sense of her actions. The last image you see is her face, looking at you with an indecipherable expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's become dark. You're still in the shoe, the giant room spread out all around. No signs of anyone around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was nothing. Well, nothing except the faint scent of Palutena and the darkened room around your little shoe room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you sit up in your makeshift bed and stare at whatever your eyes could make out in the dark room. Some bits of furniture, a standing glass light, the edge of the table Palutena sat at while you worshiped her foot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight. Her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't quite know what to do. Everything just...happened so quickly and without warning, you haven't really had the time to let it sink in. You haven't had the time to sit and think about it. A slave? You're a slave given the 'honor' of worshiping the goddess of light...? It didn't feel right. Then again, most people don't play a game and get taken into a video game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. It felt surreal, so much so that even with what you've just gone through, along with those dreams, it felt that you would wake up in your bed at your house and it would all be a memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay your head down against the soft insole of the shoe and feel a twinge of uneasiness. Palutena's scent faintly emanated from the sock-sheet and insole. Did she really intend to keep you like this? Sure, she nearly killed you, passing it off as humor, forced you to worship her, chained you to her foot, emphasized your helplessness and is forcing you to sleep in her shoe with the threat of your life becoming a terror if you try to run again due to her whims, but she comforted you. She held you against her in a hug to help you calm down after her, made sure you didn't die from falling from her hand, and even made a bed-sheet out of her sock for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll throughout your thoughts however, one thing kept coming back, one item still lingered; Palutena's smell. It was comforting, too much so. It almost felt imprisoning withing the shoe. You need to get out of here, just to the outside of the shoe so you can get some air that isn't infused with her scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take that long to get out of the shoe, but just as you set foot on the ground below, the twinge of uneasiness came back again. If you didn't get back in the shoe before she came back, would she take this as an escape attempt? Her attitude was unpredictable. It didn't help that some of her words and actions still haunt you. 'Millions of mortals to torment...there's no chance you'll get away...' A lot of what she's done hasn't made sense. Sure the slips she's said could be serious, but what if she's just playing with you? After all, she was close to killing you and laughed it off. It could be a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't sit well with you. Especially when she...shrunk you down even further. That was terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began walking away from the shoe, far enough away so you wouldn't have to be around her aroma anymore. What did want with you? Just as a worshiper so she can 'feed' off of you? Or something else entirely...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...whatever the reason, you're stuck here, for better or worse. At least until you can find a way to leave for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Palutena's aroma wasn't around you as heavily (since it seems that the whole room smelled like her, just to a much lesser degree), you take another look around the dark room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was just as dark as it was a few minutes ago. From what little you can make out, it seems she left you here in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small spark within you began to flare up. It wouldn't hurt to take a look around would it? With how dark the room is, it couldn't be more than 3:00AM. You could just explore the room for a bit then retire to the shoe to see if sleep will come to you again. On the other hand, you don't want to get caught. Palutena could very easily interpret this as escaping, and if she means what she said, your life will be an experience you would want to end.</span></div></div>",

Oh, and the light that sent you here erased your memory of playing the game.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is Jacob. You are 12 years old, and scare VERY easily. When you woke up you were in a VERY dark room. There is a bad storm raging outside, and the only time you could get a decent lighting was when lightning struck. You could hear the sound of a piano somewhere near. You start walking around aimlessly to try, and see where it's coming from. You walk right into something very long, and thing. Once you hit it, it made a low sound. Kind of like a guitar. \"Hmmm! What was that?\" You here a female voice say. It sounded teenage. You start rapidly looking around, because right after you heard that the piano music stopped. What you saw horrified you. A girl who appeared to be 18 years old, wearing an old looking red dress. that wasn't what scared you. She had glowing blue skin, and pure yellow eyes. She also had long golden hair (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/a/ae/Melody14.png/200px-Melody14.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/a/...</a>). You are frozen in fear for a few seconds. The girl then gets up, and goes over to the guitar to investigate. It then dawns on you that you have to run! You turn to run, but the thing is you run right into the guitar string again. \"Hmmm, what are you?\" The girl asked. You are too afraid to answer. All that exits your mouth is \"I... Uh... P-P-P...\". \"I can tell your afraid. How could you not be? If I could scare normal sized humans on site, there is no doubt in my mind someone your size would be terrified by a ghost like me.\" The girl said. \"P-P-P-Please d-d-don't hurt m-me!\" You plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what small one. If you can pass my test, then I shall let you go unscathed... But if you fail, then you shall stay with me, and be tormented for eternity.\" The ghost girl said. You are frozen in fear, and can't move. She takes your silence as a yes, and takes you to her piano. \"It's simple... I shall play one of my songs, and you must guess what it is...\" She said. She then began to play the following tune...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDa da da. Da da da da. Da da da da.

She gently lifted her heel upwards,and saw your tiny body still wiggling and kicking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIka stared at you in amazement.The naive girl knew you're alive, but she didn't expect to see you moving around so vigorously like a worm.She giggled happily at the fact her new friend is enjoying it.  She hopes he doesn't mind a little change of plans.She quickly changes into her own squid form,and follow after the weird girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy feel the tentacles that replaced the feet and sandals gripped him protectively. And soon he felt he was on the wildest of rides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n|Short-time skip!|<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken boy felt as if he just got back from skydiving in a fucking hurricane. He felt Ika gently prying him off of her sizable sole. As his initial disorientation and dizziness starts to fade away. He noticed Ika is wearing the\u2026hero uniform of the second game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'So that must mean\u2026'</i> The boy thought as he saw remaining squid sister,Marie. She is wearing her cute kimono..but noticeably she isn't wearing the socks that came with it. So she exposing her bare feet,which is a good deal bigger than the younger and much more active Ika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo\u2026small humon like foot?\" Marie softly inquired in your own language.Even though her accent sounds like a weird cross between japanese and russian,and a first grader could make a better and more coherent sentence. It's still so much better than the younger inkling who can barely say one or two words in english.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger happily nodded as she puts on the shoes,and it made you realised that the squid probably told the secret agent that just to make you happy while she grabs some zapfish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's honestly pretty damn sweet of her...\" The boy uncomfortably murmured to himself as he suddenly felt guilty for taking advantage of such friendly and sweet girl. The young inkling give him a happy wave as she finishes putting on her clanky and large boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly ran off, and began her mission to save Inkopolis from the threat of the octopus! Once she gone,Marie give you a curious yet judging look,almost as if she knows that you <i>were</i> using the girl for your desires just by looking at you. The sight of her big as hell feet lightly scraping the topside of her sandals made a mad blush appear on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she suddenly stops her action,and walk carefully towards you. With her shadow looming over you,once again you're reminded that you're rather unfortunate situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in his mind,Marie gained a mischievous yet the same time subtly angry smirk.It just doesn't sit right with her that the human boy is using a sweet girl for his benefit. But judging from his face,the small human has realised this,and is now feeling guilty. Marie's face somewhat soften at the fact that he realised what he is doing is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he still got to learn his lesson,and plus besides she is in a playful mood. And since he likes feet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the salty squid do to the boy?</span></div></div>",

Of course there was an easy remedy for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the foot pressed down on you, pinning you tot he floor and enveloping your entire form. Your senses were all her sole now.

Open up your mind and senses little one.\" her voice echoed from above despite the foot cutting you off from most of the outside world. You were still motionless, stunned from the sights from before and now this new scenario. If felt great... and yet you felt weird as well.

Little by little, it took up more of his vision, the smell getting stronger until it and the foot were fully on top of him. It nearly covered him completely!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the blurriness in your eyes clears, the world spreads out further before you. The smell of ocean salts floats through your nostrils, mixing with the wet paint, and what seems like seafood. Everything looks as bright and colourful as a 90s cartoon - but it takes a few seconds before these colours end up in any understandable shapes. Some shops towering above you, flooded with odd-looking people in spats and sneakers. At your half-inch height, they looked more like ferocious krakens -  mixed with glimpses of anemone and octopi. Further in the distance, buildings that pierce the sky, some with grafitti of long-dead memes and jokes sprawled on them. A few screeching seagulls pecking at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to move, but something glues you down. It's sticky, smooth, and spreads out like an ocean in every direction... Orange ink?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, not unlike one that a squid might secrete - if more vibrant. You're splat in the middle of Inkopolis!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a rumble. The paint-coated floor shakes violently. The enormous birds around fly away in fear, leaving you alone to face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething. Something approaching at lightning speed. It looks like a tower standing high up against you, blocking the sun... Except towers don't move like that. A tower wouldn't have huge shoes that slam down in constant rhythm against steel with enough force to make it creak. A tower wouldn't make such smooth, organic movements, each joint's motion like a transformation as bits of the painted walls disappear and reappear behind the limbs' movements. A tower wouldn't have curves in its body like that, wobbling as if the creature didn't have any bones. And a tower definitely wouldn't screech like that... Or was that singing? It takes a step closer. There's a little wobble in the way it moves, a shiny reflection coming off the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to move in the ink, you're left helpless as the gargantuan form pounds towards you. For just a second, you see a long stretch of pink fabric moving up into the air, tightly hugging around the plump curves of a shapely leg, folding inwards with a movement of the mighty muscles behind them. Black material glistening like fish scales compliment the backside above, poofing outwards with a little flap. And below, two black structures decorated with pink at the bottom - enormous shoes with rose soles, sides wrapped loosely around the ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thing completely consumes the world around you for that second; you feel as if you're sinking deeper inside the ink around you as the foot looms above. And with one tiny squeal from the side - \"Callie!\" - it falls. Your body is helplessly pressed against the pink surface, sickening squashing sounds around you. As soon as it lifts, a mixture of relief and horror washes over you. The squelch was just the sound of ink sticking to her shoe, not any bones breaking - yet, that wet clump of orange contained... you. You're plastered to the sole of the squiddy woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear her voice echoing around you. Callie - if that's what this monster is called- is humming something. Catchy, but ear-splitting at your size. The leg stretches forward, revealing you to the air - you can spot another squid-girl dressed in green in the distance, waving to someone, a small box in hand. Your face soon slams onto the cement again, harshly squeezed underneath the pressure of a sea creature's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie's legs seem to fly wildly into the air. You get an eyeful of her dangling ponytails, and her twisting hips, in synch with the melody - and you're slammed down again. In fact, she seems to be stepping to the rhythm of the song, the ball of her foot hitting on every beat, and lifting afterwards to come back down in a sickening pattern. Pink, orange, and green blurs move by you, assaulting your senses. No matter how much you try to pry yourself loose, your limbs remain stuck in the gloop. The past and future seem to sink further away with each stomp. You try to pull yourself away from the pain, detach yourself from the blunt slams and the moment, convince yourself it's a dream... Yet, with each footstep made to a deliberate, rapid beat, it becomes hard to imagine anything as real, vivid, and intense as this moment. Like a rollercoaster, everything rushes by. You fall in a trance with each upwards motion, giving enough time for the numbness in your body to wear out... Only to bring back the sting of ink-coated concrete as she stomps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes sting from the salk and ink; your joints ache from the continual mashing. The worst part is the stairs - her rhythm changes on the first few steps, leaving your body unprepared for the impact. And once your body felt used to the tempo, she suddenly decided to bolt up the next flight in one horrendous dash and a single rising note. All the steps rattled harshly against you, each harder and stronger than the last. The rapid assault on your body left you panting, desperate for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath her, you can hear a muffled, high-pitched voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't your tentacles move any faster? Our broadcast begins in eight minutes!\" There are a few crunches between the comment - as if the other person (or squid) is chewing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body shakes as the words come out directly above: \"Chill, Marie. I'm just practicing some moves for our next dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are so many steps there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn excited squeal rings out above, as the foot tilted slightly against you. \"Hey - I just came up with this totally fresh move on the way here! Wanna see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to show me no matter what I answer, right, Callie?\" With the shoe at this position, you can see another leg, covered in green tights, with a skirt wobbling back and forth above. Near the groin, gloved hands reach into a box of french fries, scooping them towards this second squid's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahah - yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she jumped into the air. At the very height of her leap, the grip around your body instantly loosened; gravity's hard tugging felt more like a soft embrace. With less time than it took to blink, she'd changed into squid form and flipped around three times. You were caught between the wriggling tentacles for a second, before they flung you out. Finally, freedom-!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought quickly passed once you saw your destination: a glob of ketchup resting on a french fry! You flew through the air, a nice view of the inky city below, before landing inside with a teensy sploosh. A little bit of the batter crumbled beneath your torso, warming it with processed potato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, pretty sweet, but not Dopefish-fresh. Like, an 72%.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pull yourself away to find the origin of the booming voice, you find yourself with something terrible facing you. A recognizably humanoid face, soft and nearly poreless. Albino hair with an ice cream cup-esque hat. Something resembling a black mask covering the gentle yellow eyes, white eyebrows pointed upwards right above. If you had to read it, she looked fairly smug, but not confrontational - though her mood was the least of your worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh... Who appointed you minister of freshness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grin Marie shot back revealed sharp teeth, clenched tightly against each other - you could only shudder imagining their chomping power. The maw stretched open, wall of white coming apart to let a tongue slither out. It dripped with saliva, crawling towards your ketchup trap; the pink surface quickly reached the french fry and skillfully seized it. Facing her taste buds and sugary breath, you felt your sanity level drop to the seafloor. Like a Lovecraftian protagonist, you had seen things humans were not meant to see; and an uncaring, tentacled family of Elder Gods had decided to accept you as a sacrifice. As the supple lips closed around you, you could only writhe madly in hopes that the monolithic Marie would notice. The light disappeared, sending you into the ocean of drool - the only signal of the outside world faint words muffled by her jaw's rocking movements:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Marie? It looks like there was something icky on that french fry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocking of her tongue and teeth instantly become a tsunami of motion. Waves of drool wash up behind you, quickly ejecting your body from between her lips like a water slide. With quick reflexes, Callie noticed you moving through the air - and caught you in one hand. She moved it slightly, resting you between the fingers and palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was replaced with the two Squid Sisters eagerly peering down, large eyes scanning the \"icky thing\" that fell into Marie's meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie ran her other hand over your arms and legs, bending them gently as a test of flexibility. \"Only four limbs... Waitaminnut! Eight is a multiple of four! Marie, this thing's an Octarian spy!\" Her face moved into a look of shock, still scanning you for movement as the sharp teeth and smooth lips moved. \"How much do you know, four-legs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you attempt to speak up, the other squid sister chimes in: \"And you thought I did a good Cap'n Cuttlefish impression...\" Marie's eyes held a slight hint of sadness in them, as if she was quietly apologetic of her actions earlier. Or perhaps just holding pity for such a tiny, pathetic thing. \"Looks an awful lot like those primitive creatures Gramps showed us. But he never told us they were that small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'you think I can make it spew ink?\" Experimentally, Callie loomed one finger over you, and pressed it down hard on your chest. It winded you easily; you gasped for air and struggled against the finger for a moment, face turning multiple colours. Disappointed, the squid lifted her grasp on you, letting you breathe again. \"Hmph. It's kinda wimpy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie prodded on her sister's arm, looking impatient. \"Callie, I know you're happy that my snack came with a surprise toy inside or whatever - but we've gotta broadcast the news.\" She added: \"Like, NOW.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then.\" Callie's left arm flopped downwards, dejected. Staring closer to you, she decided:</span></div></div>",

For a good moment, you were hanging in midair by one arm, jammed between the alarmingly-smooth index and thumb of this super-sized Squid Sister. It felt like you could just slip out easily, and hit the floor - your body turning to nothing but a slight tint of red in the paint puddles below. She kept eying you over, her immense, flowery pupils still showing suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your could speak, an echoing voice cut you off: \"Could you put him somewhere TODAY, Callie?\" Marie had her squishy arms crossed, and the tapping of her foot below was like continuous thunderclaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright already, geez!\" She shrugged, accidentally letting you slip loose - and, once again, hurdling towards Marie. You tried shutting your eyes, but either the air pressure or sheer sense of terror made it impossible - so you were given a full, high definition of your flight destination. And, as if you hadn't too close to both of the squid family already, chance set you flying right into the green-coated chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at you awkwardly for a moment - looking unusually alarmed, considering her previous laid-back gaze. If she weren't so terrifyingly huge, it could almost seem helpless and lost. Slowly, the bright eyes narrowed to an angry squint, and her mouth shrank to a (relatively-speaking) teensy pout, pointed at her partner; you could see the underside of her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? WHAT? That looks safe enough to me.\" She giggled slyly, tugging on Marie's arm. \"We're ready for the air!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour environment jiggled slightly as they dashed into the studio. The continual motion, bumping back and forth, combined with the storm-like crashing of feet below, the dampness coating your body, and the smell of salty snacks permeating the air, gave you sea sickness. Atop the \"safe place\", the once-gentle face shot down to you. \"Stay hidden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded silently in her shadow. Looking out, you were in the center of a recording studio, with a few crew members wandering around - seemingly unaware of your presence. And to the right, only barely past Marie's reach -  which was a considerable length to you - Callie stood with a prize-winning smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on to your tentacles...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie adopted a similar, but calmer smirk. Despite your presence, it seemed oddly natural and relaxed. \"...It's Inkopolis News Time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera crew stood miles into distance. Even Marie's arms, relaxing to her sides, looked impossibly far away. No matter which way you moved, you would only end up at another spot on the Squid Sister's chest. It was so supple, though, it felt like you could sink in at any moment - lost in the imperceptible ridges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cheerful boom hurdled into your right ear: \"Let's unveil the current regular battle stages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" The green-clad woman's voice rang through your head even harder. She wasn't raising it as loud as her excitable sister - but being so close to her vocal cords, you could feel every word vibrating through her body. Your limbs practically turned to ink at the low (yet bubbly) tone. Everything felt like it was shaking, even after she'd finished speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, on a monitor wider than a football stadium, a colourful landscape appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple-clad sister pointed to the screen. \"So, Marie, how would you plan your attack here?\" The faraway Callie could still see you. Her eyes peeked covertly to her sister's bosom, right where you trembled. She made a subtle hand gesture, like someone petting a dog - but faster. You could tell she was grinding her giant, pointed teeth through her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh... shoot lots of ink?\" Evidently, your holder felt you shuddering. You could see her great neck twisting down, a bit of wetness forming on the back. She looked at you through her round nose - mouth shut in a tiny frown of frustration and disgust. Her immense eyes kept that same expression as earlier - a mix of exasperation and pity. From your perspective, staring up at an immense figure, it felt like the entire world had its looming eyes pointed down on your pathetic state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it didn't last long. Marie's eyes darted back up to the camera, showing you the underside of her jaw. Soon, your vision was replaced with the pure, white surface of her glove. It hid you from the broadcast; but the force of even that subtle movement squeezed you hard. Between the Inkling woman's finger and the surface of her chest, you had hard pressure on every side of your tiny form, fully engulfing your senses. Your head pounded. Then your ribs. Then your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squashing motion was just too much. Within what must have been under a second, but felt like ten minutes, the pressure launched you from her breast. The world whirred by again, a seizure-inducing mix of bright colours and movement. For better or worse, you didn't land far off. Your body was buried deeper in her cleavage, the velocity and reduced friction from the smooth surface pushing you a good ways down her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the broadcast continued. \"So, the key to blattling here is--\" Callie's voice was now muffled by skin and clothes, hiding the world from your sight. It was as if all of Inkopolis was painted black and green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Marie's tone shook you once again: \"Hold up--did you just say \"blattling\"? Bahahaha!\" It echoed through your spine, reverberating harshly. The laughter lasted longer than was really appropriate - and you could feel her arms twitching a little. It seemed your shaking was slightly ticklish. You made a try at climbing back out - but her skin was far too smooth to get a solid hold on. In fact, it felt like your efforts were only getting you deeper in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a split second, you pondered what strange evolutionary routes these sea creatures crossed for their species to develop mammary glands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a now-familiar, garbled voice echoed from the other end of your prison walls: \"Until next time...\" Another shiver took you. Behind the mountains that made up Marie's skin, you felt her taking a long breath in, filling her lungs - or whatever Inklings had. Her breath and heartbeat held in place for a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAAAAY FRESH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo words. Two words, and a goofy pose. That alone sounded and felt like the sky crashing down on you. A slight jiggle from Marie's tit translated to you as a crushing slam, its force rippling through your body. Two supple walls on either end kneaded your pathetic form. The reverberating words and wiggles shattered you even more, surrounding your body. Did the Squid Sister know how terrifying it was inside here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, her breathing returned to a normal pace. The shaking ended; but you were still cushioned between her breasts. But at least now you'd have their full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause - presumably for the crew to leave - Callie spoke outside. \"Congrats, Marie! The paparazzi's going to be crazy about your weird twitching and disappearing mole! As if we needed MORE weird coverage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response came out quieter than usual, but fast - she was obviously trained at comebacks. \"What is this, the Salty Spittoon? I -tried- to get the surprise toy under control, but I don't know if it even understands me. Probably too primitive - a brain that size can't hold much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaybe your toy's too busy SPYING on us to obey orders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaybe it wouldn't be able to gawk at us if you hadn't tossed it at my knockers!\" You felt one tit receding gently as she put a hand on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt shaking from footsteps, and the sound of Callie's breathing got louder. \"I can't make decisions under pressure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like the pressure on your own body decrease. Marie's hand pushed the walls of flesh aside slightly. She scooped you up from her chest - squeezing your head, and jiggling you a little to pry you loose. \"Come on, get out of there, little thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other sister instantly leaped in to help. She held onto Marie's wrist, tugging hard - and increasing the force on your body. Soon, they dislodged you - putting you in the white-haired squid's hand this time, with both of them staring you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't get over how tiny it is.\" Callie's looming finger poked you in the torso, releasing the wind from your teensy lungs and sending you tumbling to the glove-fabric floor. It almost looked as if her eyes were glowing when she saw you gasping for air. \"Hee, stop that!\" She chuckled. \"You're making it way too hard for me to stay angry at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie shrugged, still concerned. \"Guess that's why these things died out. I can't imagine how it'd defend itself against predators.\" She smirked ambiguously after that. You started to wonder what kinds of \"predators\" she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie pushed her shoulder a bit. \"I'm still PRETTY sure it's some Octarian scheme. How the heck would an extinct species get here? And if they're running out of room in Octo Valley, it makes sense that their weapons would be space-efficient.\" She crossed her arms. \"Just common logic, Marie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other sister cut you off. It was almost as if they were purposefully silencing you. \"No, that's wild guessing. If we really want to find out, we'll have to run some experiments. Find out what kinda traits this little thing has - elasticity, endurance, solubility...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie shook her head. \"Or squeeze it until it decides to start giving us some answers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see absolutely no way that could backfire and destroy the last remnants of an extinct species.\" Marie rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way they looked at each other, it was almost as if they were more intent on proving a point to each other than actually finding out what you were doing there. Your fate was entirely in the Squid Sisters' hands - and after some bickering, they decided to...</span></div></div>",

You were a little nervous as both of them were looking at you, waiting to see if you'd say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-\" you started but realized you didn't know what you wanted to say, you didn't know what you COULD say to get them to ease up on what they want to do. Are they going to believe that you were here because their entire world was just a video game that you had intended to play when a bright light just plopped you here at such a tiny height. After a few seconds of silence Callie just rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, what a help this is Marie, the thing probably can't even talk, it's brain is probably too primitive, as you suggested like...5 minutes ago\" She poked at you again and that was finally what set you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN talk thank you very much! And i'm not an it i'm a he, and i'm not a thing i'm a human!\" You said, finally having taken enough from these two and their constant prodding at you, verbally and physically. Simultaneously both looked at you quite shocked at your outburst. If there was ever a time to get your story off your chest, it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know why i'm here? I'd like to know that too! All I know is I woke up in the square and YOU-\" you said as you pointed at Callie \"stepped on me doing your little dance, damn near crushing me until you leaped into the air sending me flying into HER food! After that and a near death experience of being squid food I was found and you both decided to take your time either poking at me with you finger, throwing me around, crushing me or throwing me around in your clothes, and trying to suffocate me! Between all that you've been trying to call me a spy, or a toy, or a dumb primitive! No, i'm not any of that! I just woke up here! I was just trying to relax and unwind at home! I didn't ask to be tormented by TWO STUPID SQUID SISTERS!\" You finally finished, satisfied and trying to catch your breath after that tirade your senses finally returned. Maybe insulting the two titans that had caused you such havoc without even trying was a bad idea. You didn't want to know what would happen if you managed to tick them off. With a sense of dread you looked up at their faces again to see their initial shock had changed to expressions of...</span></div></div>",

Apparently not. \"Your voice is so high pitch and cute!\" Callie called as she plucked you into her hands. She brings you to her face and starts cooing over how cute you are. Marie however had a much more different attitude about this \"Little punk, thing he can yell at the squid sisters, hand him over Callie, I'll teach him a lesson\" Marie said as she extended a hand over to her sister. \"No I won't, he wants to stay with me\" Callie said holding you against her cheek. Since Callie seems to be acting nice and Marie wants to hurt you, you would have to agree with Callie on that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Fine\" Marie said as she backed off \"So what do you wanna do with the small rude Primitive\". Wow every time she starts talking you think you like Marie less and less \"I don't know to be honest, I've never had a pet so maybe he will be my first one\" Callie said as she was still inspecting your body. \"What, I don't wanna be your pet!\" you shout up to Callie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, just leave him on the side of street and let him fend for himself.\" Marie added Callie who just brushed off Marie's idea continued to coo over you with saying how cute you were. Marie stood up and gave you a dirty look,  she obviously doesn't like the way her sister has taken a liken to you and the glare she gives you makes you feel a bit scared. \"Works done, so I'm heading home. Are you coming or what? Marie said to her sister Callie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie looked at you then back to her sister. \"I think I need to make a stop first,I'll be home later.\" Marie leaves and Callie looks at you, looking at you with a look of excitedment \"are you ready little pet.

Whether it was a squid girl or a normal girl, they all love shopping. She reaches down and grabs her purse that was near her feet. Her purse was light green like she was. It had lipstick, a wallet, gum and other things that a girl would have in a purse. She lowers you and drops you right in. You land right next to the lipstick and look up to see Callie smiling down at you \"This is gonna be so FUN!, going shopping with my little pet. You can sleep in there until we get there okay\" Callie then closed the Purses lid and your In darkness. Deciding that you can't possibly get out. You lay down and get comfortable. That was until Callie started moving and you get thrown around in the purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes Callie opens the purse \"Come out little pet, I've got a surprise for you\" Callie called. Since you've been trying to avoid being squished by the purse's contents for the last 30 minutes, You climb out as fast as you can. You were greeted by a stunning view. You were currently in a females changing room that shoppers use to try on clothes. And there Callie was wearing a gorgeous Green dress that hugged her body. It started at her breasts barely containing them to her ass which the dress hugged very well. Since you've been with Callie this was the first time you were memorized by her beauty. You couldn't even look away because you were stunned by her looks. \"So I take my little pet likes what he sees\" Callie said as she noticed how turned on you were. You couldn't even respond \"hahaha! I think I'll buy this, just in case you get disobedient and I need to keep you in line\" she walked over towards you seductively and pushed you back in the purse with her long finger. She closes it and continues shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long trip of shopping with Callie and dodging stuff in the purse she returns home. She was carrying bags of things. Everything she bought she showed you first, from a cage to keep you in to pet food. It shows that she obviously wants to and is planning on keeping you.
