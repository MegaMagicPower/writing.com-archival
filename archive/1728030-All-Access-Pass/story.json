He walked through the old warehouse district where his office was towards the subway station taking a short cut through a small alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering between the dumpers he noticed something on the ground glittering in the little light that reached this place. It looked like a badge on a lanyard. Alex picked it up and looked at it more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the plastic lanyard and the badge in a plastic sleeve where golden. Amd on the badge big black letters said <b>ALL ACCESS PASS</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex kept walking, examining the badge in his hands from all sides. There was no other writing or markings on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned a corner and passed by the entrance of one of the \"hottest\" clubs in town. Despite it being only the early evening, already a hand full of people were waited in a short line up to a doorman, who stood in front of velvet rope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alex passed entrance, the doorman suddenly looked up, turned to open the rope and stared at Alex obviously waiting for him to enter. Surprised Alex looked around expecting someone behind him, but there was no one. The doorman continued the stare and even the other people in like seemed to be looking at him expectingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had never been to a night club, especially not this one. It wasn't really his \"scene\". He was just wearing jeans, a t-shirt and sneakers completely under-dressed compared to the other men waiting in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped up to the doorman and showed him the badge. \"Is this one of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorman glanced at the pass and shook his head. \"Nope. Do you want to come in, sir?\"</span></div></div>",

Lights flashing to the rhythm of the musc - which wasn't as loud and bad as he had assumed - didn't allow him to see details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dance floor in front of him was empty, despite the queue outside, probably due to the exclusivity and the early hour. He made out some figures lurking around the sides where there were tables and seats and some more people were at a bar at the far end of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander stood there frozen unsure what to do.</span></div></div>",

He passed some tables where a few small groups of guests sat, most of them were chatting among each other hardly taking notice of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half way around to the bar he saw a spiral stair case off to the side guarded by a large man in a suit. Alexander glaced up and for the first time noticed the large balcony that spanned at least the whole wall on this side of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alexander looked back down at the guard, the guard had noticed him and had stepped aside, obviously waiting for Alexander to take the stairs. </span></div></div>",

Never seen one like it before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the mans attention shifted and he glanced past Alex. Alex turned and saw a tall, beautiful woman approach the both of them. She had dark skin, had an Afro and wore a short, golden shining dress and matching heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at the guard, who nodded and said, \"Good evening, Miss Kira. Is there anything I can have sent up for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you, Nigel.\" she replied, \"I don't think I'll be long. I'm just meeting Marco here.\" And with that she strode passed Alex. who stared at her as she masterfully took the narrow staircase with the tall shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, who was that?\" Alex blurted out when the woman went out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was Miss Kira Richardson. She's the girl friend of the owner.\" the guard answered without hesitation. \"So, would you like to go up, too? I'll can have a bottle of champaign sent up for you, if you wish. On the house, of course.\"</span></div></div>",

He was about to lean against the wall as he heard a click followed by an buzzing noise. He looked up and saw he was standing in front of a service door marked \"Private\" whose electric door opener was buzzing in order to let someone in. A green light on a key pad beside the door was glowing green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just stood there with an open mouth. A few seconds later the door stopped buzzing and light turn to red. Alex sighed with relief and turned to leave, but in that moment the door clicked and started buzzing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was confused, but curious at the same time. </span></div></div>",

Alex froze for a moment as the man looked up, but he merely nodded at Alex and then continued reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex stepped inside and the door fell closed behind him. Alex once again looked to the badge he still was holding in his hand. Slowly Alex seemed to realize what he had there, although his still was puzzled how this was possible.

Shoot.\" He put the newspaper aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it ok for me to be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the man looked puzzled. \"You've got an All Access Pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't know me - or this badge, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puzzled expression on the man's face became stronger. \"No, I don't.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Thanks anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome\". The face of the man relaxed and he returned to his newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex walked around the room a bit and ended up looking at the lockers. They were old, covered with scratches and partially torn off stickers. The first one had a name tag reading \"Combs\". A small but sturdy looking pad lock kept it closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeisurely Alex rattled at the door and he is almost not surprised as the padlock drops open by itself. Alex carefully removed the padlock and opened the locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt contained nothing special. A pair of shoes, some street clothes on a hanger, the usual. There was a money clip on top shelf possibly with a few twenties in it. Alex noticed a photo stuck to the inside of the door showing a couple sitting in a park smiling at the camera. Alex turned back to the subway employee. He was most certainly the guy in the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your locker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is.\" The man replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't care anyone could take your money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Its normally locked, so don't forget to lock it when you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I could take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was almost getting creepy, but Alex had to try it out. He picked up the cash and locked the locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpenly holding the money, Alex moved towards the exit, while starring at the man at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alex reached the door, the man looked up and said \"Bye. Nice meeting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can really use that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Alex rushed out of the room and down to the platforms where he boarded a train just pulling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train was full due to rush hour, but he dropped himself into a seat that some vacated just after he got on. He sat there for a while finally trying to order his thoughts and considering the badge and what happened in that subway service area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while he finally looked up as the train pulled into a station and he realized, that he had got into the wrong train and that he was now downtown. The thought that he didn't really want to go home right now anyway and he was starving, so Alex disembarked and climbed up to street level. He found a small diner where he sat down in a dark corner, had a short look at the menu and then waved over the waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Mandy. What can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall, dark haired woman was about Alex's age and she smiled friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you even seen anything like this?\" Alex asked, showing her the badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't.\" she replied, \"but it's an All-Access Pass, so that means everything's on the house. So, what would you like? I can recommend the steak and kidney pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll take that. And a beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile eating Alex considered what do do next. Maybe it would be a good idea to get rid of the badge.</span></div></div>",

Despite being dinner time the place was quite empty. \"Looks like I can spare a few minutes.\" she said sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask you where you live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Just around the corner in 253 11th Street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was silent for a moment. And then asked \"But you wouldn't tell that any other customer would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! That would be insane.

You do have an All Access Pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's heart was thumping loudly in his chest as he finally asked, \"Would you unbutton your blouse for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not. Not here in front of everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Alex though he went too far, but then he realized something. \"What if we go in back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be better.\" The waitress nodded and got up.</span></div></div>",
