What had she done wrong for her boyfriend to turn around and start dating her friend? She pulled out a piece of glass. \"My pictur frame must of broke.\" She sighed. Maybe there was a way out of this. Maybe there wasn't. She heard the bathroom door open and she hugged her knees so no one could see her legs. It was her friend. She finished doing her job and Anna heard her boyfriend's voice say, \"C'mon babe. Wait until 7:00. I'll pick you up.\" Then the door slammed shut. Anna wanted to run after them. She wanted to kill her friend for having a way to turn anybody on. Anna looked at her wrist. Maybe she'd be happy if she just forgot about the whole thing and died. She didn't know what to do. She was too young to die. Her parents would go mad. At least her friend would feel bad. Anna smiled at the thought. Well, I guess it's time to pull the plug. Suddenly, her stall flung open. She had forgotten to lock it.<br>\r\n\"Come with me Anna.\" It was a girl Anna barely knew. Her brown hair was shining like there was light above it, but there was no light besides the on in the bathroom. The girl took her hand and they walked out the door. \"Anna, I want to show you something.\" Anna peeered through the jacket the girl had flung on her. It was her friend. She looked so hysterical as she cried her eyes out. Her boyfriend was there too. What happened? Suddenly, Anna understood. This was the flash of the future. If she had killed herself, this would've happened. Anna walked up to her boyfriend and hugged him. He didn't budge. He didn't even look at her. So much for TLC! Her friend rubbed her shoulders as Anna said, \"You guys!\" \"Did you hear something?\" Her boyfriend shook his head. Anna glared at the girl that had taken her here. \"Take me back. I don't want to die. I hate the silent treatment.\" The girl obeyed. They were back in the stall. Anna raced out but there was noone there. \"Anna, you have to decide your future. Don't die because of one boy. God has plans for you.\" Anna turned around. The girl had wings, white leathery wings that were accompanying her white dress. She had a crown. \"I'm your gaurdian angel.\" Anna pinched herself. It was real. \"Ok gaurdian angel. Why weren't you there all the times I needed you? My homework, my dog died, the day my uncle moved to Genovia...\" The angel laughed. \"I can't stop what has already happened. I can't stop the future. I can only stop you.\" Then she dissapeared.</span></div></div>",

It didn't sound too familiar, but she managed to stop crying. She wiped her tears away, got up and turned around. \"Anna...\" \"Ginger?\" Anna asked, \"What are you doing here?\" \"I have a hall pass...\" Ginger seemed a bit frightened, pausing to choose her words carefully. Anna took advantage of the stop in this potential discussion to examine the girl. Ginger was a sophomore, that Anna knew when she was a little kid. They lived in the same neighbourhood and every once in a while when they were younger, they would get together and hang out. Ginger was always an inquisitive girl, but also very funny making Anna laugh. She would always bring the tastiest sweets or even bring her mother\u2019s makeup kit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut ever since they hit junior high, everything changed. It was completely different. Anna was one year older than Ginger. Ginger grew taller though, her body filled out faster and she became broody. Almost like she resented Anna for something. As time went on, they both drifted apart. And now by some quirk of fate, they were reunited. \"What's wrong? And what are you doing here?\" asked Ginger. \"It's my boyfriend --\u201d \"I don't have a boyfriend,\" Ginger interrupted, \"Do you know how lucky you are?\" Anna sighed. \"He's cheating on me,\" Anna said. \"Oh no!\" Ginger said, \"That's horrible! What a jerk! Tell me his name, so I can give him a big kick in his tiny balls!\" Anna giggled at that. Ginger was still funny. Ginger suggested \"Why don't you go to the nurse?\" \u201cThe nurse? Why would I do that?\u201d enquired Anna. \"Well,\" Ginger began tentatively, \"Why don't you fake some kinda disease or something? You could go to the nurse. You look teary-eyed enough, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna blushed at that. \u201cI mean you\u2019re still gorgeous, I just meant\u2026\u201d \"Ummm...no thanks Ginger, but thanks. I think I'll head to my locker and get my art stuff. The bell rings soon and art is my next class.\" \"Suit yourself.\" Ginger replied. \"Yeah, but thanks.\" Anna admitted. Ginger seemed upset as she turned towards the door. Ginger took a few steps before Anna stopped her. \"Ginger!\" she yelled. Ginger turned around and looked at Anna, a small smile appearing on her face. Anna didn't say anything for a while, but Ginger was still curious on what Anna wanted to tell her. \"Umm, Ginger,\" Anna started, walking a little bit closer to her, \"Would you like to come to our house for dinner tonight? I mean, for old times\u2019 sake and stuff...and well...I miss having you around. Can you come?? Pleease?\" Ginger stood there thinking about it for a while, her smile growing. \"Ummm,\" she started \"I think I can come...yup, I can come! I can't wait! It'll be just like old times...right Anna?\" she concluded, a nervousness in her expression. Anna stopped and thought again for a minute, remembering Ginger\u2019s broodiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she smiled as the taller, nervous, younger girl. \"Yup,\" she said, \"It will.\" Anna and Ginger returned to class, Anna\u2019s thoughts no longer on her cheating boyfriend, now about her former friend. They met up after school ended. Ginger walked and talked with Anna for more than 2 hours. Anna couldn\u2019t recall when she last laughed so much. Ginger really was a funny girl. All of sudden, seemingly without prompting Ginger leaned in, starting to gently kiss Anna on her velvety lips. Anna\u2019s eyes widened, surprised at these unexpected change of events. Before she closed her eyes and returned the kiss. Ginger was beautiful, funny and she was there. Anna would have done something stupid, but for her. \"This was fate!\" thought Anna as she felt Ginger hold her. Ginger was hands down the best kisser who had ever kissed Anna. Of course, that just meant she was better than Jack, but by such a huge margin that it made Jack's attempts look like vampirism by comparison.</span></div></div>",

And what are you doing here?\" asked Ginger. \"It's my boyfriend --\u201d \"He's not worth it!\" Ginger interrupted, \"Do you know how lucky you are to be alive and so beautiful? Whatever he did, the world needs you and he never deserved someone like you!\" Anna sighed. \"He's cheating on me,\" Anna said. \"Oh no!\" Ginger said, \"That's horrible! What a jerk! Tell me his name, so I can give him a big kick in his tiny balls!\" Anna giggled at that. Ginger was still funny. Ginger suggested \"Why don't you go to the nurse?\" \u201cThe nurse? Why would I do that?\u201d enquired Anna. \"Well, you did just try to cut your own throat.\" Ginger began tentatively, \"Why don't you fake some kinda disease or something? You could go to the nurse. You look teary-eyed enough, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna blushed at that. \u201cI mean you\u2019re still gorgeous, I just meant\u2026\u201d \"Ummm...no thanks Ginger, but thanks. I think I'll head to my locker and get my art stuff. The bell rings soon and art is my next class.\" \"You won't hurt yourselves again, will you?\" expressed a worried Ginger. \"No, you're right. He isn't worth it!\" Anna declared. \"Well suit yourself.\" Ginger replied. \"Yeah, but thanks Ginger for everything.\" Anna admitted. Ginger seemed upset as she turned towards the door. Ginger took a few steps before Anna stopped her. \"Ginger!\" she yelled. Ginger turned around and looked at Anna, a small smile appearing on her face. Anna didn't say anything for a while, but Ginger was still curious on what Anna wanted to tell her. \"Umm, Ginger,\" Anna started, walking a little bit closer to her, \"Would you like to come to our house for dinner tonight? I mean, for old times\u2019 sake and stuff...and well...I miss having you around. Can you come?? Pleease?\" Ginger stood there thinking about it for a while, her smile growing. \"Ummm,\" she started \"I think I can come...yup, I can come! I can't wait! It'll be just like old times...right Anna?\" she concluded, a nervousness in her expression. Anna stopped and thought again for a minute, remembering Ginger\u2019s broodiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she smiled as the taller, nervous, younger girl. \"Yup,\" she said, \"It will.\" Anna and Ginger returned to class, Anna\u2019s thoughts no longer on her cheating boyfriend, now about her former friend. They met up after school ended. Ginger walked and talked with Anna for more than 2 hours. Anna couldn\u2019t recall when she last laughed so much. Ginger really was a funny girl. All of sudden, seemingly without prompting Ginger leaned in, starting to gently kiss Anna on her velvety lips. Anna\u2019s eyes widened, surprised at these unexpected change of events. Before she closed her eyes and returned the kiss. Ginger was beautiful, funny and she was there. Anna would have done something stupid, but for her. \"This was fate!\" thought Anna as she felt Ginger hold her. Ginger was hands down the best kisser who had ever kissed Anna. Of course, that just meant she was better than Jack, but by such a huge margin that it made Jack's attempts look like vampirism by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe separates from Anna, a large grin on her face. \"I think I have a solution for that bastar...I won't dignify him by even referring to him by that insult. What's your ex-friends' name?\" she asked. \"Her name is Jessica Grant. It wasn't the first boyfriend she acted upon either, just the first of mine. I'm done with boys, I love having a pretty younger girlfriend!\" she responded. Ginger blushed, but her face betrayed her happiness. \"So what plan do you have for those adulterers?\" asked Anna, excited. \"Follow me back to my place, dear girlfriend. Boy, are you in for a surprise!\" declared Ginger, happily. Anna held Ginger's hand, trying to keep herself from jumping up and down. </span></div></div>",

A quick squeeze of reassurance from Ginger, before the door opened. Anna gasped as she looked around. She wasn't sure if it was a chemistry lab or a witches' den. \"A sexy lab coat for a sexy girl?\" half posed, half asked Ginger. Anna felt softness after putting it in. \"Silken Tashkent, a fake fur to keep warm. And for other things?\" Anna couldn't figure out when Ginger had been so flirtatiously seductive. She seemed to ooze this raw beauty of sensuality, Anna didn't even know existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few wink, Ginger took out some chemicals from a test tube. \"Watch this!\" declared Ginger, gently pouring a measured portion of 5 different compounds into a small black cauldron. \"It's iron alloy rather than ceramic plastic. The iron from the cauldron stimulates the chemical compound. We need to wait for a few more seconds.\" explained Ginger. Anna could only nod as Ginger ran her gloved hand across her lab coat sleeve.

Anna mewled before a bubbling sound interrupted her reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time!\" chanted an excited Ginger. Anna watched as a ginger dropped a small drop of another solution. The solution was purple. \"Watch this, babe!\" exclaimed Ginger, lifting a cage unto the table. Anna could see a large make rat whose member was unusually long for so small a creature. \"Ginger applied a drop of the purple compound to the rat, whose shone briefly a yellowish white light before stopping. There was no member after that. \"Did the rat just...become a girl?\" gasped Anna. Ginger grinned. \"Watch this!\" Two more cages were introduced a male and a female. A drop was added to the female, before Ginger pressed a button at the top of each cage. The tree cages joined and the two females were now together. Anna gasped again as both rats clawed at each other with obvious lustful abandon. \"Now watch the boy rat!\" Anna observed the excitement of the male rat, clearly enjoying the show. It seemed lesbianism attracted all males regardless of species. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final cage was opened. What Anna saw stunned her. Ginger beamed before introducing two more male rats.

She looked herself in the mirror. \"Goodbye!\" she whispered as she held the knife to her throat. Tears fell down her face as she closed her eyes. The knife surprised her by flying out of her hand. \u201cAnna! Anna, are you okay?\" Anna heard a voice call out. It didn't sound too familiar, but she managed to stop crying. She wiped her tears away, got up and turned around. \"Anna...\" \"Ginger?\" Anna asked, \"What are you doing here?\" \"I have a hall pass...\" Ginger seemed a bit frightened, pausing to choose her words carefully. Anna took advantage of the stop in this potential discussion to examine the girl. Ginger was a sophomore, that Anna knew when she was a little kid. They lived in the same neighbourhood and every once in a while when they were younger, they would get together and hang out. Ginger was always an inquisitive girl, but also very funny making Anna laugh.

There was a note underneath. \"Dear Jack, a sweet cake for you, which you richly deserve.\" He could barely make put JG below. He lifted the treat, almost drooling as he reached for a bite. \"Share?\" came a familiar voice. He grinned at Jessica, splitting the donut in half.

Anna and Ginger bit back their giggles as Jack's new breasts were exposed, followed by Jessica's shaved mound. Soon two girls were devouring each other womanhoods as Ginger pulled Anna away. Both girls wound up in an empty classrooms, laughing hysterically. Anna was delighted at the vengeance they had wrought. \"H-How longggahahahaha!\" laughed Anna unable to finish her steneve. Ginger giggled in return before pulling Anna in a liss. Anna replied in turn...before the heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naked lesbians!!!!\" They held hands as they rushed out. To their delight, some clever kid had hidden their clothes, leaving Jack and Ginger pressing against each other; Jack's new girl behind hopeless exposed.

Her dad didn't say anything until they were out of the school's parking lot.<br>\r\n  \"What the FUCK happened?!\" He yelled, his gorgeous face turning red. <br>\r\n  Her father was only thirty, and he was a handsome man. Her parents had divorced, leaving Anna with her father. She bitterly resented the decision until she learnt why her fantastic mum had done so. <br>\r\n  \"Look, I just didn't feel like...\" She trailed off. Her dad didn't say another word. He just drove on, carefully not saying anything or letting his face betray his true emotions.<br>\r\n  As soon as they were home, Anna got out of the car and ran up to the lift. Her dad reached her side after a few moments. They travelled up to the apartment in complete silence. <br>\r\n  Once inside the apartment, her father took out his whisky. It was a beautiful, cold, modern apartment. Her father had left her mother with no money- that's why she couldn't have Anna. <br>\r\n  \"You stupid, stupid little fucking BITCH!\" Her father hissed, setting down his glass. Anna began shaking in fear.<br>\r\n  Her father advanced, his eyes narrowing, an evil smile creeping onto his lips. <br>\r\n  \"We'll have to punish you, won't we?\" He came up to her until they were almost nose to nose. Anna's eyes were wide and frightened. Her father smiled, cupped her face and began kissing her. <br>\r\n  \"Ugh, Dad!\" She pushed him away in disgust. Her father got angry. He grabbed her arm, leading her to his bedroom. He sat her on the bed, slapping her on the face. Anna began crying. <br>\r\n  \"Shut the fuck up!\" He hissed again. Anna stopped crying, and wiped her tears. Her father picked her up, wiping her tears away from her mouth, and kissed her again. She tried to push him away again.<br>\r\n  \"You little bitch!\" He laughed. He slapped her hard, and started rustling around in his cupboard. She made a move to stand up. He pushed her back down and slapped her again. Anna bitterly tried not to cry. He found whatever it was he was looking for. It was cold in his room. She began shivering. <br>\r\n  Still smiling, he walked up to the door and locked it. Then he walked to the windows, pulling the shutters, and, over that, the curtains. He lit a fire in the huge fireplace, making sure his silk black sheets were comfortable. Then he smiled.<br>\r\n  \"If you even as much as whimper...\" He pulled out a thick coil of rope, which he roughly tied into a whip. Her eyes widened. <br>\r\n  Anna began shaking. He got even madder. She stopped, and stood up.<br>\r\n  \"Take of your clothes, you little bitch!\" He hissed, looking up and down her body. She had an amazing body, big, curvacious breasts, and long, curly blonde hair. <br>\r\n Anna didn't want to be whipped, so she took off her top and her skirt. Standing next to the fire in her lacy red bra and thong, she wasn't cold anymore. Her father laughed and walked up to her. He undid her bra, kissing her neck softly. He massaged her breasts then pointed towards the thongs. She unwillingly took them off. He unbuttoned his shirt, and took of his smart black trousers. His cock was straining to get out of his black silk underwear. He came up to her.<br>\r\n  His thumb entered her hole and carresed there softly. She emitted a whimper. His eyes grew cold and he reached for the whip.<br>\r\n  \"No, don't!\" She croaked, shaking. She walked over to the bed and lay down, fighting back tears. He smiled and took off his underwear. <br>\r\n  His cock was huge. It was thick, throbbing and around nine inches. Anna's eyes grew wide. Her father walked up to the bed, and began kissing her.<br>\r\n \"Good thing I'm your step-father.\" He muttered, stroking her soft curls, then moving down. Anna hated to admit her was right. This man was in fact her step-father. <br>\r\n  He smiled, getting on top of her. He pushed her off the bed, and lay down. <br>\r\n  \"Now suck it.\" He commanded. She obliged. Her hot, wet mouth closed over his cock and he let out a moan. She began pumping her mouth up and down, trying to make him come, begging to stop. He grabbed a fistful of her locks and shoved his cock into her mouth fully. She nearly choked, but carried on. Then, when he came into her mouth, he put a thumb over her lips and made her swallow. <br>\r\n  \"Good.\" He muttered, picking up her tanned, lithe body and placing her onto the bed. His mouth reached her clitoris, and despite her feelings towards him, Anna was getting wet. He laughed softly.<br>\r\n  \"Well, you seem to like this...\" His smooth, cold tongue reached her hole. She gasped as he began to lick the walls of her vagina, rubbing his thumb over her clitoris. <br>\r\n \"Stop!\" She suddenly said. His eyes grew cold, as did his face.<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" He asked, his voice low and as hard as steel.<br>\r\n  \"No, I don't want to..\" She whimpered. He reached for the rope. She began crying. He slapped her, then roughly tied her hands together. The rope burnt her wrists each time she tried to escape. He slapped her ass, watching a red welt appear. She whimpered again. He untied her hands. <br>\r\n  \"You didn't like that, did you? So shut the fuck up!\" He yelled. She looked up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n\"Good thing all our neighbours are at work.\" He read her mind. Then he fumbled in his nightdrawer. He reached out a pack of condoms, taking out one. He slipped it over his cock, then began kissing Anna roughly, fondling her breasts. <br>\r\n  He slowly, teasinly rubbed his cock against her opening. It was hot, wet and sticky. He caressed her soft, short curls then he pushed himself inside her. She moaned in pain. <br>\r\n  \"You're a virgin!\" He laughed, pushing as far as he could go. She wailed in painful lust. He began pumping, feeling her body respond to his touch. Her walls encased his cock, and her tight little hole got a litle bigger with each pump. He felt his balls quiver. He was going to come. He exploded inside her, but still pumped on. Her eyes grew wider and wider and she began moaning as she reached her own breathless climax. He pulled out of her roughly, pulling the condom off his vast cock. Anna started crying. He slapped her again, then turned her round. <br>\r\n  \"Stand on all fours!\" He commanded, slapping her round ass. She obliged quickly. <br>\r\n  He pushed his thick cock inside her again, but shoved his fist into her pussy.<br>\r\n \"Oow!\" She howled, as his fist pumped in and out of her. He drew out the fist, leaving her opening red and dripping wet. He continued to pump her ass, then came inside her. He got out of her, off the bed and walked over to the fireplace, leaving her quivering body on the spilt sheets. <br>\r\n  He lit a ciggaratte and inhaled deeply. <br>\r\n  \"It's Saturday tomorrow. Let's do something...fun.\" He laughed as she began crying, and put his clothes back on. He unlocked the door and left again for work. <br>\r\n  He left her a note \"Stay in watch movies eat popcorn/Go to Erotica Museum. You'll need the practice. Buy yourself something small and leather.\" He left a 100$ bill. </span></div></div>",

It ain't anything serious, I promise<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi.\"</span></div></div>",

She hurried down the hall to the Biology lab feeling a little better, but still really pissed off with Jessica. The more she thought about it, the less that note seemed to make sense. You don't HOLD HANDS with somebody who is just your good friend. She had never heard anything so ridiculous in her life. And to think that she had almost been gullible enough to buy it. <br>\r\nShe entered the classroom, and saw Jessica whispering excitedly with their other friend Cara. She stopped talking the moment she noticed Anna entering the room. Anna plonked herself down on the desk beside Jessica, and took a deep breath. This was not going to be pretty.<br>\r\n\"Did you get my note?\" Jessica asked her. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got it. I didn't really believe it though.\"<br>\r\nJessica's eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean, you didn't believe it?\"<br>\r\n\"What I mean is, is that you're a back-stabbing bitch. How dumb do you think  I am? You and Jack have 'suddenly' got to be good friends? Such good friends that you have the cheek to hold hands with him while we're in school?\"<br>\r\nJessica didn't say anything for a moment. <br>\r\n\"Well?\" Anna felt like punching her. Jessica had better choose her next words carefully.<br>\r\n\"I don't have to listen to this shit\", Jessica spat at her. She stormed out of the classroom.</span></div></div>",

But its not gonna happen anymore; Jack is the third boyfriend of mine you've become 'good friends' with in the past two years.\" she stopped to catch her breath for a few seconds, then continued. <br>\r\n\"You know, ever since 8th Grade I've watched you fool people into thinking you're some sort of princess here. But from now on, they're not gonna think of you as 'The Most Popular Girl in The School'.\"<br>\r\nAnna wondered if she should say what was on her mind; after a moment, she finally decided to give her ex-best friend a piece of her mind that had been lodged there for a whole month now.<br>\r\n\"From now on, you are the Official Slut of Mortfair Highschool\".</span></div></div>",
