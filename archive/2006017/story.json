            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCome to mama!\u201d crooned Catwoman as she lifted the Eye of Sekhmet from the display case. The crimson glitter of the enormous jewel set into the amulet was outshone by the avid gleam in Catwoman\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she had first read about the Eye online, she had thought about nothing else. It had taken her six months of planning and about a million dollars in equipment to break into this museum. Now, at long last, the Eye was hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for the first time, she wondered why she\u2019d done it. There weren\u2019t many buyers for something this hot. After expenses, she wouldn\u2019t make more than a hundred thousand off the sale. Really, it was a poor investment of time and money. So why had she gone to so much bother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. Sell it? she thought. How could she even think about selling it? It was so beautiful, so perfect\u2026Before she realized it, she\u2019d fastened the amulet\u2019s gold chain around her neck and was caressing the gem, which sparkled redly in the light of the lanterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, Selina,\u201d came a voice from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuperman!\u201d Catwoman wheeled around. The Man of Steel was hovering in midair, arms folded across his powerful chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut it back now and come along quietly, Selina, and I\u2019ll recommend leniency,\u201d said Superman. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll bring you in anyway, and it\u2019ll go much harder for you. Do yourself a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmph,\u201d sniffed Catwoman. \u201cYou\u2019re always so high-handed, Superman, flying in out of nowhere and poking your nose into my business. Maybe I just don\u2019t feel like making things easy for you today.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman landed and walked towards her. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t hurt me, Selina,\u201d he said gravely. \u201cIf you resist, I can have you in cuffs before you can blink. I don\u2019t want to have to do that to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her heart, Catwoman knew he was right, but the fact that the outcome of this encounter was inevitable only made her angrier and more stubborn. She balled a fist and punched him with all her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Superman caught Catwoman\u2019s fist in his hand, the Eye suddenly glowed red. Superman felt dizzy and staggered back, letting go of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no,\u201d he said. \u201cKryptonite?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman laughed. \u201cNot Kryptonite, Superman, but something much worse for you. This is the Eye of Sekhmet\u2014the Egyptian warrior goddess, `She Who Is Powerful.\u2019 The Lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor millennia, the Eye\u2019s been waiting for a champion destined to claim it. It chose me\u2014the last living descendant of the last High Priestess of Sekhmet. It was calling to me to come and bond to it. When you touched me, it awakened, and so did I. Now its power\u2019s mine. And so\u2019s yours!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman started to shrink, his costume sagging as he lost height and muscle mass. Catwoman floated off the ground, the Eye flaring scarlet as it infused Superman\u2019s power into her. She began to grow, gaining everything he had lost. She grew taller, her shoulders and upper body widened, her waist narrowed. Her physique, which was only toned before, began to pack on serious muscle, giving her the musculature of a middleweight bodybuilder, while staying lithe and proportional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already generous endowments swelled up firmer and rounder, her hips and ass did the same. Her black hair got longer and glossier, falling down to her waist, and her face became even more beautiful, her green eyes now glowing with their own light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flexed her biceps and they ripped through the sleeves of her skintight catsuit like paper. Another flex of her thighs and calves shredded her leggings. With one pull, she tore off the remains of her catsuit, leaving her standing there naked, except for the Eye around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hands on her hips, copying Superman\u2019s famous power pose. The contrast between her sexy, power-packed physique and the scrawny weakling in the oversized Halloween costume in front of her couldn\u2019t have been more dramatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Superman?\u201d she boomed, her voice sultrier and deeper. \u201cCAT got your tongue?\u201d The former hero was unable to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floated over to a massive granite statue. Putting one hand underneath, she lifted it smoothly off the ground and pressed it overhead several times without effort, then set it back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Superman\u2019s crotch, her X-ray vision penetrating the baggy costume. \u201cLooks like at least one part of you is impressed,\u201d she giggled. \u201cNow for another test\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes flared red as she destroyed the lanterns with her heat vision, plunging the room into darkness. Even so, she could see as clearly as if it were noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a slight noise behind her and turned to catch a glowing green dart that had been shooting towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you absorbed Superman\u2019s powers, Selina, you most likely absorbed his weaknesses,\u201d said Batman\u2019s voice from the shadows. \u201cSo you should be feeling that Kryptonite dart now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeductive as ever, Bruce,\u201d giggled Catwoman. \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong. I feel fine.\u201d She licked the tip of the dart. \u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d said Batman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Eye took his strengths and left all his weaknesses. I\u2019m completely immune to Kryptonite. But HIM\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked the dart at the now-mortal Superman. It penetrated his shoulder and he immediately gasped for air, clutching at his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh,\u201d said Selina. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s going to last too long now that his powers are gone. Better get him to the JLA infirmary.\u201d By now, Superman was having repeated seizures as the Kryptonite attacked his now-frail body. Batman ran over to tend to him. \u201cYou did this to him,\u201d he said accusingly. \u201cHelp him, Selina!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina waved her hand dismissively. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t tried to stick me with that dart, Bruce, this would never have happened. Anyway, it\u2019s not my problem,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019ve got bigger fish to fry.\u201d Leaving Batman to summon the JLA for help, Catwoman accelerated and flew easily through the ceiling, mere concrete and steel offering no resistance to her now-super form, and into the open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon was full and the night air was clear and cloudless, the view from five miles up breathtaking. She stopped to enjoy the moment, her hair billowing in the wind. The lights of Metropolis glittered in the distance and she zoomed in with her super vision, watching the people of the city as they went about their Friday evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power of Superman flowed through her, but it wasn\u2019t enough. She craved more. She wanted to be bigger, sexier, more muscular, more powerful. And she had the means to make her desires into reality, with the Eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonding with the Eye had revealed its true purpose to her: to bring Sekhmet back to walk the earth. With each metahuman she drained, the Eye would grow stronger. Once she'd drained enough of them, the Eye would be fully empowered and she would be reborn as the ultimate incarnation of the immortal Sekhmet, with all Her knowledge and power\u2014plus the powers of all the other metahumans she had absorbed, amplified to levels beyond human comprehension. No other gods would constrain her, or even rival her. She'd be eternal, and the world\u2014and eventually, the universe\u2014would be hers to make over in her image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed there a minute more, watching the mortals she would soon rule over. Then Super Selina, soon to be Super Sekhmet, flew off to continue her ascension to godhood.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Super Selina knew she wanted to move quick. So far she had been playing chess and the heroes of the world had been playing checkers. Still it was only a matter of time before there was some kind of response to her. In fact she figured that it was only a matter of time before the heroes gathered at JLAHQ. So she had to think and think quickly. she quickly reasoned if the enemy was gathering in strength in place A go to place B. For her place B was Star Labs. She quickly flew towards that research center with one goal in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n For Selina the battle at Star Labs was amazing. The security forces all laid knocked out before her. She had taken care not to kill any of the guards not for any moral reason but to get better used to the power she now possessed. Still there was something very sexually gratifying watching bullets just bounce of her. She even laughed when one of the male scientists came out with some Kryptonite to weaken her. She just swatted him with her left hand 30 feet. It was an amazing feeling. As she looked around with her hands on her hips and her chest thrust outwards she looked carefully at the destruction she had just caused. Realizing there was no more resistance to her she moved in to the lab and found a scared woman in a lab coat. Selina looked at her and cupped her breasts and said \"Don't you wish yours were as glorious as mine?\" The woman nodded yes and Selina smiled. Then Selina smiled an evil grin and looked at the woman and said \"Where is the Phantom Zone projector?\" The woman tried to point and Selina yelled \"Speak up now.\" The woman finally said \"Room 24 please do not hurt me.\" Selina then replied \"As long as you do as a I say I will not hurt you. Can you use that machine?\" The woman nodded yes and Selina responded with glee \"Yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n When they entered R&amp;D room 24 Selina ordered the woman to power on the machine and explain the basics of using it to her. Once Selina was confident she knew what she was doing with the Phantom Zone Projector she blew a kiss to the woman and sent her crashing against one of the walls. Selina observed the woman and realized she would be fine but most likely would require some medical attention. It did not matter to Selina as she had more important things to do as she quickly released several kryptonian prisoners from the Phantom Zone. Among them were General Zod, Ursa, Non,  Hul, Rom-Lok and Logar. As the Kryptonians made there way to Earth Selina quickly met them and ushered them outside to the sunlight where the yellow sun quickly powered them up. As soon as there strength levels were up to par with hers she grabbed them all drained each one of them in a truly orgasmic experience. She saved Ursa for last. The feeling of her boobs overpowering Ursa's was amazing. Her first girl girl experience. Finally she tore off their clothes and then with her eyes she quickly turned them all to ashes. Selina ran her hands up and down her now super strong body. She was 7 times stronger than Superman could ever hope to be at least. Her boobs had increased by 3 cup sizes, and her muscles now looked like they belonged on male bodybuilder. Still on her 7 foot frame they longed powerful yet feminine. \"This feels so good\" screamed Selina in pure delight. She then proceeded to make a pair of black stripper boots with the clothes of the super villains and a perfect black one piece swimsuit that showed off her rack. She then took her hair and put in a long pony tail to look more villain like using a braid made from their uniforms. With her new attire complete she saw no reason to stick around.  With that she quickly jumped up and burst out of Star Labs. A quick blast from her eyes and Star Labs was reduced to an inferno. \"Do not want to risk there being something that can stop me after all' thought Selina as she flew  through the night sky heading towards the JLA HQ. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like most of Superman's worst days - this day started with one key event. That was an alarm clock ringing in the 5th Dimension. Barely a second later a little man in a bowler cap appeared in the 3rd Dimension. This time he decided he would play his game a little bit differently and he'd pick a proxy to torment the heroes. He'd spent his latest exile watching some of the more interesting denizens of the 3rd Dimension and picked, as his subject, someone he was sure would delight in playing to his twisted sense of humor. The Joker's delightfully demented girlfriend, Harley Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had a habit of perennially attracting the Bat family instead of the Super family - but Mr, Mxyzptlk had his solution for that one all wrapped up. A little magically altered paper work and Harley Quinn was transferred from Arkham to Belle Reeve. With her knowledge of psychology and new doctor's not fully versed in the clown princess psychoses, it took Harley only a few days to get herself released from Belle Reeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mxy expected, Harley decided she'd play a little in Metropolis before going back to Gotham where Batman or Batgirl or Nightwing or Robin or... well, somebody... would no doubt catch her and send her back to Arkham. And so, Harley began a string of bank robberies to build her bank roll for some fun. The Metropolis police, not used to dealing with a criminal as over the edge as Harley were finding themselves ill equipped to deal with her - despite having a task force specifically for super villains. The problem was, they were trained for Supervillains like Superman dealt with - criminal masterminds, brute monsters - that sort of thing. An insane clown was not on their list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Superman was asked to apprehend her - just as Mxy knew he would be (partly because he'd been helping Harley avoid the police) - and he'd put an enchantment on her for just this occasion. If anyone with powers above those of a normal human touched Harley Quinn - those powers would flow into the clown princess - along with full control and knowledge of them as a little gift from the imp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had just knocked out the third cop using a spring loaded boxing glove on her latest caper when there was a flash of blue and red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, shucks.\" Harley pouted, \"And I was just starting to have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Quinzel, it's time to stop this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spring loaded boxing glove bounced off of Superman's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Quinzel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn oversized wooden mallet broke over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Quinzel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 nerf darts stuck to him... and then exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Quinzel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Harley's chagrin Superman's voice never showed any signs of frustration or aggravation - it remained perfectly level straight through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya Supes, what brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to bring you in Dr. Quinzel. I need to leave these fine officers alone and come peacefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee - you're a real boy scout, ain't cha. The bats usually just ties me up or knocks me out with a stun batarang or something - but you're being all nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Batman and I have different styles of dealing with criminals Dr. Quinzel. I prefer mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley held up her hands to a nearby cop who put them behind her back and cuffed them before leading Harley past the Man of Steel. \"What a swell guy.\", Harley said before briefly breaking out of the cops hold to jump up and place a kiss on Superman's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman felt it immediately - so did Harley. Without any effort at all she snapped the cuffs on her wrist to bring her hands around front and leapt up onto Superman, wrapping her arms around him and giving him a long, big kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman, for his part, tried to push the clown princess off of him, but found he was unable to. He was also unable to stop her tongue from penetrating his mouth. When she finally broke the kiss, Harley said \"Thanks Supes. Wait'll Mr. J gets a load of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the villainess disappeared into the sky in the blink of an eye and Superman staggered backwards - partly because of the sudden loss of his powers, and partly because that kiss and the body pressed against him had redirected most of his blood flow to regions of his body with purposes other than keeping his legs erect.</span></div></div>",

When she finally did catch up to him this time it was in the middle of a three way brawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam 1 - the Incredible Hulk, aka her cousin Bruce Banner. One man disaster zone, sometime monster, sometime hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam 2 - the Hulk Busters - Major Glen Talbot and his special team of soldiers and scientists dedicated to the sole purpose of taking down gamma powered beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam 3 - Titania and the Absorbing Man - super powered couple with chips on their shoulders that even with their incredible strength they had to be hard pressed to lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHulk was currently engaged with Absorbing Man who appeared to have absorbed some sort of metal form. Titania was smashing a Hulk Buster tank on one side of the battle field while the Hulk Buster's brought in one of their experimental weapons on the other side and aimed it at the Hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was overcome by a feeling of concern as - if the weapon was at all effective it would leave Bruce exposed against the Absorbing Man - and that could be lethal. Seeing as she was on the same side of the battle field as Titania she couldn't reach the weapon before it discharged - but she could buy Bruce some breathing room in case it worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking her emerald legs for all they were worth, Jen Walters - better known to some as the She-Hulk - leaped into the fray, catching the Absorbing Man off guard with a tackle that carried the two away from the Hulk. The Hulk - temporarily free of his quarry turned to the sound of a charging energy weapon, but he was too late to do anything about it as a beam lanced from the gun - a beam as large as the Hulk himself. For a moment, the Hulk disappeared from site in the beam which continued across the battlefield to completely engulf the form of Titania as well, moments after she'd tossed the tank she'd just demolished away. The beam lasted only a few seconds before the Absorbing Man came crashing into the generator of the weapon when She-Hulk decided he was the only projectile at hand for dealing with the gun. The generator exploded with enough force to stun the Absorbing Man back into his normal form, and Jen quickly rendered him unconscious before turning her attention to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the battlefield knelt Bruce Banner - not the Incredible Hulk. Where once had stood a nearly 10 foot emerald behemoth was now a closer to 6 foot gamma scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jen's eyes spotted something on the other side of Bruce and she realized immediately what had happened to the Hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania was green skinned. Her outfit - designed to be form fitting was pretty much completely destroyed as she had grown to close to 10 feet of height and she had just punched another Hulk Buster tank and sent the massive vehicle soaring across the desert.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hidden inside the darkness of New York's abandoned alleyways, a dark figure hissed as she crawled on a brick wall. She couldn't believe it had come to this. The symbiote, who had given everything to Eddie Brock and had made him one of the most powerful men on the planet, was now all alone again. She'd been abandoned by that loathsome bastard! How dare he! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, she'd been left without a host to survive; a doomed fate for any symbiote. She had had no other choice than to infiltrate a hospital, desperately searching for a compatible human to bond with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, what she wouldn't give to bond with Peter once more. She was still angry that he had thrown her away, but now she understood that she'd been too forceful, instead of explaining how beautiful they bond could be. Alas, Parker wasn't too fond of her after teaming up with Brock to hurt him -- another mistake of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough sheer luck and determination she had found a new host. This time, a female human for a change. And as fate would have it, the patient she had found lying comatose in a hospital bed was none other than Gwen Stacy; her first host's girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Stacy girl was a perfect fit. Not only because of her history, but because her genetic makeup was perfect for herself. The symbiote hadn't thought twice about bonding with Gwen; the creation of She-Venom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there were some... <i>setbacks</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Gwen Stacy was diagnosed with a certain genetic condition, which had little effect on the girl but quite the impact on the symbiote. She-Venom felt different compared to when she had bonded with Brock and Peter. However, she didn't know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, she had to be careful. Gwen wasn't exactly the most healthiest person, despite the symbiote's healing powers. The girl was only faintly awake; enough to leave her imprint on She-Venom's personality, but leaving the symbiote in control. Her powers had also diminished. Compared to her previous hosts, She-Venom felt weaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also hungry. <i>Very </i>hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled in annoyance, finding no new prey for her to devour. Normally there would be people inside these alleys; the shady kind that no one would miss. But so far, She-Venom had found no one. Not even a single psycho or drug dealer. Just her luck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbiote-clad woman turned her gaze to the street up ahead. People were walking around like usual. That was the beauty of this city. It was always bustling with activity, meaning there were always people for her to devour and sate her hunger. A long pink tongue slithered out of her mouth, passing razor sharp teeth and licking her dark lips. Just thinking of all the crunchy heads she could munch on... She was getting way too hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, please stop drooling all over the floor. It's creepy as heck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom hissed loudly and turned her head so fast, her neck would snap were she not a symbiote-enhanced individual. There was a man standing down below. He was large; standing close to 6'6\" or so, and the amount of muscle underneath his clothes made him look like a mountain. She-Venom could see perfectly in the dark, which allowed her to make out the dark color of his skin and the facial hair as well as features of the person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped down from the wall and narrowed her white eyes at the intruder. Her entire body was tense, realizing this hero was dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke Cage.\" The girl hissed warily; her voice a mixture of Gwen's and the symbiote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe street hero raised an eyebrow, \"So, you recognize me? Didn't know the mighty Venom knew of me. Then again, looks like you had a wardrobe change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brock abandoned me, so I needed a new partner. We are She-Venom now.\" She responded curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, makes sense. You better not think I'll pull my punches just because you're a lady. SHIELD has a brand new cell for you, or so I've heard. Time to come with me.\" The hero cracked his knuckles, muscles tensing as they strained against the man's tight shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom's eyes darted from side to side, trying to find an escape route. She could try to climb the wall and escape on the rooftops. The other exits were blocked, and she wasn't confident enough to take on someone like Cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, she jumped high and dug her claws into the stone and mortar of the nearest wall, eyes aimed above where her salvation was. Before she could crawl her way to freedom, however, a trash can struck her back. She-Venom let out a grunt as she fell down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where do you think you're going?\" Cage rubbed his hands, having thrown the object in the first place, \"Oh, right; straight to your cell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom let out a hiss as she dodged one of the hero's punches, using her newfound agility and flexibility to dance around her opponent. His kicks and fists missed every turn, but almost scored a hit sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting an opening, she lashed out with her claws and scratched his back. There were no gashes once she was done though. His shirt had tears in it, but his dark skin was still intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Invulnerability.\" Cage commented when he caught her staring, \"Pretty handy when you're fighting someone with sharp objects, like those claws of yours. Do you still want to fight it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never allow those filthy SHIELD doctors to experiment on me!\" She yelled in defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her attacks were having little effect. Luke Cage was stronger than her at the moment, seeing as this form was built for speed and agility, possessing lesser strength than her previous forms. She-Venom tried biting his arm, but even her teeth were unable to pierce his flesh; Cage simply threw her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight continued on for a while, with her dodging and trying to hurt him, while Cage missed and withstood her attacks. Both sides were quickly becoming annoyed with their lack of progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay still already!\" The hero grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom responded by clawing at his face, \"Leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stalemate was broken as she extended two black tentacles from her back, wrapping them around the surprised street fighter. Cage struggled to break free, while She-Venom attempted to restrain him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the hunger from earlier came back in full force, accompanied by that strange feeling caused by Gwen's body. She-Venom was curious about what it meant. She could somehow feel Luke's energy now that she had her tentacles wrapped around him, and an instinct told her to... pull? Absorb?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to follow her instincts and began to draw on the energy source. At the same time, Cage let out a moan of pain, followed by She-Venom feeling revitalized. A warmth began to spread through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... ugh... what are you doing to me?\" The captured hero panted, looking pale all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom came closer, her mouth and teeth twisting into a familiar grin, \"We are feasting, little hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more energy flooded her body, draining her victim's life force. The symbiote was surprised; this was an ability she had never possessed before. Gwen's unique condition, when combined with the symbiote's own abilities, allowed She-Venom to somehow steal her foe's energy; powers included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cage seemed to wither away, She-Venom could feel herself becoming more powerful than ever. Her muscles twitched as they ever so slowly expanded, becoming firmer and denser thanks to the hero's <i>generous </i>donation. The villainess' strength increased rapidly as the tentacles continued to sap away his life essence. The woman let out a purr of delight, feeling her abs contract and then widen while becoming plates of armor. Even her legs expanded; the dark material of the symbiote suit making them smooth, yet also defined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want more!\" She-Venom giggled excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her skin becoming invulnerable, similar to Cage's powers. Or to be more precise, <i>his </i>powers. But now they were hers. His strength, speed, reflexes, invulnerability... Now it belonged to her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was done, She-Venom stood around 6 feet tall and resembled an amateur bodybuilder. Yet the added muscle didn't make her look brutish. On the contrary; her figure was more curvaceous than before. Her full breasts had grown a bit, and the muscle mass she'd stolen from Cage made her butt firmer and rounder, going perfectly in tandem with her narrow waist that was connected to a tight and defined core. The villainess smiled widely as she flexed an arm, watching her bicep pop up like a ripe fruit, and relished at the power surge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cage had been reduced to a shivering mess. He looked sick; paler skin than usual, sunken eyes and skinnier. But the same could not be said for her, seeing as she was bigger and stronger than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was delicious. Thank you for the meal, hero.\" She-Venom cooed as she came closer to the fallen hero. He looked up shakily, his breathing labored as he tried to speak. The symbiote-clad woman grinned maliciously, \"But we are still hungry, and we want <i>more</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no impenetrable skin left, Luke Cage was helpless as she opened her mouth wide and bit off his head in one fell swoop. She-Venom swayed her hips as she walked past his corpse, the defined muscles in her legs flexing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger was still there though. And She-Venom knew there were more heroes for her to feast on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She-Venom felt exhilarated as she jumped from rooftop to rooftop; muscular legs carrying her greater distances than ever before. A wide grin was plastered on her face. The encounter with Cage had been unexpected, and at first she'd been worried for her own life. After all, her weakened and tired condition was not helpful when fending off a superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now? Things were different. <i>She </i>was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had drained Luke Cage of his superpowers, taking away his invulnerability and strength, which had made him defenseless enough for her to kill. She-Venom possessed his abilities now. Her skin was impenetrable, her muscles and boned had become denser, and her strength was now the double previous amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what if she could take more? She-Venom looked at the city below from her hiding spot on the roof; her mind swirling with ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many individuals that she could steal from. Devouring their powers would be incredible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCage was only a small time hero, who got to work with the big heroes sometimes, but was ultimately more of a local neighborhood type. Similarly, people with even greater abilities were out there, waiting for her to feast on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will take everything from them.\" She-Venom hissed quietly, \"Their strength and powers will be ours. Then, we will become the ultimate warrior; a scourge on this world that no one can stop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could make this a reality, however, she needed more power. Which meant she'd have to search for heroes in the city. The villainess pondered long and hard on who to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to draw too much attention to herself by going after the more famous heroes. While confident in her newfound ability, there was no desire to fight it out with all of the Avengers. Instead, a more tactful approach would suit her needs better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, She-Venom knew from experience that a team of heroes was like a well-oiled machine, so one of them would definitely interfere whenever she'd try to absorb a teammate's powers, unless she was strong enough to hold them back. A frustrated growl left her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left her with little options, didn't it? Cage had been a lucky find, even if he had found her first, but she doubted that she'd run into another hero like that. Not all of them wandered the streets at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut those that did were usually the type that were adept at taking out normal criminals instead of battling powerful villains. She-Venom hummed in thought, leaning back against a wall, arms crossed under her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf finding the heroes was going to be difficult -- New York was a big place -- and they wouldn't just bump into her like Cage, then perhaps it was a better idea to make them come to her. She'd simply drain them to become even stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that could work! All she needed to do was cause a big enough ruckus to make them go after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom smiled as she spotted a bank down below, \"Yes, this will do nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbiote-enhanced villainess jumped over the edge of the roof, laughing excitedly as she slammed into the concrete of the street. In the past, this would have dazed her, but with Cage's powers added to her own she felt almost nothing; her bones and muscles denser than ever, keeping her safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored the people screaming around her, eyes zooming in one the bank's front door. An idea quickly wormed its way into her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom walked over to a nearby car, grabbed it with both hands and began to lift. Just as expected, the vehicle felt like a baseball to her. Her sharp teeth morphed into another grin as she held the car over her head, dense muscles flexing under her symbiote-covered skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom threw the car at the bank without delay. The thing crashed into the front door and practically demolished it. Bricks and dust flew everywhere, and fearful shouts came from within. But she didn't care; their screams were like music to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villainess walked casually into the wrecked building, uncaring of the wounded civilians at her feet. One of them was unfortunate enough to be in her way, so she stepped on him and caved his chest in, bones breaking like twigs. The poor soul didn't stand a chance. A normal human like him couldn't possibly withstand her bulk. She let out a giggle and admired how her shapely calves flexed as she shook the blood away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was still filled with dust, and the lobby was a complete mess. Chairs were thrown aside, a pillar had been torn to pieces and the car had crashed into the wall at the end of the room. Fearful gazes turned to her; survivors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom regarded the damage with approval. The smear of blood on the floor that trailed towards where the car was burning indicated she'd been very lucky with that throw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecurity guards appeared out of nowhere, trying to surround her, weapons drawn and ready. She giggled in delight at the brave display, even if their fear was palpable she could smell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, boys. Are you ready to have some fun?\" She-Venom asked rhetorically, spreading her arms in a mocking gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your hands where we can see them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. Did they really think she would be that easy? A black tendril shot out from her body and struck the speaker with enough force to launch him back. His landing would be fatal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir handguns barked loudly, bullets flying through the air but failing to pierce her impenetrable skin. She-Venom laughed sadistically at their pitiful display. Cage's powers were serving her well; in the past, the bullets would have felt like someone was throwing pebbles at her, but now she felt as if they were tickling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dashed forward before the guards could react, lashing out at the nearest security guard and backhanding him. Bones shattered and he flew towards the end of the room like a missile. A grin filled with teeth was all his friend saw in those last moments of his life, before She-Venom broke his spine with a single kick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the guards fell prey to her. The symbiote-enhanced woman quickly began feasting on them the regular way, still hungry after that encounter with Cage. What could she say? She just couldn't resist a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need backup!\" A survivor yelled into his mic, shooting frantically at the muscular villainess, \"Bring in the SWAT! Fuck, send in the goddamn army or Avengers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed by his shouting, she lifted a broken pillar with a single hand, and then tossed it. The man's yells were cut off as he was squashed beneath the heavy stone decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom let out a deep breath, senses and nerves tingling with excitement. The guards were dead. Their bodies either battered and broken, or severely mutilated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline flooded her system like a sugar rush. She wanted to blow off more steam! Where were those heroes?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it right there, Venom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was none other than the Hulk's cousin; the incredible She-Hulk. The green-skinned lawyer glowered at She-Venom, her usual outfit replaced with the iconic white and purple leotard that the hero wore in combat. Her arms and legs were put on display, exposing the bulging muscles of the gamma-radiated woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom smiled sinisterly. This was exactly what she had been hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking her knuckles, She-Hulk raised a dark green eyebrow at the villainess, \"Or She-Venom, I guess? Didn't know your kind came with females too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a lot of things you don't know about us.\" She retorted. Her ability to steal a person's powers, for starters, \"Come closer and you might find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're skipping the pre-fight banter? That's alright; I needed to vent anyway!\" She-Hulk yelled confidently, before dashing forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith deceptive speed for someone her size, the gamma-powered lawyer crossed the distance between them, taking She-Venom by surprise. She hissed as her foe slammed a shoulder against her. Still, it didn't hurt as much as it would have had she not been powered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only because of her bad footing that she was hurled back. Luckily she took no damage. She-Venom was already up and ready to block one of She-Hulk's punches, catching said hero's fist in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, She-Hulk was no slouch; a green leg soared through the air and almost hit her side, were it not for her quick thinking to use her other arm to block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, not bad.\" She-Hulk complimented her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbiote-wearing villainess grinned in response, \"You've seen nothing yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her considerable might, she pushed the hero's leg away and drove her knee into She-Hulk's abdomen. Spittle flew out of her foe's mouth. She-Hulk thought her body was strong enough to take her own attacks -- a foolish mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom capitalized on the momentary shock by punching the greenskin in the face. She then proceeded to keep up the barrage, striking the hero in the face and the chest. Each hit was fueled by her newfound power; muscles bulging and flexing underneath her dark skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, She-Hulk had enough. She crouched low and fell on her back to avoid getting struck in the face, which caused She-Venom to overextend. Realizing her mistake too late, the villainess could only brace herself as the hero used both feet to launch her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" She growled angrily, landing next to an abandoned office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze fell on said office; the desk in particular. She-Venom grabbed the heavy wooden furniture with a single hand, before throwing it at the enemy. It flew too fast for She-Hulk to dodge. Instead, the hero crossed her arms over her face, protecting it as the desk crashed against her, shattering into pieces and splinters that were thrown in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two can play that game.\" She-Hulk said in annoyance, grabbing a nearby block of rubble, \"Catch this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than act to defend herself, She-Venom simply smiled as she placed her hands on her hips and thrust her wide chest forward. The boulder crashed viciously against her, but she wasn't moving any time soon, and Cage's invulnerability forced the rubble to break apart first; only dust and a smug villainess remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised?\" She remarked coyly once the dust settled, allowing her to spot a baffled She-Hulk. She laughed heartily, \"I told you there were things about us that you don't know. Let us give you a hint; we recently picked up a very useful ability, which makes our skin invulnerable to whatever you throw at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular lawyer frowned, \"Great. So I'm facing a Luke Cage then. Just what I needed this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, the girl had no idea. She-Venom grinned deviously. From a certain point of view, the Hulk's cousin <i>was </i>facing Cage, just not in the way she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two superpowered women clashed once more, resuming their brawl. It became abundantly clear that She-Hulk had an edge when it came to sheer strength. The blows she dished out were stronger and hurt more, much to She-Venom's annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when it came to durability, the gamma-radiated superhero was weaker than her. Perhaps they'd been evenly matched before the theft of Luke Cage's powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the fight was starting to drag out. She-Venom scowled as her opponent used a broken pillar like a bat, throwing her across the room but not doing substantial damage. The wall cracked under her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this encounter lasted any longer, the chance of reinforcements for She-Hulk would increase and she'd be forced to escape. She wasn't confident enough to take on more than one superhero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd SHIELD would also be on her heel, to make matters worse. There were a lot of people on this planet who would kill to get their hands on a functional symbiote. She-Venom would not allow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen Stacy was an excellent host in many ways. Not only was the girl close to Spiderman, she was the sole reason for their newest ability. The symbiote didn't want to let go of this power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it didn't want to let go of Gwen either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant that she had to do something about this annoying pest that was currently running straight towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom used her flexibility and augmented speed to jump over She-Hulk, before pushing herself against the hero's backside. Her muscular arms quickly slipped underneath the woman's armpits. The hero stumbled as she finished restraining her, holding her tight and secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" She-Hulk said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no intention of doing so though. She-Venom gave a toothy smile as her tentacles began to wrap around the trapped female hulk. Just to be safe, she kept her hold over her foe secure while they tightened their hold on the woman's limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't easy; She-Hulk was trying her hardest to break free, making it difficult for her to drain the hero. But after a few more seconds of grappling with each other, the symbiote finally began the process of stealing She-Hulk's might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom's progress could be measured by the struggling that her captive put up. In the beginning, the green-skinned hero was still on the brink of escaping. That resistance was worn down over time though. She-Hulk's breathing slowly got more erratic and her efforts to break free lessened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, it became easier for She-Venom to keep her occupied. More power flowed into her, manifesting in how her muscles grew and expanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbiote-enhanced villainess' arms thickened with muscle mass, while her legs went through a similar process. The girl's quads were absolutely pumped and were gaining several inches. Similarly, her shapely calves bulged outwards. As for her upper body, She-Venom's shoulders widened, becoming more striated and sinewy. The tendons and muscle fibers in her back were fueled by She-Hulk, who was now losing the definition in her muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPure ecstasy coursed through She-Venom's veins. She moaned audibly as her power increased exponentially. There was just so much to drain from a gamma-radiated superhero, and she was loving every second of it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much to take. So much to gain.\" She-Venom chuckled darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Hulk could only groan in pain and discomfort. The hero was looking absolutely miserable; a stark contrast to the villainess keeping her active, who got bigger and stronger with every second she drained the green-skinned woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbiote was forced to spread out over Gwen's body, accommodating bodybuilder-sized muscles that were positively ripped. White veins throbbed underneath her skin. She-Venom let out a satisfied sigh once the last remnants of She-Hulk's power was absorbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the drained Jennifer Walters slump on the floor. What had once been a tall, confident and powerful hero was now nothing more than a husk of a broken woman. She-Venom stood proudly over her fallen opponent; almost seven feet tall, weighing around 300 pounds of dense muscle and sensational curves. Her full breasts were as big as soccer balls, while her firm buttocks had grown to a similar size, becoming a muscular booty that went well with her powerful thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Venom laughed sadistically as she felt the combined power of Cage and She-Hulk fuel her ascendance. The villainess flexed one of her arms, watching a massive bicep pop up; striations increasing and a deep split on top. Her claws trailed the deep grooves between her phenomenal abs, which were protecting her narrow waist alongside bulging obliques. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe venomized Gwen Stacy fled the scene, leaving the weakened Jennifer Walters and the terrified police behind. She wasn't done becoming more powerful -- not by a long shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd more prey was always welcome.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a comic book fan fiction about a sexy villainess who steals all the powers of one (or possibly more) superheroes and the way she uses them. All initial selections will be fan fiction based on existing super heroes and villainesses that exist within the same universe and are, at least in some fashion, familiar to each other. The villainess will always be stealing power from at least one of the most powerful men in the universe in which she exists - but this does not prevent her from gaining power from other men or even women. However, only women will steal power - men can only regain powers they previously lost - but never by taking them back from the villainess. Superheroines can steal powers from super villains or super heroes to oppose the villainess, but this will usually end with either the villainess gaining those powers too or the super heroine becoming corrupted by power</td>",
