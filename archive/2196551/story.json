Tom and I were going to a bar downtown we liked, there were usually some girls there, sometimes they wanted to hang out, some nights they didn\u2019t.  So far tonight it was not one of those nights. Only a few girls in the bar and none of them were real good lookers. My name is Alex by the way. In many ways I guess I\u2019m your normal recent college graduate. I have a job I hate, a few close friends, some money but not enough to have a lot of fun, but enough to have some fun.<br>\r\n  We got access to the pool table around 9:30 and by 10:30 I was up two games to one. Our deal was simple, the games are split either way, but the winner had to buy the other a beer. I was about to win my third game when I sunk the eight ball by accident.<br>\r\n  \u201cHow could you be that stupid man,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI\u2019ll take another.\u201d I cursed under my breath and went up to the bar.<br>\r\n  \u201cAnother round,\u201d I said. Jake the bartender knew us well and started to get Tom\u2019s Budweiser and me a craft beer, today it looked like an IPA. As I waited, I got out my phone and looked over my shoulder, Tom was racking the balls, it was safe to open my phone. I wasn\u2019t proud of the fact that I used a dating app, but the bar scene had not proven to find anyone I really liked.  I looked at new profile that popped up. She was kind of cute, a year older than me, but a little homely. I thought about swiping right, then I noticed she was a smoker, which I didn\u2019t like, and I swiped left.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I turned my head and saw a lone female figure that I hadn\u2019t noticed sitting down beside me.<br>\r\n  \u201cShe smoked,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n  \u201cSocially,\u201d she said. \u201cShe might have quit if needed, especially at this stage in life.<br>\r\n  \u201cYou were looking pretty closely,\u201d I said as Jake brought the beers. I nodded my thanks, I knew the beers were going on my card.<br>\r\n  \u201cI\u2019m curious about dating apps,\u201d she said. \u201cBeen on a couple, but it seems to just be people looking for hookups.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cSome are like that, but I think others mean well.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cDo you think it is true that it just makes it easier for people who look hot?\u201d<br>\r\n  I thought about that for a second, she had a point, much like in a bar, the first thing you notice is looks, but then I knew I would try to find out more. \u201cI think looks help, but in the end, its the same as meeting in a bar, it takes more to hold attention, it takes a person you want to talk to.\u201d<br>\r\n  She smiled, nodded, then reached out her hand. \u201cI can go with that, I\u2019m Erin.\u201d I took a second to look Erin over. She was wearing black slacks and green tank top. Her blonde hair was down past her shoulders and wavy, I normally didn\u2019t like blondes, but she seemed nice enough, in other areas as well. \u201cAlex,\u201d I said, taking her hand and shaking it softly. \u201cListen, I need to take this beer over to my friend, but you\u2019re welcome to join us.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> I could see her think about it, then nod her head. \u201cSounds like fun,\u201d she said. She grabbed her drink, some cocktail, I couldn\u2019t tell what it was, but it would only be something I\u2019d be worried about if I felt a desire to get her another one.<br>\r\n  \u201cAlex, you know better then to bring ladies over here,\u201d Tom said as he set to break the game. \u201cUs only at the table.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cWorried that you\u2019ll be beat by a girl?\u201d Erin said as she walked up and half sat on the edge of the table.<br>\r\n  \u201cNot one bit, its just kind of a thing we have.\u201d Tom took the beer I handed him and took a small sip. \u201cThe pool table is where we go when we don\u2019t find the fish we want in the sea.\u201d I winced at the pun. Erin laughed.<br>\r\n  \u201cWell, tell you what,\u201d she placed a quarter on the table. \u201cI call winner, and I will see if you can swim with the sharks.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cI like her,\u201d Tom said.  \u201cDeal.\u201d  He lined up the break and shot it forward, sinking a ball on the break, and the game began. \u201cSo, Erin, what makes you like Old Alex here?\u201d<br>\r\n She started off \u201cI sat down next to him and,\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cWe started talking,\u201d I interrupted.<br>\r\n  \u201cAbout the dating app he was on,\u201d she finished. I winced as Tom sunk in another ball and his next shot looked lined up.<br>\r\n  \u201cHe tries to hide it but its pretty obvious,\u201d Tom said, he sunk the next shot, but also scratched. I had my turn.<br>\r\n  \u201cIts kinda cute, but he shouldn\u2019t be ashamed,\u201d she added. Nowadays a lot of people use dating apps.<br>\r\n  \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Tom said. \u201cToo much about looks and too many shallow girls.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cSo basically no one that would hook up with you,\u201d Erin said. As they talked, I sunk my shot and went to line up my second.<br>\r\n  \u201cWhat do you say Alex?\u201d Tom asked the question right as I was taking my shot, I missed. I didn\u2019t know if I was more upset that I missed or what he brought up.<br>\r\n  I looked at Erin, then back at Tom. I was ashamed at having to use an app to date, but I felt the need. \u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt anything,\u201d I said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t cost that much, and if it works, great, if not, then I spent a little money trying.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cIs it more for hook ups or are you actually looking?\u201d I didn\u2019t like that she kept asking, but something about how she was asking, I felt like it was okay to answer. I looked as Tom sunk another shot.<br>\r\n  \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I was honest. \u201cDon\u2019t know what I want right now. I could see Erin looking at me up and down, almost as if she was sizing me up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I felt like I was getting the short end of the stick, considering Tom was up already. He looked at me, cocked his head to the side as if to say why not. I shrugged my shoulders. I wouldn\u2019t be getting lucky unless I actually got lucky. \u201cWhat\u2019s the pro of this app?\u201d He looked back at Erin as he asked the question. \u201cWhy would I want to try it?\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cBecause I promise you\u2019ll find someone you like and will like you back. In many ways.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cFuck it,\u201d he said. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d <br>\r\n  \u201cDude, you\u2019re already up.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cBy one ball, you can still win.\u201d<br>\r\n  I put my head down, debating my options. I didn\u2019t even notice Erin walking up beside me.<br>\r\n  She leaned in to my ear, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be happy at the end of the night, one way or another. I think you have this game.\u201d<br>\r\n  He words did give me some confidence. \u201cOkay, deal.\u201d She reached out her hand and I shook it. Tom did the same. He then lined up his shot, and missed.</span></div></div>",

It took a few minutes to download and she explained the process. \u201cSo first you both are going to punch in some details to your preferences, just like any other app, but in this case, it is mostly on the physical side to start.\u201d<br>\r\n  The app appeared on my phone and it first asked if I was a male or female, I clicked male. Then it asked for what I wanted my date to look like. It gave several options. I picked red hair, I was always a sucker for red heds, straight, not curly. It went down past her shoulders. For her face, I picked Bluish Green eyes, a small nose, medium size mouth. Boobs medium, pegged her at 5 foot 6 with an athletically toned body. After a few more modifications, several profiles appeared on my screen. They were all minor variations of what I had selected. \u201cThese can\u2019t be all real women on the app.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cTom, you almost done with the first step?\u201d Erin ignored my question.<br>\r\n  \u201cYes maam.  I agree with Alex, these girls cant be real. <br>\r\n  \u201cSelect one you like, then we will continue.\u201d She said, matter of factly. The waitress brought over our drinks. They were all shots with chasers, I could see her carefully make sure the right shots went in front of us versus Erin. Erin picked hers up fast.<br>\r\n  I scrolled through the ten pictures in front of me, I finally settled on one I liked. Tom did the same.  We showed each other the pictures, his looked like Erin almost, though with much larger breasts and a more curvy body.<br>\r\n  \u201cThat looks like my ex a little,\u201d Tom said.  He was right, and I did always have a crush on her, though I didn\u2019t mean to recreate her right here.<br>\r\n  \u201cOkay then,\u201d Erin said. \u201cLets take a shot to good fortune, and I will tell you how this will work.\u201d She did the little three card monty trick with the two shot glasses. She then allowed us each to pick one. I picked the one up closer to me, Tom picked up the other. We toasted and downed the shots fast, I felt a little more of a kick then I was used to, but I guess it helped take the edge off.<br>\r\n  Erin set her glass down and smiled. \u201cSo this is what\u2019s going to happen. I should go into a little more about this app, and let you know it is more than an app, it applies some extra enhancements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ll be changed for about 12 hours, and at the end of the 12 hours you can either choose to remain how you are, or change back.

Tom was sweating, I think he was very nervous about the prospect of turning into a girl. I asked myself if I would sleep with him if he changed. But then Erin said I would. Was that wrong? Would he be forced into this? I guess it was no different then paying to sleep with a prostitute, which we both had done once on a trip to Mexico.<br>\r\n  \u201cWhat do you mean chooses to turn back?\u201d I finally broke the silence as I thought about the premise of either being a woman forever, or perhaps Tom. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my best friend.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cThink about it, best friends are hard to come by.

You can sit in the stall or you can watch in the mirror, but you will just see the form, not your actual body. I\u2019m going to go check on Tom and grab your phone, you\u2019re going to need it.  Lock the door behind me, I will knock. Don\u2019t open unless you hear me calling out.\u201d <br>\r\n  She left the room and I did what she said to the lock. I stepped into a toilet stall and took off my clothes. I looked at my penis, it was already a little smaller and limp. I slid the leotard on and I felt my penis perk up. I stepped out of the stall and I looked in the mirror, my hair was now down to my shoulders. It looked like I was maybe a little shorter, but not much. I could see my stubble I had on my face recede back into my skin. My eyes, slowly changing from brown to the blue green I had picked earlier. I looked awkward in the leotard, but by the second, I could see my body adjusting, it didn\u2019t hurt, but it did feel weird.  I heard a knock at the door, I went to open it then I remembered Erin saying she would call out. I paused, no one called out and I just stayed in front of the mirror, looking at the door. I was worried a manager would unlock it or something. There was another knock, and I walked back into the toilet stall, just in case.<br>\r\n  Another minute passed, and I felt my insides feel more and more weird. I groaned a little as it felt like parts of my body were retracting in on themselves. I reached towards my throat as it clinched in. I coughed, and I could hear my voice raising up in pitch.<br>\r\n  While certain parts were retracting, I could feel my hips and chest expanding. I had to see, I stepped out of the stall. When I looked in the mirror, I first thought there was someone else in the room with me, but then I recognized the leotard, and realized how far along I was. My breasts were still filling out but they were well along. My hips had flared out. There was only the smallest of bulges left where my penis was. My face had completely changed.  I heard a knock at the door, this time I heard Erin calling out. I went to the door, unlocked it, and opened it enough for her to come in. She slipped in carrying my phone, she looked at me and nodded. \u201cI like your taste,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n  \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this feel weirder?\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cBecause its part of the program. You\u2019re accepting the changes because you\u2019re becoming you. When you\u2019re done changing, you\u2019ll feel natural as you are.\u201d<br>\r\n  Part of me wanted to slap her for that, but she was right, I was accepting it.  \u201cWhy did you have to check on Tom? He\u2019s not changing at all.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cHis changes are more minor, you wont even notice them, its more in the mind.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I actually had to give him the next set of instructions. This body of yours, was your ideal. But we set it up that the other person can make minor changes, with your approval. He now has access to the many of the same profiles that you did. He has the option of swiping left or right, and then minor changes will be applied to your body. If you approve of them, then you can accept them, or you can reject them.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cLike what changes?\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cMore curves or less curves. Maybe a little taller or shorter, you were 5\u201910, Tom is six feet, being taller may be more matching. But we do it here, before he sees you, so when he sees you, the changes are complete and you can both accept it. Also, who you are right now, is someone who is real, we need to make changes to you so that you don\u2019t randomly run into your identical twin.\u201d<br>\r\n  \u201cThat might be kind of fun though,\u201d I said. I meant it too, but I could see her shaking her head no.<br>\r\n  \u201cThis has the potential to be something special. You\u2019re not the first, and we don\u2019t want you to be the last.\u201d  <br>\r\n  As she said that she came up to me and gave me a hug. I was shocked at the hug, but I wrapped my arms around her, it was comforting, and I needed some comfort. I was feeling like I was accepting this, but it was still an emotional situation.  I felt the last of my penis shrink inside my body and my new vagina form. She let go of me and I turned towards the mirror, the weird feelings inside my body began to subside, and I could see my new body in front of me. I cupped my breasts and squeezed them, the feeling felt familiar but still so foreign.  I examined other parts of my body and smiled, the feelings were good. <br>\r\n  She made sure the door was locked. She took my phone and placed it on what looked like a charging station, as the phone connected I saw a series of images pop up next to my reflection. They were the profiles I had not chosen from. There were some added physical descriptions with them. The same profile details popped up next to mine. I finally had some details on my own physique. I was 5\u20195, 115 pounds. My breasts were a C cup, eyes a mix between blue and green. My hair was a natural auburn. I could also see my hip size, shoe size, and a number of other features.<br>\r\n  \u201cSo here is what will happen, Tom\u2019s phone is connected to yours.  He will look at these profiles, then as he selects, they will mold some into your reflection, if you like what you see, you approve it, then your body will make the change, if you don\u2019t like it, then you just decline it and nothing happens.</span></div></div>",

I allowed him to make my hips and ass a little bigger along with a slight expansion of my breasts, I was now a full D cup.

I thought about it, and my mind seemed to go right into narrowing down options. I wanted to feel good in this body. I decided on a v-neck dress. It showed an ample amount of cleavage. It was blue and green, which showed off my eyes, it went to just above my knees. I chose some sandals with a little lift in them. As I settled on the choices, I felt the leotard change and shift. Soon I had a thong on, a bra, and the dress. The shoes appeared on my feet. It felt like magic, and I thought it to be impossible, but then everything seemed to be possible, now.
