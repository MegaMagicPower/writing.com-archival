Once he's sped off to the next house down the street, you dash through the house and out the front door, sprinting for the mailbox.  You grab everything out of it and eagerly sift through the contents, looking for the big fat royalty check that they promised you'd receive today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks at the thought of another day going by with only $5.61 to your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're sorting through the rest of the mail, you notice a plain white envelope with your name and address handwritten in black marker.  No return address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you tuck the rest of the mail under your arm and tear open the envelope, pulling out the single piece of paper off a canary yellow legal pad.  Scrawled on it is a short message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><b>Keep this safe, old friend:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5  551  96  7  328<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- VNC\"</b></span></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the plain note for several moments, trying to figure out what it means.  You think of old friends, and somewhere from the recesses of your brain, you remember Vincent Nathan Carver, a friend from high school that you haven't spoken to in over ten years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do with the note?</span></div></div>",

On a hunch, you start checking banks on the islands and come across a positive match at the Grand Cayman Bank.  To your surprise, you're listed as a trustee on the account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the next plane out, you arrive in the Cayman Islands and head immediately to the bank, where you're ushered into a private room.  Before long, the bank manager arrives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As instructed by the primary account holder, the funds in account number 5551967328 are completely at your disposal.  Provided, however, that you listen the following in its entirety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hands you a digital voice recorder.  Nervously, you push the playback button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's Vince.  If you're listening to this right now, I'm probably dead.  Hopefully you found your way here without too much trouble.  I set this whole thing up with Adrienne, and if things are going as planned, the two of you are sitting here right now listening to this message.  However, if you're sitting here by yourself, that means I was right not to completely trust Adrienne when I sent the account number to you.  Anyway, however you've arrived here, the important thing is that I want you to have this money.  I want you to use to do all the good we said we were going to do in this world.  Take care old friend... and thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do with the money?</span></div></div>",

After it's all spent, you smile and hand the bank manager the list of deposits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure this is how you'd like the money disbursed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you reply.  \"It's what we've always wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" the bank manager continues, \"I have been instructed to give this to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slides an envelope and another digital voice recorder over to you.
