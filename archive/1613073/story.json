He slowly moved himself toward the end of the bed, and lifted himself up to get ready for school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bedroom, if you could call it that, was a mess.  He lived with his Grandmother, in a room downstairs, which they transformed into a family-bedroom for him and his brother, since his parents lost their house.  It was definitely a boys\u2019 room, although sometimes when he cleaned it did look nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian went to his dresser for a shirt, and slipped it over his head.  Clad in a white shirt, and boxer shorts, he slowly went upstairs for a quick breakfast.  After making some toast with grape jelly. As soon as he was finished, he then began his morning ritual of getting ready for school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he was done with his shower, his brother was knocking on the door, \u201cHey, could you please hurry? I gotta go!\u201d As soon as Brian opened the door, his brother pushed him out of the bathroom.  \u201cWow, couldn\u2019t you use the one downstairs?\u201d he asked. The younger one responded, \u201cGrandpa was using that one down there, and I really gotta go,\u201d he said through the door. \u201cI\u2019m hurrying, hold your horses\u201d Brian said, as he toweled off and got dressed.  He opened the door, and his brother nearly knocked him over, rushing into the bathroom.  \u201cWow, take it easy there,\u201d said Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian walked down to his room and started his computer.  He wanted to check his email before he had to go to school.  As soon as the computer was started, he logged into his email account, and started exploring the messages he\u2019d gotten since last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, this looks interesting,\u201d he said as he moused over the subject of a particular email.  'Old book sale! Personal collection! One day only! Located in the old Fred Myer parking lot\u2026\u2019 he read.  \u201cThat looks interesting\u2026 let\u2019s check it out,\u201d he said as he clicked on the link to open the email.  Inside it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This sale is one day only, and all books must go.  There are many genres to choose from so don't hesitate to come down and check them out, you wont be disappointed.  Sale is from 9 am to 8 pm Saturday.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Looks like this is something I should check out,\u2019 he thought.  He continued reading the email; finding that a lot of the books being sold are quite unique and have a very deep history.  He was very interested, but happened to glance at the clock and noticed that he had about twenty minutes before he had to get to school, so he saved the email.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was finished, his little brother called down, \u201cHey Brian, can you help me make some breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a second, I\u2019ll be right up!\u201d he said, signing out of his email and shutting down his computer.  He got up, and went upstairs to help his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Brian was helping his brother make breakfast, he decided to grab another piece of toast. They quickly ate, grabbed their backpacks, and got to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian\u2019s day seemed to drag on.  Nothing happened in most of his classes except for schoolwork.  He was happy to see the day end and ran out of the school to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Brian was home he ran downstairs and turned his computer on.  He brought up his browser, and over the next few hours, did a few searches about magical books and the types of genres that are out there.  To his surprise, it seemed that there were many that delved in black magic, white magic, and quite a few others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the end of his research, Brian was resolved to get one of three types of books: Modification Magic, Alteration Magic and Anthropomorphic Magic.   These three areas seemed to intrigue Brian the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, tomorrow is a big day,\u2019 thought Brian, as he yawned, \u2018I should probably hit the hay\u2019.  And with that, he closed the web browser, and shut down his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brian lay in bed, trying to fall asleep all he could think about was these books and if they work, what they can do for him.  He's always wondered what it would be like to get bigger\u2026 both in a muscular and fat way\u2026  He's also wondered what it would be like to get pregnant, or at least to discover the growth of his body as if he were pregnant.   Something in his mind also thought that transforming into some sort of animal was very appealing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Tomorrow I'll find out if magic truly exists\u2026\u2019 he thought, as he slowly drifted into a dreamless sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was excited to find a book that would help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got up, the phone rang, so he rushed to get it before his brother did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" asked Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Brian, did I wake you?\" asked Brent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, I just woke up a few seconds before you called,\" replied Brian, \"whats happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too much. Hey, I was wondering if you would like to hang out today?\" asked Brent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.  Lets say around noon or so?\" said Brian, as he looked at the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, be there in about a half hour then,\" said Brent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Brian hung up, and went to get ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes later, Brian was ready for the day, and was in the kitchen waiting for his friend to show up.  While he was waiting, he was wondering how to get Brent to head over to the book sale so that he could get his his hands on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was broken out of his thoughts when his friend was knocking at the door. Brian got up, and went to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bri,\" said Brent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Brent, ready to head out then?\" asked Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" he replied.  \"Oh, hey, as I was on my way here, I saw that there was a book sale in the old Fred Meyer Parking lot.  Do you want to go check it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just going ask if we could,\" Brian replied, \"Yeah, lets go check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian got into Brent's car, and they drove off, heading to the old lot.  Once they got there, they parked, and headed to the tent that was setup.  There didn't seem to be anyone inside, but just as soon as they passed the entrance, they were greeted by an older lady dressed in gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello you two, how are you doing?  Is there anything that I can help you find?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Brian could reply, Brent was already asking her about the books, and telling her what he was interested in.  So, while he had her attention, Brian decided to look around, to see if he could find anything that may catch his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, don't want to grow other appendages... hmmm...  no, don't need more hair...\"</i> thought Brian as he looked through the stacks of books around him.  He was starting to get discouraged, until he bumped into a stack of books, and knocked it over, revealing a small, brightly colored book, reading \"Body Augmentation\".  He quickly picked up the stack of books that fell over, and grabbed the one that he spotted.  He opened the small cover to read its contents, but before he could focus on the first word, the shopkeeper snapped the book out of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!  You can't read these books before purchase, otherwise you could steal the valuable spells contained within... you have to purchase this before you can look...\" she stated, in a somewhat annoyed, but mystical tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" replied Brian, slightly confused why she was so defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be two-fifty,\" she said.  Brian handed her three dollars, and told her to keep the change, as she placed the book in a cloth like bag, with a drawstring.  She handed the book to him, and he put it in his pocket, then went to find Brent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrent was already outside, waiting in his car glancing at the book he had purchased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Brent, what book did you get?\" asked Brian as he walked up to the passenger side of the car.  Brent quickly put his book back in its cloth bag, and put it under his seat.  \"OH, nothing, just some information on transformation.  What about you, what did you get?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a book called 'Body Augmentation'. I was going to take a look at what it had inside, but the old lady stopped me before I could, and said I had to buy it,\" said Brian, as he pulled his small bag out of his pocket and loosened the draw string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't think you should read that while in the car... might want to wait till we get to my house, okay?\" said Brent, as he looked at Brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What does Brian do now?</b><br>\r\n1.  Read the book on the way to Brent's house?<br>\r\n2.  Wait till you get to Brent's house, its only 5 minutes away?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Brent is driving, Brian cant help but think about the book and wonder if he should try it at Brent's house, or to wait until he's home.  As Brent draws near his house, Brian begins to remember the last time he talked to his best friend about the interests he has.  It was New Years, at Brent's house; Brian and a few other acquaintances had met up, and began talking about certain things, and one thing led to another.  That night, Brent and Brian found out each others deepest desires.  Brent had always wondered what it was like to transform into a female, or at least, what it was like to have boobs, and feminine features.  Brian on the other hand, let Brent, and all who were at the party know, that he has always had a fascination about getting bigger.  Brian wouldn't really put to words what he meant, but that night, he held his hands out in front of his stomach, miming a large belly, that really wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Brian was pulled out of thoughts as Brent pulled into his driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I can only guess what your book does, Brian,\" said Brent as he put the car into park, and turned off the ignition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whats that?\" asked Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I remember what you said back a while ago, at the New Years Party, how you mimed having a big belly,\" he said reaching over and patting my small belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah,\" said Brian, as the memory popped back into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, are we going to sit in this car all day, or are we going to check out these books?\" asked Brent, pulling his seatbelt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets head in, I guess,\" said Brian, grabbing his book, and releasing his own seatbelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you know Bri, I was thinking...\" Brent started, hesitantly, \"I don't think you'd look half bad with a bit more weight on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Brian, slightly blushing at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.  I mean, you look pretty good right now, got just the right amount of chub on you right now... Kind of like the ex-jock look.  You know,\" Brent explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Brian said, looking down.  His belly did stick out, a tiny bit, but did not hang over his pants button.  Just a small swell.  His chest was pretty solid, but had a tinge of softness to it. His upper arms, looked strong, but definitely were hidden under some cushion.  Brian looked behind himself and caught a glimpse of his bubble but... Filling his 32\" waist pants out nicely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely, I mean, i wouldn't mind seeing what this book can do...\" Brent said, pointing at the pouch the book was in, \"do you want to find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Brian in an almost too eager reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens head into the house, and down into Brent's family room.  Brian went to the couch and got himself comfortable, and opened the drawstring on the small bag that the book was placed in.  He quickly pulled the pocket sized book out, and began to read its contents...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, there's all sorts of stuff in here.  It seems that they have some activation spells, whenever someone says a certain word that you pick out, you gain a specified amount of weight.  Also, there are some 'Timed' spells.  This is pretty awesome,\" said Brian excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Brian was explaining about his book, Brent went to put his away, and came back with some Anime dvds to watch while they experimented with Brian's book.  Brent got the dvds started, and came over to where Brian was sitting, and sat down himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool,\" Brian said as Brent took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet,\" Brent replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, there are a couple of options here, it says I can do this with a friend too...  Every pound I gain, you gain too, or do you just want to see me grow?\" asked Brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, truth be told, I have wondered what it would be like to have a pot belly,\" he patted his flat midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what will it be...?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After about 10 minutes Brian was just finishing his 8th piece of pizza.  He leaned back a bit, and placed a hand on his slightly bloated middle.  The whole time, Brent was staring at him, not even paying attention to his own food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, wow,\" was all that Brent could get out, before Brian let out a large low sounding burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats up?\" asked Brian, as he was pulled back into reality and noticing that Brent was staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, did you not notice that you just ate a whole bunch of food?\" Brent asked, wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... wait.... What?\" Brian asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you just had about 8 pieces of pizza in about 10 minutes...\"  he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't have,\" said Brian, not believing Brent, \"besides, I am still really hungry though... and if I did have that much, you would have finished your plate by now anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brian, you really did just eat that much food, believe me... I'm not the only one who's been... well staring at you,\" Brent said as he began eating his now cold pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, well, whatever.  I'm going to go get more food,\" Brian said, as he got up, and headed toward the buffet again.  This time though, he went and got some pasta, and 5 slices of pizza to go with it, and not forgetting the breadsticks.  As he sat down at the table again, Brent almost choked at the amount that was set down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, are you really going to eat all that?\" Brent asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Brian smiled, and began eating the large bowl of pasta, with 1 of the 10 breadsticks he grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn about 5 minutes, Brian finished off the pasta, and the breadsticks, and was working on the last piece of pizza.   As he finished the last piece, Brian suddenly felt a sharp pain.  He noticed his pants were suddenly digging into his waist.  He reached down and unbuttoned the pants, letting his belly swell a little bit forward, and take up the room that the button was suppressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I've had my fill,\"says Brian, as he leans back again, and this time, has a noticeable bulge where his slightly flat belly once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, really?  We've only been here about 20 minutes, and I haven't even started on my second plate of food...\" said Brent with a slightly disappointed tone to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrent continued eating his fill while Brian went up to the dessert pizza and took a few slices of the cinnamon apple and chocolate pizzas and slowly ate them with a few glasses of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Brent announced that he was stuffed, and leaned back in his chair.   He let out a significant and long burp, but nothing compared to what Brian unleashed earlier.  His stomach was slightly distended from the all-you-can-eat pizza, but no where near the size of Brian's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrent did a double take, just as Brian finished off the last glass of soda he had, and set it down.  His shirt visibly stretched around a protruding tight ball of mass that is now his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian looks down, and his eyes widen, \"Wow...,\" is all he could muster as he brought a hand to his tight belly, and began to rub it, the shirt just barely stretched, but definitely filled by the new mass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think its time to head out, don't you Brian?\" Brent asked, as he stood up, and leaned over the table to give Brian's new belly a poke.  It felt very firm to the touch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...,\" Brian replied... slowly moving himself out of the chair and standing up, his pants still unbuttoned.  As he stood up, he noticed that the shirt had ridden up a bit displaying about an inch of his rounded belly to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets ...,\" begins Brian...</span></div></div>",

Brian, on the other hand can smell that someone is barbecuing and suddenly feels a tinge of hunger building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both get out of the car and head toward the back yard, and greet Brent's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom, whatcha cooking?\" Brent asks, as he walks up to the grill..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just having a barbecue for your sister, she got the internship at Disney World,\" she replied, \"and this is a surprise celebration for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, thats totally awesome!\" he said, and turned to look at Brian.  \"Uhh, you okay Brian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he asked that, all three of them heard a loud growling noise come from Brian's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, sounds like you're hungry Brian.  Have you had anything to eat?\" asked Brent's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrent answered before Brian could even open his mouth, \"Yeah, we just came back from the new AYCE Pizza place... and he ate a ton...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to answer you truthfully, yes, I'm pretty hungry at the moment,\" said Brian, and he patted his still swollen middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, give me about ten minutes, and we'll get the barbecue rolling.  Brent's sister should be here any minute now,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, we'll head inside, and get washed up, although I don't think I will have room for anything... I'm still very full,\" said Brent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrent and Brian made their way into the house, and Brian sat down on a stool in the kitchen, the position he took accentuating the shape and size of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the way you're sitting, makes you look pregnant...\" said Brent, \"and I can't believe that you're still hungry after all that food we just had...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian lifts his shirt just above his belly, letting the tan ball show, and began rubbing it lightly with one hand, \"You know, I feel like I haven't eaten all day, really...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that thing looks even bigger,\" stated Brent, as he watched Brian rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  I wonder how much I have grown...\" replies Brian, as he slides of the stool, and goes into the bathroom to look in the mirror.  Once there, he takes his shirt all the way off, and sets it on the counter, and just stares in the mirror.  The most predominant feature is the size of his newly rounded belly.   The treasure trail that runs from his belly button below, seems sparse, since his belly has expanded so much.  Brian turns himself and checks out his profile.  His belly sticks out a good 4 inches from under his pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Brent, do you have a measuring tape or something that we can measure my gut with?\" asks Brian, as he puts his shirt back on, and exits the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, be right there,\" Brent replied, opening a drawer in the kitchen and producing a cloth measuring tape, \"Why do you need it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to measure... uhh... yeah...\" Brian then points down to his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" said Brent, \"Do you need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, I should be good,\" said Brian as he took the measuring tape from Brent, and headed back into the bathroom.  He pulled the tape around his torso just above his belly button, and read the numbers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About an hour later, Brian decided it was time to get ready, and check out the book sale.  He got up, turned off the TV, grabbed some clothes and went upstairs to take a quick shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was undressing, he couldn't help but look in the mirror... He was about 5 foot 5 inches tall, with fair skin.  His hair was brown, and face slightly cherubic in construction.  He had a peach-fuzz goatee going on, with a light mustache.  Looking further down, he had a light dusting of brown chest hair, between his beefy pecs.  They weren't the most defined in the world, but you could tell there was muscle there, along with a bit of padding...  Moving further down was his abs.  Well, mostly.  He's never really worked out before, but when he flexed them, you could see the outline of a six-pack. But when relaxed, it was a firm roundness that he was quite fond of.  His belly had a navel that was still shallow, but had a bit of depth to it.  It was also outlined in a light dusting of brown hair, forming a treasure trail down into his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shucked off his boxer shorts, then started the shower, taking a few minutes to clean himself up.  Once he was done, he toweled off, and put on his clean clothes, then went downstairs to find his shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding his shoes and grabbing his wallet, he was out the door.  He grabbed his bike, hopped on and started pedaling towards the store parking lot that had the book sale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived 20 minutes after his departure, noticing that there was a large tent in front of the closed down store.  There were a few hand painted signs depicting that it was a book sale, but other than that, it seemed quite deserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the tent, looking around seeing tables of books piled high.  Some were even stacked on the ground nearly as high as he was tall.  Almost immediately an elderly man walked over and greeted Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!  I didn't think anyone would show up.  My name's Stockley... Stockley Stephens,\" he said, reaching out and shaking Brian's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Brian,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you in the market for, Brian?\" asked Stockley, looking Brian up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, I was just coming to check out what you had.  It seems quite interesting really...\" he said fading off, \"I'm not sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats okay my boy, just have a look around, I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have about any of the books...\" replied Stockley, slowly moving to the back of the tent, behind a large bookshelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks,\" replied Brian, as he started looking at the table in front of him.  He began his search for the book of his dreams...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost ten minutes passed, and Brian still hasn't found anything yet. He wasn't sure what kind of modification he wanted, since there seemed to be so many of them. Out of nowhere, he felt a tap on his shoulder, and saw Stockley standing next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might i suggest one of these two books?\" He asked, presenting two rather old looking books, covered in a thick layer of dust.  Stockley set them on the table, and with a large wheezy breath, blew the dust off the books so that Brian was able to see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was titled: <b>Pregnancy (m): Through the ages</b>.<br>\r\nThe second one was : <b>Father: For the Expecting Man</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think either of these will help you with what you seek,\" said Stockley, with a slight grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" Brian asked, trying not to give away his feelings to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have a strange aura about you.  I can't quite place it, but either of these will bring what you desire,\" he said, but then immediately continued, \"but you should know, the first book contains spells that modify you so that if you have relations with either a man or a woman, <i>you</i> will have offspring. The second allows you to modify your appearance and allow you to experience the growth of a child inside you, but without actually having a child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian's eyes lit up, hearing what each book can do.  He's not sure if he wants to use the first one, since he is still in high school, even though he's about to graduate.  The second seems more enticing, since it just mimics the pregnant form without having a child...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Brian decide....? </span></div></div>",
