The country of Luctan, and the country of Leviathan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe countries differ in one major point: Luctans people are 72x smaller than their neighbors. This is not just for the people. Also the flora and faune and the complete nature is the same size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legend says that 10.000 Years ago there was a great war between the Luctans and the Leviathans. Obvious the Luctans couldn't stand a chance since everything they stood against the leviathans was literally crushed underfoot. The great magicians of the four kingdoms united to finaly drive back the giants to their side of the Kontinent. Then they put up a great magical barrier that had cost the life of all four of the great magicians. No, that nobody ruled the Kingdoms anymore all hell broke lose and the Kingdomship broke apart. Now Luctan was reigned by Warlords who owned the cities. with the time the warlords became Kings and new borders where drawn. War, peace and diplomacy led to a new Luctan. It was now divided into 8 parts, ruled by their kings. The barrier became a Legend since nobody went near this sacred place till then. The knowledge of \"higher magic\" and the barrier was lost and became finaly nothing more than a legend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Legend says that the people of Leviathan where cursed by the gods for crossing the holy border to the other world and causing so much chaos, that the gods have taken them the abbillitie of evolution and they even took one of their genders. The Leviathans just consists of women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2000 years after the great war, the scale started to tilt. The barrier is losing power and it is just a matter of time till it collapses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day is today!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were nothing! How dare these bugs challenge the might of her warrior tribe! She would crush them underfoot and return home to a hero's feast!<br>\r\n  She roared in defiance and stomped across the tiny fields into the settlement. It was small, a cluster of huts made of little plants and mud lower than her ankle. Dozens of people no higher than an inch ran about her sandalled feet. She raised her foot high above a large hut and stamped down with all her might, grunting with exhertion. It crunched without resistance and for the tiny people the earth shook. Other huts collapsed and little ones were knocked down by the power of her strong leg.<br>\r\n  The had offered so little resistance to the soft leather sole of her sandal that she'd barely felt the twigs snap and it was pressed so far into the ground that earth fell in on to her toes. <br>\r\n  Then she heard a horrible noise. A high pitched squealing coming from around her feet. The little ones! They were moving slowly away from her wriggling toes. Some just lay still. There were lots that were even smaller than an inch. They thought they could escape! <br>\r\n Rahja stomped a few more huts, careless of wether any were hiding inside and then stood, hands on her shapely hips and laughed down at her routing enemies.<br>\r\n  \"Cowards! You scurry like the bugs you are! But I, Rahja of the Tribe of Titania will show you the fate of cowards. She stretched her long toned leg over the heads of some of the fleeing crowds and trod down with a loud crunch on the woods they had been running to. Another step and she was ahead of them. It didn't matter that some had run in the other way as it would take only seconds to walk around to them. <br>\r\n She raised her left foot above the squeaking mob and moved it above the most little ones she could. \"Praise Titania for my strong legs and warrior's feet\" she thought as she stepped on five little ones. They crunched moistly under her sole and she raised her heel twisting her toes to grind them into the dirt. Tilana back at the village would not have been able to get so many in one step with her tiny foot!<br>\r\n  But there were still some sixty runts left to deal with and Rahja swore to let none escape justice, so she set to work circling the village, herding them to the few surviving huts, and relishing the crunching of each heavy footstep.</span></div></div>",

Rahja then lifted her giant sandal clad foot and slammed it down on the group of ten fleeing villagers. <br>\r\nSeven of them were actually flattened underneath the leather sole while the remaining three just barely missed Rahja's huge foot by a few inches. She gritted her teeth as she grinded them into the earth, wiggling her massive toes. Just then the ground beneath the three recovering villagers beside Rahja's foot started to cave in as Rahja's sandal sank into the dirt. Two of the tiny villagers managed to get away, but one of them lost his footing and fell back onto the huge, field sized insole of Rahja's sandal. He only had a few feet of space between him and the massive ball of flesh that was Rahja's heel. Before he could even scream, The huge heel came down, setteling back down into its rightful place and crushing the man into nothing. Rahja continued to wipe out the remaining huts and villagers inside with her feet. Twisting them into a digusting mixture of mud,grass and flesh. Sometimes she'd even kick the small houses with her feet, sending debri and tiny people hurling to their doom. As Rahja approaches the last standing hut, the five only remaining villagers came out and began trying to escape. Rahja laughed. They had nowhere else to go or hide at now. Rahja approached them and began deciding what their final fate should be</span></div></div>",

They were all running in the same direction, as if to make it easier for her to squash them! One step forward brought her within striking distance. Two half inch high squeelers were knock down by the force of her footfall and a third inch high actually started to run back!<br>\r\n Marvelling at that such human looking creatures should show no more sense than common bugs Rahja shifted the front of her sandle so that her toes covered all three and carried on walking. The leather of her sandle bulged under her toes, then as her weight shifted forward onto them, her other foot raising above the last two insects she felt the soft crunch as her toes splayed out. <br>\r\n There was one holding a tinier one just standing facing Rahja's twisting toes and making that high pitched squealing. <br>\r\n Rahja planted her foot next to the vanquished foes and put her hands back on her hips as she laughed down at them.<br>\r\n \"You bugs thought you could challenge Leviathan?\" She laughed again. \"This land is ours by right of power. Tommorrow I shall return with my sisters and we will walk upon this whole land from end to end. VICTORY!\"<br>\r\n While talking Rahja had dipped the toe of her right sandle behind the last two Luctans so that they were under her heel. As she cried victory she pressed her heel down and raising her toes twisted it into the dirt.<br>\r\n  That was the last of them. She tilted her left foot back and noted a couple of squashed creatures stuck to her sole. Rahja surveyed her handywork. Where once had been a tiny village was simply a small clearing covered in her own footprints and scuff marks. There were still tiny piles of earth and broken twigs, semi crushed little bodies and tiny things. Just to make sure she methodically paced up and down firmly treading on every inch of ground, feeling the odd crunch or squelch as already crushed bodies were further mashed into pulp beneath her heavy tread.<br>\r\n  Satisfied at a job well done, the warrior girl set off happily for home anticipating the hero's reception ahead.</span></div></div>",

It meant home. It was all she had ever known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been out riding and had gone around the north-east face towards, the hinterlands. It had started as a normal day, but then she had seen the giantess... A figure like a woman but nearly five hundred feet high towering over the trees in the far distance. She hadn\u2019t ridden to check the village which lay in that way, but, scared, had turned to ride home. She knew the old stories...

With careless steps she walked through the little city which took her 3 steps to cross and one further step to burry the first people under her sandal. As the trail noticed the arrival of the goddess they scattered appart in every direction. some where heading to a nearby forest others where running towards a hill where she noticed a castle. Thousands of men where heading towards her from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking she lifted her foot and stomped onto the furthest Luctans she could reach and obliberated them. Then she lifted her foot again and stomped down on the next ones in sight. She thought about the ones heading to the forest and pursued them. It took her one small step to prevent most of them from hiding underneath the treetops. Within 3 minutes she had crushed 98% of the population of the town and was not even breathing heavily. The few ones that actually reached the army where killed by them. They didn't want to let the message spread and create a nationwide panik. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRahja smiled at the now muddy and bloodsoaked ground underneath her and turned towards the almost empty town. Most cattle had been left behind just like the sick and old people who would have slowed them down. Even some kids where still there who had lost their parents in the panick or simply had none. She didn't cared. She just wanted to kill them all and make the town ground even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back into the village. She should destroy it before the army arrives, she thought and began her destructive work. She stepped onto the first house and took one small step to reach the next one. Two houses collapsed underneath her sole in the next step. She stomped around the town and destroyed at least one house with every tread. An old man got out of one house to confront the giantess. He had a walking stick with him and was barely able to move but still he lifted a hand into the air and started to say something. Rhaja noticed him and even before he could start to speak up he was flattened underneath the leather sole - together with some goats and a house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe destruction of the village didn't even take a minute. All what was left was an area covered with splinters, debris and blood. She turned around to face the army who didn't made it that far after all. </span></div></div>",

Unkown to Sarna and all her people, most of the planet was habitated by the Airez, but contrary to their neighbors, the Airez developed an advanced technology over their history, due to the fact that they were very numerous and the resources were limited, contrary to the Ilnay whose society consisted on very few individuals.<br>\r\nUnlike her own people, Sarna was very courious and always wanted to explore, but this time she decided to go further than the last time, beyond the borders of the mountains.

As much as she enjoyed being the squasher, it can't have been much fun for the \"squashee\", as she called the things she stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she leaned all her weight onto that foot as she took a step forward to continue further into the settlement, pressing the man into a crudely formed sandal shaped open grave in the mud. However, Cherry had already forgotten about what was happening beneath her.</span></div></div>",

She and Lynn continued massacring the micros, each trying to find a more creative way to kill the micros when simply crushing them got boring. \"Hey Cherry, look at this!\" Lynn called. She had a handful of tiny men and was holding them over her massive breasts. Using one hand, she spread the huge mounds of flesh and sprinkled the micros in. Then she let go and let her shirt snap them back together. Both girls fell down laughing at the tiny crunches the dying micros made, killing and destroying even more.<br>\r\n      \"Ha, I can top that!\" Cherry said, laughing. Quickly snatching more tinies, she pulled her pants and thong away from her perfectly shaped ass. Dropping them down her pants, she writhed and giggled with glee. Lynn walked over, smashing more buildings. She smacked Cherry's bottom, ending the micros' stay in her butt.<br>\r\n      \"Okay, it's a tie!\" Lynn said.<br>\r\n      \"Sure, but I think you missed a couple, hold on,\" Cherry clenched her cheeks together, smearing the few surviving tinies on the sides of her ass, \"Got 'em!

Suddenly the mighty grass in front of the village bend into the ground by a mighty foot. A sneaker smashed a field of Menna, the crops they where groing. With every step the feet sunk into the earth at least a  half a man deep. As the foot lifted again there was just mud. The mighty grass was crushed and torn apart. But the Girls didn't stop. A sandal landed on a hut in front of the Citygates. That was the signal for the soldiers to fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrows hit the girls, but most of them simply bounced of and broke apart on the skin of the giants. the only Chance to hurt them was hitting them with an ballista, But they where damn slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn giggled as Cherrys sandal crushed into the wall, sending the tiny soldiers flying everywhere. Lynn made a direct step into the City, flattening a couple of houses under her shoe. The two girls giggled as they continued walking through the Village. They didn't care where they stepped, but they casually walked through the whole village. Cherry loved the ticklish feeling of the compressing things under her foot. Lynn simply loved to tease the little fellows. \"Stupid beasts\", she said while she stepped on a group of running micros and some of their workingbugs. Without a warning Cherry jumped into the air and landed on the townhall with both feet. The building, made of stones, collapsed without any resistance. A little dustcloud rose up from under her Sandals. Red streams could be seen in the rubble. Finaly they reached the fortress. It was by far the biggest building in the Village and went almost halfway up to their knees. It was almost as high as the lawn. </span></div></div>",

Carla was hurt and couldn't move her leg. Fada, her maybe lover tried to help her. The sock was white, but it's sole was stained brownish yellow by the sweat which soaked them. Polly, the youngest of the group was choking barely able to breathe in the thick atmosphere and her father Simion was trying to find a way out, but the sock was placed in such a way that it was impossible.

Then her gaze was attracted by her friends wriggling toes.<br>\r\n  \"What size exactly are those big ugly feet of yours?\"<br>\r\n  Cherry blushed. Though she was a tall girl she was embaressed by the size of her feet. She hesitated, but didn't want to do a dare so she said, \"ten.

Usually his kind didn't reach the 30 so this where all men in his eyes. He saw the pride in their eyes but mostly it was overwhelmed by fear and sheer terror.

He had seen giants before but never really from this near and never had to fight one. The commander was convinced that they could win but how? They had trained a lot for this situation but nothing could prepare them for a real encounter. He thought about his family. Sophia, his wife. Lia, his doughter and his two sons Jason and Ridick. He had to protect them and even if he didn't come back he had to make sure that they would survive. That they could carry his name forth as his heir. The Mill he lived in.

She walked on and ten minutes later she had completely forgotten about the encounter....<br>\r\n This is not Earth.<br>\r\n This is a world called by it's inhabitants Teralax. It's a world both like and unlike our own. This story takes place in a country called Lucitania. It's culture and technology is much like that of early 21st century England, but this is not Earth, nor is this England. This world is recivering from a dark age, much as our own is, but in this case the rise and fall of technology was far more drastic. Three thouand years ago, technology and science had advanced to a level far beyond the level of the present day. <br>\r\n  The study of genetics produced many strange creatures, few of which have survived to the present day. With the success of this Utopian society came overpopulation. People were living longer and unwilling to forego children. Society faced disaster as resources seemed destined to run out. Genetic science seemed to hold the key to salvation. <br>\r\n  Rather than fathering children normally, children would be engineered by combining the genetic material of the parents. Also these children would be smaller. Much smaller. Eventually, when the older generation died out, the human race would all be less than an inch tall and would never have to worry about starvation or poverty again. <br>\r\n  Of course, to some, this plan seemed insane, and many refused to take part in the programme, to the disgust of the billions who did. The programme continued anyway. At first, the tiny children were cared for by their parents, but as they grew up, many chose to move to their own miniture towns. <br>\r\n  Then came the plague.<br>\r\n  It was a mistake. A mistake which became a genetic disaster. A virus created in a lab experiment was accidently realeased into the air. The virus was deadly, airborne, and seemingly unstoppable. Across the world people died in their millions. But, as with many viruses, particuarly those borne in the lab, the plague prayed on certain people with certain genetic traits. It barely touched the new inch high population. It struck at the 'traditionalist humans'. And though only about 70% of women were killed, it infected 100% of men. None survived.<br>\r\n  In our society, such a thing would mean the end of the species, but not here. They still had the technology which had artificially combined DNA to create tiny people. Now, it was used by the surviving traditionalists to combine the DNA of female partners and create full sized female offspring. There was no point in creating boys, as they would become infected and die within hours of birth, and it was likely that the virus would never go away. It lived benignly in all females. Mankind (normal sized) was dead, but by the miracle of technology, womankind survived.<br>\r\n Then came the Age of Chaos. The sudden death of 85% of the traditionalist population which still covered the majority of the planet could not go without effect. Civilisation collapsed entirely and the rule of the sword became normality. Cities were abandoned, full of the dead. Everything was ruined in the space of a year. What followed was a dark age lasting over a thousand years. Almost all science culture and knowledge was lost. Only the vital reproductive tech survived as the centre of various new world religions. <br>\r\n  Eventually, culture, science and civilisation recovered. At least it mostly recovered. History was a blank slate, there were no men.... and knowledge of the true nature of the tiny people had been forgotten. This was the greatest tragedy of all.<br>\r\n  When law and order broke down, the people who called themselves the Alieth had no protection from the barbaric giants. A thousand years later and they still don't. To the modern woman of Teralax, these tiny people aren't people at all; merely insects who oddly mimic human shape. And they think nothing of killing them en masse. <br>\r\n  After a thousand years spent hiding and fighting for survival, the Alieth (as they are known only to themselves) have reverted to a savage state. They aren't stupid; not by a long way, but a short and violent life doesn't lend itself to study and science. A sharpened stick is a pretty standard weapon. <br>\r\n  There are far more Alieth than Teralaxians. A corruption of the genetics caused by the virus has led them to grow up and reproduce twice as fast as their taller oppresors. <br>\r\n But enough history! How does this story begin?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'Fraid you'll just have to step on them like everyone else.\"<br>\r\n  Small talk over the women got down to business.

Information is a bit sketchy on that, but at least it'll be varied.<br>\r\n  The second is a series called 'Kink', which is about fetish sexuality and will (obviously go out in a late night slot.

Although they all where sailors down to the heart everyone was glad to be out of the hostile water and to have soil beneath their feet. The captain left the boat first with his flag. \"I name you Destingia and I shall be the rightous ruler of this Island and all who live here.\" He looked up to the cheering men and signaled them to come and enter his new land.

It is not the first time she destroys a city of the small ones. Everyone had done this at least once upon a time, but this was by far the largest one she had ever seen. \"Good for me\", she thought. \"Now I have this all by myself.\" The workers have left shortly before the area was cleared and tomorrow the city won't be there anymore. \"i wonder how much people do live in here.\" She looked over to the skyscraper which went to her eye level. \"there would fit more than a thousand people just in this one house. This would be fun!\" She looked for a mass of small houses, and stopped her circling right in front of a residentil area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her arms in front of her breasts and took a deep breath. She wanted to enjoy every second of this. Her right sandal lifted high up into the air and hovered over the buildings made out of burned mudbricks and wood. She imagined how terrifieng she must look at this moment to the inhabitants. How her black sole with the light pattern blocks out the evenig sun and cast a long shadow across the city. How the dirt from the site fell onto the roofs and street. Boulders to them, biger than their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she lowered her foot slowly, ever so slowly. She felt the crackling of the bigger buildings as they gave away under her sole and then the lower ones. The dry mud and the thin sticks didn't really showed much of resistance. her foot finaly reached the ground and completly destroyed everything beneath it - and she loved it! She simply loved the way her foot rested onto the ruins and debris spilling out from underneath her sandal. this was as easy as crushing a sandcastle but much better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her excitement she barely noticed the little people and bugriders attacking the bare skin of her feet in the sandals. </span></div></div>",

It all seemed old fashioned to you, they still used wires to get energy to their devices for crying out loud. Every thing seemed bulky even considering everything was sky rise size to you, they must not be good at optimization... After letting out a large sigh settling your nerves you continued to leave for your new job. Everything was bigger than you expected, you knew these people were big, but big seemed like an understatement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crawling under the door since there was no way you were opening it you stood up in the hall. The Macro people who noticed you gave you dirty looks from the heavens. You knew full well the Macros didn't like the Micros, treating them like insects since ancient times.  However you found comfort in the fact that it was illegal to kill you and this hotel was closely watched. Though even though the government itself tried creating peace, as soon as you left a closely watched area, no one would really care... Thank God your on the ground floor you think walking past the stairwell and into the lobby. You glanced at the people here, your new employer should be waiting here somewhere. Only one person has a school uniform, that's definitely her. She looked impatient looking at her yard sized phones clock. You glance at the wall clock realizing she's probably going to late for school, you'd better hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we could've met earlier if you didn't want to be late\" you yelled looking up through her skirt, standing beside her intimidating white and pink shoe. It was a nice view you had to admit, resting on your suitcase you watched your new official titaness look down for the voice she heard. Making eye contact she smiled \"Matt?\" Her voice rang in your head a little. \"Yup\" you say as she lifts your suitcase into her purse, while you were deposited into her shirt pocket. \"Well ready for your new job!?\" she giggled, staring at the intimidating drop below you over her breast you replied \"ready as I'm going to be\".  Don't worry I'm not gonna drop you or crush you or anything, your more fun while your alive\" she winked realizing your insecurity at the very new and large changes to your life, before turning around unkowingly whipping her beasts and you around with the force of a rollercoaster. Luckily just lose your grip and fall into the deep pocket while she giggles, you found some comfort in her giddiness as she started walking...<br>\r\nYour world erupted with each step her breasts rising and falling knocking you like a ragdoll inside your 1st class cloth seat, you couldn't help but wonder in she noticed her pocket was turned into a bouncy castle. Finally stopping at a crosswalk, you right yourself and compose your spinning head . A massive object is lifed above you as she checks her phones clock before it fell out of your view from the bottom of the pocket. She glanced at her passenger still smiling, \"you doing ok down there?\", Head still spinning you responded with a thumbs up over exaggerated so she noticed the small movement. Looking more serious she stated a small (to her) decision, \"If we don't wanna be late I'm gonna have to run, so hang on\". Before even prossessing her words you suddenly find yourself weight less before the bottom of the pocket came to you, you doubted you even had time to fall much. Almost immediately your world lacked gravity as the air rushing overhead sounded like mountain winds ripping at the titaness' face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the trek was over (with 5 minutes to spare), but your world still spun and your head spun with the intensity of 1000 angry hornets (each one bigger than you are). Light enters the pocket as she pulls you out and sets you on the desk carefully laying you down and leaning in concern on her face. \"What a rush!\" You say panting vision slowly retuning, giggling her concern lifts from her face \"good to hear sorry about that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust about the time you feel well enough to stand up all though carefully as you still feel sick and light headed ...</span></div></div>",

She just giggled staring down at you \"it's a macro name...\" She states matter of fact, \"to me your name is weird Matt\" emphasizing your name and winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the teacher walked in and started her job teaching, signaling that yours was soon to start helping Aphrodite with her schoolwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe how different the schools here were so different than your home, instead of the holographic desks which projected and project to work on, they still used pencil and paper!? Seeing the stacks upon stacks of paper needed and all the pencils on the desks all wonder why they cut so many trees down disappeared. Your people rarely cut any trees down due to their size but these giants could wrap their arms around most, so they needed significantly more wood just because of their gargantuan size, and even if you were the same size they'd still use more, judging by the sight before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher Ms.Muse began attendance she called out a bunch of odd names (to you) like Jupiter and Zeus, finally calling Aphrodite and continuing to call out odd names such as Ra, Oden, Venus, Achilles, Thor and Anubis. You Were overwhelmed at this point at how far away you really were from home, an excitement brewed within you as you realized just how many unexpected things might happen on your adventure in this strange land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Class began reviewing geometry. All the measurements being in imperial instead of the metric you were used to confused you slightly but numbers are numbers. <br>\r\n-<i>Question #1</i>- Was written at the top of the page along with a picture of the front of some sort of house with measurements. printed neatly below was a series of tasks labeled as letters starting with<i> a) find the area of the front of this house, remember to remove the area of the windows and doors.</i>this task seemed easy to you, just 5 easy shapes. The look on Aphrodites face however was one of confusion. \"Start by ignoring the 2 widows and the doors\" you say pointing to the house. Glancing at the picture she just responded \"how?\" Sighing you realized why she needed a schoolwork assistant. After showing her to calculate the rectangular body and triangular roof of the house and adding the areas together, She calculated the rectangle on her own then hesitated. \"What's wrong?\" You asked having the next step already done in your head. \"There's a missing measurement I can't calculate the triangle\" she mumbled clearly frustrated, \"math isn't your thing huh\" you say somewhat knowing. She just sighed the giddiness of this morning replaced with a face looking like she died inside. \"Well you can calculate the other measurements using Pythagorean theorem\" you say trying to help the titaness leaning into her hand in boredom and frustration, after hearing you she sat up a slight spark in her eye \"Oh I know that a\u00b2+b\u00b2=c\u00b2 ('A' squared plus 'b' squared equals 'c' squared) right?\" \"Exactly though I prefer \u221a(a\u00b2+b\u00b2)=c (the square root of 'A' squared plus 'b' squared equals 'c'\" you say trying to make things easier for her, \"that way you only have to put one equation through your calculator\". Finally making headway you both fly through the rest taking a little more time on the last and hardest shape ... The circular attic window, but you eventually solve that one and began calculating the total surface area \"so it has an area of 32\" she said proudly \"squared and in this measurement\" you say not really knowing what the name of the measurement actually was \"Oh so...\" She said adding the characters after her answer writing 32H\u00b2 \"thirty two Hectares {not accurate to the real measurement system I just used what sounded cool} squared\" she said \"yes exactly\" you say excitedly, before slumping over to her next words \"question 'b)' next... \" Luckily the bell rung and saved you both from the headache inducing math review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing careful while walking this time - since she realized how hard her walking was to you - she made her way to her next class English. Unlike math the giantess was better at the subject than you as she used punctuation and a vocabulary you'd never even heard of. You realized you fit nicely with her, your skill sets complimenting each other nicely... Mainly making you happy because you could never help her with her English work. Soon enough the bell rang again signaling lunch to begin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of the major changes the earth made was the development of the shrinking technologie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia Petroivka, a russian scientist developed it and gatherd a massive ammount of followers around her who believed in an all female patriarchy for a better future. The women did little terror attacks and took hostages to make money. As the shrinking technology was finished the group marched out, armed with shrinkguns and took over the world part by part. Nobody stood a chance against the women who downsized every resistance. People and equiptment was crushed like toys under the mercyless feet of the women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter years of war they even succeed to shrink a complete city. Paris was the first City which was completly crushed underfoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia and her women won the war and ruled the world with the might of the shrink technologie which became a main piece of equiptment of the law forces. Jails and courts became unnessecary. Convicts simply was shrunk down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lead to the development of a new race. The Outlaws. The shrunken people of course tried to hide and to survive even though their miserable situation. As soon as they are shrunk they simply lose all their rights. The outlaws gather and build villages and cities and have their own culture and civilisation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the normal sized people the outlaws are convicts and lawless people who don't even deserve to live and so they are treated.
