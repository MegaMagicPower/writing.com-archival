Although to be fair Shepard already had a good idea of what had caused it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it would seem\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself laugh alongside the elder woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly though it\u2019s nothing to worry about seems you\u2019re simply packing on a handful of pounds due to that small victory celebration you threw us all last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard smiled recalling the events from previous night how she had thrown the crew and her teammates a \u201csmall\u201d party for the completion of the mission against The Collectors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human harvesting aliens were through and no one had been left behind so to speak so The Commander had decided that all on board the Normandy relax throw their shoes off and party hard at least for a night. They all deserved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she had joined in and sometime down the line must have had too much fun, drink, and food. Ten to one said Kelly was no doubt involved, Shepard knew full well of the younger girl\u2019s crush on her\u2026they didn\u2019t wake up together however so The Commander figured it hadn\u2019t gone that far\u2026yet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled before being snapped back to reality by Chakwas\u2019 distinctive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in your line of work you\u2019ll burn away those pounds like a knife through butter. Just in case watch what you eat for about a day or two however as I said it should be easy for you to get back to your standard weight, Shepard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard thanked the good doctor making her leave just as the door leading to the A.I. core flipped open allowing the individual on the opposite end passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApologies for the interruption Shepard-Commander for we do not understand the reasoning why humans in particular are so emotional about wither or not they are of the correct weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the synthetic being known solely as Legion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you can say it\u2019s more of an organic thing. Not really something that you can grasp so easily, Legion. In ways\u2026it\u2019s just who we are as individuals. It\u2019s \u201ccoded\u201d into us so to speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t sure if he, it, understood so well so instead opted at Chakwas was perhaps a better person to ask such questions. The elder woman shot her something of a false glare. Shepard owed her for this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with the scene before her Shepard at last excused herself afterwards began to make her way toward the elevator.</span></div></div>",

Moments ago it was still a normal night. Suddenly, a huge explosion rocked the vessel. Breaking from sleep, Commander Shepard sat bolt upright, springing out of bed. Rushing the nearby terminal, thoughts flashed through Shepard's mind. The Collectors? No, they'd all died in the explosion at the base. Bartarians? No, they'd never get past Joker. Reapers? Now that was a scary possibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the console, a blue orb, the computer manifestation of EDI flashed into existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Situation Report! What's going on? Are we under attack?\" The commander spoke quickly, not wasting any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Large explosion in the lower decks. Sensors indicate no external hull breaches, however several interior bulkheads are badly damaged. There are no ships in our vicinity. Most likely explanation is that explosion caused internally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! EDI, do you know what's responsible for this? Is Jack at it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no indications of the direct cause of the accident, although I can verify that Subject Zero was asleep in her birth below the deck at the time of the occurrence. The explosion seems to have come from engineering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Tali! What's her status?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My readings indicate that the female quarian's suit has been penetrated and that she has sustained severe damage to her torso and legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get medical crews to her now! Call Chakwas and Mordin. Have them standing by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already done Shepard.\" But the commander didn't hear that last statement. Shepard was already bolting out the door, speeding to the elevator as fast as humanly possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander watched through the thick glass of the Medical Unit windows. Tali had been rushed to the facility immediately, losing a great amount of blood. With her bio-suit in tatters, the young girl had been sealed in, the air promptly scrubbed of all contaminants; only Legion, housed in the AI core remained inside. Chakwas, with the help of EDI, remotely controlled the many instruments in the room, doing her best staunch the bleeding and repair what she could of the damaged organs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feminine hand lay down upon the commander's rough shoulder. \"Shepard, don't act that way. It was a freak accident and you know she wouldn't want to see you like this.\" Shepard turned to face Miranda, the Cerberus Officer and second in command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Miranda, but I feel so helpless right now. Tali's in there dying and there's nothing I can do about it.\" Turning back toward the glass. \u201cWhen I see a problem, I go out to solve it with everything I've got. But here's a situation that I can't affect in any way, and it may cost Tali her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChakwas walked over to the pair, the orange light from her remote uplink on the omni-tool fading away, a tired look on her face. \"Commander, I figure I should update you on the situation. The quarian's in bad shape.\" Wiping sweat from her brow she continued. \"We got her here fast enough that she shouldn't see any serious problems due to exposure, and we've managed to stop the bleeding. The problem is her organs took a beating. We should be able to keep her alive using the machines we've got now, but I'm not sure for how long; they're not meant to mesh with quarian physiology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard's mind raced. Something had to be done. Tali was in there and needed help! But how?....Suddenly, a spark of inspiration hit the desperate commander. Turning to Miranda again, Shepard voiced an idea. \"Miranda, is the Lazarus project unit still functional?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used that to bring me back from the dead. Can't we use that to regrow Tali's organs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard, it just doesn't work like that. That tech wasn't built to interface with a quarian; it was made specifically to rebuild you and only you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's got to be a way! Mordin, get over here.\" Shepard gestured to his Salarian ally. \"Can you think of any way to save Tali?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salarian frowned. \"Hmm. Interesting challenge. Girl dying. Love her, yes? Can see problem. Take look at organ structure.\" he pressed a few buttons on his omni-tool and a display of quarian anatomy popped up. \"Humanoid in design. Similar to human in makeup. Differences mainly in skeletal structure and cellular anatomy. Unfortunately, not directly compatible. Transplant not an option. Flotilla too far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we used the Lazarus project?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda interjected. \"Shepard, I told you it won't work on her! It's made for you alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the scientist's eyes lit up. Muttering to himself, Mordin began to pace back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Direct splicing not possible. Possible modifying Quarian's genetic code? No, to dangerous, would tear cells apart. Modify human code? Interesting. Humans prone to mutation. Possible......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard reached out, grabbing the scientist by the shoulder. \"What!?! Have you thought of something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salarian nodded. \"Possibility. Miranda, project built to rebuild Shepard, correct? It only must rebuild Shepard, but not Shepard.\" The black haired woman looked puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not possible to modify quarian genetic structure. But! Possible to modify human genetic structure. Suggest replacing certain code fragments in sequencing to mimic quarian DNA. Still Shepard's cells, different DNA. Transplant modified organs to Tali. With probable acceptance of modified genome, survival possible. Still, untested. Side effects possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it save her?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordin took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it! EDI, set a course for the Lazarus project base. I want us there in as little time possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue ball blinked up again. \"Immediately Shepard. Notifying Joker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali groaned internally. Her head was pounding. A pulsing white light seemed to be beating from right behind her eyelids, and she felt as if her organs had been ripped out, rearranged, and put back in. She hurt everywhere. \"Keelah....what happened?\" Thinking back to the events prior, she tried to recall what had happened. \"I was in the engine room, checking on our electrical systems and then......what?\" She didn't recall a thing after that. Everything just went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quarian girl struggled to open her eyes. Fluttering open, the world outside was a hazy blur. There was a fuzz crow of people standing above her. Slowly, she began to focus. Standing in front of her in an unfamiliar room were Dr. Chakwas, the black haired Miranda, Yeoman Chambers, Mordin, and, in front of all of them Shepard. He had a worried look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh......Shepard? Where.....where am I? What happened and, ooooooohhhhh, why do I hurt so much.\" Her lover let out a visible sigh of relief as the commander's expression changed from one of near panic to one of absolute euphoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali! You\u2019re awake! Thank God!\" Tali was confused. What was he talking about? Reaching up to scratch the top of her head in confusion, she felt something....odd. Gripping it with her hand, she pulled it forward so she could see. It was long, black, and apparently attached to her head. It was.....hair?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali's mind could not seem to process this piece of information. \"Hair? My hair? MY HAIR!!\" Looking down at herself in shock, the quarian girl realized just how exposed she was. Covered only by a plain medical gown, her purple skin radiated a warm hue. Her raven black hair drift down over her face, contrasting her bright white, glowing eyes. Holding her hands up to her face, she gasped, seeing the exposed fingers for the first time in months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the rising panic within her, Shepard sprang forward, placing a pair of strong hands upon Tali's slender shoulders. Calmly, yet strong, Shepard tried to sooth the panicked Quarian. \"Tali, listen to me. I need you to stay calm. We can explain everything.\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the moniter flatlined, erupting into a dull monotone beep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Chakwas sprang forward, activating several nearby machines. \"She's having a cardiac event.\" With a few button presses a robotic arm swung down in front of the unconcious girl. Injecting something into her arm, the heartbeat monitor responded by giving a steady ping once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor stepped back, wiping sweat from her brow. Turning to the nearby commander and crew, she spoke. \"That was not to be unexpected. The sudden shock of seeing herself outside her biosuit galvanized her new endocrine system. the sudden influx of adrenaline and other stimulants overstimulated her heart, stopping it. Fortunately there will be no permanent damage. And, now that that inital burst is over, all chemical levels should revert to a stable condition.\" Getting a few blank looks from the crew, Chakwas continued. \"Her body essentially did a dry run of it's system. It had to test all the different parts, and now that it has she should be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the commander, \"I would like to keep her here for the night as a precaution against further trouble, but she should be completely fine after all this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. Let me know when she's going to wake up again. In the mean time I've got work to do. Thane, Garrus, your with me. We recently got a distress signal from a ship in the Armstong Cluster. Apparently a Volus vessel was highjacked by Eclipse mercs and we need to get them out of there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard started to walk with his duo to the nearby elevator to the shuttle bay, but Mordin stopped him on the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard, would like a word with you before you go. Been monitoring Tali's vital signs. Interesting data. Results show new viable chemical pathways in hybrid cells. Don't worry, nothing major. Running some tests. Should have results upon your return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the update. Alright crew, let's move!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Originally posted by Indianajones393<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the recovering Quarian slept soundly in her bed, Shepard and his team raced to the aid of the seized Volus frieghter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here's the plan. We go in fast and quiet. Scanners indicate that the majority of the hostiles are centered around the main cargo hold. There are a handful further up where we believe the two Volus are being held with their crew. Garrus will set up a line of fire from a secluded position on the back of the ship. I'll act as the distraction and draw them into his kill box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he fire starts it's likely to draw the majority of the merc forces away from the hostages. Thane, your job is to sneak up to that positins and eliminate anyone remaining.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy that Shepard.\" said Garrus. Thane simply nodded. After Thane prayer, the trio stealthily docked at the aft end of the ship. Thane slipped into a nearby vent, and Garrus lined up his shot as Shepard took up position infront of the largest concentration of hostiles. His radio crackled slightly as Garrus signaled him. \"Ready when you are Commander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later and the whole ordeal was over. Without so much as a hiccup, the plan had worked flawlessly. After the inital detonation of Shepard's incendiary grenade, a nifty trick he had learned from his mercernary cohort Zaeed, Garrus had been able to eliminate most of the mercs with a few quick shots from his Viper. All the remaining mercs were gunned down in the cross fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThane had easily slipped passed the panicing guards, dropping down from a ledge behind the only two remaining members who watched over the prisoners. With a subtle crack, one body fell limp to the floor, neck broken. His partner was quickly followed by a bullet to the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard, on board the shuttle back to the nearby Normandy, thought over the results of the conflict. The two Volus had been quite gracious. Thanking him for their rescue, they offered a fair amount of credits. More important however, was the cargo they were transporting. An experimental omni-tool upgrade, it was supposed to increase the amount of time one could hack a security system before the firewalls rebooted. Shepard would have to have Mordin to take a look at this to see if it was compatible with their systems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Mordin, Shepard wondered if the Salarian had had any luck analyzing the side effects of Tali's new body. He had assured the commander that it was nothing major, but at the same time Shepard was worried. He had almost lost Tali once. If there were complications...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDocking with the Normandy, Shepard exited the cargo bay, heading straight for Mordin's lab. As the sliding door opened infront of him, the salarian looked up from his work. Smiling, he greeted the Commander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard. Congratulations on the success of the mission. Glad you're here. Wanted to talk to you. Been analyzing tissue samples. Mentioned new chemical pathways being formed, yes? Apparently changes more systemic than previously thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuarians usually contained to biosuit due to fledgling immune system. However, upon reconstitution of hybrid cells, reintegration occured on greater scale than anticipated. Fusion between new and old DNA spread through entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis jumpstarted her natual immune system. Thus she can survive outside of suit; modifications made by new DNA spread through whole body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere comes unexpected effects. Quarian body dextro-amino acid based. Fusion with new code opened up new chemical pathway for the absorbtion of nutrients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, upon further inspection, discovered other unforseen result. The nervous system connection between the stomach and the brain in quarian physiology different than in humans. New nervous system not compatible with brain reciever. Howerver, brain still in contact with nervous system. See problem?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard looked at Mordin with a confused look. He understood a little of what the doctor said, but all this medical terminology was almost like a foreign language to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily he was saved by the appearence of Dr. Chakwas. \"Let me try to explain what Mordin's saying.\" she said, aware of the Captain's confusion. \" Tali's original cells were based off of different compounds than those a human is made of. Thus, these cells got food from a different source. However, with the fusion of the two types of cells, both chemical pathways to absorb food still work. So in turn, Tali can process a new type of nutrients than was she previously was able to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, her nervous system was damaged in the explosion. The one we replaced it with is fully functional, but not entirely compatible. Her brain is still able to send out signals to her body, but the opposite is not true. Parts of her body can not send signals back to her brain. This causes problems where the body uses what's called a negative feedback loop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body is a remarkable thing. Most of her should be able to adjust just fine. The only area that will really be affected is her digestive track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen food is eaten, it ends up in the stomach where the food is broken down. When you're full, the stomach messages the brain saying \"Stop\". As long as the brain doesn't recieve that message however, it still thinks your hungry. Despite the fact that she'll still be eating, her brain won't realize it. Understand?\" Shepard nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now bear with me. The brain has what are essentially \"feel good\" horomones it can release to the body. If it thinks that the body isn't getting enough food, it will encourage eating by releasing those horomones when viewing food or eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEssentially what this all means is that not only is Tali's body going to seek food constantly, but it is also going to recieve about double the nutrients that it normally would. She's going to have to watch her food consumption if she wants to maintain her current weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard imagined a heavier Tali. Something about that...intrigued him. She looked so thin and frail without her biosuit on. Perhaps it would be a good thing if she built up her frame a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Commander?\" Chakwas looked at him with a quizzical look. Quickly snapping out of his day dream, her looked over at her. \"This is all well and good, but it's not the reason I came up here. I wanted to let you know she'll be waking soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard gave a sigh of relief. \"Thank you doctor.\" And with that, he followed Chakwas down to the medical bay. </span></div></div>",

Spying the Commander, the light in Tali's eyes seemed to glow a little brighter. \"Shepard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander smiled. \"Welcome back to the world of the living Tali Zorrah vas Normandy.\" He turned back to the nearby crew member. \" How's she doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female attendant chuckled. \" Given all that's occurred, Tali is doing extremely well. All of her systems seem to be in proper order, and all that's left to test is her endocrine system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you I'm fine!\" Tali dismissed the attendant's comments with a wave of her hand. \"Kelah...you almost die and everyone thinks you've gone soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard smiled. \"You seem to be coping well. How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little sore, but nothing major. Kind of like getting hit with a concussive round in the stomach at close range. Apart from that, I feel normal.

The rest of the crew was asleep, except for the night shift personnel. The day had gone by so quickly. It was almost dizzying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she and Shepard walked through the Normandy's hull, the N7 Spectre relayed all of the events that had occurred since the accident. It had been only a day, but it felt like a lifetime ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing out of her suit was like being born again, although certainly less painful. The female engineer was bombarded by the vast array of feelings and smells. Sure she'd spent a brief moment or two outside her containment vessel on her nights with Shepard, but those nights were filled with love and sensuous desires, and even though they were more than worth it she had to risk her body to do so. But this...this was different. She could feel with her hands, hands that had not felt more than the cool machinery of her suit for years on end. She could hear sounds not transmitted through a head piece. She could smell aromas that would have sent her previous self into anaphalactic shock. It was wonderful! She couldn't wait to taste food that didn't have to be thoroughly sanitized and sterilized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefitting Tali with a new wardrobe had not taken too long. There were plenty of spare uniforms in the storage lockers and the cargo bay. She'd still have to wear the suit as armor for tactical excursions, but the helmet would only be needed for vacuums. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking to and fro on the Normandy's various levels, Shepard had taken the time to explain the majority if what happened to Tali. The explosion, rebuilding Tali's body, all of the quarian's questions were answered. Still, hunger pangs sent the couple to the Mess Hall, Shepard curious to just how much the dysfunctional nervous system would affect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two took a seat on opposite sides of the large table in the crew quarters. Chakwas had spied them leaving the elevator, and after relaying a few more test results requested that Tali spend one more night in the Med-Bay. The quarian was visibly disappointed; she had planned the perfect ending to her first day out of freedom, a night with Shepard, but that would have to wait. There was always tomorrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali placed a tray full of food down on the table. Mess Sargent Gardner had prepared a meal a little better than his usual fair specially for her first meal using some of those special ingredients Shepard had bought on the Citadel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard, it just feels so wonderful being out of that suit. I can't thank you enough for saving my life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you. You know I'd do anything to save you Tali.\" Shepard's words made the Quarian's face flush pink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, life has a whole new perspective now.\" She gestured to the world with her arms. \"Everything has new value. I can't wait to experience everything, starting with this.\" Tali gripped a fork and stuck it into the pile of food on her plate, eagerly returning it to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard saw the smile of ecstasy that washed over her face. He was unsure of whether it was the fact that she had never had unprocessed, fresh food before, her remodeled digestive track, or a mixture of both, but it was clear she was in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmmmmm! This is delicious!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you miss.\" Gardener called over from the kitchen. \"It's about time someone appreciated my work!\" he said, glaring at nearby deckhands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory of that meal was still fresh in her mind. She had torn through it with reckless abandon, but yet was able to savor every little bite just the same. It had been wonderful, every bit more delicious than she ever could have imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to have gone by so quickly. She had limited herself to seconds, taking heed of Shepard's warning about her modifications, despite the fact that she felt like she was hungry enough to eat triple what she had.  The taste seemed to linger on her lips, tantilizingly out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her stomach rumble again. The hunger pangs had lasted for the last hour or two, not painful, but certainly there. Glancing at the nearby clock, she could tell it was far enough into the night that most of the crew would be asleep.  Maybe she could sneak over to the kitchen for just a nibble...</span></div></div>",

Opening the food storage locker, Tali decided that it was probably best just to eat a little, just enough to satiate her hunger temporarily. Sifting through its contents, the engineer picked a little of everything. \"Some of this, some of that, some fresh fruit, some vegetables, got to keep it healthy...and a pastry to top it all off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back over to the med bay, the quarian quietly devoured her snack in private. Like a humanoid vacuum cleaner, Tali's hand brought food to her mouth and down her gullet at a rapid pace. Soon the only remaining item was the pastry, the purple girl saving it for dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying down, Tali popped the cream cheese danish in her mouth. The instant it touched her tongue, her taste buds exploded. \"Mmmmmmmmm!\" Tali was in heaven. She didn't know why this food tasted so much better than the rest, but she didn't really care. Allowing the flavor to wash over her mouth again and again, the quarian savored the taste for as long as possible before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of content, the purple girl fell into a peaceful sleep, absentmindedly rubbing her belly as she drifted off into dreamland. As she slept, Tali's brain dreamt exciting, wonderful dreams. And what Tali dreamt of, was food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali, clad only in her undesirables, was on a big, colossal pastry, the same as the one she had eaten earlier, only several thousand times its size. She was sitting on, or rather in, the massive crater in the middle of the pastry where the cream cheese should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her belly let out a loud gurgle as massive hunger pangs struck her. Pure and undeniable, the hunger swept over her entire being, consuming her. Almost zombie like, Tali began tearing chunks of the ground around her, made of that delicious, giant pastry, and shoveling them into her mouth. Handful after handful, mouthful after mouthful, the flaky pastry filled the engineer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, the quarian girl filled out. Her belly, even as it was being packed solid with food, softened. Layers of fat surged across its surface. Almost like rising dough it puffed outward, developing rolls. First two, then three, but still she ate, her massive binge keeping pace with the fat, packing her tight even as she grew. Her legs thickened, losing the toned muscle she spend so long developing. The fattened out, spreading until they touched. Her butt expanded, pushing her slightly higher off the ground. Still Tali kept eating. Her arms puffed up, fat fingers digging into the flaky ground. Her breasts ballooned outward, her bra miraculously maintaining its place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Tali\u2019s unfathomable hunger began to subside. Her arm movements slowed down, eventually stopping. Her eyes, coming back into focus, stared down at her massive frame. Her mouth, first gaping wide open in shock, slowly shifted to a wide smile of satisfaction. Her thick arms grabbed a pair of her many love handles, and watched as the massive plateau of her belly shook like an earthquake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud clap of thunder split the sky. The massive quarian glanced up to see yellow clouds gathering into massive thunderheads. Drops began to fall, directly over the bloated girl\u2019s immobile body. Her initial worry, however, changed to bliss when she tasted the odd droplets. Cream cheese. The delicious substance had ever so disappointingly been missing from the center of the giant dessert. It seemed as if that problem was about to be rectified. Another clap of thunder sounded overhead, and a wall of the filling fell from the sky like a river, directly over Tali. The purple girl merely smiled and opened wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking from her delicious slumber, Tali stretched, letting out a loud yawn. \u201cWhat a weird dream! Keelah, I hope I never get that big! When they said thinking with your stomach, they really meant it.\u201d Still, she had seen Sheppard looking at her as she ate, glancing down at her belly ever so often. Maybe putting on a few pounds wasn\u2019t so bad. She was rather boney, like all quarians after all. Tali's belly rumbled once again, getting a reassuring pat from its host. \"Wow, hungry all ready? I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Sheppard wasn't lying when he said about an increased appetite. But how come I feel so....\"</span></div></div>",

Still she didn't feel comfortable just eating here. She stealthily snuck to the refrigerator and opened it. Before her was a feast of human foods that she had never eaten before. She knew she was only supposed to have a nibble, but she should try everything once right? She loaded her arms with food and stashed it in the Main Gun. She even made two more trips. When all the food was assembled she wasted no time stuffing her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelicious burgers, pies, cakes, pastries, and other fattening delicacies passed her lips. She ate a 3 pound burger in five massive bites. Her cheeks swelled with pastries and their tasty fillings. Her thick fingers slid into onion rings and she ate them all off with haste. She was reckless. About twenty minutes in she stopped realizing she only ate one third of the food. Should she be full? Maybe human food was different. She shrugged and decided to eat until she was full. A thick creamy Salarian food passed her lips and once again she was lost in the food. After 30 minutes the food was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali was amazed, how had she done that? She looked at herself and gave a little gasp. Food was all over her and she was a mess. Her belly stuck proudly in front of her. She poked it and it was firm. She looked pregnant. She looked from side to side, as if she wondered if there was anyone she missed in the small gunnery room. Actually, there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Illusive Man watched from the small bug. The Quarian's eating habits intrigued him, he already knew why, but not the effects. This could prove useful against the Quarians in the coming days as a type of leverage. He watched her examine herself and prod her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is fascinating,\" he said taking a drink of his whiskey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as she was clearly a little panicked now and was attempting to clean up after herself. As she ran to the kitchen he thought she was hyper-ventilating. She then looked around the still empty cafeteria, and snuck to the women's restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Illusive Man touched a few buttons and Miranda's face appeared on a terminal to his left. \"Sir?\" Miranda asked not at all looking tired despite the hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Operative Lawson, I have new orders for you,\" said the Illusive Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, what do you need?\" Lawson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Investigate the Quarian, you no doubt know of her, err.. condition. I want all the data you can get. Tell me her rate of gain, anything you think is useful,\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" said Miranda, \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Get started, I believe she is in the women's restroom currently,\" He said and no goodbyes. He just cut the link and watched the engineer throw her clothes into a garbage hatch to be destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the Normandy Miranda considered her options. Should she be stealthy or just walk in. What to do, what to do?</span></div></div>",

Liara was, however, able to help Shepard track down two other individuals to help her with her mission, The assasin Thane and the Justicar Samara. Shepard had even brought her closer to tracking down the Shadow Broker, by exposing the plot of her secretary, Nyxeris. And while Liara was glad that she was one step closer towards her goal, Nyxeris had served a helpful purpose. Since Liara would often spend almost the entire day working at her computer, she would have Nyxeris go out and pick up food for her to eat, and without the time to find another asisstant, Liara simply bought large ammounts of non-parishable food at a time and dumped it all next to her desk. The last few days had been very exiting and stressful for her as she chased new information all across the extranet, and she found herself making these food runs more and more often as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Damnit, empty...\" Liara thought again, as she tossed a candy bar wraper behind her back, landing in an impressive pile of empty food cans and wrappers that had been slowly towering up behind her for at least two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh, I guess I'll need to go get some more, it'll only take me a moment I suppose\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara stood up suddenly, her chair knocking over the pile of refuse behind her, she took no notice to the now day old garbage strewn all over her once pristine office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Liara a moment to notice that her red and white dress felt rather tight around the waist, looking down, she clearly saw her once flat belly now pushing outwards, forming what seemed to be the earlist stage of a muffin top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now i'll have to go clothes shopping later too...\" Liara frowned at the thought of a further distraction, but there was no time to set up an exercise routine into her schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards a resturant for some take out, Liara noticed a small crowd of Salarian workers gathered around a news screen, when she got closer, she saw that a Citadel news reporter, Emily Wong, was giving a report that Commander Shepard, the first Human Spectre, had supposedly stopped the human abductions and possibly stopped another Reaper threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Shepard saves the galaxy again, and I can't even track down one person...\" Liara sullenly thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter picking up the take out, which looked a lot like a large basket of dumplings, Liara returned to her office and decided to...</span></div></div>",

She then slowly sat down, placed her dinner on the left side of her desk and pressed the voice command key on her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call Commander Jane Shepard\". Liara said in a half-whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acknowledged\". The computer automatically said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAboard the Normandy SR-2, Commander Shepard was alone in her private room reviewing the battle against the Collectors in her head. The Illusive Man, the leader of Cerberus and Shepard's as-of-now former boss, was not happy with her decision to destroy the Collectors' base, which he had wanted for himself. And while miraculously not one member of Shepard's team had died during the attack, Shepard had no clue when or where the Reapers might attack again. She was running out of plausable ideas to prepare or plan an offensive against her ancient enemies. Some of the more agressive crew members, namely Jack, were becoming restless, and Shepard knew that she was going to need some kind of mission to distract them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Commander...\" Shepard's pilot, Joker said over the ship's intercom. \"You have a call coming in from Liara, do you want me to patch it through\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\". Shepard answered, suddenly focusing back on reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard walked over to the private computer in her room, where she quickly opened up the video call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard\". Liara's picture on the screen said, \"I heard that your mission was a success\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it did\". Shepard answered back with a smile \"How goes the hunt for the Shadow Broaker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so well...\" Liara answered back. \"I seems that all of my best leads this week have hit a dead end\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Is there any way that I could help?\" Shepard inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something\" Liara replied. \"I have one plausable lead left, but I can't do anything myself. I was calling to ask if you might be able to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it doing this helps you, then of course I'll do my part.\" Shepard quickly followed-up, \"I should be able to reach Illium by tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Shepard\". Liara answered finally letting loose of her serious tone and cracking the first smile Shepard had seen from her fellow, blue crew member since their first mission together against Saren. \" I will be able to give you more information once you arrive,\" Liara concluded. With the final words uttered, Liara's picture disapeared from Shepard's screen in a short flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard took a moment to ponder the call. Liara's face seemed to be slightly rounder than it had been the last time she had seen her, and Shepard couldn't help but think that there was a slight improvement to Liara's overall figure. Or maybe Liara's new found heft was all in her head...she knew she'd find out for sure tomorrow on Illium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should bring her a gift.\" Shepard thought, as she discreetly put in an order for a obscenely large box of exotic choclates to be picked up at the Nos Astra Port. She figured she could swing by quickly on arrival at Illium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Liara awoke to find that she had once again fallen alseep in her office chair. It could have been her imagination but it seemed to Liara that the chair was getting softer. \"I guess I've finally manage to break this chair in,\" she quietly said to herself. She glanced at the clock and noticed that she still had a few hours before she would be expecting Shepard, and knew that she would need something to pass the time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Originally posted by Claptrap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Shepard would be dropping by shortly, Liara decided that the first thing she should do is to get rid of all of the trash that had been slowly building up in her office. after a second of concentrating, Liara lifted the trash pile with a biotic field and neatly dumped it down her office's grabage disposal. After quickly tossing a bottle she missed down the shoot as well, she realized that her softend midsection was yet again calling out for more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since i won't get any more work done until Shepard arrives, I might as well eat breakfast at a resturant for once...\" Liara thought to herself, as she got up from her chair and started walking towards her closet to pick out some new clothes to wear. As she dug through her closet, Liara was shocked when she realized that almost all of her outfits were extremely tight around her waist and butt, and the only thing that still fit her well was the old scientist's outfit she had worn during her adventures with Shepard on the Normandy, and even that streched slightly to accommodate Liara's new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could wear this, Shepard does seem to like it.\" Liara thought as she examined herself in the closet's mirror. She blushed when she noticed that the outfit really showed off her new belly and gently poked her index finger into the small layer of fat, finding the sensasion strangly appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Shepard won't notice this little problem.\" Liara referred to her growing waistline, but quickly shook the thought and continued to put on her boots. Now dressed, she bravely stepped out of the door looking for a place to grab a quick meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant that Liara was heading to, Vos Cafe Villa, was relatively new, but she had already heard from several friends and associates that it had some of the best meals avialable in Nos Astra. She was actually really eager to find an excuse to eat there for awhile, and now seemed like the perfect time to give the restaurant a go. The restaurant had a typical Illium feel, lots of bright lights and walls made out of a bluish metal that complimented Asari complexions, it even had a few gambling stations lined up along one side of the dining area. Liara was seated immediately and handed a menu, from which she ordered a plate of various Asari and Human made pastries. After a brief five minute wait, the pastries arrived on a beautifully made silver platter, all decoratively arranged and placed about the platter. Liara was amazed to see that the food not only looked teriffic, and delicious, but the entire appearance was top notch, something she wouldn't have expected from an Illium restaurant, let alone one that was so affordable. She delicately picked up one of the pastries, admiring it's craft, and gently popped it in her mouth, instantaneously realizing why Vos Cafe Villa was receiving all those glowing reviews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are amazing!\" Liara thought to herself. \"No wonder this restaurant is the talk of all Illium...I'd eat here everyday if I had the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara quickly shoved the remaining pastries into her mouth, only stopping momentarily to catch her breath every few seconds. After she had finished eating all of the pastries, she strangly still felt hungery and decided to call out to a near by Asari waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, do you think I could possibly get another order of pastries?\" Liara asked, looking rather embarrased, feeling ashamed for making a pig out of herself in such a public place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing\" the waitress replied, looking rather chubby herself. \"Many of our customers put in orders for second meals. You meal should be ready shortly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the waitress' rather strange response, Liara eagerly awaited her next meal, and when it arrived, she began digging into the pastries faster than she had during the first meal. About half way through however, Liara began to slow down, as her stomach was nearing it's peak capacity. However, the fullness was only a minor setback as the blue Asari was determined to finish off the entire plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, Liara, now bloated and stuffed to the brim, finished by licking some of the cream off her face...no doubt a remnant from her abnormally huge feast. After paying the bill, she began to head back to her office, a trip she was finding much more difficult than it had been earlier this morning, with each stop sloshing her bloated tummy from one side to the next. If she moved too fast she felt as though her wobbling belly might capsize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Liara groaned, accidentally letting out a large belch. She began cursing herself as she laboriously climbed the stairs towards her door. Once inside, she slowly hobbled over to her chair and sat down with a low thud. She slowly began rubbing her belly to ease the pain, and began thinking about why exactly she felt compelled to eat to meals in the first place. A few moments later, her thoughts and soothing (or so she thought) belly rub were interrupted by the sound of her door sliding open, followed by someone she wasn't quite expecting yet.</span></div></div>",

Price was never a problem for the Commander, however, as her various adventures always offered her many different ways to make money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you intend to bribe information broaker T'soni for her aid?\" Legion asked Shepard inquizically as his single geth optic zoomed in on the large box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No.\" Shepard answered sounding suprised. \"It's a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still a little much, don't you think?\" Garrus asked while scanning the immediate area for any possible threats and taking note of any area that might be easily defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her Turian friend's question, Shepard preceeded into Nos Astra's financial district, walking by several various alien species arguing over stock prices on her way towards Liara's office. Once there, Shepard asked her two crew members to remain outside and prevent anyone else from entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Garrus replied, knowing that Shepard had wanted to see Liara alone ever since they had defeated the collectors several weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard opened the door and walked into Liara's office, and was shocked by what she saw. Liara had been sitting with her chair leaning against the room's back wall, so Shepard was able to get a clear image of Liara's new figure. Her belly, still bloated from her large breakfast, was now extending outward about half the distance her boobs were, which looked to be about a quarter size bigger than she had last seen them. Liara's larger size was clearly straining her outfit's stretchy material, and Shepard couldn't help but feel that she rather liked her lover's new appearence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard! I, uh...\" Liara stammered, clearly embarrased about the current situation and her current appearence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard rushed forward, and helped Liara regain her balance, who was just about to fall out of her chair out of pure embarrasment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" Liara said in a half whisper, standing up to give shepard a hug for helping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard met her lover's embrace, finding Liara's new softness to be quite mesmerizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again Shepard. Forgive me, but i seem to have let myself go as of late.\" Liara said in a rather hushed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I think you look rather nice\" Shepard answered back, giving off a warm smile in the process, before handing Liara the large gift she had bought for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shepard, thank you, those look delicious\" Liara smiled sheepishly, before inviting Shepard to sit so that they might discuss Liara's proposed mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I have information that the Shadow Broaker has a high ranking informant stationed on the Citadel.\" Liara told Shepard, somewhat still embarrased about what had happened earlier. \"I was hoping that you would be willing to go there and see if you could learn any interesting information from him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it will help you, I will be happy to do it\" Shepard answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing.\" Liara quickly said. \" I would like to accompany you on this mission, as there is not much I can currently do from my office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Liara, you are always welcome on my ship\" the Commander answered with another smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara smiled back, and the two came together for a short kiss, before they both walked out of the room together and met up with Legion and Garrus at the base of the stairs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.4;\">The chubby blue alien walked home, big bag of dumplings in hand and plopped down onto her desk chair. She\u2019d been thinking about Shepard the whole walk home, her once commander turned ally in the fight against the Shadow Broker had saved the universe again. As she was thinking she mindlessly took a dumpling from the bag and put it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly moaning, Liara grabbed another, and another, soon all thoughts of Shepard and the Shadow Broker far from her mind as the need to eat the delicious, greasy food consumed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*A Few Moments Later*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBWAAAAAAAAAARP\u201d Liara let out a huge belch, followed by a small groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, so many dumplings.\u201d She moaned, her hands rubbing her swollen belly through her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grocery bag her dumplings had come in was now on the floor along with the rest of the mess the Asari had made over the past few weeks, while the dumplings it had held now rested within her large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, \u2018urp\u2019 worth it.\u201d Liara moaned, continuing to burp and rub her belly. \u201cThey tasted \u2018urp\u2019 so delicious. I didn\u2019t know \u2018urp\u2019 human food could \u2018urp\u2019 be so nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to remember where exactly she\u2019d got the dumplings from, a new human restaurant that\u2019d opened earlier this week. She was definitely going back to get more later, they were cheap, delicious and there where so many more items on the menu to try. After she\u2019d done some more research on the Shadow Broker. Or maybe she\u2019d have a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, a nap does sound \u2018urp\u2019 really good.\u201d Liara mused to herself, a tiredness settling over her as she digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, a nap would be lovely. The Shadow Broker would be there when she woke up, and maybe she could give Shepard a call and ask her if she would be willing to come help her now that the Collectors where dealt with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering to her feet and groaning from the effort of hefting her stuffed belly up with her, Liara walked to her bedroom. Once there she took the now tight dress off, leaving her in plain black underwear, although they didn\u2019t fit as well as they had a few weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara wasn\u2019t the trim and fit scientist and soldier ready for battle at any time that she\u2019d once been. Weeks of ordering in and bulk-buying food to save time so she could chase down the Shadow Broker had made quite an impression on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tight, angular Asari face had softened slightly, leaving her looking unusually chubby for the ancient race. Her breasts too, once perky now overflowed her bra slightly looking softer and starting to sag after gaining a cup size. Her once toned abs where gone, instead a small pot-belly was starting to form around her waist, pushing over the waistband of her panties. Lastly, but certainly not least, her ass and thighs, once nothing to look at, had obviously taken the brunt of her gain giving the once skinny Asari a pear shape more fitting the genetically enhanced Miranda. Her ass looked swollen, sticking out behind her and making her panties give her a wedgy, while her thighs where now jiggly and covered in a small layer of fat that had completely erased any sign of a thigh gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall the past few weeks of gluttony had turned Liara from a toned soldier to a flabby scientist who\u2019d likely struggle in any combat. And while Liara was aware of these changes in her body she hadn\u2019t given it much thought, it was simply another consequence for her dedication to finding the Shadow Broker. She reasoned that it wasn\u2019t like she had time to work out or go on a diet right now, not when she was so close to finding and defeating her rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another burp, Liara staggered over to her bed and collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I so sleepy? She mused as her hands continued to rub her belly. Must be the greasy human food, I\u2019m not used to it. Oh well, after a quick nap I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be ready to continue my hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Liara fell to sleep and her body continued to digest the delicious dumplings, a giant shadowed figure smiled at a glowing screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter had become the hunted.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Shepard made the impossible possible\u2026many times over as she had heard the assassin Thane Krios mentioned once before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to think that Miranda Lawson actually considered herself the second in power after Shepard was downright laughable if only because of how absurd the statement was. The Turian yes, maybe even the Quarian to a lesser degree, but \u201cThe Cheerleader\u201d hah hell no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat bitch was just that and while Shepard had settled their near violent dispute several weeks ago Jack would no way admit to considering Miranda a close personal friend. Some of the others of the crew yeah maybe\u2026so long as they didn\u2019t piss her off but not Lawson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also despised how whenever she would tag along with Shepard to more public-focused planets some men (as well as some women) would stare at Miranda for minutes on end. Some of those perverts wouldn\u2019t even try to hide it. Jack knew all too well what they were scoping out\u2026those twin inflated beach balls Lawson called a backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled for a second somehow controlling herself from ripping a hole in bottom portion of the engine room. Shepard wasn\u2019t as violent as her but was known to have willingly head-butted a Krogan for insulting Grunt knowing that she\u2019d probably toss Jack into Grunt\u2019s pod for a bit of literal cooling off. So she decided not to risk it or waste Shepard\u2019s time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still the distaste for Miranda still lingered inside her. If only there was a way to ruin little miss genetically-made perfect. Recalling the bitch\u2019s ass Jack smiled confidentially of course the answer had been so simple and right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake the rest of Miranda match her big booty. Those same people that couldn\u2019t take their eyes off her would be disgusted by her flab-filled rolls. Combat-wise she\u2019d be so damn slow and useless her position as second-in-command would be thrown out the window in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perfect but first Jack had to find a way to make such a thought a reality.</span></div></div>",
