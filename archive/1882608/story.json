He has the power to control shadows to the point of becoming one. He uses a double bladed sword that can come apart to become duel swords. It is called the Twin Serpent sword.( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.spirithalloween.com/images/spirit/products/interactivezoom/processed/01069137.interactive.a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.spirithalloween.com/images/sp...</a>)-that is it together and this is it apart-( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.spirithalloween.com/images/spirit/products/interactivezoom/processed/01069137.interactive.b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.spirithalloween.com/images/sp...</a>) He is also a slight shape-shifter. Thanks to this power he has 4 sets of dragon wings almost like Drago's. He also has a tail like Drago's. When not using his wings the top pair drapes over Draco's shoulders and attach at the center of the chest and the rest fall pointing down like a cape. He can also transform into a black wolf with red eyes, a large black python, a black dragon and an Anthro version Volf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for Draco's pets:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Moses</b>- a white wolf with blue eyes and metallic angel wings that shoot feathers like bullets with pinpoint accuracy. He is kind and talkative, but when he's mad he is quiet and mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Shadow</b>- a black Wolf anthro with a heavy build and golden eyes. Unlike Moses he prefers to rip things apart with his teethe and claws, but they make a good team. He is quiet and respectful, but in battle he is mean and ruthless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Viper</b>- he is a 50' long black mamba. He is a master of stealth and he uses this to his advantage by sneaking up on people and biting them then leaving. He is kind and quiet. But make him mad he will bite you and you don't want that trust me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pythor</b>- a 200' Basilisk. Unlike viper he prefers a head-on approach so he can literally crush his enemy's. He is mean and destructive but they also make a good team. Trust me you don't want to be on his bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Eragor</b>- a 30\" tall black dragon with red tipped scales and a arrow shaped spike on the tip of his tail. He is a kind and noble creature that is very smart. He is not like most dragons because he can breath black fire. He uses his fire, teeth, claws and tail to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Volf</b>- he is a snake, wolf, and dragon hybrid. It has the body, legs, and head of a wolf, the wings, tail and forelegs( which he can use as hands) of a dragon, and the fangs and under belly of a snake. His canines are larger than usual and stick out of the mouth a little. The next notable feature of his body is a row of spikes that runs down his spine from the base of the neck to the edge of his tail spike. He can also unhinge his jaws if the wants to use his fangs. He can also breath fire like a dragon. He is extremely smart and clever, plus noble and kind, but is deadly in battle. He goes everywhere with Draco no matter what happens( talk about loyalty).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for Draco's girlfriend Juniper a.k.a. June. She is 5\"7' with raven black hair, piercing ice-blue eyes, a great body, beautiful face, ghostly white skin and a pair of demon wings on her back. But don't let that fool you she brings new meaning to \"looks can kill\" being an elf/demoness hybrid she is beautiful and deadly. She is kind, compassionate, and caring. She is also very good with a bow ( not as good as Draco, he can pin a fly to a tree a mile away with out killing it). If you get on her bad side she will be the meanest person you will ever meet.</span></div></div>",

He was sitting in the shadows near the entrance of the court yard and watched me train and I was in the center of the court yard surrounded be hundreds of shadow dummies (dummies made out of shadows duh) about to try a move I have been working on called \"Black Destruction\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go.\" I said as I closed my eyes to charged my energy. When I opened my eyes when I was ready they were glowing blood red. I then jump high up into the air and collect all my energy into a ball above my right palm, and finally I aim and unleash a blast of pure death and destruction straight at the dummies, destroying them all and turning them to ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh that was more powerful then I thought...\" I said looking at Volf. \"Any comments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he did was grin showing all his sharp teeth and clapped his claws together. \"I'm impressed\" he finally said in that confident growly voice of his \"that was even more effective than I thought. You could save that as a surprise for Luke during...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did somebody say my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both looked up surprised, only to see a gold and black lucario with four sets of angel wings hovering over the training grounds. He also had two mum chucks attached to his thighs and a folded demon wind shrunken on his left forearm blades pointing up towards his shoulder and center where his spike should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just you Luke and I was about to throw one of my knives at you too.\" I said after identifying the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!!! Don't do that man, I could've killed you!!!\" Volf said angrily which is rare for him, the only time he'll get mad is when he's fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I couldn't resist! It's too fun scarring you guys. But I'll try to stop\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask why?\" I asked as I an eyebrow in suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VOLF SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME!!!\" Luke yelled as he pointed at Volf, who was staring at him angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahaha, that's funny. The almighty lord of light frightened by Volf, HA!\" I said as I walked over and sat next to Volf, then scratched him behind his ear. \"Good boy.\" I whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he did in response was growl happily and nuzzle his head into my neck and whispered \"I love you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled and hugged him around his neck enjoying the feel of his soft black fur and gray scales \"I love you too bud.\" Then let him go and kissed him on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Luke had landed next to us but out of Volf's range.\"So what do you want do Draco? A quick sparring match or do you want go get some lunch?\" Luke said happily after seeing your little display of affection for each other.</span></div></div>",

Want me to get the guys and meet you in the dinning room?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, me and Luke will get everyone else. We'll see you in the dinning room after placing our orders, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, see you in a bit.\" He said before spreading his wings and flying off to get my other companions, where ever they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god he's gone.\" Luke said as he seemed to relax when Volf left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really does terrify you doesn't he?\" I said putting an arm around him as comfort. \"It's not like he's going to hurt you or anything you know that, he loves you like a brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" he said \"but dude I didn't sleep for a week when I saw him rip apart that group of knights a month ago. I mean did you really have to make him so viscous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A: You cut people to pieces almost every day with your mum-chucks.\"I said getting a side weighs glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's different. I kill to protect the empire. HE kills for the fun of it.\" Said Luke looking down at the ground. He was never proud of killing them, even if he tries to hide it behind boasting about his skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And B: have you ever heard of a bad guy without a viscous fighter?\" I asked turning my head to him and he shook his.\"Besides he's only like that when he's fighting,and so am I, but you aren't scared of me. Am I right?\" I finished before putting my other arm around him and trapped the angel in a gentle embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, your right thanks Draco.\" He said as a little smile creeps across his muzzle and returned the hug. \"But he still creeps me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that. \"Dude, he creeps everyone out. Even Zorro admitted that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which\" he said lifting his head from my chest to look me in the eye. \"Shouldn't we go round everyone up for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh yeah. I'll get the demons, you get the angles?\" I said remembering what we were supposed to be doing.\"Thank god Brom gave us these communicators / armory's or we would be screwed.\" I said looking at my communicator on my left wrist. (it looked like a regular watch with a gold trim) but when I pressed a extra button on the side, the clock-face lit up and a holographic screen came up above it. \"Call Flame, Drago, Naga, Shout, and Leo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;VOICE CONFIRMED, ONE MOMENT DRACO.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting about a minute it said &lt;CONNECTION ACQUIRED&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everyone it's Draco, If Your Asleep Wake Up, If Not Get Your Ass To The Dinning Room It's Lunch Time!!!\" I yelled into the screen and out of their speakers. Moments later came their reply. \"COMING!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one way of doing it.\" Luke said to me after I closed my com. and he had just done the same, but in a less loud way.(Just for future reference everyone's com. is different Luke's is an earpiece in his right ear. When he activates it the com. transforms into something like a scouter from \"Dragon Ball Z\".) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you can't argue with the results.\" I say in my defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True...we should probably get going if we want anything to eat for lunch.\" Luke said before laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right but unless they want the wrath of both The Lord of Shadows and The Lord of Light, not to mention my guys and your tiger and dragon.\" I said very matter-of-factually. \"But one question, do you want to fly or walk to lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, tough question.\"He said putting his left paw on his muzzle and his right paw under his left elbow in his signature pondering pose. \"I think we should.....\"</span></div></div>",

K let's go.\" I said before jumping into the air and started heading towards lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch me if you can!!!\" I yelled behind me at Luke, who was still on the ground admiring my flying form witch seemed to snap him out of his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait for me!\" He said jumping in the air after me. \"Get back here or so help me I will end you!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you try it little man!\" I yelled joyfully. We do this all the time, first we would offer a flight one of us would fly ahead and the other would go after the first and would always end with a blade at the neck and us laughing our asses off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your soooo dead now!\" Luke yelled after me increasing his speed considerably <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled and took to a dive flying right past him and pulling up just before hitting the ground and flew off towards the dining room. Luke on the other hand never stopped ascending into the sky even when I sped past him, he just kept going. Once he was high enough he stopped, turned and found me speeding towards lunch. He smiled started gliding in my direction gradually increasing speed with every passing second until he was like a falcon after its prey. \"I got you now!!!\" He said just before impact. But the thing is it never happened. When he came in contact I burst into nothing and to save himself from breaking something he landed hands first on the ground and pushed off into a flip, landing on his feet. \"What the he...\" was all he could say before he felt a cold prick on the back of his neck. He stiffened and slowly turned his head to see the spear like end of my tail at the nape of his neck and me arms crossed, starring at him with red demonic eyes and a devilish smile on my face. \"How- what- a... How the hell did you get there!\" He screamed in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, it's really quite easy. When I dived past you and was about to hit the ground I created a clone of myself to pull up and fly towards lunch while I turned into a shadow and waited for the right moment to strike. Which came faster than I thought- by the way your speed has greatly increased anyway- when you were trying to figure out what happened, I came out of the shadows behind you and you know the rest.\" I explained after pulling my tail away from his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I always forget how clever you are when it comes to battle.\" Luke said completely dumbfounded. The look on his face was just so priceless I couldn't help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he gave me a weird look I said \"Sorry, sorry the look on your face was too funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What did I look like?\" He asked and I tried to replicate the look and I must have been close because next thing I know he was on his ass laughing like his life depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right!!! Anyway we should go we're going to be late.\" I said holding out a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah your right.\" He said grabbing my hand while I helped him up then spread his wings again and elevating in the air slightly. \"Come let's go, I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead the way.\" I said following his lead and headed towards the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill they make it there without any surprises?</span></div></div>",

I pet volf on the head and turned to the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moses, it's been awhile. Where were you the past few days?\" I asked as I scratched him behind the ears a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*mrrrrr* Viper and I had to take care of a few things is all.\" He said leaning into my scratching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was it this time?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one special, just a government offical from another kingdom, no one you need to worry about\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.

Long time no ssssee.\" He siad wrapping around my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell you to stop calling me master?\" I said giving him a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell me assss many timessss assss you like, but I will alwayssss call you masssster.\" He said as he got comfortable and took a nap on my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Me and Luke were on the way to lunch with the others.  We were a good few thousand feet above the city- because we chose to take the scenic route to the other side of our castle- flying wing-tip to wing-tip with each other and talking about random things from our friends to battle strategies. (For future reference I'm the king of a fairly large empire and my capital is located at the base of a mountain range to the north making a natural wall from assault on that front. From the base of the mountain I built my large castle with a wall, gate and moat separating it from the rest of the city but the gate is always open except in war raids on the city.At the edge of the castle wall I built a wall around my city so the only entrance is the front gate in the south and down the main road of the city, a forest path in the west or in from a harbor entrance in the east. The city itself is in a circular pattern around a central square and broken into four sections by the main roads from the gates. The top left is the residential district where all the citizens live. The top right is the barracks where my guards and the elite members of my army live- like generals ,officers and very skilled fighters such as my elite battle unit The Pack the best fighters in my army. The lower right section is the market where you can find what ever you would need or want from weapons to food. Last but not least is the lower left corner of the city the festival area with multiple large gardens and a cemetery closest to the wall, there is a very large paved area that is used as an area for party or festivals. Outside the wall to the south are the fields where the city grows its food. To the east is a harbor that connects to the ocean where all the traders and merchants deliver and buy their goods. Finally to the west is a large forest that stretches for miles along the mountain range. At the center of the city there are statues of me and the others in a circle facing out in all directions in full battle gear with weapons out ready to attack at any moment.)Then out of pure instinct I grabbed something that was flying right at me. When I looked at it I found it was an arrow and I stopped it literally inches from my neck. Upon figuring out what it was I tracked where it came from to see a person on a roof right below me jumping from roof to roof on city buildings heading toward the wall of the city is blocking entrance from the forest. I identified the man as an assassin from an enemy army the Cults. Now the idea that an assassin would even think about entering my city pisses me off and seeing one jumping from roof to roof in my city just through me over the edge! I stopped short, allowing Luke to fly past while I stared at the assassin with rage filled eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Luke few past he stopped,turned and asked why I stopped. Then he noticed the arrow in my hand and the look in my eye, he could tell I was pissed off for some reason. When he asked what was wrong and I pointed at the assassin making his way toward the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draco it's just an assassin let it go.\" He said trying to calm me done without any luck because it only made me angrier as he could see shadows start to curl off me body and my eyes were turning into red dragon eyes surrounded by black. Plus I was starting a low angry growl from the back of my throat. Not to mention that the arrow in my hand had been engulfed in black flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!! THESE ASSHOLES THINK THEY CAN COME INTO MY CITY AND PUT MY PEOPLE IN DANGER!!! I WILL RIP THEM ALL TO SHREDS AND DAMN THE CONSCIENCES!!!\" I yelled with all my might now completely taken over by rage. I was about to charge the assassin when a wall of light blocked my path. I looked over at Luke with rage filled eyes. \"Luke... TAKE DOWN THIS SHIELD BEFORE I TAKE IT DOWN FOR YOU!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... you have lost yourself in rage. I'm not letting you leave until you CALM DOWN!!!\" He yelled flying in front of me with his mum chucks out and wings shining. Now at this point my anger and rage was starting to make me flicker in and out of my true form (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i590.photobucket.com/albums/ss347/Capiorcorpus_Archleone/Possiblereleaseform.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i590.photobucket.com/albums/ss347...</a> copy and paste it in the URL bar) which is incredibly dangerous for anyone standing in my way i.e Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE!!! THEN I'LL JUST GO THROUGH YOU!!!\" I said. After saying that I had enough sense not to attack him because I didn't want to hurt him even in my enraged state so I turned myself into a cloud of smoke and flew right through Luke and around his wall only to reform on the other side and fly at full speed after the assassin who hearing me shout turned saw what was happening and sped away at top speed fearing for his life-which he should be-he was just about to reach the wall and enter the forest when he heard me roar in pure blood-lust so he sped up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I saw the assassin enter the forest I ranked up my speed to full power and turned into a blur of black. \"YOUR NOT GETTING AWAY THAT EASILY YOU MAGGOT!!! GET BACK HERE AND FACE YOUR DOOM LIKE A MAN!!! I yelled after him. Little did I know that Luke was right on my tail trying to stop me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DRACO CALM DOWN ONE ASSASSIN DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL!!!\" He yelled after me trying to catch up with me. The part that really surprised him is he's the fastest member of our little family and he's struggling to catch up to me! Just when he thought he was going to catch me, I got an extra burst of speed and rocketed into the forest after the assassin. He followed a few seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Luke catch Draco or does something stop him from doing so?</span></div></div>",

I spotted the assassin jumping from tree branch to tree branch with practiced ease. Using my  knowledge of this forest and all its obstacles I know that he was heading to my favorite clearing here, a fairly large one full of wild flowers and a lone willow tree in the center. (Guess you could call it a personal retreat.) Unfortunately Luke was still on my tail so I have to find out a way to stop him. At this point I calmed down enough to think straight so I was running tons of scenarios through my head of how to stop him and catch the assassin. \"Got it!\" I said after thinking for a few seconds. 'If I make a clone of myself to hold him back long enough to get the assassin and interrogate him, he'll be to busy to stop me!!!' I smiled to myself and did just that. \"This will be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that!!!\" Luke yelled still trying to get in front me even his powers were useless at stopping me because I just blasts right through his walls and I broke all of his restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what I mean!!!\" I yelled creating a clone with just enough power to stop Luke and all my skills with a blade to hold him off. The clone stopped, turned unsheathed his huge sword and attacked with a downward diagonal slash, which Luke quickly blocked with his own blades. \"Hold him off for me bud I some business to take care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure.\" The clone growled in response, breaking away from Luke and striking again. \"Have fun Damian!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will good luck\" I said locating the assassin he seemed to have stopped to see what was going on. He seemed slightly shocked at what he saw. Upon locking eyes with him I know he was scared so to make it worse I gave him a devilish grin showing off all my razor sharp teeth. HeheheheheHAHAHAHAAAA!!!!! Your mine now!!!\" I said rushing towards him. This absolutely terrified him so ran even faster than before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you like to continue with Damian or his clone? (Oh the suspense in the air, you could cut it with a knife or in Draco's case a sword!)</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are Draco a 16 year old teen with amazing powers, a beautiful family, and the best friends that anyone could have.( Even if they are a little different.) Draco has 12 friends that are almost as powerful as him. When I said they were different I meant they aren't even the same species. He also has 6 pets (but they prefer to be called companions) that go with him everywhere, unless he tells them not to and they can all talk. Draco is Neutral in his alignment.<br>\r\nHis friends are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Luke</b>- a Shiny Lucario with 4 sets of angel wings. He has the power to control light and uses duel bladed numchucks in battle. He is Draco's closest friend, most powerful ally and rival. Not to mention his opposite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Flame</b>- a Flamedramon with 3 sets of bat wings. He has the power to control or create ice and he uses duel bladed nightsticks in battle. He is as cold as the ice he controls with a little fun in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Garu</b>- a Weregarurumon with 3 sets of angel wings and the power to control fire. He uses a double bladed spear in battle. He's a bit of a hot head but is great to be with. He is Flames rival, but they love each other(not literally! Or do they?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Drago</b>- a Pyrus Lunino Dragonoid( look it up in Google if you don't know what he looks like). He has the power to control lightning and he uses a pair of falcon talons in battle.(look up the final form of the falcon-talons in ninja gaiden 2, claws only.) He is really energetic and can be dangerous if angered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Zorro</b>- a zoroark with 2 sets of angel wings and the power to control earth (that includes metal). He uses a scythe in battle. He's tough and hard to break like the elements he controls. He is Drago's rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Naga</b>- he is a bakugan I created. He looks a lot like Naga from bakugan except his arms are longer the wing a attached to his back instead of his arms and the spike on his back is less prominent. He has the power to control life (anything alive he can control). He uses his powers in battle. He's cheerful and polite but he is a ruthless killer in battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Brom</b>- he is a robotic dragon (if you played saints row the third you know what it looks like, wings included ) he has the power to control technology. He uses a sword in battle. He may be a robot but he's great company with a great personality. He is Naga's rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Shout</b>- a Shoutmon that is Taller than usual with a pair of dragon wings. He still uses his mic. in battle. He has the power to control sound. He's loud but can be quiet when he wants to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ren</b>- she is a renamon with a pair of angel wings. She has the power to control wind. She uses her body as a weapon and she is a master of close-quarters combat. She is beautiful and kind to people she considers family. She is shout's rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Leo</b>- he is a Darkus Leonidas with the power to control space. He uses a battle axe to fight. He is a little gloomy but overall he's a great guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ryu</b>- he is a permanently transformed Werewolf with the power to control time. He uses a chain scythe in battle. He is Leo's rival. He is a prankster and a person that will play with your mind if you're his enemy, if not he is just a loveable smart-ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: <br>\r\n1. No changing their powers<br>\r\n2. Killing is aloud but no killing the main characters the includes the ones above and Draco's pets. They can be injured but nothing else.<br>\r\n3. Draco's powers will be explained in the start of the story.<br>\r\n4. Go Crazy anything is aloud that doesn't go against what is above.<br>\r\n( I know it's lengthy but I had to but I had to explain them sorry!!!!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
