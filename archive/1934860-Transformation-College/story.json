Emily didnt know it, but she had just had her first encounter with Sabrina, the college Alpha bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter an hour of getting lost in the huge campus, walking in on three different classes and being amazed by each of them. she finally found her dorm. she signed in and got her room key and a leaflet about the rules of the dorm. lugging her suitcase up the stairs she finally got into her room, it looked like she was going to be sharing with someone, one side of the room was already decorated with posters, clothes lying on one of the beds and a overpacked wardrobe stood open, dozens of pairs of shoes, skirts and dresses filled it. the bare side of the room was clearly hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe unpacked, placing her laptop on the bedside table, putting her suitcase worth of clothes into her own closet and sat on her new bed still in a slight state of shock from being told shes a witch. she pulled out the big thick magical book she had been given to study from and began flicking through the spells. it seemed magic could do almost anything, and she had seen the classes she had walked in on with students turned into mice for talking and a teacher levitating so she knew the book wasn't a joke with its contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe stopped on a chapter about transformation spells. they seemed pretty amazing, able to change objects or even people into other things. she was so enthralled with her reading that she didn't hear her door being unlocked until she realised someone was standing over her. she slowly looked up from her book...</span></div></div>",

YOU WERE GUM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\na split second later your thoughts were interrupted as her teeth came crashing down on you, pulping you as you mixed with her hot saliva. her tongue moved you around her mouth as she crushed you more and more into a glob of wet minty gum. you saw flashes of light as her mouth was open but with the teeth crashing down over and over grinding your rubbery body and stretching it out into all sorts of shapes, you were too distracted to really see what was going on outside her mouth. her chomping was so loud, from this angle any words of hers were just booming noise to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina chuckled to herself as she chewed her new \"room-mate\" glancing down at the page you had been on. \"ooh look, you were actually reading up on this spell before i changed you. hehe i hope you managed to read the counter charm little gumgirl. it would really suck if your such a beginner that you cant escape this\" she didn't know if you could hear her in your current state, nor did she really care. she had the room back to herself. she threw your stuff back in your suitcase and stuffed it at the back of her wardrobe out of sight. leaving no sign you had arrived at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nenjoying your taste she sat on her bed reading a magazine, she twisted you about idly with her tongue and pressed you against her lips before blowing hard. you stretched out of her mouth, getting a glimpse of the room as you expanded like a balloon. you saw your bed was bare and your things were gone. you really wished you had signed in or at least let someone know you were here before this evil room-mate got a hold of you. your ears popped as so did you and she pulled you back into her mouth like any other piece of gum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nas enchanted gum your flavor lasted alot longer than normal gum, even after she had been chewing you for an hour you still had flavor. her phone buzzed. Sabrina put down her magazine as she looked at the text message \"hey Sabs. we are down in the lunch hall.\" with a smile she tossed her magazine onto your bed and slipped her heels back on. she strolled down the hallway and out towards the lunch hall. she blew another bubble with you, giving you a glimpse of campus as you passed other witches chatting and practicing spells. you tried to call for help but in your current form you had no mouth. POP, back in you went to the warm, wet prison of her mouth, her chomping too distracting to think straight. you were trying your hardest to remember the counter spell you had read, but her chomping kept interupting your train of thought. not that you could cast a reversal from inside her mouth, the spell wouldn't work unless there was room to reform safely, and inside her mouth was not a place to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou caught glimpses of other girls faces in what looked like a lunch hall chatting and laughing between chomps and realized she must have gone to meet friends. suddenly the chomping finally stops as you hear her booming voice make sounds again. her fingers suddenly reached in for you as her tongue pushed you forwards. she plucked you from her mouth. maybe she was letting you go? no such luck unfortunatly as her hand reached under the table and she squished your wet glob like form into the underside of the table, nestled amongst other pieces of gum, now dried from their long time under the table. you saw her hand vanish and realized she had just discarded you like a piece of gum...which you were...but this wasn't fair! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nall you could do was stare at her legs, watching them shift as she chatted to her friends, you saw their legs too of course but you didn't care about that. you needed to remember the reversal charm or you were looking at a life under the table...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a long and restless night sleep, you finally woke up. Thankfully, Sabrina was still sleeping soundly. Good. This was all part of your plan. You had wanted to wake up before her, so that you could get your sweet sweet revenge before she woke up and transformed you into some new nightmare. Without even opening you book, you crossed silently to her bedside. You knew exactly what you wanted to transform her into. You were going to change Sabrina into a bra. How \"fitting\" a punishment! You would then wear her, forcing her to go through being worn by her most hated person, for a day or even a week! Who knew how long you would keep her like that? You closed your eyes and chanted the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you opened your eyes, Sabrina wasn't there anymore. In place of the bratty bully was a lacey black bra, your perfect size. You grinned and laughed evilly. Now she would know how it feels to be transformed and bullied. Your victory was interrupted by something you never expected to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son of a bitch!\" A shrill cry rang out in your mind. \"I will fucking kill you!\" It was Sabrina's voice! But where was it coming from? You glanced down at the bra on the bed. \"Yes you idiot! It's me!\" You gasped. How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" You echoed your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ! Do you know anything? I've mastered the telepathy spell, which you obviously haven't.\" That explained it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So no one else can hear you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you shit head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You started it!\" She yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You started it!\" You counter. A pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Just change me back, or you WILL be sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I?\" You wonder, once again enjoying your moment of victory. \"What will you do about it? Nothing. Anyways, I'm going to eat breakfast now! Bye!\" You turned towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mother fu-\" You were already gone, and her voice cut off as you shut the door. Apparently her telepathy didn't go very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was in one of her worst moods ever. That bitch had just revenged her in her sleep. Not cool. Secretly though, Sabrina was scared. She hated being transformed. One time her older sister had pranced her, turning her into a slice of cake and pretending to eat her. Back then she was innocent and nice, so this terrified her. It only got worse when her older sister left the room to take a call, and her younger sister entered and saw the cake. She began eating it, tearing chunks from Sabrina's body, causing her massive pain. She would have died if Sabrina hadn't remembered the reversal speed at the last second and saved herself. Even then she needed copious amounts of medical and spell healing to get better. Her older sister is the reason why she behaves like a bully to this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Sabrina heard the jingle of keys and the dorm room door begin to hope, she felt so relived. Maybe she should start being nicer toward Emily? But it wasn't Emily who entered the room. It was Sabrina's friend Kari!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari was glad she was friends with Sabrina. Not only did it keep her off her bad side, but Sabrina often gave her cool stuff too! Like today, she had promised Kari that she could borrow her pretty black bra for the party that night. She even let Kari have the spare key to her dorm! She was so nice! Kari entered the room, jamming to the music that was blaring through her headphones, blocking any other noise out. She saw a black bra on Sabrina's bed, and assuming it was hers, picked it up and began to leave. She heard some weird vocals in the background of the song she was listening to, but she silenced that with an anti-telepathy spell. Truth be told, she didn't expect it to work, but it did! She smiled, and left the room, locking it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina hadn't stood a chance. Seeing it was Kari, and remembering her promise to her, she screamed her head off, but the music drowned out any noise. Sabrina was easily picked up, and then for some reason, silenced with a anti-telepathy spell! She couldn't counter that, and had no idea how long it would last! She was now completely mute! She could do nothing as her unaware friend carried her away from safety and back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoyed your breakfast more than usual. Probably because you were excited about your revenge. Ideas were filling your mind with what to do with the bra form of Sabrina. There were so many possibilities! You practically shoved the food down your throat, and ran back to your room. You opened the door, stepped inside...and almost screamed. Sabrina was gone! You searched frantically all over the room, but found no trace! What now?</span></div></div>",

Ah I see it must've escape from the cage as she did a teleportion spell on it and teleported into the cage saldy zaylee has been waiting for the teacher to teach the animal reverse spell but no luck and when she was spotted she was happy thinking that she'll be turned back instead they thought she was one of the class pets once she was inside the cage she noticed it was made out of plastic and the outside voices sounded distorted so even if they went over the spell she wouldn't be able to hear or make sence of it which means some of these mouses in here must also be students try calling out but only squeaks came out. After the class ended may stood up and quickly grab the panties she was sitting on and shove it her pocket  giving Emily no chance of seeing the girl as may was leaving she saw a lost and found box it was full of objects and clothing no doubt that some where transform students she threw the girl she transform into a Yoyo earlier into the box she had no use for her no more  and was thinking of doing the same to the panties snice Noone will be none the wiser and the box gets empty each week so it'll be a perfect crime</span></div></div>",

One moment you were peacefully sitting in class taking notes...and the next you found yourself now lying on the floor, looking up at the ceiling, unable to move at all. You struggled, but to no avail. What had just happened? Did someone transform you? This question was answered, as the troublemaker began to move towards you. You saw her creep up, and screamed, but you had no mouth. What were you? Thankfully, you were saved though, but the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abbigail! This is the last warning!\" Miss Marsh called from her desk. The troublemaker, apparently named Abbigail, sunk back into her seat, leaving you on the floor. Miss Marsh stood up, and walked to the fron of her desk. The whole class was looking at Abbi. \"What have I told you about transforming other students? This is unacceptable!\" She began heading towards the back of the class. Abbigail looked terrified, but she suddenly smiled an evil smiled directly at you. You were confused, until you saw a shadow, and the massive high heel of Miss Marsh stepped down directly onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like a thousand pounds was crushing you, and you cried out in agony. Whatever object you were begin to crack, but Miss Marsh seemed not to notice. She turned the other three students back into their normal selves, and then scolded Abbi for a few minutes. You were kept under Miss Marsh's intense pressure for this entire time. Finally, she stomped in exasperation, and you whole body seems to crack, as her heel almost split you in two. A large crack erupted from your body, and you were screaming with pain mentally. Finally, Miss Marsh noticed what was under her foot, and she bent down and picked it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your necklace Abbigail?\" Miss Marsh asked sternly. So that's what you were. A necklace. Great. Just great. Maybe she would turn you back. Unfortunately, Abbi saw an opportunity, and struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it's mine. Can I have it back please?\" She innocently replied, giving you a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No young ma'am. I am confiscating this necklace until further notice.\" She grasped you tighter, and walked back to her desk. This couldn't be happening! You thought you were saved! Miss Marsh deposited you on her desk, and class continued like normal. After about twenty minutes of sitting and doing nothing, class ended, and everyone left. Abbi tried to get you back, but Miss Marsh decided to keep you longer. She worked for another thirty minutes, until finally getting ready to leave.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After searching through your room for about five minutes, you realized that Sabrina was truly not there. Where could see have possibly gone though? You walked out into the hallway, but it was deserted, save one girl leaning against the wall. On a whim, you decided to ask her if she had seen anybody go into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That room over there?\" The girl said when you asked her. \"Sure. Kari did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kari? Wo is Kari?\" You asked frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sabrina's one friend. Went right in, grabbed a black bra, and left, probably back to her room. Who knows?\" You gasped when she said black bra. She must have taken Sabrina on accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way did she go?\" The girl pointed to the room at the end of the hallway. You thanked her and ran off to Kari's room. This was not the way things were supposed to go! Now Sabrina would hate you for the rest of your life. What had you done? You only hoped that it wasn't too late. Quickly, you came to the end of the hallway, and saw the door marked \"Kari\" on the outside. You slowly turned the handle, and to your surprise, it opened up! You stepped cautiously inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was a near complete mess. Clothes and trash and books and papers lay strewn about the room. You swore under your breath, and began digging through the trash girl's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina couldn't believe this was happening to her. Turned into a bra, and then unknowingly stolen by one of her friends, most likely to never be human again. It surprised her even more then, when she saw you walk int the room! You had come to save her! She was so overcome with happiness! All thoughts of getting even with you fled her mind. She saw your confusion though, and realized you would have a hard time finding her. She couldn't talk to you either, since Kari had silenced her, so she simply prayed you would find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of a nearly fifteen minute search through Kari's room, you had drastically lowered your options. Unfortunately, you were left with three near identical black bras in the end. You groaned in frustration. Each one looked exactly the same! To make matters worse, Sabrina was talking to you anymore! Was she angry at you? She certainly wasn't making this any easier on you. You felt each bra, picking them up one by one multiple times, shaking them and rubbing them. There was just no way to tell which one was Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's hope had slowly died as the minutes went by. It was clear that you had no idea which one she was. She felt you picking her up, shaking her, and rubbing her and everything. But then she would be sat down, and you would try another one. She could also see your frustration. Sabrina tried to fight the anti-telepathy spell and reach you, but it just wasn't possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. You had to make a choice. It was now or never. You couldn't transform each one to see if it was Sabrina or not, because you didn't know the spell, and your book was back in your room. If you took more than one, Kari was bound to notice.To make matters worse, you heard someone walking down the hallway, and you assumed it was Kari. You had to make a decision now! You scooped up one of the black bras, tucked it under your shirt, and ran out of the room. Thankfully, Kari was tying her shoe, and hadn't noticed you at all. You ran all the way back to your room, and set the bra on your bed. You grabbed your spell book and flipped to the undo bra transformation spell, and cast it. You find out that...</span></div></div>",

But I think it so long time ago they there is no point to restore her. Only test she know now it is probably only urine and other wastes. I think her family and friends forgot about her. Even if no, this will be very hard for them to know that her daughter was a toilet for such long time. I think I would be able to look on my child the same way if I know she was eating shit and drinking piss. It's very hard for family. I think you should use her, or I should say it, as normal and enjoy heating. <br>\r\n-thanks for information. I didn't think about this. I'm surprised that my toilet can be our was a person. <br>\r\n- don't think about it as a person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been broken. Your mother know she was sitting on a person transfer into toilet, piss into mouth and then inform about it Sabrina. She say that Sabrina should use her as ordinary toilet. And the worst part was that she recommends not to transfer her nav to human and even as mother she wouldn't like to have daughter that wasa toilet. So she prefer that her child will be forever a toilet and eat and drink those all horrible things that lands into toilet then have a daughter that was eating this for some time? It was the end, no target to fight, to  live if your mother prefer you to stay as toilet. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Witches and Mad scientists. Unknown to Emily, her father was the head mad scientist; their king, if you will. Sabrina guessed that he had kept Emily sheltered as she was the first born and technically the first heir to the throne. The only issue was that there had not been a witch ruling over mad scientists for over five hundred years. Sabrina figured that Emily's father sent her to a witch college in hopes of her not making it to the crowning ceremony, making her little brother the heir to the throne instead by default. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly what do you know about my family?\" Standing up, Emily demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina smiled, wondering how she could use her discovery to its fullest....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm your dorm mate!\" She grinned even wider. Now you understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well nice to meet you Raina!\" You looked her over, in case you ever needed to remember what she looked like. She was slightly taller than you, with long brown hair and brown eyes. Her skin was fairly tan and smooth looking, and was also lean and tonned. Her practically perfect body was topped off by C cup breasts and a nice ass. She certainly seemed like a popular girl. Before you could ask what year she was in, she answered for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my first year, so I'm glad I have a dorm buddy who is as nice as you look to be. I was really waiting for you to show up. Can you teach me any magic? I'm pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I'm new myself.\" You admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well that's fine! We will practice together! Yay!\" She jumped up and down. You couldn't help but laugh. Raina was certainly energetic. \"Anyways...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily! I like that name! It's pretty! What was I saying?\" You made a mental note of Raina being forgetful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were telling me something or other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Thanks! Anyway, I have been working on a plan ever since I got here. Apparently, there is this really mean girl at this school...\" Your mind went to the blonde from earlier. \"...so I've been making a plan to prank her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Want to help me Emily?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I just got here and...\" Raina drops to her knees, and gives you the cutest puppy dog eyes you have ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please???????\" She pleads. You give in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Raina screams and hugs you. For nearly three minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raina. The plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What plan?\" You give her a look. \"Oh right. Sorry. Here goes!\" She explains the plan to you, and it's a pretty good one. Basically, it involves one of you being transformed into a bra, and then snuck into Sabrina's room. Eventually, Sabrina will have to wear you, and when she does, the other person will notice, and turn you back to normal. This will cause the transformed person to burst away from Sabrina's chest, leaving Sabrina completely naked from the waist up for the whole school to see. Aside from some minor points, the plan seems pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good plan Raina! I just have one question.\" Raina begins to get out a book, and flip some pages. \"Who has to be the bra?\" Raina starts to mutter some strange words. \"Raina? What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to, everything is white. Quickly, you realize you are staring up at your ceiling. What happened? You try to move, but to no avail. You can't even wiggle an inch. Suddenly, a giant face enters your view. It's Raina! She's huge. She giggles and then her hands descend onto you. You scream, but no noise comes out. Her warm hands wrap around you, and carry you across your room. Why are you small enough to be held by her? Your questions are answered, when Raina holds you in front of a mirror, and all you see is a cute looking pink bra in her hands. Oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did volunteer Emily, so I hope you're not mad at me.\" Raina's voice booms out. You aren't really, just surprised. \"Give me a second to get ready though.\" She tosses you onto her bed ontop of a pile of her clothes, shaking your world crazily. She must not know what it's like to be a bra. After five minutes of hair brushing and makeup-ing, Raina turns to the bed. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

You just get thrown out onto the ground... and before you know it, you're back to being a girl.  Naked, you curl up, seeing Sabrina sitting on her bed, another girl beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky.  It turned out that the powers-that-be managed to save her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...save whom?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me,\" says the other girl.  Sabrina nods and says, \"meet Melissa.  My shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of the time,\" says Melissa.  \"Or at least I used to be.  I might prefer something safer now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Panties?\" Sabrina asks with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shrugs.  \"Sure, why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina needs no further words, but simply raises a hand above Melissa's head.  In an instant Melissa's skin turns to fabric, and her body swiftly withers.  In seconds nothing is there but a second pair of panties lying in Melissa's clothes, pink and covered in sequins.  Sabrina fishes it out.  \"Cute, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.  Sabrina keeps talking.  \"Anyway, you can go ahead and go.  You've missed a lot of classes; you should probably think about taking the rest of the semester off.  I've got a hangar waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh - if you're worried about the nudity, don't be.  Pretty much all of us are going to have to make a naked dash sooner or later.  Kind of a job hazard.  Part of the reason your prank was so lousy.\"  Her voice deepens.  \"Certainly not worth risking a young witch's very existence.\"  Her voice goes back to normal.  \"Speaking of which... catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina tosses a small figurine to you.  Catching it on instinct, you look down and see a shrunken stone Raina, forever caught in that same laugh she let out when she burst through Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you say, and walk out naked into the hall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the longest time you had completely lost track of time, between the days cast into the darkness of a drawer or laying buried into tantamount amount of dirty clothes in an hamper. It had been all but impossible to know when you'd pass a few hours there, a couple of days or two weeks. At first you'd tried to keep track of the sun filtering through anything, tried to keep track of what classes the monster that had transformed you was following, as if you had any hope of figuring her schedule. When it had proven impossible to really keep any decent track of it, you had eventually given up, like for a lot of other things. And yet today you knew exactly what time it was, it seemed impossible to you that you'd already been stuck into this cursed form for so long and yet, you could hear all those congratulations, all the laughter of families talking to one another. Graduation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the beginning, you thought that the cold shoulder that Ronnie was giving you was part of some prank, you didn't think anyone could ever be so cold and so cruel as to really make their roommate into panties and leave them like this for any long period of times. But eventually, the long trips in the hamper, the repeated wearing of your form and the uncaring way she'd treated you, never speaking to you, had forced you to accept the cruel reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought it impossible that the school would not notice your absence, would not investigate nor do anything about it. You pictured the industrial washer scanning the contents for any misplaced witches, patrols guards checking the student body. Even eventual dorm room check outs. But you had gone through the wash unimpeded, feeling the cold soapy water drenching you to the core, mercilessly tumbling you about and then being put through the infernal heat cycle of the dryer that made your fibers more dry then the Sahara. No patrols had stopped Ronnie on her way anywhere while wearing you and no search had been made of the room either. If the college knew what happened to you, the passing days and weeks made sure to assure you that like your tormentor had said, they did not care to fix the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought you could be clever and listen in class for a way out of your predicament, that Ronnie wearing you around school would be ultimately her undoing. But no matter how much you tried to concentrate, no matter how much you strained yourself to hear all of the classes' instructions, your level of hearing seemed to be more local and there was always the rustle of her clothes, her breathing and heartbeat, the sensation of her butt as she shifted herself comfortable in her seat. Always the feeling of being twisted on yourself as she crossed her legs and leant back, smothered to her labial lips as her meaty thighs blocked the sound forward off to you. It had proven all but impossible to catch more then very little from the girls around your owner and barely anything more then the odd word of from the teacher at the front. You had tried your hardest, but eventually you had to give up the endeavour as whatever you'd heard in weeks was too varied and in too little quantity to even know how to untie Ronnie's shoes while she wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought that maybe you could work out the magic she'd used on you on your own, that maybe with a long enough time spent concentrating, you could wield those special powers that had awaken in you before this whole debacle and free yourself on your own. But while you definitively felt like you still had somewhat access to them at first, your grip on them rapidly became tenuous at best. Was your concentration more and more sloppy and slippy, were your powers drying or was Ronnie sealing them away or stealing more and more of them entirely or were you losing contact with them from lacking the proper living witch form. You couldn't tell. But the result was the same, a long time ago you had found yourself unable to feel the spark of magic in you no longer, you had felt depressed for weeks. And yet, there was nothing you could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, at first you had been persuaded that your parents so proud of you, so proud of having a witch on their side of the family too, would come for you. Maybe not in the first week or two, but you had thought that with no news from you in a couple of weeks, eventually they would inquire what had happened. If the college knew and told them, you were sure that there would be outrage and they would demand you to be freed. They would go to aunt Cassie or your grand aunt Aura. And surely those two would have the connections needed to make the college figure head sway and do something about the situation. There was no way that your family would abandon you to such a fate. And yet as the weeks passed, the trips through the washers and countless days spent waiting in the drawer with other similar pair of panties. You never heard from them, no one came for you, no one changed your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad the college no knowledge of what had happened, surely it wasn't so. Had you over estimated the resources and connection of your family in the world of magic. Were they complete little players that couldn't change anything, that couldn't shake and stir the pot of bureaucracy. Was Ronnie and her family that influential or the direction that little caring about the witches they educated. No answers were coming for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you are, taut as the day you had been transformed, wrapped over the butt and pussy of your owner. If over these two years, she had transformed anyone else, you had no idea of it, no one had talked to you in all that time. If your family had tried to get you back, you did not know about it. And as families and friends mingled to celebrate the end of college, here you remained under graduation robes, silent and lonely, with no one from your family to celebrate with. Still very much refusing to give up your past and your knowledge that you were human once. </span></div></div>",

But seeing as she had kept you this way even past going to school, this scenario seemed more and more unlikely to you and you couldn't really help but feel that if you ever had the chance of being turned back, you wouldn't recognize the world you'd find yourself in and everyone you knew and loved would be gone. A very far-fetched, convoluted and downright terrible way of time travelling. Waking up in the far flung future. Still, even that you tried to hang on to as a possibilities versus remaining panties all the way to the day you'd fray and break down to nothingness as your threads aged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first when Ronnie had finished school, she had gone around a lot in various travels across the country, the only real clue to that for you being all the vibrations that you had felt on days she'd worn you, days you weren't stuck in a travel bag or another. It had taken a good while for her to settle down, but eventually she made it back to her hometown, which you would have to admit to having no clue exactly in which state it was. She didn't really stay back at her parents place for very long and had gotten herself a place of her own to settle in and in the same times, a job. While you had wished with every fibers of your being that she would start working out somewhere with magic being a relative constant, in the vain hope that one day someone with the right sets of magical talents and moral fiber would notice you and help you out. She herself had settled for some sort of receptionist work or another in what was probably one of the most mundane workplace of her region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she settled into her life in the work force, slowly buying this and that for her place and even rarely using her powers at all. You'd been confronted with your life becoming quite sedate and repetitive, slowly but surely everything became a routine to you. Being worn for a day at her work, spending most of that time being sat on, legs smothering most if not all of the talking that was going around you and what you could listen to being mostly uninteresting, specially without context. Spending the following days all bundled up inside of her hamper, and only very rarely occasionally on the floor instead. Going through the wash cycle, being folded away and going through more days in a drawer amongst all her panties, bras, socks, thighs and other underthings. To try and avoid going completely insane with the boredom, you slowly started to implement a form of mental routine for yourself. Any given day, you would spend time singing each song you knew, recount children stories, talk to yourself about your life story and details everything you could remember about each of your friends and your family. Then you'd try and relax with a bit of zen meditation to try and not think about the fact you were made of cotton thread and stitches. And then you'd more or less do it all over again when you'd be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn't exactly an exact science either, specially without the awareness of time itself. You couldn't really know if that took you an hour or a day or two. Still, you figured that as long as you kept yourself thinking, your mind would stay sharp and your human side wouldn't fade, no matter what your owner had said on that infamous day you were transformed into this form. And of course, it was hard to keep a complete self discipline on recounting all those details each time, every day, all the time. So once in a while, you would skip out on going all out, you would skip some of your least favourite stories, would focus only on your favourite songs and allow yourself to summarize things up about yourself, your family and friends. You'd always admonish yourself afterwards for skipping, as it was your only and most important mission as a human person turned undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour window of opportunities into your owner's life being relatively small, you didn't really pay much mind to her life stories. It didn't really matter that much to you if she were having a good day or a bad one, if work was a breeze or a chore. Once in a while, she'd wear you going out with her friends but when she did, you'd be less focused on them and what the news was, as they tended to go dance and the over bearing music and the way your owner's hips and butt would sway and move would make it all but impossible to follow up anyway. You didn't much pay attention either to her love life, when she'd get a boyfriend for a while, you ended up in the midst of embarrassing things a couple of times, but like always it would end up with you crumpled up on the floor and eventually to be thrown in the hamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days slowly turned to weeks, which in turn became months and eventually years passed by. There was but one thing that had started to change for you, one thing you were no where near ready to even admit to yourself. Of course you would never admit such feelings to yourself and specially not such feeling for the cruel woman that had done this to you. In reality you had begun to look forward to the days you were being worn now, and it wasn't so much because it was airing you out and allow you to hear others and feel closer to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never had a single thoughts for other girls when you were human, very content with being interested in the other sex and happy with what little experience you did have with boyfriends. But spending years of your existence as panties, being worn by your mistress every other day of the month, your entire being wrapped, shaped and molded by her pelvis had started to take its toll on you. Even more so as she aged and started to become more than a teen, but well and truly a woman. A woman you were intimately aware of every inches of her sex as your front was taut and snug to her labial lips, intimately aware of her body as she moved, the way her muscles moved and clenched, the cocking of her hips straining your waistband and the ever so subtle ways her labia would twitch and almost bite into your taut front when excited. How her supple rear would stretch your material, specially when she bent down or sat on top of you, making you feel all of her soft flesh and all of her weight. Intimately aware of her natural scents and not so natural ones, as you had time to get used to her brand of soap, laundry detergent and even her favourite perfume. The way not only her form was fulfilling you when she was wearing you, but how immersed you became with her scents, her sweat, how her juices could soak down to your very threads if her boyfriend would tease her with you still on. How comforting the warmth of her living body completely filling you as she went about her day made you feel, more and more comfortable and enamored with being worn by your woman, your owner.</span></div></div>",
