If you remember the series very carefully, there are some people of the Sohma household you do NOT wish to introduce yourself to any time soon for very good reason. Specifically, the one who's the MOST cursed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Tohru's kindhearted, gentle, trustworthy, and everything you'd like in a best friend. Not to mention kinda cute... It wouldnt be a bad idea spending a little more time with a decent girl instead of hanging out with the not-so-decent guys of the household... (specifically, the one who's the MOST cursed!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... can we save the tour for a little later?\" you suggested to Tohru, \"I'm a little more interested in knowing a bit more about you.\" You even grinned as you said that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, either youre too small to see the grin or she couldnt detect the hidden meaning in that last sentence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Chris!\" she said, still keeping that carefree smile on her face, \"but I'm not really all that interesting. Uh... I'm 16, I'm a highschool student, housekeeper and cook of the Sohma family who were kind enough to let me stay with them after my er.... my 'castle' was destroyed in a horrible landslide...\" You notice her look a little uneasy when she said that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you already know what she's refering to, to pretended to play dumb and rather skip a long confusing story about her life being inside a fictional cartoon!<br>\r\n\"Castle?\" you tilted your head feigning curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohru kinda blushed a little, \"Uh... y...yeah. It uh... wasnt a big castle, but... it was still cozy. Anyways, I've been living there since my mom died.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, dont worry about it,\" Tohru assures you, still keeping that carefree smile on her face, \"anyway Chris, now that I told you about myself, how about telling me about yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to turn down a humongous yet rather cute lady, you introduce yourself. \"Well, I'm 18, college student from the States, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The States?\" the big blue pupils of her big blue eyes eyed you with a hint of intrigue, \"As in the United States?\"<br>\r\n\"Um... yes,\" you answered as you scratched the back of your head, \"also-\"<br>\r\n\"Isnt that a whole ocean away from here?\" Tohru interrupted you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just scratch the back of your head again and answer, \"Uh... yes Tohru.\" The way her gigantic head seemed to lean even closer to you, she seemed even more interested than ever. Not that you dont mind the attention, but the way the big dark shadow casted over you seemed a little scary.<br>\r\n\"How did you manage to end up all the way in Japan?\" she asked, even more curios than ever, \"especially at your size! I mean you couldve been swallowed by a goldfish before you could ever get across the ocean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA question you just did not know the answer to. All you remember is who you are. You dont even remember the last day BEFORE you woke up in your condition stuck in the middle of a world that shouldnt be real, yet for some reason is. It seems far too real to be a dream... maybe you've been caught in a terrible car accident and in a deep coma!  Whatever the reason, it just seems so weird that it involves 'Fruits Basket'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right! I'm sorry!\" just then, Tohru interrupted your train of thought and blushed, \"I forgot! YOU forgot! ...Heh. Hey, that's funny. I forgot that you forgot!\" A simple girl, but still lovable!<br>\r\nYou laugh a little along with her, but only because you were kinda mesmerized by those big beautiful blue eyes of hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in a quick flash, her carefree smile quickly changes to a much more serious look as she looked down at you with her hand to her chin. \"Hmm... this doesnt seem like it's cause by the Chinese Zodiac curse like the Sohma family.\" That's when you could almost see the lightbulb over her head! \"...Maybe it's another type of Zodiac curse! Quick! Tell me! What's your sign?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Gemini,\" you answer.<br>\r\n\"Gemini?\" the way those big blue eyes shined as she looked down at you told you the simple girl was on to something, \"isnt that the one with the twins? Then that must mean another you wandering around somewhere!\"<br>\r\n\"Another me?\" your head was REALLY itching!<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" she nodded, \"maybe the other you might know what's been going on with you and your curse. Perhaps we should start looking for him.\" Oh dear. Just what exactly is she up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock!* \"Excuse me, Tohru. Could I speak with you for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you overheard a knock on the door followed by someone's voice call out Tohru's name. You recognized that voice too!

On the bed was a young girl, who was waking up from her sleep. She sat up on the side of her bed as she rubbed the sand from her eyes. She got up and stretched before she walked into the bathroom. She brushed her teeth and took a shower. After coming out, she, with a towel on, walks into her closet and puts on her <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.sailorenergy.net/ArtworkJAFanarts/SMARTFashionHotaru.jpg\">casual clothing</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://www.sailorenergy.net/ArtworkJAFanarts/SMARTFashionHotaru.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>. Looked like she was going somewhere. It would be best to try to get her attention before she leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!!!\" You shouted at the top of your lungs. The girl manage to hear the cry as she looked around the room. \"Down Here!!!\" She looked down and saw you waving your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world?\" She gasp as her eyes widen in shock and surprise to see a human smaller than a mouse. The girl put a hand on as you climbed into it. \"Are you okay?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" You replied.<br>\r\n\"How did you get so small?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know. The only thing I knew is who I am...\"<br>\r\n\"My name is Hotaru Tomoe, 12-years-old. What's yours?\" When you hear that name, you realized that your in the Sailor Moon world. And your being held by your most favorite of all the Senshi.<br>\r\n\"M-my name is Christopher, but my friends call me 'Chris' for short. I'm also 12 years of age.\"<br>\r\n\"Christopher, that's a nice name.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks. My mother named me. Where am I?\"<br>\r\n\"You're in my room, obviously.\" Hotaru giggled.<br>\r\n\"Not what I mean.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is the Tomoe Mansion.\"<br>\r\n\"Mansion? Are you rich?\"<br>\r\n\"My dad's a scientist.\"<br>\r\n\"What about your, mother?\"<br>\r\n\"She died when I was still young.\"<br>\r\n\"I see... sorry to hear that...\"<br>\r\n\"What about your parents?\"<br>\r\n\"My father is a baker and my mother is the housekeeper. Wait, what country am I in?\"<br>\r\n\"Japan.\"<br>\r\n\"JAPAN!!!\" You stood up in shock. \"How can I understand you? I'm not from here and don't speak Japanese.\"<br>\r\n\"Where are you from then?\"<br>\r\n\"USA.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's many of oceans away from here. What do you do?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm actually a mage.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean you can do magic tricks?\"<br>\r\n\"No, not those fake imitations you see. Real magic.\" You wave over the palm of your hand. \"Like this.\" A fireball appeared.<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Hotaru was amazed at the fireball floating in your hand. She looks up at the clock. \"Oh no! I'm suppose to meet up with Chibi-Usa!\"<br>\r\n\"Your friend?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. Do you wanna come along with me or stay here?\"</span></div></div>",

You look up towards the sky to see that they belong to a giant towering over you.<br>\r\nA girl. A greyish teenage girl with cropped shoulder length hair and four ponytails, two long and two short wearing a Chinese blue leotard with white trimmings and a pair of blue thigh-length boots. Little to no emotion was shown on her face as her blue dilated pupils were staring into your soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. This woman... looks familiar. Wasnt she from Cardcaptor Sakura? YES! That's it! She's a physical form of one of the Clow Cards. The Fight! ....The Fight?<br>\r\nNot exactly a good choice to be spotted by.

Still didnt work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither this dream is really stubborn or this aint a dream. Either way, perhaps you better not take any chances.<br>\r\n\"Um...uh...h.....h....Hi!\" you look up to her and greet her hoping to show her you mean no harm. She doesnt respond. Fight continues to look at you with a blank stare and slight intrigue in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try it again. \"Um....Konnichiwa?\" Doesnt really do much better. The stare in Fight's eyes is still giving you the creeps.<br>\r\nJust then, Fight lifted her foot and took one step closer to you.<br>\r\nOut of instinct, you jumped back, fearing she's trying to step on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she wasnt.

She was created for the sole purpose of fighting and youre about the size of a bug to her. You couldnt bear to imagine what would happen if it was the Nothing that spotted you! You failed to hide your sweating and shivering. 'Please....' you think to yourself, 'PLEASE let this be a bad dream!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a moment of staring, a huge finger came down toward your head. You wanted to jump out of the way, but you were too scared to budge. You closed your eyes and waited for that finger to squish you into tiny human paste....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...She patted your head! A little rough, but it didnt hurt. Fight was actually being careful enough not to hurt you! Could she actually be concerned for your well being?! A simple card come to life?! Is that even possible?<br>\r\nSo far it looks that way. She DID save your life from that evil mouse that tried to come at you. Speaking of, you never properly thanked her for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and bowed your head showing your gratitude as well as saying it, \"Thank you.... for saving my life. Arigato!\" Youre not sure if she understood you or not, but for some reason you dont feel quite as scared of her anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you even tried to start conversation. \"Um...

[Your name]. Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" Fight mouthed something, but no sound came out of her mouth.

You dont wanna see your new friend hurt this poor girl!<br>\r\n\"FIGHT, WAIT!! STOP!!!\" you shouted, not causing Fight to flinch even the tiniest bit, \"It's ok! She's friendly!

Either that, or she really is listening to what youre telling her! You wipe the sweat off your forehead with your free hand while the other hand's gripping Fight's white hair strands for dear life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure not the only one relieved. Tomoyo sighed a little too, now knowing that this pale woman wasnt gonna pummel her to death!<br>\r\n\"Um....uh....um....\" Tomoyo's cheeks started turning red as she was trying to find the right words to say as she seemed to pointing up towards you, \"Um... could you... well... err...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a good idea as to what she was trying to ask Fight. Since you know by heart that she's very kind-hearted, gentle, and less intimidating than the Fight Card..... why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" you try to tell your current captor/heroine, \"I trust her. You can hand me to her. Go ahead.\" The Fight seemed to have stalled for a couple of seconds. She mustve been reluctant to give you up.<br>\r\nNevertheless, she finally picked you out of the hair loop and brought you toward Tomoyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl extended her hands ready to accept the offer.... however again, the Fight stalled for a couple more seconds before finally putting you down slowly and carefully into the palm of Tomoyo's hand. The moment you landed, you could see something slightly different about Fight through the corner of your eye. You could almost detect a slight hint of uneasiness on her barely-emotional face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tomoyo raised her hand a bit, bringing you much closer to that gigantic, adolescently curious smiling face looking back you kinda nervously.<br>\r\nSince you know now that she does speak English, it shouldnt be too hard for you to break the ice!<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" you raised your hand and greeted her, trying to your own fear and nervousness. Unlike the woman opposite your direction, it doesnt take Tomoyo long to respond!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" she nodded and smiled, \"A...are you alright? Sh-she didnt hurt you, did she?\"<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \"No. No! Not at all. Fight was very gentle to me. She even saved my life just a little while ago!\" Granted, you were very grateful of your new friend. That mouse was terrifying! At least for someone your size, anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo looked back toward Fight and said, \"Thank you so much, Miss... for helping my little friend, [your name]!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Did she just say your name?! Youre pretty sure she said your name!! How does she know your name? And 'little friend'? Does she know you?<br>\r\n\"Um... how do you know my name?\" you ask her, \"Have we met?\" Come to think of it, you DID wake up in the middle of her house! And she seemed to be looking for a 'little one' before she stumbled before the Fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo simply responded by scratching the back of her head and smiling while blushing a bit, \"Um.... it's... kind of a long story.\" It looks like she owes you quite a bit of an explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it looks like the explanation will have to wait. After the talk between you and Tomoyo, you noticed the Fight acting more and more unusual... Nothing dangerous or life-threatening, just a bit off for someone like her. She seems to be breathing a little heavier, her fingers were twitching, and the cheeks of her emotionless face were turning red! If you didnt know any better, you'd think she's starting to feel more and more anxious about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she's getting impatient with Tomoyo keeping her little friend in her hand. Will you ease the Fight Card and give her what she wants? Or stick with Tomoyo a little longer?</span></div></div>",

What is it?\" Tomoyo's eyes practically twinkled with interest, making your question even harder to try and ask!<br>\r\n\"Well... um.... uh...\" you sweat a little as you pointed over to the pale-colored uneasy titaness right in front of your current captor, \"could you...er... umm....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood news is Tomoyo knew immediately what you were trying to ask. Bad news is, the twinkle in her eye kinda faded a bit. \"Oh! Well, um...\" she looked over to the living Clow Card and carefully extended her hand with you in it to her new friend. Speaking of, despite the slightly scary site of her head practically looking down at you from Heaven itself,  the way her cheeks were kinda reddened and the loud sounds of her inhaling and exhaling with every quick breath made her slightly less intimidating. In fact, she looks... CUTE! Er.. for a card come to life, of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you'll give him back, right?\"<br>\r\nFight's eyes widened a little (almost exactly like Tomoyo's when Fight gave you to her) despite her unemotional facade. With both hands, she gently and carefully scooped you out of your younger captor's hand and carefully tightened her grip on you a bit. The grip wasnt very tight seeing as though you had plenty of breathing space and space to squirm around a bit. You even managed to notice her blowing a quick gentle sigh of relief thanks to the fact her breath was kinda chilly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter moments of merely staring into your soul in complete silence, Fight raised you back up over her head and placed you back in one of her ponytail loops. How long are you gonna be there? Who knows... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.... uh... um...\" it looks like Tomoyo is trying to make conversation with the titaness below you, \"I.. I dont believe we've been introduced. I am Daidouji Tomoyo! Pleased to meet you!\" Fight merely looked back at her with a blank expression. Nonetheless, she continued, \"Um... well... say...\" just then, the young lady started looking the big lady over from all sides, \"that is a nice outfit you have on! Where did you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you couldnt see from your angle, you could imagine Fight starting looking back at her questionably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Tomoyo continues eyeing her gettup like a kid in a candy store. \"It's SOOO cool! I HAVE to learn how to make a costume like that! Do you mind if I borrow it one day? I promise I'll make you an extra one! ...Do you mind if it's pink? I think you'd look SO cute in pink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh!\" just then, you overheard girlish laughter coming from just inches away from you! You turned your head slightly to a girl's face staring at you only an inch away from your face!<br>\r\n\"Wah!\" you jumped back and almost lost your balance on the hair loop! Though it didnt surprise you as much as the fact that there was a girl about your size with you! But not just any girl... this fellow tiny was yellowish colored with a yellow cape, a yellow robe with baggy-bottoms, and a yellow double pointed hat. You recognize this girl as well....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L...Little?\" ANOTHER one of the Clow Cards come to life. One you can possibly relate to. However, her touch could make you shrink.

Kinda worried of that outcome, you do your best to remain calm and quiet, being extremely careful not to agitate her. So screaming for help is out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Little seems to be eyeing you curiously. You so much as backed away a little and she edged a little closer to you, keeping her dilated yellow eyes locked on to yours. You didnt want to take the risk of getting shrunk even smaller, but you couldnt back away any further. You were at the very edge of the hairloop and it was a long drop down from Fight's head to the ground if her ponytail doesnt break your fall! Either way, youre putting yourself in a really big situation with a really harsh consequence! Which situation sounds better for you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You fear the thought of if there are already two Clow Cards in Tomoyo's house, there could be more hiding around nearby. You also fear the thought of being shrunk even further by the one just in front of you. As Little tilted her head a little, gazing at you with almost as much intrigue as Fight did, you pondered really hard about what to do. On one hand, it's a long way down. On the other, you could end up the size of a flea! On one hand, splat. On the other, you'd be next to being completely wiped off the face of the earth. No one other than Little would know what would become of you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrestled around the question for what seemed like forever until you made sort of a mental coin-toss...<br>\r\n...TAILS!<br>\r\nYou took a long hard sigh, looked down at the hairloop's edge... and jumped!<br>\r\n\"!!\" The last thing you saw was Little's face change to a shocked expression before you plummeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way down, you reached for Fight's hairstrands. You grabbbed a hold of one... unfortunately, you started losing your grip. The hair felt too smooth and slippery. Either Fight musta put some sort of mousse in her hair before she met you (that would explain how she's able to keep that 'unique' hairstyle standing!) or your hands were far too sweaty. Either way, you couldnt hold on for long. No matter how hard you tried climbing back up the pony tail, you only slipped further down. Soon, you reached the very end... and it was STILL a long way down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, you could see Little defying the laws of physics hopping down the ponytail itself and racing toward you! Just when your hand slipped off the end, Little grabbed you and held you tightly! You were grateful that she saved your life... for about a few seconds! Her touch caused your arm to glow. <br>\r\n\"Aw.. no....\" You knew what was gonna happen!<br>\r\nThe glow became brighter and brighter until finally the brightness flashed right in your eyes, blinding you for a while! You couldnt so much as see your arm in front of you! Just feel Little holding onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"?!\"<br>\r\n\"What the?!\" Sure enough, even Tomoyo and Fight noticed the flash coming from your direction! You felt the entire world around you shift 180 degrees and you didnt feel anything touch your arm anymore!<br>\r\nThis was it. Your final fate... as a microscopic splat on the carpet. You wont even get to see your last moments of life. Nothing but bright light all around as you felt gravity pulling you down....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasnt much of a fall. In fact, there wasnt much of a splat! There wasnt even a splat at all! Not only did you survive the drop, it was an incredibly soft landing. 'What just happened?!' you thought to yourself as the white light started to fade away and your vision was coming back to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your.... name]?\" you heard Tomoyo's voice call out to you. In an instant, you saw Tomoyo's head leaning down at you in a mixture of concern and confusion. Strange thing is that her head doesnt look very humongous from your point of view. And she was leaning only a couple inches away from you! \"W....What's happened to you?! Youre... big!\"<br>\r\nBIG?! You immediately got up off the ground and took a good look at your surroundings. Same room.... only smaller. MUCH smaller. Even Fight was a little shorter than you and Tomoyo was almost half your size! Your new little friend was right! Your back to normal size... at least in THIS universe, anyway! Could the Little have done this? Maybe her shrinking power mixed in with whatever power shrunk you in the first place and canceled eachother out! Speaking of which, where is she? OH WHO CARES?! YOURE BIG AGAIN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm big again! I'M...\" but before you could start jumping for joy, you noticed a different look on Fight's face. Her emotionally-void face looked a bit more threatening as she stared over at you. She even put her arm in front of Tomoyo and stepped in front of her like she was trying to defend her from someone! But from WHO?!<br>\r\nShe raised her fists as she glared your direction. Out of curiosity, you turned around... no one else was behind you, which meant she was glaring at YOU!<br>\r\n\"F...Fight?\" you spoke calmly as you backed away, \"Wh-what are you doing?! It's me!\" She didnt seem to listen!<br>\r\nThankfully, Tomoyo even spoken on your behalf. \"Wait! Dont hurt him! Dont you remember? That's our friend, [Your name]!\" Sadly, Fight ignored her as she stepped closer, assuming her offensive stance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeez, what was wrong with her?! Is it because of the size that she doesnt recognize you? Too bad she wasnt in the mood to listen to a lengthy explanation. She's the FIGHT card, not the LISTEN TO REASON card!<br>\r\n\"FIGHT! PLEASE WAIT! I-UNGH!!\" in a quick instant, she grabbed both your arms and pinned them against a wall! You gotta give her credit. She was strong. VERY strong! You couldnt break free of her no matter how hard you tried. Such is the power of a Clow Card. You finally stopped struggling the moment she squeezed your arms almost to the point where it hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for your other friend, Tomoyo could only stare in horror as her new friend was left at the mercy of his former colossal captor!<br>\r\n\"F-FIGHT!! L...LET HIM GO!!\" she screamed to no avail. She couldnt help you.She knew there was no way someone like her could stand a chance against the Fight. Maybe her friend Sakura could... but she was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFight breathed heavily, blowing ice-cool air in your face as her widened aqua-blue eyes stared deeply into yours. With no other options left, you closed your eyes and waited for whatever your gentle captor has in store...<br>\r\nAfter almost a minute, Fight finally reacted by...</span></div></div>",

It's practically still her typical blank stare with no emotion... however, you can detect something out of place by the way she's slightly tilting her head and blinking every few seconds as she stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's almost as if she's rather curious of the tiny creature in her hand. Despite her serious, unemotional exterior, it seems that Fight is still a child at heart. Almost like a little girl eyeing a brand new Barbie through the window of a toystore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you find it kinda cute, it's very uncomfortable for someone like you. Fight is almost a hundred times your size and she's getting way too close for comfort. That mouse from earlier was big enough to eat you in a single bite or two. All she would need do is barely tip the edge of her hand and take one very slight breath and you'll never be heard from again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, she's pushing the back of your body closer to her face with the edge of her finger! You want to tell her to stop but the way those huge eyes of hers are staring into your soul with sheer interest make it easier said than done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C...c....could you please put me down?\" you ask her as politely as possible. Fight doesnt answer. She just continues her stare.<br>\r\n\"Please. PLEASE.... PUT ME DOWN!\" you say it even louder and stricter, but nothing happens.<br>\r\n\"PUT... ME... DOWN!!\" you usher your arms downwards trying to 'explain' what youre saying, \"DOWN!!! DOOOOWWWNN!!!\" It's not working. Out of desperation, you try to use what little Japanese you know once more, \"Uh...um.... Shita ni! Shita ni! C'mon, SHITA NI!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you didnt know any better, you coulda sworn you saw a slight smile appear across Fight's face for a brief second. Is she enjoying your little panic attack? Personally, you dont really think of her as sadistic. She did save your life after all. Maybe because she's far too adept in fighting that she's far too inexperienced socially. She IS the Fight card. And fighting's what she's best at!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she clenched her fist... with you in it! She clenched you in the palm of her hand tightly, but not too tight for you to breath and move around freely. As you wondered just what she was up to, you could overhear her footsteps again as your glove-prison was slowly rocked back and forth! Fight's leaving and taking you with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...Where are you taking me?!!\" you shouted to you even though you know she wont answer, \"Where are we going?!\"<br>\r\nWonderful, not only are you shrunk and in a completely different world, youre being kidnapped! All because of a living card's keen interest in the said shrunken creature trapped in her very hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP RIGHT THERE!\" Just then, you overheard  someone's voice call out toward your direction. IN ENGLISH! Is someone calling out Fight?! <br>\r\nBesides that, the voice sounded rather feminine... and familiar. You peeked through the space between your captor's fingers and see the shouter glaring back at Fight...<br>\r\nIt's....</span></div></div>",

Of course you were more surprised of WHAT she just said over HOW she said it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N..n...new home?\" those words took you by surprise.

Nice to meet you!\" You already knew by heart who she was (except for that last part), but you played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... likewise!\" you bowed your head, \"I'm-\"<br>\r\n\"[your name]?\"<br>\r\nYou almost did a double take after you heard her say your name, \"W...WHA... H-HOW DID YOU KNOW MY NAME?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It said in the instructions you came with,\" Tomoyo answered as she pulled out a piece of paper with words written on it, \"it also says that youre an exact living replica of actual human being. You do the same things we do, you speak the same languages we do, you eat the same foods we do, only um....\" she pinched her finger and thumb together, \"...much smaller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is really odd.

I think there might be some sort of misunderstanding here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she just shook her head and continued to smile, \"Nope. It says so right on the instructions that youre a gift to me!\" She brought the piece of paper close to you to read it. Not that it matters... it's in Japanese. \"See? 'To: Daidouji Tomoyo'!\"<br>\r\nA gift? Is someone playing a little joke on you?!  \"Um... just who exactly sent me to you?\" you ask her. Unfortunately, Tomoyo just scratched her head, \"I dont know. You were left on the doorstep in a little shoebox when I found you. Along with your instructions and a couple of accessories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo whoever done this to you dropped you off in front of Tomoyo's house and ditched you? Someone's gonna pay for this. In the meantime, you'll need to convince your owner that youre not really a toy!<br>\r\n\"Listen, um.. Ms. Daidouji-\"<br>\r\n\"Please! Call me Tomoyo!\" she politely insisted.<br>\r\n\"Alright, Tomoyo. The truth is I'm not a toy. I am really a human being... apparently shrunken down to this size. I'm not sure how I've gotten this way in the first place, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The instructions said that you believe youre a real human, too,\" Tomoyo interrupted again and you could not believe what she said!<br>\r\n\"W...WHAT?\"<br>\r\n\"It says that you've been pre-installed with fake memories of a life that never existed. You remember friends and family that arent real. They must seem very real to you, dont they?\"<br>\r\nYou were left speechless after hearing that bit of news. It cant possibly be true, but what if it is?! Everything that you remember before you woke up here... your own life that you thought you had... your mom, your dad... your friends... all those years of growing up... even memories of watching the very show you seem to be stuck in! Could they've all been fake?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....it's not true!! It cant be!!\" you try very hard not to panic. You dont wanna believe this, but it's kinda hard not to! It's really scary to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, little one,\" Tomoyo smiles at you, \"I promise I'll take good care of you. I'll treat you right, give you a nice little home, plenty of food and water, and take you wherever I go!\"<br>\r\nThat's when she looked out her window, \"That reminds me! Why dont we go pay a visit to my friend, Sakura-chan? I'm sure she'd love to meet you.\"<br>\r\nIt doesnt look like you'll be going anywhere for a while... why not?<br>\r\n\"Um... or we could just stay here if you like.

Ok.\" Not only that, she immediately changed the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me!\" Tomoyo opened her closet and pulled out that little handy device you know her very well of carrying around... that mini-camcorder! No doubt the tape's filled to the brim with shots of Sakura in compromising positions!<br>\r\n\"I think it's about time I start filming someone else instead of just Sakura-chan all the time,\" she said as she strapped the camera to her hand, \"I dont want all my friends thinking I'm weird or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gee, now why would ANYONE think she of all people is weird?!' you thought to yourself as you snickered a little, which didnt go unnoticed by your young owner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! What's so funny?!\" she glared rather cutely at you.<br>\r\n\"Nuuuuuuthing!\" you smiled sweetly at her. Anyways, despite raising her eyebrow a little, she continued, \"I have a special project I'm doing at school.\"<br>\r\n\"What kind of special project?\"<br>\r\n\"A SPECIAL special project,\" she answers as she popped the lens cap off her camera. Is there something going on she aint telling you? \"Anyways, ever since you were brought to my house, I had an idea on what my project's gonna be about. I was thinking sortof a documentary on my little artificial human. I wanna film you in your natural daily habitat... display the differences and similarities between your kind and ours. Compare your outlook on the humongous world around you to ours. See what makes you tick. And most importantly, to show the world how much we have in common despite our size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she serious? \"You...you mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" she smiled brightly as she stuck the camera a couple inches away from you and looked through it, \"I call it 'A Big Day... In A Small World'!\"<br>\r\nShe thought pretty hard about this, hasnt she? That would explain the rather high-tech dollhouse you woke up in. You could practically live in that alone. Maybe that was sort of her plan from the beginning! To film you in your 'natural habitat'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, it could make you famous. On the minus side, it could have you discovered by lots of people. Some of which are the BAD kind. Some of which might hurt you or kidnap you or use you as a science experiment or something along those lines!<br>\r\n...Nah. Youre thinking too hard. It's just a simple school project, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you can trust a nice girl like Madiso-err, Tomoyo, right?</span></div></div>",

She had to reason with Akito to help free the Sohma family of some of the darker aspects of the zodiac curse, most of which Akito had caused himself, though Tohru would not allow herself to think that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had chosen the place for the rendevous; only he and Tohru would meet there and passersby wouldn't think anything strange if they spoke quietly enough. However there was one thing he hadn't counted on... Hana, Tohru's dangerously empathic friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHana was originally going shopping until she felt a strong surge of electrical waves. One pattern was familiar as Tohru Honda, who seemed to be emitting stress and desperation; the other was unfamiliar to her and carried intense feelings of anger and hatred. Both of these wave patterns seemed to be focused on one particular spot. Hana immdiately set for this location<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt their meeting Tohru continually talked about the importance of respecting fellow humans, regardless of their condition, and also expressed a strong moral feeling to help anyone in need, even if all she could do is give comfort to those in need. Akito wouldn't hear of it. Initially he would just shrug off her arguments before putting forward a cold-hearted motivation to leave things as they were. When Hana arrived Akito was becoming more confrontational; he started snapping at Tohru, demanding his right to boss the Sohma family around, to continue advocating the curse of the zodiac and to ensure that the cat remains seperate from the zodiac community. Tohru's pleas for peace and love amongst the Sohmas only infuriates him further and he pulls at her hair again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Hana cries out in shock and anger. \"Leave my Tohru alone!\" Akito looks up at Hana in surprise but doesn't give her a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing you can do!\" He replies. \"I'll be done by the time the police arrive and they're more likely to listen to me than you!\" That was too much. Seeing her good friend being abused and receiving such arrogance from someone so mean, Hana unleashed her most formidable weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe electro-poison waves struck Akito hard, causing him to lose conscoiusness and release Tohru. However Tohru had caught the recoil from Akito and fell with a feeling like she had been punched in the stomach, but not too serverely. Something else had happened; Tohru could feel a strange sensation inside her.</span></div></div>",

Tohru was looking forward to a cheerful day relaxing in the sunny meadows but Saki was here for a different reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will require your cooperation and your discretion.\" She told them, Arisa raised an eyebrow in query while Tohru carried an expression of surprise as she always did when hit by a startling new fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Hana?\" She asked, Saki sighed and told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason I've come here is I wish to try out this mysterious ritual I've been reading about. If worked properly it can enhance your cognitive senses.\" Both Tohru and Arisa were lost for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well,\" Tohru finally spoke, \"I'm sure we'll do our best to help you. Right, Uo?\" Arisa looked between them and finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but we must be careful. We have no idea of what we're dealing with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Saki informed them, \"I have a pretty good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ritual was rather Neopagan/Shinto/Anglo-Saxon in its way. Saki meditated for a while while Tohru and Arisa aligned specific flowers in a pattern surrounding her. Once that was done Saki lit some incense sticks in yet another pattern at a closer proximity and began chanting while meditating, during which Tohru and Arisa clapped their hands rhythmically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually strange lights began to surround Saki and she seemed to be changing in some way. Then what happened next shocked both Tohru and Arisa while Saki seemed oblivious. She was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaki grew and grew and grew! Soon, even when sitting down, she loomed over her friends. Tohru was positively gobsmacked but was not afraid in any way while Arisa felt uneasy but showed no fear as she did her best to remind herself of who the giantess was.</span></div></div>",

She was greeted with the typical enthusiasm and eagerly escorted to Tomoyo's bedroom. After a spot of tea Kero then made his announcement regarding the earlier subject matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Tomoyo responded. \"It's perfectly all right.\" Sakura was momentarily stumped by this reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, we're here to celebrate your birthday, first.\" She pointed out. At this Tomoyo's eyes began to sparkle as she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To watch Sakura-chan in her efforts to boost her magic. It's the best birthday gift I could ever hope for!\" Once again Sakura sweat-dropped upon hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring dinner Tomoyo made the suggestion to her mother that they might indulge in some stargazing before bedtime, a suggestion that was accepted but Sonomi advised they should not stay up too late in view of the party planned for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time came and Tomoyo led Sakura and Kero out to a spot in the garden that offered the best view of the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose this does count as stargazing after all.\" She remarked once they reached the spot in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Sakura.\" Kero prepared Her for the practice. \"First, summon your wand.\" Accepting this, though not without a few qualms, She did so and then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes.\" Kero advised. \"Concentrate. Focus upon your magic. Think about where it comes from. Look deeper, deeper.\" After some time Sakura's vision was filled with stars of all types; She couldn't help but feel some deja vu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've... been here... before.\" She murmured. There was a pause as She gazed around Her, every star shone bright, the power flowing through Her filled Her inner self with powerful magic before Kero's voice came through again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find the source.\" A redundant statement from Her perspective. \"Reach for it. Request more from it, just for a while.\" Sakura reached out, first with Her left hand and then stuck out Her staff, focusing as hard as She could. Suddenly two stars came shooting right for Her; startled all She could do was bring Herself into a more foetal position and stared as the two points of light came right up in Her face. Blinded for a moment She blinked several times before She started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura-chan, are you all right?\" Tomoyo was a little bit disappointed by the lack of visible magic but still felt she had received her present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two stars,\" She answered unsteadily, \"Just raced right at my face.\" Kero requested more information, prompting Her to recall everything that happened. Looking closely at Her he noticed two glints in Her eyes that weren't there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're there.\" He stated. \"Those stars have lodged in your eyes, Sakura.\" This remark puzzled Her as Tomoyo moved closer to have a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There does seem to be a cute glint in them.\" She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, do you know what kind of stars they were?\" When Kero asked this Sakura thought back very hard as She tried to discern how the stars could've been distinguished under the conditions in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were bright.\" She did Her best to recall. \"I suppose they were about as big as my eyes.\" Thinking for a moment Kero spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that astral plain the scale of the stars is based on how they're observed from Earth. I guess they must've been...\"</span></div></div>",

If it is used then it's likely to create a scene.\" Understanding this Sakura hung as Tomoyo and herself continued to run around the nearby blocks before Sakura understands the urgency and the general difficulty in catching up with any of her friends without knowing exactly where they were heading. Once this was recognised Sakura activated the Fly card and commenced a swift aerial search around Tomoeda with Tomoyo providing extra support; four eyes are better than two after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's Naoko-chan!\" Tomoyo pointed out as they flew of the town centre. Looking down Sakura saw her enter a bookshop and then looked for a suitable landing site. She fixed upon an alley next to the shop and circled round for landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Naoko departed the bookshop Sakura and Tomoyo ran up to her, calling for her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura-chan, Tomoyo-chan.\" Naoko acknowledged them ableit curious as to why they requested her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see your Enchantment cards?\" Sakura asked her; still confused Naoko accepted her request and handed them over. Flipping through these cards Sakura did not see the Big card anywhere. \"Thank you, Naoko-chan.\" Sakura said as she returned them before she and Tomoyo returned to the alley to continue their search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sakura-chan!\" Naoko called out as she thought of something; running after her Naoko turned the corner and was surprised to find it empty and a dead end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the search continued Sakura spotted Chiharu heading up her home street and immediately flew in to a point where they could circumspectly intercept her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chiharu-chan.\" Sakura called out as they ran towards her, Chiharu's reation was no different to Naoko's including when Sakura asked to see her Enchanted cards. Looking through them there was still no sign of the Big card. \"You and Naoko-chan were in Twin Bells today, right?\" Sakura checked, Chiharu nodded and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rika-chan was there, too.\" This was a good tip off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea where Rika-chan might be?\" Sakura asked; thinking for a moment Chiharu answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might be in Penguin Park or maybe she went straight home.\" This was a fair guess and Sakura and Tomoyo set off to look for her.</span></div></div>",

A light emanated from Rika's pocket and a blue aura surrounded her. \"I think we should back off, Tomoyo-chan.\" Sakura commented and, as they began to withdraw, Rika began to grow. At first each step Sakura took equaled an extra two inches in Rika's height but, as the magic accelerated, it became six inches for each of Sakura's steps, then one foot per step. Before long Rika had grown to twenty-five times her normal size with Sakura and Tomoyo only two feet in front of her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika was so bewildered as to what had happened. She was just telling Sakura which Enchantment cards she had and the next thing she knew the whole of Penguin Park was at her feet.

At first she thought it might be an animal or someone else on a stroll, but she noticed that it seemed to glow an ethereal blue. Curious and thrilled at the possibilities she jogged in its general direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeilin, meanwhile, had opted to pass through the same woods, thinking it would provide a shortcut between the shopping district and the apartment she was currently staying at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko rounded a corner and was surprised to find the path empty of any evidence of anything or anyone having gone through in the past few hours. As she pondered over this she had this feeling of someone approaching from behind in a stealthy manner. Turning she was stunned to see a female figure some nine feet tall, completely shrouding in that same ethereal blue from earlier on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...Anatahadaredesu ka?<a name=\"freturn1\"></a><a href=\"#footnote1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 1: W...Who are you?\">1</a>\" She asked in a loud whisper. The only response she got was a smile and then found herself tapped on the head with what felt like and almost looked like a baton. \"No... No sore wa nanideshita ka?<a name=\"freturn2\"></a><a href=\"#footnote2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 2: What... What was that for?\">2</a>\" But then she found this figure was now moving away from her deceptively fast. \"Cho... Chotto, matte!\" As soon as she said this Naoko felt a strange warm feeling creeping over her. It began with a sense of being inside an inflating balloon before developing into a sensation of stretching in the fashion of a tree. She watched as little blue dots danced about her and the whole world seemed to shrink away before her.<p align=\"left\"><u>Footnotes</u><br><a name=\"footnote1\"></a><a href=\"#freturn1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Return from Footnote 1\">1</a>\u00a0 W...Who are you?<br><a name=\"footnote2\"></a><a href=\"#freturn2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Return from Footnote 2\">2</a>\u00a0 What...

It was unexpected and not all that welcome, receiving news that there'd be an exam shortly before the summer holiday. There had been a bulletin asking for all girl students from years 4 to 6 to attend a briefing just after the last class; the headteacher there informed them that a new boarding school for girls was opening up and that there was to be an entry exam for anyone who would be willing to attend, albeit they need not accept the offer even if they took the exam as the details of this school would come after applications were submitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the school gates, Sakura looked down at the leaflet that highlighted the basics of this new school. She'd been reluctant to go along with this until she found that the new school's head would be Kaho Mizuki, which held great promise for her. Further reading showed a rather high-class accommodation program; apparently every student would have their own bedroom with en-suite, although the rest of the dorm would be communal. This did hold concern for Sakura since this insinuated it'd be very expensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Sakura-chan.\"<a name=\"freturn1\"></a><a href=\"#footnote1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 1: Sakura-chan o shinpaishinaide kudasai.\">1</a> Tomoyo reassured her as she stepped up along side her, earning a slightly puzzled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan, with this much promise the entry fee must be very high.\"<a name=\"freturn2\"></a><a href=\"#footnote2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 2: Kore dake de Tomoyo-chan, sanka-hi ga hij\u014d ni takakunakereba naranai koto o yakusoku.\">2</a> Sakura stated in a rather uneasy manner.

This was something that she still hadn't completely gotten used to; it was a signal of the arrival of her best friend Tomoyo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nIt had been a few weeks now since both of them had taken and passed the school's entrance exam. During that time, they had come to know all too well that this was no ordinary school, and with a mage as powerful as Kaho running it, how could they have expected otherwise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this school was far from normal. They found that out on their first official day as students, the instant they set foot onto the campus. The moment the two of them walked through those gates, they felt a strange magic entering their bodies. Sakura recognized it somewhat as a similar feeling to when she had used the Big card to grow to colossal size, but for Tomoyo it was an entirely new experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly they both began to grow. Sakura's growth spurt only shot her up a couple feet beyond her original height before quickly petering out. As for Tomoyo's side of the deal, she continued growing until she towered over Sakura and even the school itself at a truly gargantuan size, just barely under 1,000 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both of them had stopped growing, Kaho appeared before them to welcome them to their new school. She walked them into a building through a front door that was magically enchanted to expand and accommodate students of any size. The hallways, much the same as the door, were enchanted to expand and allow even one as massive as the newly grown Tomoyo to walk around freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaho walked the girls through the halls and toward the principal's office, where she would explain to them how everything at this school would work. As they walked, they passed by many other students. Some were smaller than Sakura, some were taller than Tomoyo, but the vast majority of them sat somewhere in the middle. Once the girls arrived at the principal's office, Kaho sat down at her desk and began to reveal everything to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained their sudden growth spurts, revealing that she had set up a magical field around the school campus, and that for every 1,000 yen beyond the initial entrance fee that they donated, they gained an additional foot in height. This explained why Tomoyo now towered at such a massive size while Sakura's height had barely changed at all. Leaving the campus would revert them back to their normal height, but the extra size on campus was meant to serve as an incentive to encourage more donations from the students. She also explained the school curriculum to them, revealing that in addition to the basic subjects that any other school would teach, Kaho's school would be helping them learn the ways of the magical arts as well. After their briefing was concluded, Kaho handed each of them a class schedule and sent them both on their way.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was distracted as she thought about all that had happened in such a short time, but quickly snapped back to reality when she heard her titanic friend speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for class now, Sakura?\" Tomoyo asked as she kneeled down and smiled at her much smaller friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, got all my stuff right here.\" Sakura replied, patting her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, would you like me to give you a lift today as well?\" Tomoyo asked, extending her enormous hand out as a platform for Sakura to walk onto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, thank you very much Tomoyo.\" Sakura answered, stepping into her friend's palm and then kneeling down so that she wouldn't fall to her feet as her friend stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo gave her much smaller friend a cheerful smile before walking toward their next class, said class being...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura Kinomoto stood at the airport's departure foyer with a strange sense of anticipation and uncertainty. She had only just said goodbye to Her family and to Sonomi Daidouji, which left Her with Her four friends awaiting the call to board their flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed rather too crazy to believe, but for Sakura the impossible was merely all in a day's work. Shortly before the Vernal Equinox they had all received from Tomoeda Elementary's reception a letter, each individually addressed, inviting them to sign up for a new boarding school started by Kaho Mizuki on a little known island somewhere between Japan and Hawaii, apparently at a latitude that would allow for the possibility of snow in the winter. They had checked these together, going though them over and over in an effort to figure out just how it could be that she'd successfully opened a private school that didn't require any entry fees or the like but there seemed to be no clauses addressing the issue. However it soon transpired that Tomoyo's mother had actually provided a substantial investment and, as for the others, their parents had received separate letters making surprisingly reasonable donation suggestions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they were here, about to board a plane chartered by Sonomi on their behalf to begin a new long-term style of education. The one thing they could feel reassured about was they knew Kaho Mizuki from before, so each and every one of them figured that it must be at least acceptable. Although the notification that stated it was an all-girl school struck them as being particularly unusual in the context of the rest of the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they got the call to board and made their way to the gate and were guided aboard a relatively small turboprop with a cabin containing 12 seats in a 2x2 arrangement. Their boarding passes directed them to the wing seats, except that Naoko found herself sitting in the window seat behind Chiharu. As they sat there a single flight attendant boarded and told them that three more passengers were expected. Sakura was stunned to find that, when they arrived, She'd met them all before. There was Rei Tachibana, two years Her senior, Yuuki Tachibana, who She hadn't seen since sealing the Silent card and wondered if the two were related, and finally the youngest passenger was the girl called Akane who had looked after Kero for a day or two. Sakura cringed a little as She considered what would happen if they all recognised Her; however the more significant issue was the evidence that they too were invited to Kaho's new school. Akane was directed to the rear of the plane across from Naoko while Rei and Yuuki were given the corresponding seats at the front while the attendant seemed to be assigned to the seat right next to Yuuki once she'd made communication with the pilot(s).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a modest amount of chat during the flight as they got to know each other, except that the attendant didn't show any sign of being involved in the school itself. It didn't take too long for the three outside of Sakura's group of friends to recall their meetings with Her but Tomoyo did her best to ease things in so as to avoid any awkward explanations regarding at least two encounters. Akane seemed particularly worried about being away from her family and so received a more substantial amount of consoling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem like a particularly long flight, at least no longer than a flight to Hong Kong, before they caught sight of the island at last. It looked quite a bit bigger than they expected and the only discernible town seemed rather closely tucked into the coastline but when the airport came into view it seemed quite substantial all things considered. However Sakura caught sight of something that seemed out of place on the island, like some kind of grand arts gallery crossed with an array of hangers as if to suggest a second airport. As they came into land She noticed one more unusual element to the scenery; there was a great sign about the size of a hoarding upon which was written... \u30d3\u30c3\u30b0\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6c34\u6728\u5b66\u6821 <i>The Mizuki School for BIG Girls</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch an apt name. Kaho's school has an all female staff and all students, along with most staff members, shall spend the school year as giants. However there is as of yet no information as to what scale they'll be at nor how long the period of study will ultimately last. Which is more important to consider?</span></div></div>",

Fortunately there were only a couple of minutes where the aircraft was sitting at a complete stop before the door could be opened, although they had a few moments of pause as they considered just who should exit first, eventually opting for an oldest to youngest arrangement with the attendant placing herself right at the back to help Akane along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as She stepped off the bottom step Sakura caught sight of someone waiting for them, a figure She instantly recognised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizuki-sensei!\" She declared with some surprise but mostly out of joy at seeing a familiar face after all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Sakura-san.\" She replied as they gathered round her. \"And I must say how happy it is to see all of you in attendance.\" She promptly marked off each of them on her clipboard before continuing. \"There's a minibus at the exit ready for us, but due to the... extra special nature of our program I've decided that we should have some lunch in town. This would also help all of you to get any questions you have out of the way, although some of them may have to wait until the last minute before I can answer them.\" There was a general response of approval from them, just as the flight attendant came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Mizuki-sensei?\" She asked with a touch of nervousness; once the reply came she continued. \"I won't be available for any return flight until next week, so I want to know just what can I expect while I'm here.\" Looking a tad uneasy for a moment Kaho glanced between the girls and her before gently leading her away from them before answering in a quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about any childish behaviour. Our students are not meant to be roaming the town for their first week, but if any do breach this rule we will have to detain them by way of special measures. As to the staff members, you shouldn't find any of us in town between nine and five during the week but rest assured they've all been cleared as being responsible enough.\" With that she let the flight attendant get on her way before guiding the girls out of the airport.</span></div></div>",

The seats on the minibus were similar to those on the aeroplane but with the typical rear bench commonly found on buses and there was no seating plan; Rei and Yuuki both took the left two seats just in front of the rear, Sakura and Tomoyo ended up on the right side on the row just behind the front with Kaho sitting on the aisle seat on the left right at the front, Akane ended up sitting at the window on the right of the corresponding row while Rika and Chiharu sat equidistant from Kaho and Tachibana on the left and Naoko sat on the right side from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the concept of having an airport at a substantial distance from a built-up area was not unknown the distance they had to travel did seem impractical for the island, especially regarding the distribution of hilly terrain as visible from the windows of the bus. However this did give everyone a good view of the town or city (they had yet to determine which would be a better description) as it sat a little bit below the level of the airport. The open sea glistened right up to the breakwaters of the port, bright yellow beaches branched off from either side of the port and, despite the distinctly modern vibe of the design of the buildings, there seemed to be a clear intent to capture the tone of old-style European construction. One interesting thing about the whole sight was that there was no building more than 10 stories high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they entered the town/city proper another curiosity about the place came to light; the roads were rather wide for the area and traffic levels. Further progression led to further anomalies in that the blocks were generally long and thin and some rather unusual road signs were appearing, apparently reading as 'Beware: Falling Shoes' to the more rationally minded. It soon became apparent that the area covered would constitute a city but the distribution of facilities and the overall population seemed to suggest a town, especially with the periodical town squares appearing with indications of continual construction of what might've been considered works of modern or post-modern art.</span></div></div>",

Once it had left what appeared to be some kind of car park or forecourt in retrospect the door began to open. Inside there was what looked like an extension of the forecourt bordered on two sides by a set of steps leading up to an unusually spacious reception area and a long stretch of open space that was reminiscent of a military depot, particularly due to the series of large hanger-like openings parallel to the reception area and the curiously high fence that had some surprisingly wide gaps between and a large sign that clearly was meant to be read from the opposite side.

I didn't think...\" She stuttered a little. \"So, the flying toy thing?\" Sakura and Tomoyo nodded at the same time. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Jump card.\" Sakura admitted. \"It was my responsibility to capture rogue cards.\" This didn't register with Maki until Kaho gave Sakura a careful tilt of the head, which was reinforced with a whisper from Tomoyo. At this Sakura presented Maki with the Glow card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks like...\" As Maki said this Sakura and Tomoyo nodded again before the card was returned to its master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can talk about this later.\" Kaho affirmed. \"Right now, let's get everyone registered.

With a sigh Sakura moved towards the desk to have Her details taken down with Kaho at her side and Kero bringing up the rear. \"Cerberus, considering how tall we'll be, perhaps it would be more convenient for you to revert to your original form.\" This statement attracted some attention but before anyone could remark on it Kero gave a nod and advised everyone to stand back.

Sakura was momentarily taken aback by this but answered within a short space of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always had some difficulty with maths, and science has been a struggle lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only to be expected.\" Kaho mentioned. \"Magically-sensitive people are not usually compatible with the sciences.\" By the time she said this Maki had effectively completed the form and gave her a nod. \"Please step this way, Kinomoto-san.\" Sakura looked where she was indicating to see a ramp leading into the nearest of the hangar-like constructs and had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't I... I mean my luggage needs to be returned to normal-size, right?\" Kaho shook her head at this and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's best to wait until you reach the dorm. How much you'll grow does not correlate with how small you've made the luggage.\" Giving a hesitant nod She then began to make Her way towards the hangar in question, slipping Her luggage into Her pocket as She went. While this was going on Yuuki caught Kero giving her a rather contemptuous look that really got under her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you?!?\" She jabbed in alarm. He seemed to go into a full-body frown before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't appreciate being belittled, especially in my smaller form.\" Yuuki got the wrong end of the stick on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

Just as Sakura stepped into the chamber the light got ever so bright She held an arm up against the glare before continuing to advance. Eventually the light appeared to consume Her and everyone had to blink the brilliant glim away. They stared as the lighting inside was now back to how it was before Kaho had invited Her to enter. Just then they felt a few distinct vibrations like a number of earth tremors and then a single utterance attracted their attention to the other side of the seemingly impractical fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOE!?!\" They stared up, most of them gobsmacked, at Sakura's newly enlarged form. The distance between them helped everyone to take Her all in but even so their eye-lines couldn't go higher than Her knees without craning their necks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura-chan?!?\" Chiharu couldn't help but gasp out at the sight of Her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible.\" Rika added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Tomoyo spoke with deep regret. \"Why didn't I get my camera out before my luggage got shrunk?\" This seemed to shake the other girls out of their wonder.

The sight of what amounted to a winged lion missing its mane flying up towards Sakura's shoulder helped everyone get a sense of just how big She was by this time. Sakura's face shifted from a look of unease to one of adoration as Kero entered Her field of vision in close proximity, but She made no remark as to how small he appeared for fear of compromising the form-filling taking place at the reception. However once that was done She just had to speak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Kero-chan, you look so cute now.</i>\" As She said this She grabbed him out of the air and cradled him against Her chest.

The third booth flashed just as the light went out in the first and more tremors occurred as Rei stepped out, towering high over them all and leading Sakura to release Kero from Her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, Sakura.\" Kero groaned. \"You never did that with me before when our proportions were on this level.\" This caused the giantess in question to sweat-drop in response.

The two giantesses pondered over how to describe it before Sakura answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's rather like being picked up by a gust of wind while feeling flushed, as though you've just seen your most important person at the grocery shop, followed by a brief case of pins and needles as the magic disperses.</i>\" Chiharu's aside look at Her effectively confirmed this. Rika gave a nod denoting her reassurance just as Kaho stepped up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you please, Sasaki-san.\" She said with a slight gesture. \"There's nothing to be scared of.\" At this Rika made her way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes passed after Rika was enlarged as those yet to grow struggled to keep their feet as she paced about, taking in how everything appeared from her new height, before Kaho invited Tomoyo to sign in. Once all the details were taken down she made a distinct contrast to the other four by waving at them as she made her way towards the portal with a shout of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way, Sakura-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon emerging with earth-shaking steps, which the remaining girls were starting to get accustomed to, Tomoyo immediately stood beside Sakura and whispered to Her about the slight disappointment she felt over not being able to fit in Her hand any more. The sweat-drop that resulted made Chiharu muse over how big a puddle it could make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yanagisawa-san?\" Kaho addressed the last of Sakura's friends, but hardly needed to add anything as the girl in question started towards the reception desk just as her name was being spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was cleared to pass Naoko's eyes seemed to sparkle with the prospect of real magic being performed upon her, not to mention what it would do. Once she reached the other side she emulated Rei and knelt down next to the fence, staring in wonder at how small those remaining seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mizuki-sensei,</i>\" Her voice reverberated to the point the fence rattled a bit, \"<i>It's amazing how cute you look now.</i>\" Kaho now held her hand out to the other two, which caused some confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei,\" Yuuki spoke up, \"If you wish to carry us shouldn't you get bigger, too?\" Kaho had to suppress a giggle at this before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not asking you to climb into my hand.\" She pointed out. \"But with just the two of you left, we could get both of you signed in and then we'll all grow together.\" Akane had no need for further invitation and practically ran to take her hand with Yuuki walking up a bit slower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with nine giantesses now standing in the underground edifice, Matsumoto stood from her place at the desk and went into a back room of some description while Kaho...</span></div></div>",

Above this was a large two-storey structure set into the higher reaches of the mountain side. They were led up to another set of stairs adjacent to this building and through a door tucked out of the way. The first space they found was recognisable as the kind of cloakroom they'd typically use to change footwear, but Kaho's actions let them know that they could get away with just going further in their socks alone. Going down a somewhat dimly-lit corridor they caught sight of some of the classrooms they'd be in, including the music room, before reaching the end of the corridor where they now found themselves in a space that seemed to be a combination of a classroom, an office and a staff lounge. Kaho invited them to take a seat on a sofa before settling down behind the main desk. The eight girls looked about them as they tried to wrap their heads round the fact that they were in what felt like a normal room while remembering they were now over 150' tall when Kaho finally spoke up on the subject of...</span></div></div>",

The bedrooms and shower rooms each took up part of the upper level. In light of their ages and glancing at their schedules the girls decided to take up berths in the following order clockwise from the cloakroom. Rei, Tomoyo, Sakura, Rika, Chiharu, Naoko, Yuuki, Akane. Each of them was most surprised to find that the bedroom provided plenty of space for them, especially whenever they recalled they were now over 10 stories tall. There were twin beds which meant, for the time being, they could demark one for sleep and the other for daytime, and there was a nook set up with the essentials for studying along with a built-in wardrobe and even a full-sized bookcase along with all the typical features of a bedroom. The en-suites were distinctly western in style in that the shower was fixed in a 400 foot tall booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce each of them had determined where they'd sleep Sakura made the offer to undo the shrinking spell on their luggage, in turn Tomoyo subsequently suggested that they really should start unpacking before they discuss the situation.

Hikaru was given the task to get water from a nearby river to drink, which she did without hesitation, smiling as she carried a bucket to a nearby river. But when she got there, she saw a figure in the shallow end of the water.  It looked like a human boy, no taller than maybe 4 or 5 inches, and he seemed to be entangled in something in the water, making him unable to move as he flailed his arms in worry. Hikaru quickly pulled the boy out of the water and saw that he was entagled in some sort of weeds, which she quickly snapped off from him. Having then rescued the boy and returning him gently to the ground, Hikaru quickly saw herself caught in a puff of smoke, coughing during it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds she saw in the smoke the boy from earlier, who was now almost her size! When the smoke disappeared, she got a better look at the boy. He seemed to look no older than 9 or 10 years old, and he had short brown hair, big, green eyes, a skinny build, and was wearing a sleeveless black shirt and tathered, brown shorts that went with his brown shoes. The boy then smiled to Hikaru, kissing her left arm, causing her to blush and freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what are you!?\" she asked, not so much scared as she was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Adio\", he told the girl, bowing his head to her. \"A magic trainee, age 9. Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Hikaru Shidou, age 14. Nice to meet you too\", Hikaru happily replied, bowing her head down as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh!? You're 14?!\" Adio asked in shock, who then noticed Hikaru's head hanging down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that\", Adio quickly apologized, seeing Hikaru's smile return once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright\", she told the boy, nerviously waving her hands as the boy continued to look depressed. \"A lot of people confuse me for someone younger due to my short stature. I suppose what you did right now was...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, a shrink spell\", Adio told the girl, now out of his worried mood from earlier. \"As you can see, I'm not quite used to my magic yet. I was trying to levitate my body across the river, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\", Hikaru said as she stood right in front of the boy. \"So...how DO you do your spells, Adio-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just say some words and it happens. No book, no incantations, no wands or anything of that sort\", Adio explained to the girl. \"That's about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat\", smiled Hikaru. \"I wish I could do that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually quite difficult to do so, Hikaru-san. In fact, I'm one of the youngest trainees in the history of the school, and I'm a novice at best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the fact that you could wield such magic must be something you'll be proud of in the future\", Hikaru said, smiling yet again. \"I wish you luck in that regard.\" Hikaru then scooped up some water from the lake with the bucket Umi had given her and went on her way, waving good-bye to the boy. \"Good luck, Adio-kun\", she smiled to the boy once again, but Adio continued to look on at Hikaru as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl saved my life\", he said to himself. \"I made light of her height before, but now I'll make it so that no one ever makes fun of her height again.\" Adio then concentrated his body, putting his hands to his heart as he began to enchant a haiku that, following it, would make Hikaru about half a foot or so taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic that I wield,<br>\r\nPlease help this girl grow in height.<br>\r\nHelp Hikaru-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the spell he performed manifested into a little beam of light that he aimed at Hikaru, aiming straight at her back. It didn't hurt Hikaru, though: in fact, the girl didn't notice it at all. But only a few moments later, Hikaru felt a strange wamrth all over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel really funny all of a sudden\", she said, putting down the bucket. Hikaru then looked at her hands, which were now bigger than her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\", Hikaru gasped, noticing her feet growing to twice their original size too. \"What's happening to me!?\" she asked herself as she watched the rest of her body increase in size as well, from her legs all the way up to her head. Each part grew bit by bit until every part of Hikaru's body, from her toes to her hair, was around four times the size it used to be. The formerly short 14-year old was now a 19-foot tall giantess. Hikaru then looked around her surroundings, more than a little scared of how small everything was in comparison to her. Then she turned herself around and saw Adio, who froze still like a statue at the sight of the giantess Hikaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad\", he said to himself in fear. \"I only wanted to make her grow to 5 feet and 5 inches or so...\" Adio then tried to run, but Hikaru quickly saw the boy and walked to him, which was faster than his running speed. She picked up Adio with her hands, proceeding then to sit on the ground on her knees, placing the boy on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adio-kun, I appreciate you caring about my height and everything\", Hikaru smiled a little, patting his head with her right hand. \"But being this big kind of...scares me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But didn't you always want to be taller?\" he asked the girl. \"From your reaction earlier, you seemed upset by your height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but not like THIS\", she said, pointing to herself and looking a little scared. Just then, Hikaru heard Umi and Fuu's voices, causing Hikaru to freeze right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hikaru, where are you!? I'm getting hungry!\", an annoyed Umi said from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been gone for a while, Hikaru-san. Is something wrong?\" Fuu asked, following Umi. The duo's questions would soon be answered when they got to the river and saw the giantess Hikaru in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hikaru!? / Hikaru-san!?\" Umi and Fuu asked at the same time, both in complete and utter shock and disbelief. Umi then proceeded to pinch herself, hoping what she saw wasn't real, only to find out it was when she cried \"Ouch\" a few moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi, guys\", a worried Hikaru said in reply, lifting up her left hand slowly to say \"hello\".</span></div></div>",

They couldn't believe what they were seeing..their friend, formerly the smallest of the group, towered over them by 14 feet! The size difference was amazing to them! Although worried about her current situation, Hikaru decided to take this opportunity to show off her new size to her friends, who used to tease her for her short stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she did was take Umi and Fuu's weapons and hold them up in the air well above her head. She watched as Fuu pleaded to put back their her sword, and watched as Umi tried to climb up the mini-giantess' leg to get hers back. It was for naught, though, as Hikaru violently shook her leg until Umi fell off (but not before she plucked a few leg hairs from the tall red head, causing her to cry a little from the pain).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, Hikaru! Give them back!\" Umi demanded, watching as Hikaru simply continued to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\", she replied, placing their weapons at the top of a 12 foot tree near by. \"If you can climb it, you can get them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hikaru-san!!\" Fuu cried, looking very upset by her friend's recent behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You two stop!\" she yelled at her friends, looking angry (and yet sad) at them. \"Ever since I stepped foot in Cephiro, you and Umi-chan have on-and-off made fun of my height! Now you know how it feels to be picked on by someone talller than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see\", a snide Umi snickered as she stared at the young boy who caused her to become big in the first place. \"Oh, Adddddddiiiioooooo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" the boy hesitated to answer, knowing where this was going. Umi inched closer and closer to the young magician, dragging Fuu along with her right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you pleeeease make me and my friend Fuu quadruple our current size?\" the blue-haired girl asked in a fake nice voice. \"It would be sooo nice of you to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do it, Adio-kun!\" pleaded Hikaru. \"They just want to be taller than me again and continue to mock my height!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hikaru-san, calm down\", Fuu asked of her friend, tears running down her eyes. \"I'm very sorry for making fun of your height before.\" Fuu then bowed her down in apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuu-chan, I forgive you!\" the now happy Hikaru smiled, hugging her friend in her arms. She then retrieved the swords of Umi and Fuu's she earlier put in the tree. \"And here's your sword back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much\", Fuu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru then turned around to apologize to Umi for her earlier behavior, but something was about to happen to her before she could do so..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umi-chan, I want to apolog-g-g..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru was shocked by what she saw before her; a growing Umi! The mini-giantess watched as her companion shot up to 6 feet, then to 8, 11, and even further, finally stopping at...</span></div></div>",

Hikaru had a smug grin on her face which gave Umi a bad feeling.  \"So, um.. what was that about?\" Umi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I taught Hikaru the basics of size changing magic.  It was easy enough since she already has some magic power.  Now she can decide her size.  And your sizes too in fact.\"  Adio said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!  I wanna learn that!\"  Umi exclaimed happily.  But when Adio just grinned, she got nervous.  \"You were planning to teach all of us, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, no.  I'm sure Hikaru can handle it for all three of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you..!\"  Umi started marching angrily up to Adio, but didn't get far before she was grabbed from behind by a hand bigger than her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Umi.\" said Hikaru, grinning.  Umi attempted to get out of Hikaru's grasp, pushing hard on the massive fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuu decided to step in then.  \"Do be careful Miss Hikaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru simply grinned.  \"Don't worry Fuu, I'm not exerting any pressure; my hand is relaxed in fact.\"  Upon hearing this Umi realized the futility of her attempt.  She could barely move Hikaru's fingers even when Hikaru wasn't using her hand muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I give up.\"  Umi said.  Hikaru smiled and placed her once more on the ground before turning to Adio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much Adio!  I'm sure this magic will be useful in our journey.\"  Hikaru grinned merrily, causing Umi to wonder what \"uses\" Hikaru had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to help, but I need to get back to my school.  Farewell, and have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farewell, and I will!\"  Hikaru called back as Adio left.  Umi and Fuu merely exchanged glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at their camp, Mokona had fortunately been watching their lunches.  They ate quietly until Fuu had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hikaru, can you enlarge our food?  That would certainly make it last longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea, Fuu!\"  Umi said.  \"This magic might be helpful after all.  Let me find something...\"  Umi leaned over their food basket and began sorting through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get another bucket of water, maybe that can be enlarged too,\" Fuu said before heading off to the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru got a mischievous idea then and with a word, the basket started growing rapidly.  Umi, unprepared for this, fell into it and landed in a pile of giant bread, much to Hikaru's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, Hikaru!\"  Umi cried in response to Hikaru's giggling.  \"This is way too big, shrink it back down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oookay!\" Hikaru said merrily as she concentrated once again.  The basket shrunk back down to normal size.  All its contents shrank with it, Umi included.  \"This is fun!\"  Hikaru said, \"I'm going to check our tent for what else might be useful bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, shrink it back down first!\" Umi cried out, unaware that Hikaru had already done so since everything she could see had shrunk at the same rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fuu came back with the water, her stomach growled.  She went over to the basket to see what they had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmi saw a giant shadow over the basket and took cover under a piece of bread.  \"Oh, Hikaru's really going too far\"  she muttered.  However, it was Fuu's hand rather than Hikaru's that reached in and picked up one of the sandwiches... unluckily, it was the very one Umi was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuu prepared to take a giant bite from the sandwich...</span></div></div>",

The girls all felt the cold, heavy breezes of wind blowing on them, struggling with each moving step to press onward. While it wasn't enough to, say, lift them off the ground, it did knock them back a little bit. This continued for a couple more hours until the wind started to clear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally\", said an annoyed Umi, shivering a little from the cold winds that blew on her skirtfor the last 2 hours. \"It's cleared up.\" Hikaru and Fuu, however, simply smiled, glad that the wind had finally cleared up..or so they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a wind more powerful than the one from before began to blow. It was much faster and stronger now, and unlike last time, capable of lifting the girls up from the ground. As the girls foudn themselves 10 feet (and inching ever higher) from the ground, Hikaru tried to grab her friends' hands. She succeeded in grabbing both Umi and Fuu's hands, but the strong winds made it difficult for them to hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hikaru-san, I can't hold on much longer\", cried Fuu, finding it difficult to hold on to her friends' hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'n having a hard time as well\", Umi added, looking very worried in the wind storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep trying, Umi-chan and Fuu-chan!\" encouraged Hikaru, looking worried herself. \"We can't give up now. Cephiro is depending on u...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before could Hikaru could finish her sentence, she let go her grasp on Fuu's right hand, and Hikaru and Umi found themselves spinning in a sprial far left from Fuu's reach. Fuu, meanwhile, found herself spinning upwards higher and higher and to the right. Usually the most calm member of the group, Fuu was downright scared as the wind blew her every which way, though thankfully she hadn't hit anything during her travels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the wind died down, and Fuu found herself proceeding slowly downwards to a small lake below her field of vision. Fuu hoped that the water was deep enough for her to land safely in, a question she found the answer quickly when she landed in it. The water was at least 20 or so feet deep, enough for Fuu to fall in and get out quickly without worry of it being too shallow. Once out of the lake, Fuu started to ring the water out of her school uniform, then proceeded to view her surroundings. But there wasn't too much for the girl to look at: outside of a few bushes here and there, trees, tree stumps, and a lot of grass around the lake area, Fuu couldn't see any animal or person there. Perhaps this was a place unnoticed by travelers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Fuu saw a sight she couldn't believe coming out from a tree stump not too far away..a 10-inch tall ant! Fuu was amazed by its size, wondering if that kind of thing was normal in Cephiro. She then saw the ant nibble a little bit on something she didn't notice earlier in the bushes..some little, red berries in the bush. As the ant ate a single berry from the tree, he grew slightly bigger than he was before. When he ate a few more, the spurts were even bigger. Fuu was absolutely amazed by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious by the berries, Fuu proceeded to see the bush herself and picked up six berries from it in her left hand. She then heard her stomach rumbling, hungry after walking in the wind for two hours straight. Fuu then looked at the berries in her hand and questioned to herself if she should eat them. What if they were poisonous to humans? What if the effects will be different on her? Fuu was pretty hungry even for some small berries, contemplating until she heard approaching footsteps from nearby. Fuu decided to put the berries in her pocket and look around her. The Magic Knight then quickly drew out her sword, asking, \"Who's there?\" to the sound in front of her. The figure slowly emerged from the shady side of the tree: it was Ferio!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ferio-san!!\" Fuu smiled to the boy, coming right up to him. \"What a coincidence to see you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard something over here and decided to check it out\", Ferio told the girl. \"That was quite a splash you made. Are you alright? And where are your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little wet, but otherwise I'm fine\", Fuu smiled to Ferio, but then looked sad soon afterwards. \"I got separated from Hikaru-san and Umi-san in a wind storm..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a pretty breezy place around here\", said Ferio, looking slightly worried himself. \"I just hope your friends didn't get stranded too far from here. I heard a giant bird lives around the lake area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big?\" Fuu asked, nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 30 feet tall or so\", Ferio told the girl. \"Apparently around here there's something that makes the animals grow big.\" When Ferio mentioned \"something\", Fuu noticed the berries she picked up before and showed them to Ferio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ferio-san, I think these might be what's causing the animals to grow\", she said to the boy, holding up the berries in her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Those things are too small\", he said in a teasing tone of voice, plopping the berries, one at a time, into Fuu's mouth, causing her to gasp. \"It's probably something else..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's true, Ferio-san!\" Fuu tried to tell Ferio, pointing to the berry bush she ate from before. \"I saw a ten-inch tall ant over there before. And now that you plopped those berries in my mouth, Ferio-san, I'm going to...to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get sick?\" asked a worried Ferio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\", Fuu sadly sighed. \"I'm going to get..big..ger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was then a pause after this. A fairly long one. But it was broken by the laughter of Ferio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're silly. People can't get that b..b-b..\" Ferio continued to laugh until he saw Fuu glow slighty, scaring the girl as she glowed. He then noticed the sight of a growing Fuu, which freaked out even Fuu herself. The 14-year old Magic Knight watched as her body started to expand and grow before Ferio's eyes, beginning with the growth of her shoes, then everything upwards, from her legs, stomach, hands, arms, hair, until finally her head. Within 25 seconds the growth began and stopped, and right before Ferio stood a 40 foot-tall Fuu, her hands on her face in shock at the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ferio-san!!\" the girl cried as tears came down her face, sittng down butt first onto the ground and picking up the boy in her big hands, placing him right beside her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuu, I'm sorry\", Ferio tried to apologize. \"I didn't know it was true. I never even heard of those berries before.\" Fuu then proceeded to calm down, picking up the boy and slowly placing him on her chest. Then she gathered her arms together and gently hugged the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident, Ferio-san. You don't need to apologize\", Fuu smiled to the boy, blushing a little over his being cute to her at her taller stature. \"But now we won't have as difficult a time finding my friends, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll help you find them\", Ferio chimed in, looking confident as he placed his right hand on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, Ferio-san!\" Fuu smiled, hugging the boy once again, which caused him to blush rapidly. \"I won't let you down.\"</span></div></div>",

Only Mokona seemed to be cool with what he saw. Everything else (Ferio included) was simply awestruck to even ask what to do about the current predicament at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, everyone\", Fuu apologized, getting on her hands. \"I didn't mean for this to happen..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you grow so big in the first place, Fuu-chan?\" Hikaru, now over the initial shock, asked her giant friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...there's these berries from a bsh right behind me that have special powers that allow whoever eats them to grow in size. It seems that each time you eat a single one, it increases your default size by two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By two? How do you it's that precise?\" Umi hesitated to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because when Ferio-san force fed me the berries earlier, I was holding eight of them. And now look at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuu then proceeded to stand up straight in the air, watching as Hikaru and Umi stood backside to her gigantic legs. Carefully lifting the two normal sized girls on top of one another, Fuu was able to find out that they, indeed, were about one-eight her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You weren't joking!\" exclaimed Hikaru. \"I personally wouldn't mind being a little bigger too, actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's a good idea, Hikaru-san\", warned Fuu. \"I have no idea ow to reverse this, and if I do something else I might only make it worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru paid no mind to what her giantess friend said as she looked at the bush containing the berries. The red-haired Magic Knight noticed that the berries came in several different colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which color berry did you eat, Fuu-chan?\" Hikaru politely asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were blue. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I see three other colored berries. Red, purple, and orange....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru then grabbed a hold of two of each of the three different colored berries that Fuu didn't previously eat and  held them in her hand. She then experimented with one of the orange berries, plopping it in her mouth and waiting for something to happen. Indeed something did...though it was no better than Fuu's growth. Umi gave Hikaru a very frightened stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Umi-chan? You look sc...huh? What's wrong with my voice!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru still hadn't realized yet that she had shrunk to only a fifth her regular size! The berries she once held easily in her hand now felt like miniature bowling balls. Mokona looked like a full-sized bear. And Fuu looked even more like a towering giantess than she had earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! What's going on!?\" the short girl began to cry, slowing putting the red berry in her mouth. It wasn't easy, though, as its much bigger size took much looker for it to be gulped down that the orange berry did. Hikaru found herself relieved that she was slowly growing again, but no one knew how long it would last..</span></div></div>",

But in reality, thanks to the help of two plush-sized dinosaurs, she has the ability to transform into a beautiful 15 year-old idol singer under the name Fancy Lala. Today, however, was one of Miho's days off, and the eager girl was in her room drawing away on her bed. One of her dinosaur friends, Mogu, was curious as to what Miho was drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Mogu asked Miho as she drew. Upon questioning she stopped and proceeded to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me standing next to a house,\" the cheerful girl explained, her picture showing her roughly thrice the size she normally was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know recall you being that tall,\" Mogu told Miho in reply, causing the girl to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know. I drew it just for fun. Though if I DID end up that tall, it would be quite weird. Think of how much I would have to eat. My room would probably have to be rearranged just for me to sit down.\" Miho continued to smile to herself as she continued to draw. Of course, now that she talked about being bigger, curiosity sparked the little girl's mind. Miho got out her magic sketchbook and pen quickly drew up on a bottle the size of your typical water bottle with the words \"growth potion\" on it. She then said the words \"dabu dabu\", causing the bottle to come out of her sketchbook and plop down on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance, there was nothing special about it. Aside from the words \"growth potion\" labeled on it, it looked like a typical water bottle. But for the sake of curiosity Miho quickly drank down its contents, causing Mogu and Pigu to look out in shock as to what she was doing. When she finally finished up the water she placed it in the trash bin in her room and then sat back down on her bed once again. The girl impatiently waited for something to happen, and the seconds turned to minutes, and then to hours.  Lunch passed, dinner passed, she did her homework, she got a bath, and still no sign of growth. Even when she went to sleep she felt nothing, sleeping a peaceful, non-eventful sleep...at least for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what had to be pure irony, though, the growth started the next morning, which was a Sunday. As Miho was picking out he clothes for the day, the girl felt a strange surge in her body, like she had just been punched in the gut. She quickly ran over to her mirror and noticed she was growing! Miho was now at least a little over 5 feet high, about the height of most high school girls. She grew an additional 5 inches while staring in the mirror, now up to the height of 5 feet and 8 inches. Though her clothes were keeping up, Miho still thought it was weird that she was actually growing. She quickly proceeded to wake up Mogu and Pigu, who were more than a little shocked when they saw a 6 foot tall Miho before their very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?!\" Pigu asked in shock and awe. Mogu was too speechless to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turns out I can make myself bigger\", Miho fake laughed, trying to cover up the fact that she was actually fairly scared of growing bigger. The spurts were getting bigger, and the length between them shorter. In less than a minute Miho grew from 6 feet to 6 and a half, then to 7 feet and 3 inches, then 8 feet and 8 inches, and then almost 11 feet. Miho finally stopped growing at 15 feet, the girl sitting butt down on the ground, her knees bending to prevent her from kicking down her own room's walls. As Miho observed her new size, she wondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Of course, at her new height she had to be careful about the ladder that led her up there, and she had to be even more careful about knocking the plants over..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Miho made her way up there with no problem, pausing and stretching as she saw not only the plants, but the neighborhood as well. At her new height she was able to observe the town quite well, even seeing her friend Akiru's house from her perspective. Seeing the town at this new mini-giantess size almost wanted Miho to grow some more to see the town from a higher perspective. Almost.

No sooner had Uotani relaxed that tremors started up with such a rythmic pattern that they seemed unnatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tohru's waves are getting stronger.\" Hanajima commented as the tremors continued and the amount of light entering through the balcony window/door became significantly lower in such a short length of time. \"She's outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HANA, UO, HELLO!\" Tohru greeted them, her voice booming and echoing around the room.

Uo wasn't sure if Tohru would be able to handle them without damaging the room and/or anything in it and Hana didn't think that Tohru could pick them up at such a massive size without taking the bed as well. Somehow Tohru managed to gently slip her two friends into her palm before wrapping her tree-sized digits around them, forming a protective wall around them with her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully withdrawing her hand from the bedroom, Tohru concentrated as hard as she could to prevent herself from dropping or squashing her tiny friends, who she felt such compassion for that they were the only ones she could treasure more than any of the Sohma family.

Once Tohru was only a head taller than the dollhouse she stood up on the tabletop and walked over to the 'house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was incredible, Tohru!\" Uo exclaimed, although seeing Tohru as bigger than Godzilla was overwhelming enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I less intimidating now?\" Tohru asked them as they stood on the balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we could ever describe you as intimidating.\" Hana commented. \"But you are easier to comprehend when you are only about ten times bigger than us.\" Tohru simply smiled  and then shrank even smaller until she could enter the main door to the 'house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tohru made her way up the stairs Uo and Hana exited the master bedroom and went towards the stairs before they met on the landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Uo commented. \"You're more powerful than Hana here.\" Hanajima did not argue and simply said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is astonishing, Tohru.

However, there were no other animals there, or other people either. all there was was a single house in the center of the field. I went inside to ask someone where I was, but only saw a bottle and a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The note talked about how the person knew I felt 'too small' at times when it came to having my opinions heard, which is weird because I don't think like that at all. It then explained that the drink was just a simply, ordinary drink, but that it contained a 'special something' just for me. I didn't drink the bottle, but when I woke up the next morning it was beside me next to my bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...that's quite odd\", observed Hana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that morning I thought that Shigure-san left me a drink or something for me to drink. The night before I came home late from work and was very, very tired, so I headed right up to my bed to sleep. Then I drank the drink the first thing this morning! And shortly after I shrunk to an even higher smaller height than we are right now! But then I wished to be normal sized again, and thus I grew back to normal. I also went to see if I could shrink by thinking about them as well, and I imagined my bed pillow shrinking to a tenth its size. It worked! It was really strange! But I didn't tell anyone else about it yet because I didn't want to burden them or upset them..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how did we shrink?\" wondered Uotani. \"I don't remember coming up to your room..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see, when you and Hana-chan came by earlier this morning, I must've bumped into you guys and imagined you shrinking accidentally! I brought you up here as quick I could before anyone saw you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you were waiting for us to wake up?\" Hana asked her worried looking friend, who simply nodded in response. \"Hmm....that's quite interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but I'm not a fan of being tiny. Tohru, you can reverse this any time, right?\" shrugged Uotani as she left stepped further away from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure can!\" Tohru replied with a smile. \"As soon as we leave the dollhouse, I'll return you two to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, this is quite interesting..\", Hana stated. \"I never imagined shrinking would be part of our future when I first met you, Tohru-kun..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?

Instead of being four feet and just over seven and a quarter inches she noticed that she had shrunk to four feet and a little over five inches.

She scanned the words. It read: \"Don't let him be sedcued. Join the Prince Yuki Fan Club and save the school president.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are stubborn.\" Hana commented. \"But they are fools.

The tallest of them only came up to Tohru's chin.

Once he was sure of her intentions Shigure accepted her offer and, unsure of what to do next, Tohru just slipped him into her pocket and went back to the cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly half an hour later Yuki came in from his vegetable patch and, upon seeing Tohru dealing with the dishes, said hello and, just as she turned round and began saying hello back, he too spontaneously shrank.

As Tohru picked it up and wondered where it would work best she couldn't help but think it was too easy to find this miniature house, especially since she'd never seen it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she found that Shigure's bedroom had the room, the elevation and the environment that would suit a home for people smaller than her fingers; every time she put the house down, though, it always felt that it wouldn't work until she placed it about eight inches away from the wall to the left of the door and one foot away from the wall that had the door in it, then it was like it had found its foundations. Bewildered but deciding not to look a gift house[sic] in the mouth she then went back downstairs to recover her shrinkees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she entered the living area she saw that Kyo was after Yuki's blood again and Shigure was doing whatever he could to hold him back. Strolling over to the table she swiftly snatched up Kyo in one hand and Yuki in the other; suspending them at shoulder height she noticed how her fists engulfed every part of their bodies below the shoulder blades. The sensation of being grasped by Tohru's mighty hands caused them to forget their animosity and instead look up at Tohru with a new sense of wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just came back to tell you that I've found somewhere for you to stay.\" She told them; this made them cool off and go with the flow as Tohru slipped them into separate pockets and then pick Shigure up in one hand to carry them to their new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving set them down at the front door of the 'dollhouse' Tohru explained to them how she found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems a little too good to be true.\" Yuki commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean, Yuki,\" Tohru responded from above, \"It's like it just dropped out of the sky.\" Shigure opened the door and looked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not so sure about that.\" He said. \"If it had fallen out of the sky all the furniture would be jumbled.\" This seriously bewildered the three outside; as Yuki and Kyo walked in to look at the living room that Shigure had spotted Tohru bent down to peer inside the bedroom windows. It was like a freshly furnished house with clean linen and fuzzy carpets.</span></div></div>",

She went over various possibilities:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: She uses one normal-sized bowl and everyone shares; this would put them in danger if she became distracted and any of them fell in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: She takes three thimbles for their soup; they would still have oversized helpings and it might seem undignified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: ???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuck for a perfect answer she made as though she was going for the first option and then put the bowl in the oven to keep the soup warm while she went upstairs to check something with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down in front of the 'house', she saw them waiting at the front door with, to her surprise, tiny soup bowls and what looked like spoons. Giving them a gentle smile she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just checking to see that your crockery arrangements are satisfactory.\" With that she rose to her feet and stomped downstairs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir dinner was an unusual affair for an unusual situation; the Sohmas were in the little dining room at the front of their new 'house' while Tohru knelt outside with her bowl of soup taking up the entire view from the dining room window. It was fortunate that Yuki had found a ladle to their size and that Tohru had procured a schoolbook for them to use as a platform to reach over the rim. A pre-dinner conversation led to them agreeing that, unless they could find a way to reverse this strange force, they would have to live as Tohru's tenants and effectively see anything normal-sized as belonging to Tohru regardless as to who owned it before they shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...</span></div></div>",

Everyone was amazed to find that the 'house' for the Sohmas had a supply of electricity and water, allowing them to wash the tiny bowls and spoons; aside from shelter from the oversized natural world outdoors and food they were generally as independent as they were before shrinking. Even so they felt as though they owed Tohru for all she was doing for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tohru was turning down her bed a sudden thought occured to her; if she found herself shrinking people smaller than her fingers just by looking at them that would mean she'd never be able to properly interact with anyone normal-size again. There was a difficult decision she had to make: Cover her eyes and live blind outside the building she's come to think of as home to prevent anyone else being shrunk or become a caretaker for a new world of tiny people, including obtaining those she looks upon before they misinterpret her apparent gigantic stature and get lost in a huge and dangerous world. All through getting ready for bed she struggled with this decision; she wanted to help people, which would warranty becoming blind in the eyes of society, but she also wanted to be honest and sociable, which would mean looking at people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got to bed she thought about the consequences of each. The next day would be a school day, meaning lots of people getting shrunk if she saw them. She asked her mother's soul what she should do.</span></div></div>",

Thinking it over Tohru realised that her question had been answered, she would have to spend her life looking after tiny people; she wondered how logistics would work if, when she went to pay for supplies, the people she would pay shrank. Deciding to cross that bridge when she reached it she got up and prepared for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten dressed and everything she popped into what used to be Shigure's room and knelt down outside of the little house to say good morning to her friends. It was interesting to see; Shigure was in the living room looking to see if miniature writing equipment was available, Kyo was still in bed having taken one of the front bedrooms and, when she lay down beside the house, she could see Yuki in the kitchen. Once they had all said good morning, and Kyo had calmed round after Tohru mighty voice awoke him from his sleep, she informed them that she was going to get them some breakfast. Once again she inquired as to what they'd like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pancakes.\" Shigure replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Onigiri.\" Kyo told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Porridge.\" Yuki suggested.

Going downstairs she considered the possibility of pouring the smallest amounts of batter possible into the frying pan in the hopes of making Sohma-sized pancakes instead of making herself full-sized pancakes and giving the others crumbs from her giant plate. This shocked her as she found that she was now thinking of herself as the giant one rather than her friends as the tiny ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on she prepared for her first attempt at making mini-pancakes, placing the smallest possible dribble of batter and swirled it around but not too much so there would still be a bit of thickness in it. The result was a pancakes the size of a large coin or the dining room table in the Sohmas' new lodgings; Tohru put it on her plate as a quick bite and tried again, resulting in the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Tohru had used up all the batter and had a large stack of pancakes the size of coins. Seeing no alternative she decided to give them one of these pancakes and let them cut it up between them. Looking at what could be used as flavouring she realised that they could not specify their selection, they'd have to settle for one flavouring to share. Sighing at the difficulty she was having Tohru took the plate and extras and went back up to what could now be thought of as the 'lodging room'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon kneeling down in front of the house she noticed that there was a latch on one side; upon releasing it the whole facade could be swung open, allowing Tohru to access any of the front rooms easily, so she took one of the little pancakes and, after Yuki had realised what had to be done and fetched the biggest plate the kitchen had, set it down right in the middle. Once they were all seated she asked what they'd like on the pancake, fortunately they all agreed on maple syrup, so she managed to only place a few drops on the pancake before returning the facade to its original position and starting on her own breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had all finished and Tohru had finished her washing up she returned to her bedroom to get her things together for school, only to discover...</span></div></div>",

Going over and looking through she was most surprised by what was available:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA net like those used for catching butterflies, only with smaller holes; a lock-picking set with some bizarre device that could deactivate security systems, a gyroscope with tiny bedsits in it allowing her to hold it any way without the... rooms being tossed, a magnifying glass, a pair of tweezers and a logbook. Tohru could not fathom how this appeared nor figure out why she suddenly had such a convenient set of materials; it was as though someone meant for her to shrink everyone she came across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in that way you do when you realise that something isn't particularly bad but you'd rather do without it when you can't, Tohru carefully took the backpack and reorganised the contents so they would be easier to access and anyone she found would feel more comfortable in transit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set this pack down at the top of the stairs while she considered what provisions she should make for those who were already tiny while she'd be out. She went downstairs and gathered together some perishables on a plate so that, if they wanted, they could get something to eat while she was away. Having set this down at a reasonable distance from the little house she explained all she could to them before saying goodbye for now.

She entered the school grounds, only changing her angle of vision slightly so that anyone she did see wouldn't be too far to take, and felt at the handle for the net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever hardly anyone was outside at this time and, before Tohru knew it, the homeroom bell sounded and, out of habit, her face shot up and she dashed through the corridors. There were people around but her eyes could not rest on them as she dashed to her classroom. Once at the door she remembered the shrinking hex her gaze had, understanding that no matter how late she may be as soon as the teacher turned to face her s/he would be immediately miniaturised. Taking another deep breath, drawing the net from her bag, she opened the door to the classroom and waited for the teacher to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honda.\" He addressed her. \"You're five minu...\" She opened her eyes as soon as he started the word minute, causing him to apparently vanish as far as the other students were concerned. Tohru walked into the class and closed the door behind her before preparing for everyone else to be inevitably shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry everyone.\" She said as she turned her gaze upon each and every student, including her two friends, and waited until all were invisible from such a distance and then put her bag down in front of the door in case the gap underneath was wide enough for them to squeeze through.

She soon noticed the little man scampering towards the underside of his desk, presumably in the mistaken idea that she would either not see him there or be unable to reach him there. With a swift but unpracticed and, therefore, crude flick of her wrist she brought the net right down on top of him, immediately making him her property. Retrieving the far end of this net she looked through the fine mesh at her homeroom teacher, cowering under her gaze. With a sympathetic sigh she fumbled with the net until there was nothing but his own shrunken clothes separating him from her hand. Now Tohru had to decide whether to put him in her... 'transport' was the only word she could find for the gyroscope, or put him in her pocket and grab some of the students before packing them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over Tohru decided that she would make her homeroom teacher the first in the transport as he was the nearest catch and it would probably indicate to everyone else that making for the door would only make it easier for her to capture them. Having made her way over to the bag she opened it up and reached for the gyroscope, opening one of the 'carriages', as it seemed appropriate to call them, before depositing her teacher on the bed inside. Now she thought about all the students in the room with her; would they be on their chairs and easy pickings for her, on their desks and also easy pickings unless they could jump out of a window, or on the floor and vulnerable to her giant footwear.</span></div></div>",

She turned her attention to the chair and there, curled up into a ball, a tiny boy trembled in terror. Considering the net to be overkill in this situation she put it down on the floor and carefully reached for her next captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be scared.\" She whispered to him, carefully placing her fingers upon his back. \"I'm not going to harm you.\" Once his tiny head looked up into her eyes she gently slipped him into the palm of her hand and carried him over to the transport. Once he was safe inside Tohru now thought of who she should pick up next. Eventually deciding to do it systematically, going from the nearest desk along the rows as opposed to along the columns. She checked each chair and always identified the shrinkee on the seat before snatching them humanely and putting them in her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recovered the logbook after taking the last student on the first row and wrote down everyone she had possession of and even remembered enough to write down where and when she got them, including Shigure, Yuki and Kyo from yesterday.

Tohru was gigantic but still cared for in spite of her new status as a living doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean...?\" Uo asked, Tohru nodded with a muffled acknowledgement. \"Well, it's not like my father would notice.\" Tohru sighed again and scooped Uo up in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is strange even for you to be sarcastic about this.\" She commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarcastic?\" Uo responded. \"I'm serious! My dad wouldn't care if I ended up in your stomach.\" Tohru was doulbe-shocked by this; the idea that she'd eat her friend and the suggestion that Uo's dad didn't care about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tohru spoke up after getting over the latest information, \"Don't you worry about a thing, Uo. You'll live with me from now on; I promise I'll look after you.\" With that she pressed the penlid-size girl against one of her cheeks, demonstrating the love and affection she would adorn all familiar faces in her captivity. The sudden change in position knocked the wind out of Uo but she reached as far as she could with her arms, at one point feeling the edge of her lips with her fingertips; it really struck home how small she was, knowing that Tohru really could gobble her up if she wanted to, especially when she felt one of the giantess's molars through the skin against her leg. \"Anyway,\" Tohru continued as she withdrew Uo from her face, \"Would you rather ride in a speical compartment in my backpack like the other students, join Hana in my pocket, or have a pocket all to yourself?\"</span></div></div>",

She made an extensive hesitation, wondering if her silhouette would be visible from the inside. She looked down at her two friends, who were barely discernable in the gloom of her pockets but could still be seen lying on their backs smiling up at the giant face, and smiled back at them. She lowered the hand that she would not bear the net with into the respective pocket and petted the occupant, who even managed to return the favour and stroke her digits, while she gave a reassuring glance into the other pocket as the girl in there did what she could to poke her head out and acknowledge Tohru's kindness for effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this was all finished Tohru had the courage to open the door and look at the class. She slid it open and looked around as the occupants turned to face her, all apparently vanishing as they did so. Once there was no one left within her field of vision Tohru closed the door behind her and put her backpack down, propped up against it, as she retrieved her net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she do the same approach here as she did with her own class?</span></div></div>",

The tiny woman reacted differently to her own teacher; while he attempted to sprint for a tight corner she stood there staring at Tohru's shoes as they thundered towards her. Once Tohru began to crouch over her she slowly backed away having noticed the net she was carrying. She was quick to figure, however, that it would be futile to flee from such a huge girl and, instead, sat on the floor hugging her knees. A shadow fell on her and, before she had a chance to see, she was engulfed by Tohru's hand. There was a hint of a yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Tohru whispered into her fist, \"I won't harm you.\" With that she opened her hand and looked at the tiny teacher lying in the palm. She looked up and gasped in shock at the sight of Tohru's looming face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...p...please,\" She squeaked, \"Let me go.\" Tohru's look of concern intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I did,\" She answered, \"How could you be sure of your safety? I'll look after you and many others. I'll do what I can to keep you warm and well-fed. I'll even try to find ways to relieve any boredom you'll experience.\" The little lady swallowed; she still wasn't sure if Tohru would be so caring. However there was no option, she simply let Tohru carry her over to the carrier and be set down in a vacant bedsit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Tohru went around the classroom; across, then down. This time she had to keep her eyes on the floor as some of the students were standing up when she saw them; her net was of particular use here as they were constantly trying to escape, fearing she'd commit unspeakable acts on her captives. As for the two acquiantances of hers in this class, who does she find first?</span></div></div>",

She was only a yard away from the front door before it opened and Tomoyo popped out from behind it to enthusiastically greet her friend and loved one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long all three of them were in Tomoyo's bedroom whereupon Kero immediately flew up to Tomoyo's eye level and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really bake a cake?\" Tomoyo smiled and responed affirmatively, knowing all too well how keen he was on cake. Going over to the coffee table she opened a box to reveal a strawberry tart, which Kero looked upon with ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kero-chan,\" Sakura told him, \"We don't eat until we've dealt with what Tomoyo-chan asked us over for.\" While Kero sulked Tomoyo immediately produced a tape measure, expressing her desire to measure Sakura for new costumes. In spite of Sakura's confusion since she thought of Tomoyo's costumes always fitting her Tomoyo said that Sakura was going through a growth spurt.</span></div></div>",

She had asked Tomoyo to meet up with her and they had arranged to meet at the Daidouji mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir talk was quite heated. Tomoyo wished that they could do something together but Sakura couldn't consider anything special they could do, since they had been playing together at just about every form of sport and child's play they could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tomoyo suggested, \"Could you use magic to help with this?\" Sakura had thought about this but was unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Tomoyo,\" Sakura replied, \"I had always thought that the cards were only to be used in emergencies.\" Tomoyo just smiled as she thought of a loophole in her argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kero-chan wasn't too worried about emergencies when he wanted to make the most of my strawberry tart.\" She answered, Sakura sweat-dropped as she remembered that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her first encounter with the Little card. It shrunk her to the size of her thumb and also drained her magical ability, leaving her in a giant world with only her athletic skills to ensure her safety. It was fortunate that Kero caught up with her so she could catch up with it and return to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura kept replaying these memories in her mind she found her imagination distorting two of the scenarios. One where she witnessed her brother on the move from such a small scale, and another when she caught up with the Little card before Tomoyo's eyes. Now she was imagining how it would've been if Tomoyo was the one to enter the kitchen. That thought caused this unusual feeling deep inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Tomoyo.\" Sakura commented as she considered a compromise.</span></div></div>",

Kero also picked up on the card's presence. Just then a glowing yellow dot moved across the room like a flea, with Sakura catching sight of it and was beginning to think of how to subdue it until it jumped onto Tomoyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Tomoyo exclaimed in surprise as she fell over before the Clow card in question jumped away. Sakura was more concerned for Tomoyo at this moment and let it slip. To her surprise Tomoyo had not only passed out but was rapidly shrinking before her very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Tomoyo came round to find herself lying on something fluffy. Getting to her feet she first looked round and up to see her coffee table looming above her and then, turning the other way, she saw the gigantic vista that was Sakura Kinomoto. Tomoyo was overjoyed while Sakura felt terrible concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TOMOYO-CHAN,\" Sakura thundered as she lowered her hand down to her level, \"ARE YOU ALRIGHT?\" Tomoyo smiled with a strong feeling of happiness and love and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly alright, Sakura-chan!\" And she jumped into Sakura's palm. Sakura was surprised by how quickly and enthusiastically Tomoyo clambered into her hand when she considered how overwhelming everything must be from Tomoyo's point of view. Carefully lifting her tiny friend up to her eye level as she kneeled on the floor Sakura turned to Kero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Clow card is this?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be the Little card.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little as in small?\" Sakura checked although there was no need for Kero to answer. \"So what do we do now?\" This second question was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't just chase after it,\" Kero informed her, \"If it touches you not only will you shrink but your magical powers will disappear.\" Sakura was disappointed by that answer as she not only wanted to return Tomoyo to her normal size but she wanted to stop the card from affecting anyone else. Just then Tomoyo makes a suggestion...</span></div></div>",

The melodious voice was so soothing and pacifying that Sakura couldn't help but pause to hear it. Just then she picked up on the presence of a Clow card and began to search for any clear sign of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she searched a dot of light bounced from its hiding place and down the nearby corridor, straight to the music room. Suddenly Tomoyo's singing was cut-off and gasps of surprise replaced it before the teacher started calling Tomoyo's name, closely followed by a query of whether or not she felt well. Filled with concern Sakura dashed into the music room calling out Tomoyo's name. Upon seeing no sign of her while the music teacher knelt upon the floor and several other members of the Tomoeda Elementary choir gathered around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Tomoyo-chan?!?\" Sakura asked the teacher. Looking up at her Tsujitani-sensei responded in the calm manner you get when you've seen something almost totally unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right here, Kinomoto-san.\" She held out her cupped hands, in which Sakura was almost stunned to see Tomoyo, shrunk down to the size of her thumb. Looking up at Sakura Tomoyo called out her name, which sounded rather far away to Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan, you... shrunk?\" Sakura checked as she did what she could to make sure she was seeing the real thing. The response only came as a nod.</span></div></div>",

I feel all right.\" Tsujitani relaxed slightly at Tomoyo's calm approach to her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan,\" Sakura inquired, \"What will your mother say?!?\" There was a pause that hung in the air as though Sakura was going to continue but couldn't find the right words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine, Sakura-chan.\" Tomoyo answered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can't continue with rehearsals.\" Tsujitani informed her. \"Shall we phone your mother?\" Tomoyo shook her head slightly and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phone home first, please, and ask if they can take me back to my bedroom. Then you can tell my mother.\" Sakura was taken aback by how calmly Tomoyo spoke when the situation was not only strange but also witnessed by several people. Tsujitani also looked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, Daidouji-san?\" She asked. \"Maybe Kinomoto-san could give you a lift?\" Sakura confirmed this, feeling uplifted by being able to help and the chance to reduce the number of witnesses.

As she moved the skirt of her cheerleading uniform flapped with her, which made sure that Tomoyo knew Sakura was on the move.

Everything seemed to rush by as Sakura found herself sitting on Tomoyo's sofa before she knew it; Tomoyo herself had seated in such a way as to be close to Sakura but with a slight distance so as to try and give Sakura more room to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you had something to tell me.\" Sakura commented, noticing a sense of unease in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have we been friends, Sakura?\" Tomoyo asked her in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three or four years, I suppose.\" Sakura answered, slightly confused by this response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you and Li getting on?\" Tomoyo inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've written to each other a few times.\" Sakura returned. \"We do miss each other but you and Meilin have provided us with such support. Somehow I feel as though I can handle Syaoran's absence better now; we have surprising differences, he told me once that he likes an academic atmosphere and that he gets unnerved when someone expresses themselves to the full. I'm starting to feel some doubt in our love.\" Sakura choked back a few tears while Tomoyo let her go at her own pace. \"I'm wondering if what I feel for Syaoran has similarities to how I felt about Yukito.\" Tomoyo smiled knowingly; she had seen that Sakura had become more self-perceptive over the past months. Sakura did not continue and her tears had dried up so now Tomoyo orated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, ever since our first meeting I felt a strong friendship for you but, by the start of the second trimester in our third year at school, I knew that it was more than just friendship. I expected that you would find happiness in someone else but, somehow, the gods have constantly placed obstacles in your pursuit of the ones you love while I could open up whenever I chose. I am sure that the time has come. Sakura... I... love... you.\" Sakura looked as though she might understand but clearly she was making herself see this statement in a platonic manner, so Tomoyo added. \"I love you like Yukito loves Touya, like how Syaoran loved you or maybe still does. Sakura, you are the one I wish to devote my life to.\" Sakura's expression now showed something like being stunned; Tomoyo sat there to let Sakura absorb the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love?\" Sakura asked and Tomoyo calmly nodded. \"As in like with Chiharu and Yamazaki?\" Tomoyo slightly nodded but also shrugged her shoulders, knowing how slapstick the mentioned relationship tended to get.</span></div></div>",

Once she got used to the lack of light she noticed that she was indeed on a soft surface and, looking round, she found a vast hill rising above her; she followed this with her eyes in both directions until she finally spotted what she was looking for. Off in the distance she could see that this mountain was really a gigantic girl, a charming giant girl, a giant girl so caring and so powerful that she would never leave Tomoyo\u2019s mind; it was Sakura Kinomoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made it.\u201d Tomoyo commented to herself, certain that her voice was now too faint for Sakura to hear, especially while in a deep sleep.

She brought her video camera out of her handbag. \u201cI know I\u2019ve got a long journey ahead of me,\u201d She commented to herself again, \u201cBut I just can\u2019t resist the prospect of a hike on Sakura\u2019s beautiful body.\u201d She set her camera so the recording screen was pointing in the same direction as the lens, in order to film herself, and pressed record. \u201cI, Tomoyo Daidouji,\u201d She announced dramatically, \u201cHave come here, into Sakura\u2019s bedroom, to undertake an incredible adventure. Now that I am barely one centimetre tall I will venture forth into the unknown, see new sights, hear new sounds and smell new smells as I boldly go where no human has ever gone before.\u201d Her tone changed from dramatic to jolly. \u201cBut first, let us look at the grand vista of Sakura Kinomoto as viewed from the perspective of an insect.\u201d And with that she marched recklessly towards the titaness, struggling over the creases in the sheets caused by Sakura\u2019s enormous sleeping form before she went on all fours to haul herself up Sakura\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving reached the top, in spite of Sakura\u2019s occasional shift in her sleep, Tomoyo now looked down towards Sakura\u2019s feet and then up towards Sakura\u2019s head, all the while recording the vista with her video camera, commenting on both the blatant size difference but also on her perceptions of the mountain-sized Sakura; although she knew that she was the one who\u2019s tiny Tomoyo couldn\u2019t help but refer to Sakura as being the one who was huge, it was all a matter of perspective and Tomoyo had plenty of that. Tomoyo took a break from her recording and leaned down to listen in on Sakura\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be joining you later.\u201d She whispered to it as she returned to her feet. \u201cSakura\u2019s face is so beautiful.\u201d She expressed as she kept her camera focused on the snoozing visage looming in the distance. \u201cLet\u2019s take a closer look.\u201d Now, having no tiredness from her climb up Sakura, Tomoyo began her night-hike across from above Sakura\u2019s stomach up towards Sakura\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Tomoyo reached Sakura's collar bone the giantess shifted again in her sleep, turning over to her side and bringing one hand up to rest next to her head; the change in orientation inadvertently caused Tomoyo to tumble down towards Sakura's shoulder but, instead of landing on the pillow, Tomoyo found herself partially entangled in the pyjama collar. It took her a bit of time to free herself from the giant lip of clothing and dropping down onto the pillow; Sakura's body caused a depression here that nearly made Tomoyo slide down into a nook next to Sakura's neck. The temptation was strong to snuggle up against Sakura's larynx but Tomoyo reminded herself that she had come to get even more intimate than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo hauled herself up the incline of the pillow, Sakura's snoozing an omnipresent sound that gave her a real thrill and also a calming effect as she kept thinking as to who was making the breathing sound, before finally coming to a point where it was relatively level so she didn't have to go on all fours. In spite of the grand vista that Sakura's face gave for her to record Tomoyo had to have her wits about her as she was edging along a ledge where the horizontal became the vertical around Sakura's head. For a moment Tomoyo sat on this ledge and kept her camera trained on Sakura's mouth directly ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That which is better than being next to the one you love,\" Tomoyo continued her commentary, \"Is being inside the one you love.\" She slid down the slope until she was within arm's reach of Sakura's lips, which hung open as the magical giantess slept; every single breath inadvertently washed over her tiny visitor but Tomoyo wasn't fazed, as far as she was concerned Sakura's breath was the sweetest breeze ever to exist. From the shrunken girl's point of view the inhalation was a cool coaxing breeze that seemed to be trying to get Tomoyo to hurry along and the exhalation was a warm reassuring invitation to venture into a system of caverns that would actually be much warmer than outside. Not wanting to <br>\r\nkeep her girlfriend waiting Tomoyo took hold of the lowest join between Sakura's lips and pulled herself up onto it; she kept the rise of her shoes on the lip and steadied herself against Sakura's upper lip as she scanned the inside with the camera, which had been recording with an in built torch on. Tomoyo had it on low so, even if the light struck Sakura's eyelid, the giantess would not wake; now Tomoyo set it to standard illumination as there was no way that Sakura would notice the light inside her. Tomoyo took a deep breath, revelling in the scent of Sakura's maw, and made one last comment before advancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I go, deep into Sakura-chan.\"</span></div></div>",

Once she steadied herself she realised that she had been using one of Sakura's premolars to right herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" She declared. Taking the initiative Tomoyo once again pulled herself up, this time onto the inside of Sakura's teeth, and made herself comfortable as she filmed her giant surroundings. \"Sakura-chan,\" She announced in spite of the knowledge that her host couldn't hear her, \"You have the most beautiful mouth in the universe.\" She watched as the tongue shifted up and down, forwards and backwards, at one point very nearly making Tomoyo get ahead of herself. As she considered this Tomoyo lay back with her feet in the nook of one of Sakura's molars, her body resting on the gum and her head using the soft palette as a pillow. She started daydreaming; imagining Sakura doing this deliberately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan,\" Sakura muffled as she swirled her friend around her mouth, \"You are so delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan,\" She murbled without bringing her teeth together, \"Please be careful there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sakura-chan.\" Tomoyo sighed at the thought of Sakura being willing to eat her. When Sakura took a huff it aroused her from this dreamland; looking round she saw the slightly wider opening between the giant's lips steadily closing to a gap she'd have to crawl through if she wanted to get out. Tomoyo smiled; she wasn't going to go back even now. She had made her decision and she had one hundred percent confidence in her assistant's capability to protect her from the dangerous side of going along Sakura's alimentary canal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her position, now lying on her stomach on one tooth, and proceeded to film the underside of Sakura's tongue, followed by the hard palette beyond the great muscle and even took the time to focus her camera on every one of Sakura's teeth. As she was filming the eighth lower right tooth Sakura's incisors came together, bringing the upper set within, from Tomoyo's point of view, ten feet of the lower set and a strange groan accompanied by an unusual manoeuvre undertaken by the tongue indicated that she was swallowing an accumulation of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like I may have overstayed my welcome.\" Tomoyo commented for the recording. \"I'd better wrap up and venture deeper into the magnificent body of Sakura Kinomoto.\" She got to her feet, using Sakura's teeth as stepping stones, and walked towards the back of the mouth. Sixth tooth, seventh tooth, eighth tooth...</span></div></div>",

She once again went into a flight of fancy, imagining Sakura swirling her around in her mouth again, tasting every last millimetre of her and enjoying every moment. When she fell over again Tomoyo snapped back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now lying against the frontier of Sakura's gums with the tongue having given up on her; a loud huff roared around her and a major gust buffeted her so that she might've been blown close to the front of the tongue had she not been obstructed by the gums. Tomoyo looked to where the roaring huff was strongest; there it was, a dull pink followed by pitch black, the beginning of Sakura's throat. Yawning wide it seemed to await a tasty snack, enticing Tomoyo to go further but she did not want to miss out on a single piece of detail within Sakura\u2019s mouth. Scanning the mighty orifice with her camera Tomoyo found herself taking particular interest in the uvula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d She exclaimed upon the sight of it hanging from the roof of Sakura\u2019s mouth, steadily waving with every breath the giantess took. Tomoyo calmly walked deeper into Sakura\u2019s body pausing right underneath the great fleshy stalactite. \u201cIt\u2019s so amusing.\u201d Tomoyo noted as she pointed her camera right up to it; a couple of times it looked like it would knock the video camera out of her tiny hand and down into Sakura\u2019s pharynx. Understanding this Tomoyo began to reach for it, desiring to pat it and tickle it; just as she was about to stand on tiptoe to make contact with it she changed her mind. \u201cI cannot give Sakura-chan\u2019s uvula a tickle,\u201d She thought aloud, \u201cIt might rouse her and I can just imagine what she\u2019ll say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding a soaking Tomoyo in between her thumb and forefinger Sakura refused every attempt Tomoyo made to put her back in her mouth. \u201cTomoyo-chan,\u201d She said, \u201cI could never eat you. Why did you go in there anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t figure my actions.\u201d Tomoyo continued, partly to herself and partly as commentary for the video. \u201cNot until she sees that I can pass through her without being digested.\u201d With that she looked at the way the slope of Sakura\u2019s pharynx was orientated as she attempted to gauge how to walk down the gullet, sitting right on the edge of Sakura\u2019s tongue, her feet hanging over the \u2018event horizon\u2019.</span></div></div>",

She smiled amusingly as she associated it with a funfair slide with a crash mat at the base for Sakura\u2019s flesh was as comfy as the cushions of her sofa but as firm as laminate flooring. She picked herself up and scanned the area with her camera, the in-built light being the primary means by which she could see her surroundings, taking note of the soft pink walls of the one part of the human body unseen by a dentist or anyone except for those who used endoscopes and she was sure Sakura never had one of those in her. Tomoyo was very confident that she was the first person ever to see Sakura\u2019s pharynx from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarvellous!\u201d Tomoyo declared as she brought her scan to an end by pointing her camera at the very end of Sakura\u2019s tongue, where it merged with the rest of her body. Observing the soft pink surroundings and feeling even the slightest of breaths Tomoyo began to advance deeper into Sakura\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light increased outside Sakura responded only by moving one of her arms but this change in orientation registered to Tomoyo as a clear Sakura-quake, forcing her to steady herself by leaning on the back wall of Sakura\u2019s pharynx; she was so deep inside Sakura now that any change in the amount of light outside would go unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the divide in the throat where the oesophagus and trachea begin Tomoyo found that she had to do all she could to resist Sakura\u2019s inhalations, which were now very powerful, as they appeared to be trying to drag her into the larynx where she would surely be choked on. In spite of knowing that her voice would be too feeble Tomoyo couldn\u2019t help but call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura-chan! Don\u2019t breathe me in or you\u2019ll be coughing until the cows come home!\u201d Fortunately one of the exhalations provided enough force for Tomoyo to bounce of the back of the throat and land next to the epiglottis. Dusting herself off Tomoyo looked at this firm flap of skin and thought over its role, smiling at the realisation that it also provided shelter from Sakura\u2019s hurricane breath. Though it was no longer buffeting her she could hear the great whooshing roars of her beloved\u2019s breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking straight down Sakura\u2019s gullet Tomoyo noticed that where there was a ring of folds when she first shone a light down there now it was a smooth almost uniform tunnel leading even deeper into Sakura\u2019s body, which was starting to feel like a sauna at this depth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she strolled down Sakura\u2019s gullet Tomoyo now noticed another strange sound; accompanying the distant windy sounds of the giantess\u2019s breathing there was now a steady rhythmic percussion sound emanating from one of the walls somewhere ahead. As she ventured deeper Tomoyo recognised this the sound of Sakura\u2019s heart, which was now as big as a house as far as she was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Sakura-chan,\u201d Tomoyo commented, \u201cI always knew you had a big heart.\u201d She continued her walk unabated by any variation in the air as she left the throat behind her, penetrating the darkest and warmest depths of Sakura\u2019s body, never once turning her camera off.</span></div></div>",

By now the temperature had reached approximately 37 degrees Celsius with Tomoyo being so far inside Sakura, however her skin was now registering it as 30 degrees, partly due to the time elapsed between being at Sakura's lips and about halfway down her gullet but mostly due to the same anti-digestion magic doing its best to keep Tomoyo at a fairly comfortable temperature. Because of this Tomoyo now found herself sweating in this hot humid tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew you were so warm, Sakura-chan.\" Tomoyo commented for a bit of humour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long Tomoyo saw a wall of flesh up ahead; curious she approached with her hand stretched out to feel for any evidence of the entrance to Sakura's stomach. Upon making contact with the smooth muscle Tomoyo felt a strange change in the distance above her head to the side of the oesophagus. Looking up she noticed that she hadn't quite reached the end of the gullet, a set of folds led to a narrow passage right above her. By Tomoyo's standards she would have to try and climb the inside of Sakura's gullet for ten feet or so before being able to start on making the oesophageal sphincter accept her into Sakura's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo tried to climb the smooth muscle of the oesophagus with one hand while still filming her surroundings. She struggled to get her feet into the few folds that were available and tried to climb with both hands while still holding the camera. She made some way but, just as she came within arm's reach of the sphincter, she slipped and fell. Fortunately the flesh was at just the right consistency to prevent her from getting any injury except for the possibility of a minor bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would've thought your body would want a light snack, Sakura-chan.\" Tomoyo joked, in spite of her knowledge that Sakura would hardly notice her if at all. Sighing she shouldered the camera and hauled herself back up with all four limbs, climbing all the way up to the sphincter. Reaching out with the hand she hadn't been wielding the camera with she squeezed four fingers through into Sakura's stomach and wriggled them in the hopes of stimulating its automatic response to something descending through the gullet. It only gave some so her hand could fit through when it closed round her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great determination Tomoyo gripped the lining of Sakura's stomach and pulled, struggling to get the sphincter open and enter the stomach. She gradually hauled her arm through and, when her elbow got through, she used it to provide leverage as she pulled and pushed as hard as she could. Eventually her shoulder was at the entrance and she managed to pry open the sphincter enough to get her head and shoulders through. Before long, though, the sphincter closed around her waist. Noticing that it wasn't letting her slide back any more than it was letting her pull forward she continued her recording for now and gasped in awe as the light on her camera illuminated the interior of Sakura's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnificent.\" She declared as she psyched herself up to get the rest of her body in.</span></div></div>",

The sphincter had closed again, this time around her ankles. She knew she needed to do this carefully or her shoes would slip off and she was reluctant to leave anything behind. This time she changed her technique; bending over and using her hands to, once again, pull the sphincter open and bring her feet into Sakura's stomach. She struggled against Sakura's smooth muscles but finally had a wide enough opening to swing her feet up and out of the oesophagus. Sighing with relief she retrieved her camera to get every detail of her new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura-chan is truly marvellous to behold,\" She commented, \"Even the folds of her stomach are so well-patterned. It could be part of a new wallpaper or carpet catelogue.\" She joked. Just then her world turned upside down and she tumbled an apparent distance of forty yards before coming to a stop \"Kya!\" She exclaimed in surprise and alarm. She thanked her 'current location' for being cushioned so that she didn't even seem to acquire any bruising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiieee! I'm late!\" Sakura cried out as she rose with the alarm, upon observing the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" Kero groaned as Sakura's cry roused him. Sakura threw aside the covers, returned the alarm clock to its place on the shelf and rushed for her school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside her Tomoyo got tumbled around as Sakura dashed this way and that getting her things together. One advantage of her location was that she could hear everything Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness.\" She struggled to say as she was tossed about by Sakura's movements. \"How can she be late if she set the alarm?\" It was tough for her to figure this out as she was jiggled so. During a period of rest she tried to understand why Sakura had made such an error but was interrupted by a groaning from above. Within seconds a volume of water large enough for Tomoyo to fill a sink with fell from the ceiling. She moved out of the way as quick as she could but still got one foot sodden by this. Having found a fold that she could use as a seat she looked at the liquid Sakura had swallowed, wondering if there was food coming down already, when she noticed the froth floating in it. \"Nice one, Sakura-chan.\" She blurted out as she understood it was leftover from Sakura brushing her teeth. Before she could continue the tossing and tumbling began again.</span></div></div>",

Why?!  How did you know you'd be safe?!  And how did you even get small enough in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((Writer's note:  I think it would be best if people let the original author of this storyline do Tomoyo's explanation.

The vibrations were a clear mystery but her initial thought was that either she had to find help or she'd drown/suffocate in this strange bog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP! HELP!\" She cried out but there was no response. She cried out again but one particularly strong surge of movement seemed to throw everything off-balance, causing her to get a mouthful of the substance and finishing up with it up to her shoulders. She's astonished to find that this stuff didn't taste like mud but like sweet strawberries. \"Where am I?!?\" She cried out in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sakura-chan.\" Tomoyo addressed her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Tomoyo-chan?\" Sakura queried in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we have lunch together?\" Tomoyo asked, glancing at Sakura's bento in the side pocket of her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...Sure.\" Sakura replied. \"I made my own lunch today; I wanted something <i>special</i> in my lunch.\" Tomoyo was intrigued but let it slide. 'Don't worry, Meilin-chan,' She thought, 'You'll be all right.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeilin called out for help several times but she finally decided that she wasn't getting anywhere; she was puzzled by the fact that she had not yet sank deeper into the strawberry-flavoured quagmire when she had gone what she thought of as four inches deeper in a few minutes. She quickly decided that she would be receiving no help soon and simply did what she could to be comfortable in this environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then surges and vibrations would reverberate around the swamp as she saw it before every thing returned to normal. Sometimes Meilin found herself sinking deeper into the goo but no deeper than having it up to her neck and sometimes she even felt herself rising out of it, but no higher than her stomach. Now and again she would cry out for help but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after one spectacular surge left her right back where she started, light began to arrive in spite of how dim it was. Looking round Meilin found that she was right in the middle of a large pale quagmire with dark walls rising up all sides and, somehow, it was covered over with a semi-translucent roof. After a while shadows danced beyond the ceiling and the walls got darker before she felt a different kind of surge, like that of being in a lift but with more power behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have that's so special, Sakura-chan?\" Tomoyo asked, unable to contain her curiosity anymore. Sweat-dropping for a moment Sakura decided to spill the beans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this, Tomoyo-chan.\" She replied, holding up a small yoghurt pot. Tomoyo looked at the label and identified it a strawberry yoghurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds delicious, Sakura-chan.\" Tomoyo commented. \"But is it really all that special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Sakura replied. \"However, considering the extra ingredient, some people might call me kaijuu with every conviction.\" In spite of her muttering the sentence Tomoyo heard every word and just had to press the question; swallowing hard Sakura began to explain her intentions... to swallow Meilin!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a descent sensation, further shadows dancing over her and occasionally hearing voices outside, Meilin felt herself and her environment rising again. Feeling frustrated with all this turbulence Meilin was about to shout her feelings to the world when, suddenly, a loud noise accompanied a sudden influx of light as the roof was removed with unbelievable speed. It took her a few minutes to adjust to the light before she looked upwards to see a mind-boggling but also terrifying sight. High in the sky above, filling her entire field of view, was Sakura's face, bigger than she had ever known. For a moment Sakura left her field of vision, allowing Meilin to do a double-take. Tasting the quagmire again and looking at its colour she soon realised that she had been shrunk really, really small and was now inside a yoghurt pot. Her face turned blue with fear as she began to think of how and why all these events occurred. It wasn't long before Sakura appeared above the rim again and Meilin felt that her worst fears were confirmed as she saw that Sakura was now brandishing a spoon. As the enormous scoop descended Meilin cringed at the prospect of ending her life as no more that a tiny morsel of food for Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, however, had decided to start off with just the yoghurt and carefully navigated the spoon to avoid the tiny speck of a girl that Meilin was now. Lifting it up with care she let Tomoyo look upon the spoonful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see her, Sakura-chan.\" She commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Sakura replied, \"She's not in this one.\" Having already mentioned humility when she started her lunch Sakura opened up her mouth without a sound and engulfed the spoonful of yoghurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeilin quivered with fright; not only did she see an amount of yoghurt several times her own body weight disappear into Sakura's mouth in one indulgent slurp but both Sakura and Tomoyo were as audible as major thunderstorms; Meilin knew that she was intended to be eaten. She began to sob with overwhelming terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" She asked quietly as the spoon came back, but once again missed her and only got some yoghurt. Upon finding and hearing that she wasn't yet heading for Sakura's belly Meilin started to get frustrated as the shock wore off. \"Enough with the teasing, Kinomoto.\" She commented at her regular voice level. \"If you're gonna eat me then get it over with.\" A minute later she wished she hadn't said that as, this time, Sakura brought the spoon into the yoghurt and up underneath her. Meilin became temporarily petrified with terror as she was effortlessly lifted out of the pot with plenty of yoghurt. Once her ascent ended she looked around; Sakura was holding her at chest level as she found her potential executioner looking down at her with a simple smile on her face and, looking round again, found Tomoyo peering down at her at a much closer proximity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I CAN SEE HER, SAKURA-CHAN.</b>\" She roared with a hint of amusement, almost deafening Meilin from such close proximity. \"<b>SHE LOOKS SO CUTE I CAN IMAGINE WHY YOU'D LIKE TO EAT HER.</b>\" Once Tomoyo's massive visage withdrew Sakura lifted Meilin up until she was able to see all of Sakura's face, from her eyebrows to her lower lip, genuinely looking rather hungry. Meilin quivered with fright at the prospect of vanishing between those gigantic lips. Sakura made a yummy sound as loud as a thunderclap to Meilin and lifted her up even closer to one of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>MEILIN-CHAN, YOU LOOK DELICIOUS.</b>\" She thundered at a more bearable volume than Tomoyo did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY, KINOMOTO?!?\" Meilin shouted at the titaness. \"WHY?!?\" The huge emerald orb disappeared momentarily as Sakura blinked, the movements of her muscles making enough sound for Meilin to notice every little movement in and around Sakura's eye even when she was not looking.</span></div></div>",

I WAS HORRIFIED BY THE PROSPECT AT FIRST BUT, AS TIME WENT ON, I WONDERED WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO HAVE SOMEONE WALK ON MY TONGUE, HOW THEY'D TASTE AND IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO FEEL THEM MOVING AROUND AFTER I SWALLOWED THEM. IT OCCURRED TO ME A FEW MONTHS AGO THAT, IF THEY WERE SOMEHOW PROTECTED FROM THE DANGERS OF BEING SWALLOWED I COULD EAT SOMEONE WITHOUT HAVING TO KILL THEM. I PRACTISED A LITTLE ON SMALL FISH, SEEING IF I COULD KEEP THEM ALIVE WITHIN ME, BEFORE I FINALLY FIGURED OUT A CHARM TO LET LIVING THINGS PLAY AROUND INSIDE OF ME</b>.\" Having finished her story Sakura used the pinky on her free hand to scrape some yoghurt of the sides of the spoon before it dripped down her skirt, giving Meilin another scary but, this time, rather exciting experience as she watched Sakura lick enough yoghurt off her little finger to, from Meilin's point of view, fill a lorry. Meilin found herself being brought towards Sakura again, only to find herself closer to Sakura's ear than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, why me?\" Meilin shouted. \"You could've chosen anybody for this venture.\" Bringing her back round again Sakura lited her free index finger over Meilin, really amplifying the size difference when Meilin felt like she was going to be squished inside a large waste disposal unit, until she suddenly felt a strange feeling creep over her. When Sakura withdrew her forefinger Meilin looked towards Sakura in confusion. Although Sakura was too far away to see Meilin's reaction she knew that she wouldn't have a clue about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>THAT WAS THE PROTECTION CHARM.</b>\" She explained, lifting Meilin back to her eye. \"<b>I DID THINK OF ASKING TOMOYO-CHAN TO TAKE THE JOURNEY BUT I WASN'T SURE IF SHE COULD MANAGE ALL THE MOVEMENTS MY BODY MAKES.</b>\" Meilin looked even more confused, which didn't go unnoticed by Sakura's giant eye. \"<b>I FELT THAT IT REQUIRED SOMEONE ADVENTUROUS AND WITH PLENTY OF STAMINA.</b>\" Meilin's pride rose to the surface now and mitigated the fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Meilin commented, \"If you're sure I'll survive.\" Since she was speaking at normal volume Sakura had to strain to hear her prey. Once they were both sure that Meilin's words had gotten across Sakura brought her back for the final look at her massive visage before she commenced to eat this spoonful of yoghurt. In Japan the phrase 'Itadakimasu', which is said before eating, translates literally as 'I will humbly receive this' from the Shinto belief in animism. Sakura now used a derivative of this that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I WILL HUMBLY RECEIVE YOU.</b>\" As she opened her mouth to devour Meilin while Tomoyo watched on with excitement and amusement.</span></div></div>",

She watched helplessly as Sakura's enormous mouth loomed closer and closer, every detail could be made out. Meilin looked on to see that, by comparison, Sakura's tongue could cover the whole of Tomoeda; her teeth, as they came into view, were the size of office blocks and, most ominously, the dark edifice at the back could swallow a skyscraper. Glancing back along the handle Meilin really could see just how small she was as Sakura's hand, clutching the spoon, was big enough for people Meilin's size to build a mountain village on, her fingernails alone had enough room on them for a one-man dwelling each. Turning back to the mouth Meilin was overwhelmed; she could see nothing but the inside of Sakura's mouth, the end of the spoon already passing between her front teeth. Meilin could even see Sakura's uvula hanging above the 'event horizon' as Meilin saw it; this was because once whatever Sakura put in her mouth went past it there was no chance of returning. All of a sudden worst-case scenario thoughts filled Meilin's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What if her protection magic doesn't work?' She thought. 'What if her stomach, sensing my presence as being that of food, digests me?!? What if I just end up as a nutrient soup?' Meilin did not cry out because she knew that she was too far from Sakura's ears to be heard even if she shouted as loud as she could. She braced herself for ingestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura closed her mouth around the spoon, maintaining a steady pace to make Meilin's trip to seem less like that of a crumb and more like that of a pioneer. Glancing at Tomoyo she was most surprised to find her recording the whole event with her camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeilin didn't look back as Sakura closed her mouth, she knew what was happening from the reduction in the amount of light present in the cave of flesh and enamel. Every sound Sakura made she could hear; even Sakura's slight muffled 'Hoe' was like a rumble of thunder to the tiny girl before a sound like someone emptying a swimming pool was accompanied by the spoon being withdrawn right from under her feet, leaving her lying in a pool of yoghurt and saliva upon Sakura's enormous pink tongue.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't long before Meilin felt Sakura's tongue shift beneath her; at first Sakura was gentle, so that Meilin could get used to being moved about within her maw, but before long, the smooth sweet flavour of the yoghurt accompanied by the slightest tickle as Meilin found that her feet were now in contact with Sakura's taste buds, both of these factors made Sakura drift into pleasure from her food and now, as the yoghurt continued to slowly flow forth to completely coat her tongue, she couldn't help but swill it around her mouth. Meilin was stunned and, once again, terrified; she knew that Sakura was enjoying her lunch and she deduced that, since she was headed for Sakura's tummy, she <i>was</i> Sakura's lunch. As she was tossed around Meilin found that she made contact with all sorts of different things, ranging from the sticky goo of the strawberry yoghurt to the surprisingly comfortable softness, and yet, firmness of Sakura's tongue. As one quick swish of Sakura's tongue made her temporarily airborne in this humid environment Meilin continually focused on Sakura's loud, god-like reassurance until she landed in the yoghurt again, except that she felt her feet against something very hard. Meilin suddenly got that terrible worst-case scenario foreboding; her feet were in contact with one of Sakura's teeth and she felt sure that digestion-proof magic could not protect her from the grinding and crunching power of the teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was most intrigued by Meilin's taste; although the strawberry flavour of the yoghurt dominated her buds Sakura could still pick up Meilin's flavour whenever she was in contact with her tongue, even when all the yoghurt surrounded her. Sakura immediately made a mental note of the curious taste of her Chinese friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Sakura's mouth, Meilin was now surprised by what her eyes were seeing; although it was still dark she found that, somehow, enough light was available for her to make out the outlines of Sakura's flesh and the dull hint of white from Sakura's teeth. Another thing that surprised Meilin was how her feelings had changed while she was being swilled around and mixed in with yoghurt and saliva; initially terrified and marginally composed by Sakura's reassurance now she actually felt... comfortable in this situation. Meilin couldn't comprehend it, she actually felt as though she'd like being the smallest part of Sakura's lunch; in an effort to make sure she wasn't going crazy she told herself it couldn't be and laughed out loud. Since she wasn't much good at convincing others that her true feelings weren't so, such as when she was insecure about her relationship with Syaoran, her efforts did not convince her that it was all nonsense, her positive feelings about being a tasty treat for Sakura; there was one consolation, by speaking out loud she noticed that being inside Sakura's mouth was a lot like being in a cave for her voice managed to echo off Sakura's titanic white teeth and the extra firm roof of the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeilin realised that the aerobatics that Sakura had put her through meant that she had been sitting down, up to her waist in the yoghurt-saliva mix, meaning that most of the yoghurt was elsewhere in this cavern of a mouth; Meilin didn't dwell on this since it would be obvious when Sakura would swallow and, even if she did get swamped in a globule that Sakura's tongue had formed, Meilin knew that she would be heading for the throat anyway. Instead she noticed that Sakura wasn't savouring either herself or her fellow foodstuff (i.e. the yoghurt) with the intensity that she had done but was now just raising and lowering her tongue, reminding Meilin of a boat trip she once took to Hainan. Shaking her head Meilin once again thought out loud, telling herself to focus on her situation. She now found that she could actually distinguish the various forms of flesh around Sakura's mouth, the light level being closer to twilight levels according to Meilin's eyes. She took notes that the yoghurt contrasted strongly with Sakura's tongue, having a much brighter shade of pink than the heaving muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kinomoto,\" Meilin commented as her mind now found a humorous side to her predicament, \"Is it just me or are you taking longer with this mouthful?\" Meilin couldn't figure whether or not her minuscule voice reached through Sakura's own flesh and bone to her middle ear but, just as she had finished, Sakura's tongue became particularly active again.</span></div></div>",

She looked on towards the waiting orifice led would double as her entrance to Sakura's gullet and, before she knew it, she was almost totally swamped by the entire mass of yoghurt ready for the journey down Sakura's throat. Before long a deep drawn out groan accompanied by all the contents of Sakura's mouth steadily sliding to the back indicated to Meilin that Sakura was swallowing. Bracing herself she prepared to face the sheer drop down Sakura's esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the yoghurt that held her in place hung just below Sakura's uvula Meilin now found herself being drawn down into the pharynx at a slower rate than she had anticipated but, every pulsating muscle in this massive fleshy cavern seemed to be greeting her as the guest of honour in Sakura's lunch. The drama of it all now made Meilin excited, to her own surprise, and she also had a positive feeling of privilege as being the first person to venture inside a schoolgirl alive, ignoring the fact that it is Sakura Kinomoto. As Sakura's epiglottis forced her slimy strawberry-flavoured, partially digested transport into a highly anticipating gullet Meilin actually giggled as she considered the possibility of there being, in history, schoolgirls in tribes that practiced cannibalism; she shook it off as being ridiculous although she didn't discount the historical possibility of pre-adolescents in tribes who practiced cannibalism, either out of desperation or out of ritualistic customs. A sudden soft but firm pressure on her face brought her back to the situation at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeilin now realised that she wasn't just dropping down Sakura's throat like falling down a mains water pipe but that Sakura was unconsciously working at it. The walls of Sakura's gullet were squeezing Meilin and the yoghurt she was accompanying down towards her waiting stomach, making absolutely sure that they would take up residence there. As she was squeezed down Meilin found that her senses were reaching overload; her nose was almost overwhelmed by the smell of the yoghurt and her tongue was remembering the taste of droplets that had entered her own mouth while her body felt like Sakura's gullet was giving it a massage and her ears could hear Sakura's heartbeat and breathing through the masses of flesh that surrounded her, indicating that she who she was occupying was totally calm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After what felt like a long journey Meilin now found herself really being squeezed by the muscles within Sakura's gullet; initially bewildered she realised what was happening when her legs started swaying in an openess, she was being forced through the pyloric sphincter that guarded the entrance to Sakura's belly. She tried to say 'Bon Apetit'  but the pressure of Sakura's muscle made it impossible for her to draw breath for the next minute. Eventually she felt the firm flesh pushing on her face and found herself hanging from her forehead within the higher reaches of Sakura's stomach; her mind registered everything her senses picked up, the yoghurt had slid right past her and was now in the pool below her accompanied by other foods and Sakura's digestive juices so she took much longer to pass into the magical titaness's tummy. It seemed as though Sakura had gained control over her sphincter and was deliberately holding her there to let Meilin take everything in; just as Meilin started to suspect this the last push came and she plummeted down into the new quagmire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a *plop* Meilin landed in the mixture comprising of Sakura's lunch and her gastric juices. She surfaced only a few seconds later thankful that Sakura's charm made sure that her digestive fluids would not affect her in any way; it might as well have been water as far as Meilin was concerned. The only disruption to the fluid she found was all the food that made it into a thick swamp. One thing that struck Meilin as she floated there was that Sakura's stomach seemed so well-lit, it was as though the walls of the chamber themselves were emitting a soft pinkish light. Thinking it over she put it down to Sakura's immense magical power; not only was Meilin giving Sakura the opportunity to try out some bizarre fantasy but she was also being given a more pleasurable variant, Sakura both ensured that she would come to no harm inside her and even gave her a gentle illumination of the inside of her belly. Just then Meilin felt a strange surge going through the chamber, a rhythmic soft thud along with a steady wave in the mixture repeating itself for a while; then she heard Sakura speaking to her, her thunderous voice muffled by the distant sound of her heartbeat and the flesh that separated her from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right in there, Meilin-chan.\" She asked her little guest; Meilin wasn't sure how Sakura would be able to hear her from all the way up from her abdomen but she decided to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES, KINOMOTO!\" Meilin yelled up. \"ONCE YOU'RE OVER THE SHOCK IT'S A SPECTACULAR EXPERIENCE!\" She coughed slightly as the yelling made her throat sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to shout, Meilin-chan,\" Sakura told her, \"The power of the Voice card allows me to hear you as clearly as you're sitting opposite me at regular size.\" Meilin pondered over that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when I hear you?\" She asked at her normal voice level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's magic,\" Sakura responded, \"I'm just mumbling into my chest.\" Meilin sighed and thought over what will happen next. \"A word of advice,\" Sakura continued, \"I'm not finished with lunch just yet so try not hang around under the entrance.\" Meilin actually giggled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take all you want, Kinomoto.\" She replied. \"My tiny tummy was filled up with that yoghurt; there's something I'm not gonna have for a while.\" Now it was Sakura's turn to giggle, which shook Meilin up so that it was like a Sakura-quake. Meilin spotted a piece of... something green, kinda like lettuce but not quite and most certainly not cabbage, and she thus swam through Sakura's digestive fluids and pulled herself onto it to use as a raft until it got dissolved to the extent that she could no longer fit on it. Sitting there Meilin looked back up the way she came; a loud groan signalled swallowing and she braced herself for the impact of whatever was being eaten. After what felt like half a minute another globule of yoghurt came pouring into the stomach, glooping into the quagmire. Meilin wondered what else Sakura had in her lunch and also considered what would happen once Sakura finished.</span></div></div>",

She sat there watching Sakura finish the yoghurt that had brought her here, listening to the variety of sounds Sakura was making. There was the gentle beating of her giant heart, the gurgling and groaning of her stomach walls and the various sounds and sentances that Sakura was producing with her vocal chords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bread was liquified Sakura had gone onto wasabi so Meilin now swam across to an arrangement of compacted rice, of which some grains had been chopped by Sakura's teeth and, to Meilin's surprise, had not retained any mositure except between the grains, keeping the rice raft together. As she lay there Meilin started to ponder something. She was in Sakura's stomach, she had been made immune to digestion and was swimming around in Sakura's lunch; she decided to ask her host something, but first she waited for the next mouthful of wasabi to splash down in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinomoto.\" Meilin queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Meilin-chan?\" Inquired Sakura's voice, reverberating around the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long am I going to be in here?\" Meilin asked. There was a pause before Sakura answered.</span></div></div>",

With that she decided that she needed a way to get more of Meilin on her tastebuds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin her mouth Meilin now realised that she had been tossed towards the front of the mouth, lying upon the tip of Sakura's ginormous pink tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changed your mind, have you?\" Meilin muttered, wondering if she might not end up taking a yoghurt slide into Sakura's stomach. All of a sudden she found herself thrusted up to the roof of the mouth, almost getting the wind knocked out of her as the power of Sakura's mighty tongue forced her against the hard palate. Meilin had only just managed to compensate for the lack of space for her lungs to expand in when she heard a great groaning sound and was nearly pulled down the slope of the tongue, feet first. 'She's swallowing,' Meilin realsied, 'But she doesn't want me to go down.' Before long the pressure between tongue and palate eased off and once again Meilin had a clear sensation of being inside a living cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura continued to flick Meilin around her mouth; trying to get as much of the tiny girl's flavour while also attempting to make the experience more fun for Meilin. Now, what is Sakura's verdict about Meilin's taste?</span></div></div>",

Kerberos did grant her the use of the sealing staff, despite the fact I do have the birthright.\">10</a>\" Meilin was about to emphasise the latter fact when both Li and Sakura looked round apprehensively as the card's presence built. A whirlwind started to pick up around the four of them and a swirling yellow disc appeared above their heads, provoking a synchronised cry of alarm before Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kore wa kurouk\u0101dodarou ka?<a name=\"freturn11\"></a><a href=\"#footnote11\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 11: Which Clow card could this be?\">11</a>\" Li frowned as he did his best to strain against the wind and deduce the signs at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watashi wa wakaranai.<a name=\"freturn12\"></a><a href=\"#footnote12\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 12: I'm not sure.\">12</a>\" He replied as the wind grew stronger, evidently making for the yellow disc. \"Watashi wa sore wa Windy ka Storm koto o kitai shitaiga, karera wa ry\u014dh\u014d no mipp\u016b sa rete kitashi, kiiro no f\u014dmu wa, dochira ka to tekig\u014d shinai. <a name=\"freturn13\"></a><a href=\"#footnote13\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 13: I'd expect it to be the STORM or the WINDY but they've both been sealed and the yellow form doesn't fit with either of them.\">13</a>\" Concerned about this Sakura wondered what might be able to subdue this magical force while reaching for her key, just then she heard Tomoyo yelp in surprise and alarm and cry out her name. She looked just in time to see Tomoyo tumbling through the air towards the disc that was now formed a fairly definitive vortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan!\" She yelled back, pulling out her key and preparing to release it when she caught sight of Li being swept up, which provoked him to try and summon his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Syaoran!\" Meilin cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Li-kun!\" Sakura added before turning her attention back to the key of the seal, when suddenly both Meilin and Sakura were swept up and sent tumbling up towards the vortex before it, the winds and the four of them vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Little card giggled and gave thanks to the power of the Move card for pushing the Cardcaptor away. Now the four students were no bigger than grains of rice and would be deposited before a familiar feminine face each and the two of them ensured that each of them would be having lunch at this time; nevertheless they could end up manifesting right before their eyes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rika Sasaki sat upon the low wall at the edge of the playground with a lunchbox upon her lap. Though it was a Saturday and school was officially over for the day she still had piano practice that afternoon. She was about halfway through her lunch when she was surprised to see a yellow orb form before her eyes. It was eerily beautiful and gave her pause in her eating when she noticed a silhouette forming within the orb. Looking closer she could see that it was taking on a human form and the yellow light began to disperse once it was finished. Now Rika could see the human form clearly, the eyes closed as though asleep, smaller than her thumb, she recognised it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan?\" Rika gasped in amazement, wondering if it was Tomoyo or if some spirit had taken on her friend's appearance if her eyes weren't deceived by more mundane means. Once the yellow light had completely dispersed Tomoyo came round just as the magical force keeping her afloat let go and sent her tumbling down, straight towards Rika's lunchbox. Promptly she cried out as she fell and Rika, startled and alarmed by this turn of events, found that the only option she had within the given time to break the shrunken girl's fall was the rice in her lunchbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo struck the giant rice grains with a force akin to landing on a reasonably hard mattress, but the momentum of her fall meant that she went head over heels right into a selection of finely cut vegetables. In ten seconds Tomoyo pulled herself up into a sitting position and looked around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyodai yasai?<a name=\"freturn1\"></a><a href=\"#footnote1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 1: Giant veg?\">1</a>\" She mused. \"Kyojin gohan?<a name=\"freturn2\"></a><a href=\"#footnote2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 2: Giant rice?\">2</a>\" Tomoyo took it upon herself to climb onto the top of the vegetables. \"Dakara, watashi wa Kyojin no bent\u014d-bako ya... Watashi wa shukush\u014d shite kita to omoi, ima, dareka no o bent\u014d no dochira kada?!?<a name=\"freturn3\"></a><a href=\"#footnote3\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 3: So, I'm either inside a giant's lunchbox or... I've shrunk and am now in someone's lunch?!?\">3</a>\" Just then a series of vibrations caused Tomoyo to fall back into the various watery fluids that were seeping out of the veg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika picked up her lunchbox and looked closely at the contents, having seen Tomoyo's tiny figure fall off the rice she wished to make sure what she saw was real. Once she had finished lifting the box she could see a piece of carrot move in a manner similar to a trapdoor. As Tomoyo once again climbed to the top of the pile Rika gasped, very nearly sending her little friend back into the waters that now soaked her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan, sore wa anata ga hont\u014dni aru?<a name=\"freturn4\"></a><a href=\"#footnote4\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 4: Tomoyo, is that really you?\">4</a>\" The sound of Rika's voice from above, greatly magnified by the size difference, startled Tomoyo who hesitantly looked up to see Rika's face filling the sky from her point of view. Nervously Tomoyo smiled and waved while calling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kon'nichiwa, Rika-chan. M\u014dshiwakearimasenga, kono y\u014dna o bent\u014d ni otoshikon motte iru.<a name=\"freturn5\"></a><a href=\"#footnote5\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 5: Hello, Rika. Sorry to have dropped into your lunch like this.\">5</a>\" Rika could now confirm that either some otherworldly being had manifested as Tomoyo and was trying to dupe her or Tomoyo had somehow shrunk and teleported right in front of her. Thinking things over Rika figured there was only one way to determine the truth; she took her chopsticks and carefully lowered them down to Tomoyo's position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo looked nervously as Rika's chopsticks dropped down right over her, primed to snatch her up to the giant schoolgirl's eye-level. Tomoyo reassured herself that Rika's maturity and the fact that she could see her clearly enough meant that she wouldn't be facing anything serious at this point. The chopsticks pinched her across the waist but with no more squeeze than she'd expect from being picked up by a giant. As the landscape of food fell away from her Tomoyo figured that Rika would have to know more about the exact circumstances that led her to this situation and immediately realised that the other three were nowhere in sight.<p align=\"left\"><u>Footnotes</u><br><a name=\"footnote1\"></a><a href=\"#freturn1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Return from Footnote 1\">1</a>\u00a0 Giant veg?<br><a name=\"footnote2\"></a><a href=\"#freturn2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Return from Footnote 2\">2</a>\u00a0 Giant rice?<br><a name=\"footnote3\"></a><a href=\"#freturn3\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Return from Footnote 3\">3</a>\u00a0 So, I'm either inside a giant's lunchbox or...

This provoked her into going over to the window and see if she could pinpoint the source of the surge and maybe check for any visual clues as to its nature. However the presence was constantly shifting and she couldn't isolate it until it went right into the staff room she currently stood in, alone. As she traced it she espied an occurrence right above her lunch. Slowly she approached this, apprehensive as she could now identify the nature of this swirling energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clow K\u0101do.\" She whispered, just as she could see a tiny human figure manifesting in the centre of this vortex. As she watched the magical energy started dissipating revealing Sakura Kinomoto's figure floating in the air, to Kaho's alarm. Just as Sakura's eyes flickered open gravity reasserted itself and She yelped as She fell... straight into Kaho's outstretched hand, which provided Her with a sufficiently soft landing. \"Kinomoto-san, daijoubu desu ka?<a name=\"freturn1\"></a><a href=\"#footnote1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 1: Kinomoto, are you all right?\">1</a>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura recovered from Her sudden drop, wondering just what Clow card could have caused this escapade when the only ideas She had were ones already sealed, She was surprised and a tad alarmed to hear Mizuki's voice from up above. Looking around She was shocked upon finding Herself almost surrounding by human digits bigger than She was, whereupon She hesitantly followed the arm attached to the hand that held Her and cried out upon seeing the lady who it belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EHHHHH! Mizuki-sensei!\" She declared, in response to which She tumbled slightly as Kaho lifted Her up to her eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinomoto-san, shinpaishinaide kudasai.<a name=\"freturn2\"></a><a href=\"#footnote2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 2: Kinomoto, don't worry.\">2</a>\" She whispered gently. \"Watashi wa, koreha mah\u014d no y\u014dna jikodatta to shimasu.

She recalled Li's expressions of concern surrounding their teacher but still Kaho Mizuki's aura left Her feeling particularly relaxed.<p align=\"left\"><u>Footnotes</u><br><a name=\"footnote1\"></a><a href=\"#freturn1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Return from Footnote 1\">1</a>\u00a0 Kinomoto, are you all right?<br><a name=\"footnote2\"></a><a href=\"#freturn2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Return from Footnote 2\">2</a>\u00a0 Kinomoto, don't worry.<br><a name=\"footnote3\"></a><a href=\"#freturn3\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Return from Footnote 3\">3</a>\u00a0 I suppose this was a magical accident.

Tomoyo had proposed that Sakura use the Little card on the worst off people around the world and look after them herself, whereby many problems that they used to face would come to an end; Sakura's view, although she has been known to be optimistic, was that she'd be imprisoning people against their will and treating them like animals. She continued to voice this paradox but Tomoyo kept finding reasons for her plan to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be all right, Sakura-chan.\" Tomoyo informed her. \"You have the Libra card, right?\" Sakura confirmed this. \"Then you'd surely be able to tell if they would really prefer being your tiny pet to their current situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a complicated spell, Tomoyo-chan,\" Sakura replied, \"The Libra card is more suited to determining a 'yes-or-no' answer if someone's suspected of lying. To determine their feelings regarding your suggestion without asking them directly would take more power.\" Tomoyo accepted this; she knew that openly asking someone would cause raised eyebrows and probably stupid answers. \"Think about it.\" Sakura continued. \"How would you like to be shrunk down and spend the rest of your life as my pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura-chan,\" Tomoyo answered, \"I'd absolutely love it!\" Sakura nearly doubled-over upon hearing this. \"To be Sakura-chan's itsy-bitsy captive, to be held in her warm soft hand and carried around in her pocket,\" She continued in a daydream, \"It would be pure bliss.\"</span></div></div>",

Once Sakura had left the room Kero popped out of his sleeping quarters and just kept his gaze on Tomoyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's still deciding what her feelings are.\" Tomoyo commented. \"I wish she'll respond truthfully as I don't want her to feel unhappy inside just to try and make me feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" Kero checked, \"You really love Sakura?\" Tomoyo nodded. \"And all those things about being shrunk?\" Tomoyo nodded again. \"So why did you ask her to shrink many people neither of you have met before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing her,\" Tomoyo answered, \"It would be a great service to humanity. Knowing me,\" She added, \"I'd probably keep asking Sakura to play with me day after day if I was her pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs Sakura put the kettle on and began to get the tea things ready as her mind raced with this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Never since Syaoran-kun told me his feelings,' She thought, 'Have I felt this way. I don't know who I should choose. If I do love Tomoyo-chan we'll both feel happy but Syaoran-kun would probably feel dejected and Meilin-chan would never let it down; if I choose Syaoran-kun Tomoyo-chan could hurt inside and I wouldn't want that.' As Sakura got some snacks out as well, remembering extra for Kero, she started having daydreams<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe imagined Tomoyo in her nightdress, Tomoyo playing with people she had shrunk, Tomoyo in the palm of her hand, Tomoyo towering over Tokyo; so many different fantasies about Tomoyo flashed by, some practical and some magical. She wondered as to how she'd react if she were never going to have contact with the people she felt most strongly about. It would be discomforting if she could never see her father again but staying in contact would make it feel better, she didn't like waiting for Syaoran to come back to Japan but if he found another lover she felt like she could wish him the best of luck but, with Tomoyo, the idea of never seeing her ever again was too much. She carried the tray upstairs and set it down between herself and Tomoyo before looking her in the eye and saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan, I love you too. To go on without you would be like... like going without water.\" Tomoyo smiled the brightest and most affectionate smile she ever smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Sakura-chan.\" She replied. \"I'm sorry if I was pushing the idea of a shrunken refugee camp,\" It was a deliberate euphemism, \"But I was trying to think of a fun way by which you could help some of the problems with the world. Maybe you could shrink fugitives of true justice and punish them in the most appropriate manner.\" Sakura felt uneasy again at this prospect but felt that having little people might not be so bad if she could make it more bearable in some way.</span></div></div>",

Sakura smiled and, to add to the thanks, she used the Big card to slightly enlarge the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Kero-chan.\" She said but he didn't respond as his face was immersed in the cake. While he was gorging away at the strawberry shortcake Sakura decided to put the ring on so as to get used to it. Once it was on her finger she now marvelled at her creation, thinking about the miniature world within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Sakura went about her normal activities while wearing the ring; several people appreciated it as a simple piece of jewellery and even her teachers didn't think much of it because it was okay to wear rings in school as long as there weren't too many. When Tomoyo saw it she was over the moon as she thought about the change in plans to the choir's school trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing, Tomoyo-chan,\" Sakura checked, \"How are you going to get your luggage in with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right, Sakura-chan.\" Tomoyo answered. \"We were expected to be away for a while so luggage would be necessary anyway.\" Sakura nodded in recognition of this fact before Tomoyo went on to ask. \"Do you think I could have a room with a view?\" Sakura was stunned by this and wondered what sort of a view she desired. At first she figured that it would be a view of the landscape garden but, just to be sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of a view?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A view of you, Sakura-chan.\" Tomoyo replied. Sakura was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...You'd really be happy to have a view of my skin from your room?\" She checked. \"At such a small size?!?\" Tomoyo nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no landscape that's as beautiful than one that is you.\" She commented in an almost dream-like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Sakura conceeded, \"Will it be a view of my finger or of my hand?\" She sweatdropped at the thought of it. What is Tomoyo's choice?</span></div></div>",

If anything serious occurs, like a bad accident, I'll do what I can to help.\" Tomoyo smiled, knowing all too well that Sakura would do whatever she could to stop any of them suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any recommendations for additional luggage?\" Tomoyo asked. Sakura shook her head in a negative response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already accounted for what would normally be packed when expecting to stay in a hotel,\" She replied, \"Anything else important will be readily available.\" She paused as she realised that what she just said sounded like some kind of tour guide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tomoyo stated, \"I know what I'm bringing. If I don't see you before the time to depart I will now say 'Good luck' and 'See you out of the hotel window'.\" She giggled at the last comment.

As for her friends in the choir they all had just one suitcase and, perhaps, a second bag of some sort. Shouko Tsujitani, the music teacher, had actually brought two suitcases and her handbag. Because of the field trip their classes had been informed a few days in advance and Tomoyo had told Sakura exactly when they'd be going. Considering the time Sakura felt the only way this could be done is if she was to place her first class under a temporary charm. Unfortunately this meant using the Time card; even in a localised environment it would still take plenty of power. Sakura knew she had to act fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everyone,\" Tsujitani announced to the choir, \"I'm glad we're all here. The coach driver phoned earlier saying he had to stop for fuel, so he'll be a bit late I'm afraid.\" But the choir did not complain and indicated that they accepted the reason. Tomoyo was the least of all to complain; she knew that the later the coach would be the more time Sakura would have. \"In the mean time,\" Tsujitani continued, \"I thought we could practice our scales.\" With that everyone took their usual seats in the music room while she sat at the piano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had given herself no more than ten minutes to get to the music room, shrink the choir, and reach her first class of the day before the time charm wore off. Furthermore the less time she took the less magic would be used and the less conspicuously exhausted she'd be. She managed to reach the window of the choir in just two minutes, leaving her with eight. Looking in she identified where their things were and where they were all sitting. Having checked the whole room Sakura now made the command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring the choir and their luggage into the hotel in my ring, Little, Move.\" With that every student, every suitcase, every bag and the music teacher all glowed yellow and became a stream of glittering dots flying through the window like it wasn't there and right into Sakura's ring. When the stream had stopped Sakura dashed to the classroom she needed to be in. She now had between six and seven minutes before the charm on the classroom had to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intensity of the spell cast upon the choir meant that they materialised unconscious, which would make them believe that they had suddenly dozed off. Where do they wake up?</span></div></div>",

Tsujitani was actually one of the second to come round and Tomoyo was one of the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what happened?\" Asked one of the students as they attempted to get her bearings.

Daidouji-san, please make your way to the front of the group while I stay at the back; we don't know if anyone's gonna sneak up on us.\" As they gathered what they could Tomoyo thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know no one's gonna be sneaking through this place; we're the only ones here.'

Where the walls were not decorated there was a golden wallpaper and the ceiling bore a light pink colour that was now and again interspersed by small chandelier-type lights. After about one hour walking along this corridor they came upon a great conservatory looking out over an ambient forest under a blue sky that seemed a tad off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei?\" One of the students asked. \"What do we do now?\" Tsujitani thought this over before answering.</span></div></div>",

She always knew her mother would not make this sort of stuff up and the tone in Sonomi's voice added to the conviction.

Just then her hyper-sensitive ears picked up her father's voice calling her downstairs for breakfast. Once she responded to his call she got dressed, brushed her teeth, did up her pigtails, grabbed her school bag and went downstairs. But this isn't Sakura as we know her. In this alternative universe all females are a hundred times bigger than the men, so she's about four-hundred feet high!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this morning routine she would often find her brother sitting upon the table top at the men's table. As usual he would comment about her being a monster, although it now stems from her size as well as the sounds she makes at times. Another difference is that Sakura would merely sweatdrop and tell Touya to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's amazing for her to hear her miniature family so well. Like virtually all other women and girls in this universe, Sakura has a adaptation that allows her to interact with the much smaller men without any difficulties. Such adaptations include hyper-acute hearing and eyesight, an extra-quiet voice, extra-sensitive touch for when she holds someone in her fingers and, in case of accidental ingestion, a special sense of taste that alerts her whenever a man has entered her mouth so she can immediately spit him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also a major feat for men to cope with the female-sized world around them. Touya and Fujitaka could get on with any household chores thanks to special vehicles designed to allow men to fill in for a woman's role wherever the need should arise, as it has done for the Kinomotos.</span></div></div>",

There were worries that the family would collapse as the only female left was young Sakura, but Fujitaka took it in his stride and got a few extra chore vehicles to compliment those he used when Nadeshiko was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't easy for Touya to get the hang of these vehicles but Fujitaka was a patient teacher (no pun intended) and Sakura proved to be very mature, responsible and independent for her age. Such an arrangement made it manageable for the family to carry on as they were. Furthermore, since Nadeshiko's ghost visited regularly while Sakura was still a pre-schooler, her presence made it easier for Touya to cope with the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura grew up from her 200ft-300ft height she showed herself to be quite helpful around the house; as such Fujitaka agreed that she could be included in the chore rota, which gave him all the more time for his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya's teasing was a rather dangerous activity for him as, when she was younger, Sakura might have proved fatal in reacting but she always limited her most severe reactions to being almost entirely verbal.</span></div></div>",

She brought her index finger down right next to him and bent down to say to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think yourself lucky that I'm not like Godzilla.\" As usual when she made this counter-tease Touya simply patted her finger and muttered agreement half-heartedly. Her assertiveness always ended here as she stood up straight again and went to see if her father needed any help with serving the breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFujitaka had just been operated the arms of the cooking crane to get Sakura's breakfast onto the giant plate when he looked out of the cockpit to see his towering daughter peeping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I serve the breakfast, dad?\" She asked him. Fujitaka just smiled and accepted her offer. Before taking the breakfast over to the table she held up her hand to the upper door of the cooking crane; her dad unbuckled himself and stepped out onto her middle finger. Sakura lifted him up to her shoulder, which he jumped onto, and then she carefully pushed the crane to one side before carrying her breakfast to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had set Fujitaka in his seat next to Touya on the table Sakura sat down and used a couple of unusual instruments to give them a small portion of her breakfast. Just the right size for them even though their portions were mere crumbs to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had no need to rush her breakfast because Touya and Fujitaka often relied on her to give them lifts to wherever they needed to go; however Sakura would rush her breakfast if there was a sense of urgency for either of them.</span></div></div>",

Strolling across her bedroom to the en suite there was something about the silhouettes outlined by the light coming through the curtains that seemed different but she couldn't find the willpower to check it out so she continued to the bathroom to freshen up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had taken a shower and dealt with her ablutions Tomoyo returned to her bedroom to get dressed. As she put the last garment on she noticed the silhouettes more clearly now; although the typical garden silhouettes were still there she noticed that the more distant silhouettes were somewhat different. Just as she began to walk over to her window she heard a major cry that seemed to shake the earth; she could recognise Sakura's onomatopoeia but was surprised by how loud it was; she could almost understand it if Sakura were in her house but, as far as Tomoyo knew, she wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving recovered from the shockwave Tomoyo could hear strange movements outside and occasionally found the light coming through the window being almost totally blocked; she tried to figure out what it was. The first thing that came into her mind was that it was a Clow card, which would've explained why she could hear Sakura as she would have to have shown up if she identified its presence but she couldn't figure what Clow card would do something like this. As she pondered on this she heard Sakura's voice at a more tolerent level, even though it was as though they were sitting opposite each other at an el fresco table when she couldn't see anyone in the room with her, but the light was being obstructed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan,\" Sakura called out, \"Are you ready to come out?\" Judging by the direction of her voice Tomoyo figured that Sakura was outside her window; hoping to see her favourite girl suspended in the air brandishing the latest of her cards but sorry she was unable to tape the action Tomoyo grabbed her video camera and slung open the curtains... only to be met by the most heart-stopping, eye-opening, breath-taking, overwhelming, passion-firing, awe-inspiring, amazing, logic-defying humbling sight she'd ever seen. Sakura was right in front of her and above her; the biggest living thing she'd ever seen! In this moment she could already tell that Sakura far exceeded the tallest building she knew of.</span></div></div>",

The sight was so overwhelming that she could not hide her feelings from the (putting it mildly) giant Sakura; whereupon the huge (no pun intended) smile slipped into an expression of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan,\" Sakura asked in a surprisingly quiet voice for her size, \"Are you all right?\" For a moment Tomoyo's turmoil of emotions settled down so that awe and curiosity became the dominant feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If she's bigger than a city,' Tomoyo thought, 'How can she see me, much less my face? And how can her mouth, which could gobble up this whole house in one bite, produce such a seemingly quiet voice?' Figuring that now was not the time to ask or dwell on these Tomoyo pushed her curiosity to the back of her head and let feelings of joy and love take its place. Once her astonishment had subsided Tomoyo reached for the handle to her window, or more appropriately glass door, and slid it open, stepping out onto the balcony all the while aware of Sakura's gargantuan eyes locked onto her relatively tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Sakura-chan.\" Tomoyo called up to her tremendously titanic friend. Sakura still looked bewildered though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan,\" She replied, her voice not seeming to get any louder, \"You know you don't have to yell just for me.\" Tomoyo was shocked now; even though Sakura could probably have the whole of Tokyo for breakfast she could hear her as easily as if they stood eye-to-eye. When her focus returned to the colossal cardcaptor she saw that one of her hands were now in view, her pinky outstretched and coming towards her at a rate of knots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they were just classmates Tomoyo would probably have retreated back into her house and commence to get as far away from her bedroom as possible in the expectation that Sakura's 'little' finger would crash through the glass doors and knock out the opposite wall; however Tomoyo's complete and unconditional love for Sakura kept her legs firmly planted on the balcony as her eyes followed the ginormous digit closing in on her. It wasn't even within her own arm's reach even if she leaned out from the edge of the balcony when it was all she could see; in spite of the incomprehensible situation Tomoyo started paying more attention to the appearance of the tip of Sakura's pinky, the fact that she could see absolutely no flaw in the smooth light-coloured skin and that the fingernail arched across like the roof of a modern airport building, for want of a better analogy. Tomoyo found that she did not have more time to admire it from her home as the lower end of the fingertip brushed against her and pulled her along with it as Sakura withdrew her humongous hand and lifted her pinky into the air, making sure that the teeny tiny Tomoyo would be able to stand up and perhaps pace about on the tip of her 'little' finger.</span></div></div>",

It was only yesterday that she had been at school with Sakura, sitting at the desk next to hers, seeing her pretty face and her cute smile, and now she was lying face-down on Sakura's fingertip and Sakura seemed to be acting as though nothing was out of the ordinary and, although out of the ordinary was becoming all in a day's work for Sakura, Tomoyo was sure that Sakura wouldn't be this casual if either one of them had changed size. Once the rush of being swept up into the air had stopped Tomoyo pushed herself up on her knees, noticing that Sakura's skin gave way like the mattress of her own bed but with the added bonus that there were no sheets to crumple and the gentle soothing heat eminating from her beloved Sakura. Turning round to take a seat on Sakura's pinky Tomoyo looked up into the heavens to see the same pretty face magnified thousands of times; there was so much of her to take in that Tomoyo attempted to follow the cardcaptor's face down from the fringe of her hair to the nicely rounded chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Tomoyo Sakura's forehead had room for enough farmland to feed the whole of Tokyo and Yokohama combined and still have surplus left over for bad times; reaching the bridge of the nose Tomoyo felt like she was getting a bird's-eye view of the base of Mt. Fuji, looking left and right Sakura's eyes were great lakes of sparkling green with deep dark centres. As she looked into each one Tomoyo noticed she could see a reflection of a small figure in the lenses, that figure being herself. Continuing with her visual tour of Sakura's face she found that Sakura's nose had the most splendid slope and couldn't help but imagining everyone else in their class including herself going for a hike on this most magnificent ridge, stifling a giggle as she imagined Chiharu almost pushing Yamazaki up one of Sakura's nostrils. Then Tomoyo came to Sakura's mouth, which wasn't in a gigantic smile but had the lips pulled slightly downwards; going back up to the eyes Tomoyo saw Sakura's eyelids covering a fifth of the lakes of emerald and eyebrows you could go playing hide-and-seek in turned up. Sakura wasn't frowning or showing upset but was instead expressing concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're all right, Tomoyo-chan?\" Sakura checked, her voice never seeming to get any louder than what Tomoyo was used to. \"You're acting like I've never held you before.\" Tomoyo now seemed to understand what had happened. As she prepared to explain things to her loved one she checked over how far away she was suspended from Sakura's face and figured that she must be...</span></div></div>",

However, once Sakura's relief and Tomoyo's awe cleared up, Sakura now found herself feeling another sense of concern. \"But, if you're a Tomoyo-chan from another dimension, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of your Tomoyo?\" Tomoyo finished for her. \"Well, I suppose she's taken my place in my dimension. It makes feel like I'm being selfish.\" Sakura didn't ask as her eyes clearly indicated what she was feeling. \"Well,\" Tomoyo continued, \"I've now got tons and tons of Sakura-chan to love and she's going to be so disappointed when she finds that my Sakura-chan is no bigger than any other schoolgirl.\" Sakura listened to every word, amazed that the Tomoyo she was holding came from a world where she could fit in with the crowd, but also caught onto one particular word the tiny girl had said. She heard her own Tomoyo use it before but the context was clear now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... love... me?\" Sakura inquired and Tomoyo, noticing that the cat was out of the bag, moved over onto her knees, unfortunately the way Sakura had picked her up without damaging the Daidouji mansion meant that her shifting brought her precariously close to the edge.</span></div></div>",

Up above her loved one watched with a slight amount of concern as her tiny friend continued to tumble through the air; she knew that Tomoyo would have a soft landing no matter how many miles she'd fall as her skin would always cushion the landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo had to wait minutes before she found just how cushy her landing would be. She had fallen two miles before hitting flesh and now tumbled across the surface of Sakura's finger until she settled in the next knuckle down, three miles away from the tip of Sakura's pinky. Picking herself up and comically dusting herself off Tomoyo giggled at the thrill-ride she had been through and gave her giant love a cheery wave, at which Sakura sweat-dropped from the way that Tomoyo seemed to be rapidly getting over the fact that she was big enough to level entire prefectures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura-chan,\" Tomoyo spoke up as she returned to the conversation before she fell, \"I really do love you. You're my number one.\" Sakura took this in and wondered if her Tomoyo felt the same way. \"No matter which version of you it is I love all Sakura-chans, from the smallest to the biggest.\" Sakura now found that she had to decide what her feelings were about Tomoyo.</span></div></div>",

Just so we can get through the day.\" Sakura looked at the speck of a girl in her knuckle; as she saw it this Tomoyo was now doing her best to fill in for her original Tomoyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" Sakura responded while lifting her back up to her face, \"I could show you around. If the Sakura you knew was the size you are then you must be curious as to how I live.\" Tomoyo looked up at her hostess with a mixture of surprise from her insight and joy from the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura-chan,\" She answered, \"I'd love to be your little tourist! No matter what it is, as long as it involves Sakura-chan I'm sure I'll love it.\" Giving her a sweet super-sized smile Sakura now moved the index finger of her free hand over so that Tomoyo could jump aboard. She got the message as soon as she saw the outstretched hand alongside the one she was riding in; left to her own devices it would've taken Tomoyo ten minutes to get across Sakura's pinky to where she could sky-dive onto the tip of Sakura's index finger so Sakura tipped the hand Tomoyo was in slightly, causing her to slide down the valley of Sakura's knuckle and plunge onto Sakura's index finger in just four minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo soon realised why Sakura wanted her on this finger, she could see much more of the world around her. The first thing she saw was the Daidouji mansion spread out below them; it seemed to be on top of a cliff of some sort so Sakura didn't have to lie down to reach her. Looking beyond her mansion she saw a few more houses scattered around this clifftop and a tunnel in a wall out in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Kinomoto's Village.\" Sakura announced, causing Tomoyo to look up at her ride. \"Because I'm so huge all my family, friends, fellow students, teachers and most of their relatives have to live in this cute little village in my bedroom.\" Tomoyo was amazed; so many people she knew were living on a.. surface of some sorts in Sakura's bedroom.</span></div></div>",

Tomoyo first noticed that Sakura had a lovely view of the sea from a south-facing window that had to be at least ten miles across; noticing the interest Tomoyo had in this Sakura once again gave running commentary,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So as to make the lighting as natural as possible this window was installed to give all of us a proper daytime reference.\" Sakura turned again and Tomoyo espied another large furnishing. \"Because we all sleep in the same room, in a way,\" Sakura continued, \"I have to dress behind a fifty-five mile tall screen.\" Tomoyo had actually pulled out her video camera and was recording it all now. Now Sakura began to walk; her footfalls were impossible not to hear but Sakura lifted her arm up and down with them making it seem like she was gliding along to her passenger. Tomoyo couldn't help but take shots of the mighty Sakura Kinomoto covering the same distance in one step she would take three hours to cover on her comparatively puny little legs; she had already seen where Sakura was heading. A giant dressing table was directly ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo hadn't even realised they had arrived until she watched Sakura's face racing into the air as she was being set down on the dresser; she got the idea and when the descent stopped she strolled towards the front of Sakura's finger and slid down the tip until she stood on the underside of her fingernail, whereby she began walking again and jumping off the end onto the dresser. It was like jumping off a stage and, turning round, Tomoyo watched with astonishment as the massive digit soared away at close proximity before giving the giantess Sakura a respectful bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to have a look round.\" Sakura advised her. Checking out the surface of the dresser she saw several Sakura-sized objects that defied comprehension. The was an angle-view mirror that could help keep the sun off the North Pole, a hairbrush with bristles the size of skyscrapers and possibly even bigger and an angle lamp that could place an entire National Park in permament daylight. What really caught Tomoyo's attention was Sakura's school uniform hat on the lamp; looking at the humongous item of clothing she started to imagine a few key cities hidden inside it.</span></div></div>",

As soon as she set foot on the underside of Sakura's fingernail set felt herself being lifted up; a reorientation of the finger caused her to tumble head-over-heels again but this time found herself lying on the fingertip, only 20 yards away from where the skin curved under the nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would my tiny Tomoyo-chan like to see next?\" Sakura asked her. Tomoyo sat down upon her loved one's fingertip, having walked away from the nail for a few extra yards, and looked straight up into the emerald lakes of Sakura's eyes. She wondered what other extremely oversized items Sakura was lucky to possess and her first thought immediately went to where she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see what mountain you use for a bed, Sakura-chan?\" She responded; it was something of a tease to refer to Sakura as sleeping on a mountain and her hostess was used to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly.\" Sakura answered. \"You're quickly getting used to this, Tomoyo-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Tomoyo replied, \"Everything about you is still overwhelming but I see no reason to cower. After all, what difference would it make.\" This comment managed to make Sakura giggle, the vibrations resembling an earth tremor for Tomoyo. Sakura made her way over to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo tried to look upon where her mighty friend slept but the extension of Sakura's fingernail blocked her view. To compensate Sakura rotated her wrist 90 degrees, giving Tomoyo the unobscured view she was hoping for. The vast expanse that served as Sakura's bed didn't look too dissimilar to a normal bed; there was a mattress, a pillow, sheets, and a blanket suspended by a frame that appeared to be made out of the same stuff as the dresser. Doing what she could to recognise the proportions from afar Tomoyo figured that the pillow must be 5 miles thick and 25 miles across. The sheets seemed to be thin enough but, considering the scale, Tomoyo wondered if they might actually be 100 yards thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the scrutiny of the magnificent bed was done Sakura prepared to show Tomoyo some more of her giant furnishings when...</span></div></div>",

She steadily made her way back to the mansion, lifting her passenger closer to her face. Down below Tomoyo looked up as Sakura's face loomed larger and larger until all she could see of Sakura was her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonomi-san gets like this when I take you around in the morning.\" Sakura whispered to her. \"It is up to you as to whether you'll have breakfast at home or with me.\" Getting the message Tomoyo pondered over the possibilities. She wished to spend time with her alternative mother but she kept thinking about how thrilling it would be to have breakfast with such an enormous Sakura. She felt like she would've gone straight for the latter but, due to her close proximity to Sakura's mouth, she couldn't help but think of how easily Sakura could just swallow her alive; when she watched the huge maw form the words Sakura spoke she kept seeing those enormous white teeth and imagined cars, buses and lorries all stuck in the gaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Tomoyo's final decision?</span></div></div>",

Rubbing her eyes Tomoyo could now see that this maid was dressed in slighty different garb to what she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daidouji-sama,\" She said, \"I'm here to help you prepare for the ceremony.\" Tomoyo got up but found herself confused by those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ceremony?\" She asked, the maid seemed concerned but not shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still half asleep, my little lady.\" Came the reply. \"I'm speaking of your inaugeration at the great temple.\" Tomoyo was now fully awake and started to go along with the maid's activities. As she was getting ready in this manner her mind continued over what had been said; she could not recall ever discussing a post at a shrine or a temple so she couldn't fathom what was going on. The biggest surprise was getting dressed as she found a wide variety of clothes to wear. The main article was not too big a deal as she had worn it before, a pearl-white dress with frills around the cuffs and collar, but there were accessories that did not seem too familiar: a green singlet that was to be worn over the dress, pink high-heeled shoes (which the maid reassured as okay for walking indoors in), a platinum tiara with a large emerald embedded in the forefront and a gold necklace with a pendant bearing a star that Tomoyo noted resembled Sakura's own star symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon heading for the dining room Tomoyo found that her home seemed rather more complex than she remembered, as though a set of extensions and refurbishments had been made overnight, and there were various portraits on the walls showing many things that related to Sakura and her position as a card mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I in a parallel universe?\" Tomoyo asked herself. \"Is Sakura-chan more open about her powers in this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the dining room Tomoyo found her mother sitting at the head of the table, as usual, with a couple of servants on the flanks. As Tomoyo took her seat she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Tomoyo.\" Who responded likewise. When breakfast was served Tomoyo was amazed by the extra effort that had been put into it. \"I'm so proud of you,\" Sonomi continued, \"This is such a big day for you!\" Tomoyo now popped the question of what this was all about. \"Goodness me!\" Sonomi exclaimed. \"You must've been ever so excited last night that it's affected your memory. You know of Sakura-san?\" Tomoyo smiled brightly at this. \"Yes, yes you do. Today you will be officially recognised as the key mediator between her and our society. Such an honour it is for an ordinary schoolgirl.\" Tomoyo seemed quite confident in knowing that she was now in a parallel universe where Sakura's powers were made public, furthermore everyone now viewed her loved one as a mighty goddess. It made much more sense now.</span></div></div>",

Tomoyo also noticed that the bodyguards were in an attire that was rather more tradtional than she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Tomoyo first noticed that her home was indeed bigger than usual and the gardens were larger; this seemed very bizarre but she hoped to find answers eventually, after all where Sakura's concerned just about everything else could wait. Continuing along the driveway Tomoyo now understood that they'd be walking there, which made sense in spite of the technological level being as she remembered it, the first thing she noticed upon leaving the grounds was that there was much more green space than she remembered but otherwise it was still the same Tomoeda that she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked along Tomoyo couldn't help but think that there was something wrong with the sky; everytime she looked up there seemed to be an odd shine to it in places. Her most rational answer was sparse water droplets in the air causing an odd refraction of the sunlight. Diverting her gaze from this she looked around, seeing yet more indications that everyone was revering her beloved Sakura as a kami. Statues of her wearing the various costumes she herself had sewn stood in various public spaces, rising into the air in a posture of power and majesty and, interestingly enough, in almost perfect colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Tomoyo could now see a major construct on the horizon, which she soon deduced as her destination. It certainly looked quite impressive but it took another fifteen minutes or so before she realised just how impressive, it was the biggest structure she had yet seen, in fact...</span></div></div>",

This was something she definitely had to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo was really taken aback by just how large the temple was. Not only did it surround Tomoeda but the walls were no less than 100 feet high, most likely bigger even than that. Before long she stood with her escort in a great plaza stretching along parallel to the temple and, right in front, Tomoyo could see golden steps leading up to two doors of half green and white with handles that, as of yet, could've been either gold or brass. There were two figures standing beside these doors wearing red robes, which she figured had to be priests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had crossed the plaza, during which Tomoyo felt more and more enriched while the bodyguards seemed to be getting shaky, Tomoyo could now gauge the number and height of the steps. She counted nineteen steps, each one being about five inches high. Just then the bodyguards apologised that they were not aloud any further and stepped back; acknowledging this Tomoyo waited for prompting from the one remaining escort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you, Daidouji-sama.\" She said, whereupon Tomoyo gingerly placed one foot upon the first step and began a slow steady ascent to the doors while the maid followed on close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon stepping onto the platform in front of the doors Tomoyo noticed that the two priests were bowing very low, as such Tomoyo responded likewise but an arm stopped her from getting her head lower than her shoulders. She looked to her side and saw that it was her escort. Tomoyo did some thinking about this as she compared the rank that she appeared to be receiving with the etiquette of Japanese greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is time, m'lady.\" One of the priests mentioned as they slowly opened the doors...</span></div></div>",

The two priests did not enter but instead stood to the side in permament bow while Tomoyo's escort led her forward into the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after entering Tomoyo heard the priests closing the doors behind them. The minute the doors shut she now found that the hall was illuminated by a soft light that could not be traced, it was as though the whole ceiling should be a single light but it did not shine brighter than the rest of the hall, the only evidence being the way the shadows fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo was led deeper into the temple, now and again corridors led off from the hallway. Tomoyo wondered just how big the temple was when it stretched so far away from Tomoeda. Sometimes they would pass a priest or two or even a small group who always bowed deeply as Tomoyo went by, at first Tomoyo made a brief response but her escort ensured her that acknowledgement was not necessary for her. Tomoyo noted that all the priests wore a set of robes composed of different colours of the spectrum, which she theorised denoted rank. Eventually they came upon a less austentatious door than the first set. Upon passing through this Tomoyo was amazed to see what reminded her of a metro terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so bizarre to be in a temple that required a railway line to traverse it; Tomoyo found that they seemed to be going at a surprisingly fast speed (she even wondered if it was faster than a Shinkansen) and the carriage was very luxurious. Tomoyo even found that a crew was serving her lunch during the journey. But they eventually reached another station where the escort led her off the train and up a grand staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo wasn't sure but the golden elements of the temple complex, as she figured it must be, seemed to have been left far behind, which was a reasonable assumption. After some more walking Tomoyo was now greeted by a priestess clad in white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great One,\" She addressed Tomoyo, \"Your arrival is an honour. Come! We are ready to begin the ceremony.\" Tomoyo followed her down some more golden corridors, which she figured were only featured in key locations, while her original escort went elsewhere. In a relatively short time she stepped through a well-decorated doorway and into...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tomoyo now found herself inside a vast chamber with great gold walls all around; including the one she came through she counted fifty-two doorways and sets of stairs, which were of six steps six inches high each, and a vast circular floor upon which a massive silver etching of the circle of Sakura shone in the bright light, standing out against the multi-coloured floor, which shared the colours of the robes of the priests. From the outer edge to where the star was outlined it went from red to violet and, inside the star outline, it was a brilliant shining white. Up above the ceiling swept inwards where it rose from the golden walls and, right above the floor, it became a vast sky blue circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priestess in white stood at the nearest edge of the star to Tomoyo, facing her, as priests and priestesses clad in violet and indigo bagan to enter. Not wanting to get lost in a crowd Tomoyo descended the stairs and set foot upon the floor. With each step she surveyed the symbols that she had seen when Sakura would summon her staff, now blown out of proportion. It took her ten steps just to reach the first character as she approached the centre; by the time she came to the priestess in white priests in blue were beginning to enter, about twenty minutes after Tomoyo had entered. All around them priests in violet robes were accumulating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us take our places, ma'am.\" The white priestess said as she crossed over the broad line of silver and into the white zone; recognising what she was to do Tomoyo did the same. As they walked Tomoyo felt really cheerful for no reason she could find and the priestess seemed to be staring at the ceiling. Getting closer to the centre Tomoyo saw a thin gold circle, which had earlier been lost in the brilliant white of the centre. The white priestess did not cross this line so Tomoyo followed her lead. \"Please, great one,\" She pleaded, \"Take up your position.\" Tomoyo looked around, wondering what she meant. \"As the one closest to the Goddess you must  stand upon the epicentre.\" She gestured towards the circle. Tomoyo soon figured out how this chamber worked; seniority determined how close to the centre you'd be, probably considering it holy, and yet she could stand right <i>at</i> the centre. She slowly and steadily stepped across this final threshold and, in only a few steps found the middle of the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood there Tomoyo saw the doorways, now appearing way off in the distance, swarming with colour as many more priests entered. As the ranks grew Tomoyo now saw that the priestess in white had withdrawn to halfway between her and the priests in violet. Once the doorways were clear the white priestess raised her arms and began to flap them, all around the priests knelt from the edge of the star to the feet of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the will of the Great Goddess,\" The white priestess announced, \"Let us bestow her greatest disciple with our praise.\" She turned round and knelt herself as the room filled with rhythmic chants. A strange energy seemed to be flowing into Tomoyo from all directions until, suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Tomoyo found this amazing but wasn't all that surprised by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be the Float card.\" She mused as her eyes rose from the receding floor up to the approaching ceiling. She wondered what was going to happen as it raced towards her faster and faster; instinctively she braced herself as it came upon her. Opening her eyes she found herself surrounded by blue, her body could still be seen clearly but the great chamber was now out of her sight. \"Is this what it's like to use the Through card?\" She wondered as she seemed to be swimming in some kind of opaque air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Tomoyo now found herself seeing much farther as her head poked through the other end of the blue. She could see the golden roof of the temple receding into the distance, and apparently curving over the horizon, while beyond she was amazed to see the endless depths of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A goddess's place is in the heavens,\" Tomoyo said to herself, \"So Sakura must be somewhere out here.\" As she looked back down as her feet exited the blue she first noticed that the area of blue went right through to this end, surrounded by the gold roof, while the temple seemed to be stretching on from what she perceived as east to west far more than north to south. Tomoyo could not understand why she could see no evidence of clouds, oceans or greenery. Trying to figure this out she now noticed something else; north of the temple she could see a great pale plain stretching on and on with lines that could've been furrows but the scale was too big, while due south a similar sort of plain seemed to spread out in all directions with some very odd arrangements of similar lines. Looking around for more info Tomoyo noticed that there were two more elongated plains stretching due north, one shorter than that which had the temple and one slightly longer, and in between Tomoyo caught sight of the endless sea of space. Further checks yielded another one next to the longer one that was about the same length as the first she saw; off to the right of this she perceived the sphere of Earth at a reasonable distance and the shortest, but widest of these elongations beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she zoomed away Tomoyo took another look, something was very familiar about this. The elongations each had a smooth protrusion over the horizons at the ends. Now Tomoyo gasped as she realised that, in fact, the temple was a massive ring on a hand that was so vast that she could not find a single adjective that could readily sum it up. She took a deep breath as she managed to turn round and look up, straight at Sakura's visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredible! Tomoyo had discovered that Sakura was now so huge that the Earth could not accomodate her. Small wonder then that everyone she had met was treating her like a goddess. Tomoyo was so full of wonder that the sense of joy overlapped the sense of awe. Eventually Tomoyo's flight through the vaccuum from the ring on Sakura's finger came to an end...</span></div></div>",

Actually falling through a pore right in the central base of Sakura's forehead, she found herself in a well furnished room, the walls of which were Sakura's own flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could wonder too much, a familiar voice suddenly entered her mind. \"Tomoyo-chan! So good to finally have you here again.\" At this Tomoyo gave a start, for while she did recognise the voice as Sakura's; the word \"again\" confused her greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura-chan, what exactly is going on?\" Was all Tomoyo could think to say with the wonder still at an overpowering level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan! You... what's happened?\" Tomoyo felt Sakura's worry in her very being. \"Did something happen to your memory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... yesterday was just an ordinary day, and today I wake up and everyone sees you as a goddess! I don't know how that could happen in so short a time... unless I'm in an alternate universe or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomoyo-chan...\" Sakura paused. \"That... oh no. I think that might be my fault. I was trying to prepare you for the journey to your room while you slept... and I saw you fluctuate in existence for a moment. I pulled you back quick... but... oh gosh! What if I pulled a different you back here?

She wondered if perhaps Sakura had a sweatdrop but decided to continue without mentioning it. \"Um... so could you tell me what's happened in this universe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yes, of course...\"</span></div></div>",

The walls trembled slightly as Sakura chuckled. \"Yes, I can see you nod. Well, firstly, I absorbed all the Clow Cards' powers, since Kero-chan said I could just remake the Cards when I became ready to pass them on. But absorbing them made me wonder what else I could do, so I   called to the stars and tried to see if I could tap their power more directly. I ended up absorbing two Suns into my eyes. This had the side effect of making me grow, which I didn't expect. My best guess is I'll keep growing until my eyes alone are the size of those Suns. With me so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo was full of questions but managed to just nod. \"Well,\" Sakura continued, \"After that there was no way to hide my powers from the world. I did what I could to aid as many people as I could. Luckily I wasn't feared... well mostly wasn't... and, actually, I was surprised when a religion sprung up around me. I chose you, my closest friend, to help me when I became too big to stay on Earth. I'm hoping that you are willing to come with me when I leave... my universe's Tomoyo was but I won't hold you to what she decided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Tomoyo felt she had to ask something. \"What do you mean leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura hesitated at the worry in Tomoyo's voice. \"I will have to leave the galaxy eventually. It's hard enough for my magic to keep my size from affecting the Solar System. Trying to do that for the whole galaxy would be far too complex for me to figure out in the time I have. I'll have to leave Earth behind, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo was shocked by this, but after some thought realised its truth. \"Well, I will come with you for sure. I can't stand the thought of you being alone, and I can't stand the thought of being without you, Sakura-san!\" After Tomoyo's determined declaration, the room suddenly became warmer and took on a reddish tint, causing Tomoyo to become worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are you sure, Tomoyo-chan?\" The tone of Sakura's mindvoice made Tomoyo relax, and even giggle. It was obvious that Sakura was just blushing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure. But why can't you bring Earth with you? Surely you'd have room for the whole Solar System somewhere you could carry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about that, but sealing the Solar System away from the galaxy doesn't seem like a good idea. Earth is getting overpopulated as it is, and even one star system will eventually run out of room for people to colonise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But surely you could make more planets if you needed? What about the Create Card?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's mindvoice came back in a surprised tone. \"I ... didn't think of that. But how would people react to my doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering you're their goddess now, I would think they would want you to stay with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's mindvoice sounded amused. \"Tomoyo you never cease to amaze me.

Credit goes to him. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1375826-Shoujo-Anime-Giantess/map/14331212221\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/it...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Tomoyo surely has one special type of life, and a pretty good and big one at that. She woke up from her bed, ready to start a fun day in the summer with her friends. It was extremely thoughtful for her mother to have gotten her a private island with many things to do as she is a 400ft tall giantess (was going to make her a little bit smaller around 200ft tall to be more exact to Godzilla's height) who height easily matches those of some of the tallest buildings in the world. She sure has been the luckiest, and more importantly, the largest girl in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo surprisingly remembered a great portion of her growth over the years. You see, when she was just a baby, she started developing some growth spurts that was caused by an unknown disease that no one could even explain. It started small over the years, but by the time she was around 3 or so, she started to grow a lot bigger. At that point her mother and investors had talks with the government over the extreme conditions of her growth, and what adaptations would be needed to help the girl through her lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first entered school, many of the boys called her a Kaiju like Tomozilla, or Girlzilla, and very few girls came outside to play with a girl that was pretty big. Some were brave enough to talk to her and such, but it did took Tomoyo awhile to get used to it. The people did respect her privacy even though she was the talk of Japan in many aspects and there was, funnily enough, a talk about having her being registered as the world's first real life Kaiju; oddly enough that surfaced after an incident that helped her. You see, when she was around 6, she was actually called by some demolition groups to help destroy some buildings for reconstruction purposes, and that it would take them awhile to do it. Tomoyo was slightly nervous about this as she remembered being called Tomozilla by the boys and such, but her mother still assured her at that moment that she is still a great girl, and thanks to that pep talk she got that day, she decided to use her size and power to stomp and destroy those buildings with ease. The people went wild and came to like her for what she did. Tomoyo smiled as she overcame her fear of being mocked by those boys and not being useful to the community, though she still wanted a normal life as possible. It was also that day that she meet a girl named Sakura, who was awed by what she did, and she just transferred to her school after moving from somewhere else, but heard stories of her. She told her. \"Don't listen to what those boys say to you. Sure you look like a monster, and feel like one. But to me, you are not a monster, and even if I did call you one, you are a friendly monster to me.\" And Tomoyo was moved by her speech. Sure she might have the height and power of a monster, but she isn't a monster, and if she is one, then she is a friendly one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years Tomoyo got bigger, and today she stands at the massive 400ft feet tall she is. The boys still call her Tomozilla, but at least she got used to the name, and doesn't mind it now as they and the girls are now both trustworthy of her. She was also surprised of the love that the people showed her, how they adjust the cities streets to adjust to the gigantic girl, or how they make clothes her size, or how they made a miniature city for her on her own island if she even wanted to destroy something for fun. She also shown a lot of love to them by being helpful, and even doing them a few Kaiju movies. Just as she thinks back on all those memories...</span></div></div>",

She thought it was very thoughtful of her mother to have this annex built for her, especially since it was extremely spacious even for her. Considering that she had grown to a height of four miles even a room like that of a tent would be lucky so she was in no doubt that she had to be the luckiest, as well as the largest, girl in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered so much of her growth. It started when she was only three years old and it had been a month since her third birthday, she began to grow at a rate of half a foot every day, leading to her being as tall as her mother after just one week. Throughout the rest of her time as a three-year old the government, her mother and several others all argued about the cause of and the adaptations required for her condition of extreme growth. Once she was four she had already exceeded 100 feet in height, and yet she seemed to carry the disposition she had now since she was only 35 feet high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was a first year at Tomoeda Elementary she was already bigger than the famous monster 'Godzilla'; she remembered how the boys had always called her 'Tomozilla' and how the girls hardly went outside when she attended, although there were a few who would brave the vulnerability but it took her a while to be able to have fun with any of them. Once she moved up to second year everything was settling down except her size. While she was the talk of Japan the people respected her privacy and her feelings; that was when her mother and several sympathetic investors comissioned her new room, built to acomodate a fifty-mile tall person! Back then she was only just scraping a mile and couldn't comprehend growing that big. It was also when the nickname 'Tomozilla' ended as the boys were always too stunned to make fun and the girls were ever so trusting of her, especially since 'the incident'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when one first year had gotten up onto the school roof and had bent too far over the mesh fence, Tomoyo was the only one who saw her as she was so quiet that no one else figured that she got up there; everyone was sure that if Tomoyo's hand hadn't broken the young girl's fall then she would be dead. It was this particular act of kindness that convinced all her fellow students that she meant well. Another thing that people noticed as she grew was that all her senses and her voice and grip control became more and more acute, allowing her to handle anyone at all without the risk of breaking their bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo also remembered when she first met Sakura. It was in the second trimester of her second year, just after she had grown past one and three-quarter miles when, during one break, Sakura came up to the roof to greet her. Tomoyo had never known any student coming on to the roof <b>alone</b> just to say hello to her; their friendship was sealed when Sakura actually asked Tomoyo to pick her up. The trust she placed in Tomoyo was so reassuring. At the start of the third year, when she was close to two and a half miles high, Sakura presented her with an industrial-size rubber, even though it looked so small in her hands; ever since it became her most treasured possession and she began to develop very strong feelings for this tiny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tomoyo got on the five-mile mark stool (she had these stools in her annex as precursors to her expected height of fifty miles) and brushed her hair she thought back over her time as a third year, thinking over how her rate of growth changed from time to time, how the populace willingly and enthusiastically accepted periodical rebuilds of Tomoeda so the streets could accomodate her feet, the constant influx of clothing made to help her manage in her extreme size. She was in no doubt that she was so lucky to have all this plus good friends, a loving mother, and so much more when she made famous Japanese kaijuu look like puny insects. Just then...</span></div></div>",

Turning round from the dressing table she espied a maid on the balcony that was equal to her eye-level. It was very important for normal-sized people that a set of balconies starting at one mile and going up every quarter of a mile was installed in one part of one wall in Tomoyo's bedsit; a set of lifts made accessing Tomoyo's eye-level swift and easy so no one would find themselves struggling up thousands of flights of stairs. Getting down from her stool Tomoyo carefully thundered her way over to where the maid was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like for breakfast, my giant lady?\" The maid asked; Tomoyo had no qualms about people using adjectives that emphasised her height and sometimes teased those who were closest to her at a relatively mild level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tomoyo mused in one of her quietest voices, \"I've never tried domestic staff before.\" In spite of the twinge of primal fear the maid in question did not flinch at the suggestion; as she expected Tomoyo let out a giggle that was comparable to a rumble of thunder crossed with choir singers and extended one of her fingers to the balcony to pet the little maid on her back. \"But seriously,\" She continued as she withdrew the mighty digit, \"I'll settle for some porridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to drink?\" The maid continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like a glass of orange juice,\" Tomoyo answered. \"If there are enough oranges in the world.\" Both of them couldn't help but giggle at this. The fact of the matter was the bigger she grew the less food and drink she needed; even then it was incredible that there was always enough food for the mountainous schoolgirl without nearly everyone else in the world descending into famine. Not only was she a worldwide celebrity but also a miracle. To put things into perspective Tomoyo's breakfast would compose of enough porridge to fill five olympic-sized swimming pools and enough orange juice to flood Kyoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause so much could not be singularly transported there was a kitchen dedicated entirely to Tomoyo under the floor of her bedsit with freight lifts adapted from shipbuilding cranes to get the tremendous crockery, cutlery and glassware up to Tomoyo's dining table.</span></div></div>",

Though the island was off tectonic plate boundaries earthquakes were all too common but never serious, in fact the locals take the quakes quite humorously. This is for a very simple reason, the mansion is home to the source of the earthquakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo Daidouji was no ordinary schoolgirl; she had far exceeded all possible heights for living things. Her pinkies alone were a mile long each; her immense size could be very scary for those unfamiliar with her, which is why she lives on this island so a community could build up around her. There were no explanations for the vast crop yields from the islands farmland but it was fortunate that there were for Tomoyo consumed all the produce that the farms released and everyone else lived on imports; the mansion and farmland were property of Tomoyo's mother who maintained Tomoyo's ability to live as close to how a normal-sized person could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unbelievable how much Tomoyo grew in just ten years. She always had a rapid growth rate as a baby but, when she was 50 feet tall on her 3rd birthday then eyebrows were raised. Governments and private companies around the world supported Sonomi in her efforts to adapt to Tomoyo's extraordinary growth. By school age she was already a mile high and it was quickly decided what had to be done, resulting in the island colony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tomoyo grew strange things began to happen that would help her interact with the rest of humanity; her senses sharpened, her voice could range in volume so much that it sometimes felt like she hadn't exceeded eight feet.</span></div></div>",

Because of this Tomoyo had been attending regular medical examinations to determine how her body held itself together as well as any average girl; the results always showed the same thing, all of her body tissues had grown proportionally with her while her cells did not grow. It still didn't explain why she was so massive and could still physically operate like a normal-size girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who agreed to form the island community were either very open-minded or had dealings with the Daidouji family before, anyone else who decided to join the community would have to get used to the 34 mile high schoolgirl. The school Tomoyo attended was an annex to the mansion as it had to accomodate her tremendous form as well as all the other students; in fact the entire educational system on the island was integrated into the mansion complex so each year would be ready for the titanic student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA major income for the island was tourism. You can't keep a schoolgirl bigger than Mt. Everest under wraps so she became something of a celebrity; as such Sonomi had set up a guided tour that would give tourists the sights they wanted to see and, because they're guided tours, could orientate them to work with Tomoyo's own schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school everyone was friends with Tomoyo as she was such a caring girl especially considering the extreme difference in size she exhibited but there were some who were closer than others; Tomoyo herself had no friend closer than Sakura Kinomoto. Their relationship was unique in that Sakura had successfully obtained a giant rubber when Tomoyo forgot her own; how she did it is unimportant. The fact of the matter is that, ever since, Tomoyo always thought of Sakura as her precious little gem and always ready to assist her more than anyone else where being bigger than Malta would come in useful.</span></div></div>",

Rising from her bed, which would be big enough for her as long as she didn't exceed 60 miles in height, she went across to where her bathroom was. Everything was scaled as close to her as the engineers could manage, with taps that gushed forth so much water Niagra Falls would be put to shame and a bath that could rival Lake Michigan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen changing out of her night attire she knew it would be impossible for any motorised transport to lift, so she set it on the special conveyor system that was her personal laundry system, complete with a procedure that got it back in the appropriate item of furniture (e.g. wardrobe) for her to use it again. Anything she used that had a chance of getting dirty had this kind of treatment except for the bed where several extra-large cranes had to be used to change the sheets, otherwise Tomoyo would deal with it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was dressed Tomoyo exited her bedroom and went along a comparatively short corridor to her dining room, where major engineering works had to be installed to move the giant crockery, glassware and cutlery along with the vast quantities of food and drink to keep the titaness well looked after. As always as she sat down on her specially designed chair a maid appeared at a doorway that led onto the table from the wall it was adjacent to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I FANCY SOME SCRAMBLED EGGS AND TOAST TODAY.\" Tomoyo informed her, whereupon the maid bowed and returned to the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

The bread from which the toast would be made was homemade, whenever one loaf ran out another would be baked for these two were Tomoyo-sized; a single slice could obliterate Derby. The toasting process required a furnace large enough to engulf New York. The cooking of the scrambled eggs needed instense blowtorches against the mixer, which was appropriately thermostatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the vittles were ready they needed to be transfered to a plate the size of Greater London and, furthermore, while this was going on another maid had gone up to see what the titaness wanted to drink, which happened to be tea. Preparing a drink for someone so huge was another industrial task. First an entire factory's worth of tea had to be dumped into a vat as big as Osaka followed by water that was kept around boiling temperature in an urn the size of Mt. Fuji and this had to be left to mash for five minutes at least, with regular samples taken to test if it was strong enough, before a sluice that could be used as a radio dish would be opened sending the resulting liquid down an aqueduct as wide as the Missisippi and through wire meshes that could supply enough material to rewire the entire national grid in Belgium into a teacup the size of a standard reservoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the colossal meal was properly presented large hydraulically-powered lifts would get the material up to the correct level where they would be carefully transferred to massive railtracks of the kind used in rocket launch sites that would suspend the crockery as a set of motors would operate the chain drive that would pull the material out onto the table where Tomoyo would simply lift each item of the transport and set it down on the mats, cutlery would be presented just behind the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finished the dirties would be lowered down to the industrial dishwasher under the floor of her dining area, this is where the mats come in so as to save time transferring them onto anything special because the mats are really platforms on top off hydraulic rams..</span></div></div>",

However within a few hours reason was brought to the public, indicating that if Kaho had any intentions that were commonly associated with giants then the nation wouldn't stand a chance. Once everyone calmed down Kaho carefully took a seat on a hillside and waited for those unfamiliar with her to be informed of her life story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaho was the daughter of the head priest of the Tsukimine shrine. There was little information about her childhood except that she did experience extreme growth spurts that made her a hundred feet tall at the age of ten; the most popular theory was that the kami of the shrine made it so but others wanted an answer that would be more logical, even though they never found one. Kaho had always been very caring and helpful, even when people believed that her digits were too big and cumbersome to handle delicate tiems like yard brushes she could still interact with something as delicate as a teddy bear without squeezing all the stuffing out.

They were todl that a few year's ago, since such a magnificent woman could not remain a national secret even if they wanted her to, Kaho had been invited to a whole array of different nations and as such she had selected a few that she could and would desire to visit. It appeared that she had just returned from her journeying. The people were now wondering what this globe-trotting giantess would be doing in Japan from now on.</span></div></div>",

Although she had encountered this mighty woman earlier she did not have time to find out why she was so enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sakura was rushing back home to start preparing the dinner a close encounter with a cat meant that she nearly toppled over at high speed, had Kaho not been observing her from up above. Her massibve hand managed to get down to street level in time to give the tiny sorceress a soft landing, furthermore Kaho had particular interest in this little girl and couldn't help but pick her up as soon as she felt that small figure against her skin. Once Sakura recovered she pushed herself up on all fours and stared at the soft peach-coloured ground before looking up into Kaho's monumental face. Having seen people both from a mouse's POV and a giant's POV Sakura could handle it fairly well but was still uneasy when considering that Kaho was more than half the size of Tokyo Tower. Though she was held close Sakura found that Kaho's voice was not that much louder than a normal-sized woman's, not only that but she was so charismatic that Sakura felt that she would for sure be safe with her. Having looked upon one another Kaho then set Sakura back down, allowing her to find her balance by using her index and middle fingers to keep her suspended, and mentioned that they'd meet again tomorrow. Sakura had not seen her earilier as she was too preoccupied but now all she could do was stare at the giantess carefully thundered away, placing each foot neatly between the buildings and always giving people time to move, before commencing on her journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the time came Sakura noticed that Touya did not feel very comfortable so she tried to reassure him that Kaho meant no harm; however she was later informed that it was not fear of her size that Touya was getting worked up about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Kaho was going to be the new maths teacher at Tomoeda Elementary the head teacher had to let it be known that Kaho would have to decide where the class would be since one of her hands alone was bigger than one of the classrooms. When Sakura finds that her class is about to take a maths lesson from Kaho where will it be?</span></div></div>",

She peeped back into the tent to say goodbye to the picture of her mother before setting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's just as well that Tohru saw the bright side of life. She was a giantess! She stood around one-hundred feet high and wore size 80 shoes (468.75 in Japanese shoe size). Here's a brief history of her kind on Earth:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor hundreds of years giants and humans lived together on Earth with an edgy relationship. Oftentimes one experienced discrimination from the other with severe consequences. However, after the Second World War, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights allowed the two races to live together comfortably. Unfortunately the War had left the world empty of male giants, so giantesses had to marry and breed with ordinary men. Curiously enough, no matter what, a giantess would always give birth to humans and only occasionally gave birth to a giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohru's mother was a giantess and was, in fact, the last giant in her family. This made Tohru the last giant on her mother's side.</span></div></div>",

She was the sort who saw it as right to crush criminals beneath her high heels and, when she was pregnant, she would actually eat criminals. This gave her a legendary status: To some she was a towering heroine, bringing the criminal underworld to its knees; to others she was a force to be feared as she strode through city streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kyoko was mothering Tohru her criminal hunting slacked off but she still saw it as a giantess's duty to hunt crime and tried to raise Tohru in this manner. When her husband passed away she felt such remorse that she gave up hunting and, instead, saw employment in construction. She enjoyed her work with the police as a government executioner but it was a limited wage; as a giant contractor she got a better income but was a tiny bit frustrated by the delicate procedure of her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs giants, both Kyoko and Tohru earned a goverment grant to ensure that they could have as human a life as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tohru grew up she showed an extremely gentle nature for her size. She was the polar opposite of her mother. While Kyoko was an experienced executioner and had difficulty with the delicateness of her construction work Tohru could hold a mosue between her finger and thumb without harming it in any way and she saw no merit in killing people regardless as to whether or not they had it coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their area of Japan Kyoko and Tohru were the only giants left; they were, effectively, an endangered species. This being so Tohru could look forward to major bonuses on her living grant if she married and had giant children. The general feeling amongst the people was that if you were a giant's friend then you were special/honoured.</span></div></div>",

Uo lived up to her stereotypee as a Yankee, being the member of a street gang, and as such saw Kyoko as a legendary figure to fear and respect. She envisioned her duahgter to be a formidable force of immense strength. When she first set eyes on Tohru she first thought that she was an exchange student or a visitor from another part of Japan, since Tohru seemed too cheery to her to be Kyoko's daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohru's innocence was surprising and Uo was shaken by both Tohru's joviality and her size. After a few days of getting to know one another Tohru carried Uo back to her place where Uo set eyes on Kyoko. The conversation between idol and disciple was rather unorthodox as Uo could not understand why Kyoko was constructing buildings now instead of destroying criminals; however, when Kyoko heard that Uo belonged to a street gang (more importantly the exact one), once Tohru was out of the room, Kyoko offered to temporarily return to executing. In other words, she insinuated to Uo that she was to be giantess food. After that shocking experience Uo found that Kyoko has softened up a bit for her daughter and started to like this way of life. For her, the rest is history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHana, on the other hand, had transfered to Tohru's middle school in the last year after a disturbing experience in her old school. Hana did not show any fear of Tohru at all when they met and even talked with her about their experiences, since they had both experienced prejudice. It did not take long for them to become good friends and Tohru even offered herself as a sort-of bus service for her friends, letting them ride on her shoulders as she strode to school.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>12 year-old Mitsuki Kouyama, at first glance, looks like your typical girl. She\u2019s a big fan of singing, but lives in a strict household with her grandmother, who despises music and doesn\u2019t allow her granddaughter to do so much as hum around her presence. Despite this, she went off on her own from her house to audition as an idol singer. Why the sudden interest? Because only a few months ago she was told by two shinigami (death gods), Takuto and Meroko, that she was to die within a year. Not wanting her life to go to waste, Mitsuki selfishly asked Takuto to allow her to sing. He reluctantly agreed, much to the dismay of his partner. And with a special pill Mitsuki transforms from a 12 year-old to a healthy, blonde-haired 16 year-old girl who goes by the stage name of Full Moon. And since then she has continued to sing, despite pressure from both the press and her colleagues alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had now been six months almost to a tee since Mitsuki had met Takuto and Meroko. She wanted to do something to thank them for allowing her to perform and sing, considering her finite time of life left in her. Unfortunately she couldn\u2019t ask them for help; that would feel her feel awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you buy for people who are already dead? Maybe a simple \u2018thank you\u2019 might just suffice\u201d, Mitsuki said to herself in her bedroom on a nice Sunday morning. As she continued to think to herself, she saw something lying on the ground. It looked very similar to the pill that Mitsuki ate to transform into her teenage counterpart, but this was blue instead of the usual golden color. Further examination showed that it had the look and even the smell of that of a jellybean, not the usual kind of pill that she was used to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably just a jellybean. Oh well\u201d, Mitsuki continued to say for herself as she ate it in one gulp\u2026until she realized she just ate something off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did I just do that\u2026? It feels like I was drawn to eat it or something\u201d, the perplexed girl told herself as she decided to get ready for her work as an idol singer. Takuto and Meroko, who were still sleeping in their disguised forms around her bed (a cat and rabbit, respectively), woke up to the sound of Mitsuki moving around drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure are loud this early in the morning\u201d, Meroko whined, turning back into her regular human form. In this form the girl had long, pink hair, with a clothing attire consisted of a small red bra with a zipper that covered her breasts, a short red skirt, a red hat (with bunny ears to the sides of it), white pantyhose, and dark red boots. And lastly, she had wings protruding from her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Mitsuki?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Meroko! Sorry for waking you up\u201d, Mitsuki apologized as she continued to get ready for her day. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m trying to get ready for work and all, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re having a hard time deciding what to wear?\u201d the still tired shinigami replied, yawning and stretching her arms as she hovered across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah. Could please wake up Takuto for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t have to. I\u2019m already up\u201d, the groggy cat replied as he prepared to stand up. \u201cJust choose something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that. I can\u2019t just wear whatever I please..\u201d, Mitsuki explained to Takuto as she went through various dresses of hers, finally deciding on one at long last. It was a standard medium-length pink dress, with small ribbons on the back of the dress. IT wasn\u2019t much, but considering Mitsuki\u2019s newest gig was an appearance on a children\u2019s morning show she didn\u2019t need to dress fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHard to believe it\u2019s been six months already, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Meroko cheerfully asked both Mitsuki and Takuto as she hovered in peace a foot above Mitsuki. \u201cSo much has happened since then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. And each day brings new surprises in store\u201d, Mitsuki chirped as she put on her pink dress. Meroko covered up Takuto\u2019s eyes until she finished changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mitsuki was done changing, Takuto then reverted to his human form, much like Meroko. In this form he had short, brown hair, with a tiny ponytail behind it. He had short brown hair topped by a hat with cat ears, and he wore a white, unbuttoned shirt (with a black undershirt underneath it) with short, blue sleeves, blue jeans pants, black shoes, and a little backpack with small wings protruding out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready, Mitsuki?\u201d the annoyed shinigami asked of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am, Takuto. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Mitsuki hesitantly told him as she proceeded to sneak out quietly from her room, watching as Meroko transformed herself into Mitsuki as she did so! Takuto quietly followed the 12 year-old as they proceeded to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful you two\u201d, warned Meroko. <i>For some reason I feel that something really strange is going to happen today..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki and Takuto soon arrived outside the T.V. studio she was to perform in today. The two quickly proceeded inside and headed to the nearest girls\u2019 restroom, with Mitsuki hiding in one of the near-by stalls. Thankfully no one else was in there, so she decided to use a locked stroll to transform into her teenage form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Mitsuki. Here we go\u201d, Takuto proceeded to tell her as he snapped his fingers. The then 12 year-old girl proceeded to transform into a 16 year-old singer before his eyes! Usually Mitsuki gained a few inches when she transformed, but today something was\u2026off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem taller than usual, Mitsuki\u201d, Takuto informed the girl, standing back to back with her. She was amazed to find out that she was only an inch or so shorter than him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! This is weird!\u201d Mitsuki panicked, growing another couple of inches, now at a height of 5 feet and 10 inches or so. Her dress thankfully kept up with her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that the more you freak out, the more you grow. Just stay calm and you should be okay..\u201d, Takuto analyzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d, a still worried Mitsuki replied, growing another 2 inches in the process. She was now exactly 6 feet tall.</span></div></div>",

She thought there was very little chance of the kids in the audience, much less anyone else, plausibly believing that the girl had gained almost a foot in height in such a short amount of time. Takuto, meanwhile, was wondering if the effect had something to do with Mitsuki\u2019s transformation. He snapped his fingers to revert the girl back to her 12 year-old self, wondering what would happen upon doing so. To his surprise, the effects were the same. It seemed that Mitsuki was the size height now in both her original age and her 16 year-old counterpart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026.\u201d, Mitsuki continued to whine, proceeding to grow another 3 inches, now making her 6 feet and 3 inches tall. Takuto snapped his fingers once again and reverted her back to her 16 year-old for, giving the girl a sympathetic hug with his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ll fix this. Now go out there and perform\u201d, Takuto whispered to Mitsuki in as quite and nice a voice he could. It <i>did</i> make her calmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, wish me luck\u201d, the mini-amazon Mitsuki told Takuto as she ran out of the bathroom and down to the set the show was being played at. Unsurprisingly, she had quite a bit of stares from others around her, though more of them of the \u201cwhat the\u201d variety instead of the less innocent type. By the time she proceeded backstage, she had finally met up with her manager, Masami Ooshige. At one point an idol herself, the orange-haired woman made it a point to see Mitsuki succeed and work hard on every job she took up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMitsuki\u2026when did you get so tall? Are you wearing stilts?!\u201d a surprised Ooshige asked the girl, trying her hardest not to feel more nervous or embarrassed than she already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s from my new boots. I did this so even the kids in the back can see me..\u201d Mitsuki haphazardly strung together off the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, okay. But those are some large boots. You look as if you gained a whole foot in height with those things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. <i>Look</i> like I did\u201d. Mitsuki was unsuccessful at hiding back her nervousness, and the already tall girl once again shot up in height, this time to 6 feet and 6 inches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMitsuki, you\u2019re still growing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh..uh\u2026well\u2026you see\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use. Mitsuki was flat out shocked and scared, and she continued to grow at a vary fast pace, from 7 feet to 9 to finally 15 or so! Ooshige wasn\u2019t just shocked by this; she was floored. She practically fainted at such a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoshige-san! Are you okay?!\u201d a sweaty Mitsuki asked her, now shooting up to 15 feet and 3 inches in height. \u201cOh, now what do I do!?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The looks on the crowds face reminded her of how she was feeling, and yet being stared at by all these people made her even more self conscious. She couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. She started shaking. She instantly grew 6 more feet and was still growing, gaining several feet. The stage was starting to appear strained under her weight.<br>\r\nThe crowd gapsed and looked up, wonder if this was part of the show<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the growing singer could do was cry in frustration of everything happening to her, and soon found herself shooting up to 27 feet in height!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growing body almost revealed another problem other than simply scaring every one; the very stage she was on was crumbling under her weight. Mitsuki soon found her butt stuck in the wooden floor below her, causing her to freak out some more and grow to 28 feet in height. And as she looked at the increasingly scared crowd (who were now leaving in drones), she grew several more feet, this time to a height of 33 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, please don't go!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki begged her audience to stay, hoping that someone could get her out. But it was no good; all the people on the set fled in terror at the growing girl before them. Within minutes the only people left in the entire studio other than Mitsuki herself were Ooshige and Takuto. By this point the frustrated singer was now a towering 40 feet tall, crying to herself over what happened to her. As Mitsuki continued to cry, Takuto flew up to the giantess singer and seemed to have something to say to her. But was it good news, or bad?</span></div></div>",

There's a counterpoint to it, but I forget what it is. Strange that it would be in your house, though...oh wait! I remember now! Meroko bought some magic items a while back! This must have fallen out somewhere down the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that's why I was drawn to eat it, Takuto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. While they're considered to look little more like jellybeans to humans, they're considered a delicacy to a typical spirit. Which is funny when you consider what it does to people. So, um, about the counter to the growth...I wish I remembered what it was..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's laughter?\" Mitsuki faintly chimed in. \"Though there's nothing funny about this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki then shot up to 45 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give up, Mitsuki! I'll make you laugh until tears run down your eyes, if need be!\" Takuto promised the girl as he attempted to go find something that would amuse her around the set. Being on the set of a children's show, <i>something</i> around the area should make the giantess feel better about her. Or at least he hoped so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of searching, Takuto came back in a more ridicolouss setup. Now back in his cat form, it seemed as if he painted his body all sorts of weird colors (blue and red ears, orange feet, a purple stomach), and he was also wearing a top hat on his head and women's gloves on his hands. He awaited from Mitsuki of some sort. Anything.</span></div></div>",

Within seconds the once 45 foot tall girl was now about 40 feet or so. Takuto decided to keep this up by wearing oversized shoes, recite purposely stupid jokes, and even slapstick.

It was Friday night and she didn't have to attend school in the morning so she had the option of a lie-in. As she lay in bed she struggled to doze off as she had actually been studying hard. Her literature teacher had assigned her class a book review with a limited selection and, what was more, she divided the class into study pairs. The good news was that Sakura and Tomoyo had been assigned to the same book; the bad news was they only had two choices left, both originating in the British Isles: Lord of the Rings or Gulliver's Travels. Tomoyo alone could've tackled either but, after a brief discussion, they settled on Gulliver's Travels as it seemed lighter than Lord of the Rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day that had just gone saw Sakura doing what studying she could. She was quite surprised to find herself becoming engrossed in the book. It was fortunate that Tomoyo and her could have a copy each and then pool their efforts. In fact she had only just managed to put the book down when she had reached halfway.

Wondering what she was doing here she suddenly remembered that she was supposed to be whale watching for her class assignment. Getting up off the deckchair, not sure why or how she was on it in the first place. She went to the bow and looked out across the ocean. Then she noticed that it was a sailing ship in spite of its size. However she wasn't surprised to find that she was wearing summerwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had better get below deck, little miss.\" Said a voice. Turning round Sakura saw the stern but kindly face of a familiar old man dressed in a uniform. \"The sea's not looking too friendly today.\" He pointed off to the side where black clouds were looming. Sakura couldn't remember how sailboats could sail adjacent to the wind but she was sure this man knew what he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" She responded as she headed for the nearest hatchway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Sakura felt nervous during the storm but confident as the ship rocked wildly, the water splashed against the porthole and the thunder clapped. She lay upon the bunk waiting for the storm to pass and making sure she wouldn't get susceptible to seasickness. But things went from bad to worse. One huge wave rocked her from the bunk and, before long, water began to seep in. She hauled herself out of the room and did what she could to make for a higher deck without going outside. Then everything turned upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Sakura knew she was on a raft made of broken planks drifting in a calmer sea. She coughed up some seawater, leaving a terrible taste of salt in her mouth. Looking back she was horrified to see the ship she was on in many fragments. Further more, as the clouds drifted away she noticed the sun was setting. However a look in another direction revealed dry land. How does she get there?</span></div></div>",

She decided to wait and see what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief prayer Sakura found that the land did indeed look closer, by now the sun had just dipped below the horizon. She made a mental note to make an offering to the gods of the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it became difficult to see colour in the low light Sakura felt sure that she was now close enough to swim. She slipped off the raft and swam with all her might to the shore. Of course this did tire her out fairly soon but she now felt something against her knee. Worried that she may have had a run in with a dangerous marine animal she took one deep breath and stuck her head under the water. After a few seconds she brought it back up, feeling better knowing that her knee had made contact with sand. She now waded the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the beach Sakura checked the condition of the sand. The first thing she noticed told her that it must be high tide, the second thing was how especially fine the sand appeared to be. She was weary now, she had been swimming flat out and the earlier struggle to escape a sinking vessel meant that she had used the same amount of energy in one hour that she usually used in four. She took a few more steps before finally deciding to lie down and rest. What is she going to sleep upon?</span></div></div>",

It was good for the village to make use of whatever food washed up at shore; much more interesting than government rations. It wasn't illegal either, the anti-scavenging law was abolished several years ago not long after the current emperor's coronation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chiharu-chan?\" Rika checked at the landward end of the beach. A girl with pigtails scanned the sand, sometimes scraped it away from a possibility, and usually dismissed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just an old boot.\" She answered. Rika sighed at this. Boots were good as a source of leather but didn't have much purpose in their village. Looking up the beach Rika's eyes bogged out; the other two were focusing too much on the small things in the sand but she saw something that would be of great value. \"So that's what his majesty meant when he said 'You can't see the woods for the trees'.\" The others looked at her bewildered and then, following her gaze, gasped upon the sight of a great object made of glass and metal. They all ran towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" Naoko commented as she put her hand upon the glass. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's it got a metal pole in it?\" Chiharu added as she peered inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are letters and numbers in it.\" Rika mentioned. They paced round it, wondering as to its purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's from Blefuscu.\" Chiharu commented. \"Perhaps the emperor should be told. They might be running naval experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wondering if it might be from a Blefuscan household.\" Rika commented. \"That was a terrible storm last night. Maybe some new-fangled washing line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be,\" Naoko wondered, \"A sextant of some kind?\" Looking at it again Rika and Chiharu realised that N,E,S and W could well be North, East, South and West.</span></div></div>",

Chiharu and Rika turned and looked, also becoming flabbergasted. On top of the cliff, with a bit of T-shirt sleeve hanging over, was a giantess. A woman who must've been as tall as the imperial palace, but they weren't totally sure as she was lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...So that's where the water came from.\" Chiharu commented through her shock, noticing the dripping T-shirt sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where...?\" Naoko stammered. \"How...? Who...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone else seen her?\" Rika asked. \"If we're the only ones I'd like to try putting off reporting this until we know if she's friendly. If not then we'd best try to report as fast as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no knowing what would happen if we were found to have withheld this from the emperor.\" Chiharu commented. \"Furthermore if she's not friendly we'd be goners for sure.\" Naoko cringed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't like to see someone suffer needlessly,\" Rika mentioned, \"If we told the emperor and she turns out to be bad then we may be shown gratitude for alerting the country, but if they inhibit her even though she might be quite nice I...

He wasn't there for five minutes before a member of his escort whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The locals say that she had stirred in her sleep.\" He whispered. \"This caused some rocks to fall on the beach. My lord, it would be prudent to tie her down before she does any more damage.\" The emperor thought this over and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it would be prudent but not too tight. We don't know what her intentions are and I don't want to appear too hostile. We can make sure that she won't move without clear intent and have archers ready in case she is sure of attacking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord!\" The escort remarked. \"Are you sure of this?!? Women are trouble and a giant woman is a catastrophe. We must rope her down firm and bring forth cannons to stop her mischief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a child.\" The emperor replied. \"We mustn't be too hard on her. Harder than our children, true enough, but her arrival could be a godsend instead of a curse.\" With that the order was given out that the giantess be roped in such a way that she couldn't move without being spacially aware. The archers were deployed but were not put at the ready so as to avoid any trigger-happy soldiers spoiling the emperor's hopes of diplomacy.

Then he remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the messenger say that three young girls found her?\" He asked an adjutant, who acknowledged this. \"And who are they exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" His aide replied, \"They are the only daughters of the local families Mihara, Yanagisawa and Sasaki.\" The emperor almost started at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasaki?\" He checked. \"Is that the same Sasaki who works in the kitchens? Pudding chef, knows his cakes, that sort of thing.\" With this known he now called for the mothers of the three to come forward with their daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done very good, Rika-chan.\" Rika's mother told her as they made their way through the crowd, expecting a reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it!\" Chiharu's mother mentioned as they made their way. \"You're gonna be somebody.\" Naoko's mother didn't say anything, being temporarily struck dumb by Sakura's enormity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the formality of greeting was finished the emperor checked their identities and then went on with what he had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chiharu Mihara, Rika Sasaki, Naoko Yanagisawa,\" He announced, \"In recognition of your services to the court of Mildendo I hereby proclaim that you take on special roles in the name of Lilliput with regards to this monumentous discovery.\" He couldn't help himself for he loved a laugh. The mothers were desperately proud, but would they be when they heard exactly what he had in mind?</span></div></div>",

It took thirty seconds for her to summon enough will power to take another, and the same delay occured with every step she made towards Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura now found that there was only one person left nearby.

If she slept that long it would've been about two hours longer than normal but this was a giantess she was talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do giants usually sleep for twelve hours?\" She asked. Sakura felt very ambivalent about being called a giant but simply responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I was just so tired after the whole ordeal, but when left to myself I normally sleep for nine hours.\" Rika accepted this information reasonably well until she figured that if Sakura could pull several lengths of rope with the pegs out of the ground at once with just one hand it must've been impossible for a Lilliputian to have covered the same distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions continue.

In Lilliput we keep to the left side of the road while Blefuscans prefer to keep to the right side. Blefuscans use a decimalised system in almost every form of measurement while Lilliput uses a more varied range of measurements.\" As Rika considered other differences Sakura couldn't help but interject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Blefuscu uses metric?\" She asked; Rika's lack of reply prompted her to build on the term. \"So you would be 120cm tall by their measurements.\" Sakura's eyes blinked in bewilderment over how she was able to find the metric alternative so quickly. Rika gave an affirmative response, impressed by the swiftness with which Sakura worked it out but figured that her giant size meant such mental arithmetic would be so much easier for her. \"Then, if I'm 200 feet high by your standards, the Blefuscans must consider me to be... 60 metres tall!\" After a few seconds Rika spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They even differ in construction. For many years now Lilliputian architecture prioritises the minimal use of wood in buildings while Blefuscu has retained the old rules of construction involving timber and plaster among other things. And there are cultural issues; in Lilliput the Imperial court determines position by a combination of local elections and physical dexterity.\" Sakura moved her hand up and slightly away from her face as a fairly clear indication that she wasn't sure what Rika was talking about. \"Whenever a vacancy in the Imperial court has to be filled every local authority puts forward a candidate who received the most votes from every adult man who has their own property, these candidates must then go over or under a bar that's varied in height each time and whoever shows the greatest flexibility in achieving this gets the most desired position available and any further vacancies are filled in a top-down manner.\" Sakura's face filled her view as she watched it shift from a look of confusion to one of realisation. The giant girl beamed as she remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Like limbo-dancing.\" Rika gave a half-shrug as she conceded to Sakura's idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you call it in Japan.\"</span></div></div>",

It took about ten minutes but she finally had it on and so could focus more of her effort on traversing the waters in search of a vessel or a shoreline, but most of all she was worried as to her mother's well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little over half an hour had passed she came upon more good fortune; a rubber raft had floated into her vicinity. Once she was on board she paused and then began to beseech the heavens for the sake of Sonomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould we, the readers and writers, be so concerned about Sonomi?</span></div></div>",

With the moon having set Tomoyo figured that what she was seeing was an overgrowth of wild shrubs, meaning that access to the beach by land would be from either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I reached Guam?\" She whispered curiously as she lay down against the rise, her hair resting rather close to the thicket as she began to doze off, hoping her mother would make landfall as well as she did or better.</span></div></div>",

Looking down at herself she identified her white lace dress and her black buckled shoes. Reaching up she felt her head, it was more vague than usual but it seemed that her hair was hanging loose in a cascading wave. Getting to her knees she looked about and espied a coastline stretching across one horizon; there was no doubt that she should head for it, so looked round again and found a plank that could be used as a paddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some furious paddling but the currents seemed to be in her favour. Tomoyo was not particularly athletic but she kept herself in reasonable shape. She rested for a moment but it was now clear that she was heading for a shingle beach with some light brown cliffs rising above it. While she rested she took the opportunity to check what sort of marine life was in the vicinity. It was something of a surprise to find that the sea was currently clear of plant and animal life visible to the naked eye. Cautiously she dipped her hand into the water and lifted it out in a cupped formation, only to find no evidence of excessive algae or plankton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up again Tomoyo noticed that she had drifted even closer to the coast than she expected; picking up the paddle again she pushed the raft ever closer, this time keeping a steady pace. Soon the waves took over and pushed the raft onto the shingle, allowing her to hop off. Common sense gave her a clear indication of what to do, she grabbed hold of a piece of rope she didn't remember seeing and pulled the raft further along the shingle. The high tide mark was hard to find so she opted to stick with halfway between the surf and the cliffs as the place to leave it for now. Tomoyo now figured that she should check her pockets; she found her digital video camera, four spare batteries, a lace handkerchief and a handful of sherbet lemons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So much for being prepared.</i> She sighed. <i>At least I can document this place. Where exactly am I, anyway?</i> She looked round and walked about for a moment, trying to see some significant variation in the cliff-side.</span></div></div>",

Sonomi, mistress of the household, took her role seriously both at home and at work, ensuring the continuing prosperity of her family through her diligence. Tomoyo, Sonomi's daughter, was everything that humanity wanted to be: selfless, intelligent, dedicated; she would do anything for the ones she loved. The maids were also happy with their roles as they not only treated Sonomi and Tomoyo as superior but acutally believed that they were; and the bodyguards, they had been trained so well that they too accepted Sonomi and Tomoyo as their superiors, taking the maxim dulce et decorum est pro rector mori (Is is sweet and good to die for one's master) right to their hearts. But underneath all of this all the ladies shared a secret within the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the earlier days when Sonomi's ownership of the grand house was in its infancy there was a race who lived under her nose, or more specifically, under her feet. Their origins were unknown but a great number of people the size of pennies. Their origins were unknown as, over time, the facts had been distorted into legends and myths because, living unnoticed by the full-size ladies, proper civilisations could not be established lest they be smashed by a passing foot; as such they were living as feuding tribes doing what they could to secure plenty of resources and maintain homes that could be quickly rebuilt in the event of a major attack by that which is alive or that which is of natural phenomena. It continued this way for several years as they looked upon those who lived in the house as gods for reasons that must be as clear as glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, when Tomoyo was still particularly young, such a tribe had taken a bold move to infiltrate the house to seek out plenty more resources than could be found in the garden. They struggled to manage when under unwitting attack from the 'gods' before, finally, they were discovered and recognised for what they were. Sonomi thus determined to help these tiny people and, all together, the residents of the mansion went forth to gather all the other tribes and unite them. And so it comes to this, the secret race of tiny people residing in the merciful care of the Daidouji mansion residents hidden from the outside world.</span></div></div>",

A highly prolific race that was naturally submissive to those who were bigger. However the passage of time caused major overhauls in terms of how they were sold. Come the 1990s only women and girls could interact with them in accordance with a study of business practice and ownership and, furthermore, they would only be sold to those who would have mutual interest, ensuring both parties were as happy as possible. Strangely enough selected representatives from the little people insisted on retaining an owner's right to eat them, believing it to be a sacrifice that would lead them to heaven for sure; however campaigners amongst those who were regular sized managed to pass a legislation that only those who clearly expressed no qualms in such an act of apparent cannibalism would be sold with the owner having the right to. The punishment for consuming a little who did not have 'right to eat' on their sale information was six months community service for those who fell under the juvenile category of the age of criminal liability and, after thorough debate, six months imprisonment for the first offense amongst adults and inclusion to the littles for the second, after a breakthrough in miniaturisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of those who were small did not seem to care too much who would buy them or how they would be treated. This meant that they could be put into suspended animation and sold a a much lower price than normal; some businesses would make their suspension chambers into such things as jewellery so as to gain a bit more profit and/or make a special offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Tomoeda one business renowned for this, including a licensed miniaturisor, was the Daidouji Toy and L.P. Co. As such pre-adolescent girls were the largest demographic in Tomoeda's customer base for this. However rumours were floating about that the CEO Sonomi Daidouji had her own private collection (which wasn't too far from the truth) including some persons who had been shrunk for wrong-doings that were offically not significant enough to warrent miniaturisation (which was mostly false). Sometimes the young girls of the district would actually talk about being victims of such a conspiracy and contemplate being in one-another's clutches.</span></div></div>",

It was curious as it said that they could not bring anyone else unless they were both female and could be trusted to keep quiet. Each of them was reacting in slightly different ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko was really excited; for her mysteries and the supernatural were subjects for extensive scrutiny and was only too happy to experience a real enigma like this. Chiharu was simply bewildered as she never associated Matsumoto with this level of secrecy; in fact she never knew of anything weird occurring at Twin Bells since the missing panda incident. Rika felt somewhat uneasy, not knowing why Matsumoto wanted to see them specifically or why it had to be so secret, but she maintained her composure and felt that the benefit of the doubt would be the best option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Tomoyo were both feeling dubious about this whole affair. Sakura had a slight suspicion of an ulterior motive but figured she'd attend; after all anything untoward Matsumoto had a chance of doing Sakura had the power of undoing it a million-fold. Tomoyo was feeling ambivelent as to whether or not the invitation would be beneficial to them but, after a quick word with Sakura, decided that she'd go as, if anything went wrong, at least Sakura would be there.</span></div></div>",

'CLOSED CONDITIONALLY: REDECORATING EXPECTED' it read; Chiharu suggested giving Matsumoto a ring, apologising for being unable to enter, but Sakura stopped them from leaving, feeling that there was more to this than met the eye. With a sense of anticipation she slowly stepped up to the door, raised her fist and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty seconds there was the sound of a bolt being shifted and a key turning in the lock, before the door opened and Maki Matsumoto popped her head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good.\" She blurted out. \"You're all here. Only five?\" They all nodded; Sakura had been tempted to bring Kero with her but decided that she'd rather stick to her word rather than pull the wool over Maki's eyes. The door opened further and Maki invited them all in before closing and locking the door behind them. \"This is a special offer that, currently, is only available you the five of you. I do not wish it to be made public as there would be both controversy and dangers of abuse from what I have available.\" This made Rika and Naoko very uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaki lead them into the back room, which only Tomoyo had seen before as being nought but a simple kitchen, followed by some kind of living room before Maki stopped at a door, She took another key from her pocket and unlocked it, opening it up to reveal a few stairs leading down into a large area filled with glass boxes, the kind you get in museums, and continued to lead the five girls into this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had all decended the stairs Maki turned back and closed the door behind them, but she did not lock it. Each of them observed the contents of the boxes: They could all see miniature buildings in them but thought of them as little more than models. All were confused for different reasons. Naoko was confused and disappointed by the apparent anticlimax. Rika could not fathom why model villages would have to be kept under wraps. Chiharu was slightly annoyed as well as confused, feeling that her time had been wasted. Tomoyo couldn't understand why only they were allowed to see these models. Sakura, on the other hand, was confused by the conflict of senses; her eyes said this was no big deal but her inner self said that something was out of the ordinary.</span></div></div>",

Rika and Chiharu felt that this was some kind of late April Fool while Tomoyo was intrigued, Sakura felt ambivelent between concern and intrigue, and Naoko was thrilled that something genuinely out of the ordinary was here. \"So the balance is maintained the equivelent amount of material is sent back to replace it; usually bits of asteroids being implanted in the surface of an alternative Earth to fill the gap that taking such has left behind. Of course only houses or bigger are pre-packed in these boxes,\" She gestured to the containers around the room, \"So they won't spend hours on end staring up at giants like us. Instead they'll think that they're cut off from the rest of their world in more mundane ways.

At 19 years old she had been studying a few courses at a college in Lyon, only because of her desire to get a well-paid job and, in the existing economic climate, her chances weren't as good as they should've been. It was the end of the Easter holidays and she was riding the train back to Lyon and her dormitory. She was for sure not satisfied, all the hard work, the fees, the poor chances of finding employment when this final year was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting by the window, looking out across the rolling hils of eastern France, she kept going over all the difficulties life threw at her before she began to daydream about the life she wanted. A big house, no need to go anywhere or do anything, and plenty of wealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been daydreaming for about seven minutes when it happened. Without warning her eyes were swamped with a bright light outside and various signs that suggested the train was undergoing an emergency stop. The intensity of the breaking meant that she was doubled over the small table in front of her and her daydream had been snapped; looking up she was glad that no one was sitting opposite her, thinking how embarrassing it would've been. She cast a look out the window, expecting to still see the fields of France while wondering what the flash was; what she saw instead was mind-blowing. She saw a long plateau that shone like silver with a great structure stretching high into the air, far higher than any building she'd seen before. She also noticed that the lights had gone off in the carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she wondered why there was no power getting through suddenly a tremor resounded through the train, followed by another, and a shadow fell upon a good portion of the plateau. Mimi looked up, expected to see a thundercloud, but instead came to the verge of screaming when she saw a massive feminine hand reaching for the train.</span></div></div>",

In spite of the darkness the giant's skin was still visible through a small amount of light coming between the gaps in the fingers. There was little time to comprehend this when everyone was tossed about as the train was effortlessly lifted off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time some stability had returned Mimi was now lying on top of another student, who turned out to be one of her friends, Laurence L'Hievres. They were sprawled across a larger table closer to the back of the train on the opposite side from where Mimi was. Picking themselves up they said hello and apologised to each other for the inconvenience when they realised that light was coming back into the carriage; nervously turning to the nearest window they were aghast at the sight of two gigantic eyes looking back at them. Laurence fainted in shock. Mimi quickly set her in an available chair before cautiously crawling across the seats to get a better look. Up above she saw the giantess's index finger protruding out and the thumb doing the same below, clearly indicating that the train was now pinched between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I startled you,\" The giantess boomed, \"But there was no other way.\" Mimi quivered in fright at the prospect of being totally helpless in this woman's grasp. When Laurence came to Mimi had learned that they were being held by a Japanese woman named Maki Matsumoto who had teleported them here and had also shrank them. Together the college friends now heard that they were now, effectively, property. The train and everyone on board was to be put on sale, with schoolgirls being the only ones to buy them.</span></div></div>",

Some screamed and tried to escape, but the doors wouldn't budge, others tried to plead with Maki but their voices were too feeble for her to hear, and still others, like Mimi, just froze either from shock, submission or even both. As Maki stood up everyone in the train except two carriages were tossed about like salad; Mimi and Lawrence were amog the lucky ones, being able to stay in the seats if they braced themselves, thanks to Maki's thumb and forefinger steadying their carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother of God!\" Lawrence exclaimed. \"We're ants on sale! How could she do this, selling people like they're... seeds, or something?\" Mimi just sighed as she finally came to a clear conclusion, after mulling over the facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lawrence,\" She said, \"We have no choice. It would be dangerous to try and escape. Even if we were to succeed we'd either plummet to our doom or find ourselves facing danger round every corner, be it giants like her or hungry animals. Besides, who knows what she'd do if she caught us during an escape. It might be best to just let her put us up for sale, then maybe she'll treat us more like people.\" After that musing Lawrence had no means to respond as they were now knocked to and fro as Maki carried them off to her special lodgings for these little people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tumbling stopped Mimi took another look out the window and, this time, saw the cuff of Maki's sleeve filling the view. Doing a check Mimi now noticed that her carriage was resting upon the giantess's ring finger. The reason for the change in orientation became apparent as she now saw the biggest train station ever coming into view, the rails didn't go very far beyond the platforms before a sheer drop occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she knows we can't live on this train until we're bought.\" Mimi muttered, not sure whether her life would improve now or not. Barely a minute later the rough ride in Maki's fingers ended as the carriage clicked onto the rails and power was returned. Everyone now busied themselves sorting out their luggage, making sure that all got the right things. Fortunately no severe changes of inertia happened at this stage when Maki managed to slide the tiny train into the terminus at a speed it was designed for. When Mimi had gathered all her things she could now take a look outside, noticing that the station was very clean and well-crafted, figuring that either Matsumoto had shrank some grand station she was unfamiliar with or, failing that, went to a lot of trouble to make them feel more at home. Peering in both directions from the window she recognised that the train was being reversed into the station as she remembered which cabin was leading before the incident, and she now looked with awe as a finger bigger than a tree gently nudged the front end of the train along the track before letting friction do the rest. Looking at the platform again Mimi found that they were on platform...</span></div></div>",

With the train now at a stop Maki addressed them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please gather all the belongings you have and follow the signs to your rooms. You may decide whether to go in pairs or as individuals. Family rooms are available.\" Mimi was gobsmacked. They had barely been told that they were going on sale to some schoolgirls and now their captor was offering them quality accommodation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Lawrence,\" She commented, \"We'd better get our stuff together.\" When Mimi returned to her original seat and found that, miraculously, her luggage wasn't scattered all over Lawrence was still stuttering over what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Mimi managed to help Lawrence get her luggage and made for the doors, which had earlier been opened by a conductor. Stepping out onto the platform Mimi noticed that there was no access to any of the other platforms. It made sense as she figured that the train was on sale with all passengers and crew, suddenly she felt a warm moist breeze as Maki's voice echoed throughout the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COMPLIMENTARY ESSENTIALS ARE AVAILABLE AS ARE SIGNS TO DIRECT YOU TO WHATEVER AMENITIES YOU DESIRE.\" Mimi made the dare to turn round while Lawrence resisted; she looked on with awe as Maki's face loomed in the distance behind an array of passengers, some continuing towards the rear of the train, some standing there fighting the urge to turn and others gazing out at the titaness that had captured them. Eventually Mimi broke off her staring and continued to lead the paralyzed Lawrence to the stairs, escalators and lifts at the inner end of the platform. Mimi made sure that Lawrence wouldn't turn, figuring that if she was paralyzed now heaven only knew what would happen if she saw the giant lady's face filling the vista outside the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way Mimi marvelled at the decor of the station. Clean as a whistle with glass panels giving those on different platforms a look at the rest. Where she was there was no such view until the end of the train, seeing as how they were on platform one, with the outer wall to her left. Upon ascending to the next level she now found herself in a long corridor with a few signs pointing in different directions. She looked back again and noticed that all she could see was the platform and locomotive of the train at the bottom of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right.\" She mentioned to Lawrence, hoping to help her cope. \"The giant woman's gone now.\" But Lawrence wasn't fooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she's not.\" She responded. \"She'll never be gone. We'll be amongst giants for the rest of our lives!\" What happens next?</span></div></div>",

Come on; we might as well make the most of it.\" Lawrence began the descent from restrained hysteria to rational calm as Mimi took her by the hand and sought out a two-person room with twin beds. As Lawrence slipped out of her stunned state she became defiant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be a dream.\" She said. \"There's no way this could really happen. I'll wake up in a minute.\" Mimi soon found that the two-person rooms were already filling up when she found the correct corridor. By now Lawrence had become rather angry and had startled Mimi; the feel of Mimi's hand had told her that it was really happening. \"Why did she do this to us?!? We've done nothing wrong! It's imprisonment without trial!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many prisons have such luxurious lodgings?\" Mimi reasoned as she found a room. There were twin beds on either side of a tall window opposite the door, off to the side was a sofa with a widescreen TV complete with a VCR and DVD player to watch. There certainly seemed to be plenty of drawers and the wardrobes were spacious enough. There even seemed to be a laundry chute and a hi-fi system. When Mimi sat Lawrence down and brought all their luggage in her friend was now thinking about bargaining with Maki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we could negociate our return to France at proper size.\" She mentioned. \"If we could serve her for a while she'll take pity on us.\" Mimi sighed as she unpacked her own things and checked the en-suite. It came complete with a roomy bath, separate shower booth and even had a bidet. Finding it unbelievably appreciative, wondering if Matsumoto had some tiny maids helping her run the place, she returned to the room itself to provide a listener to Lawrence's progress. She was now sitting slumped on one of the beds. \"We're nothing now.\" She groaned in dispair. \"We're just bugs for her to banter about. Our lives are over one way or another. We're dead.\" Mimi resisted the pessimism. She stood, still listening to Lawrence, and went over to the window, finding a view looking out across the giant room the hotel was in and overlooking...</span></div></div>",

They were usually patrolling the ocean or simply trying to study the sea life from below, either way, it was all work and no play for this powerful navy force as they were effectively unstoppable. \"Hm...so far so good, crew, we see no threat going on among this huge ocean.\" Said the captain as he searched for anything unusual around and so far, no danger have been sighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go further into the sea? I'm pretty sure there's gotta be something beyond.\" Asked one of the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I guess there might be something we never see before so we should go a bit deeper into the sea and search for something.\" Replied the captain as he and his crew now began to slowly dive towards the ocean floor and searched around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found many aquatic creatures swimming around freely, some seaweed drifting across the sea, colorful corals, and among other things that you can pretty much find in the sea. Suddenly a signal from the sonar machine informed them it had picked up a sound that seems to be coming somewhere further ahead. \"Captain, there's seem to be a strange sound coming from over there.\" Said one of the navy soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think it is?\". The captain approached the sonar signal machine and once he was about to say something, the whole sub started to rumble and shake as it seems to be pulled into something. \"What the hell is happening?\" Yelled the captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems we're being pulled in by some strong force.\" Yelled a female crew member. \"I don't think we have enough speed to escape something that strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll just have to use maximum power.\" Said the captain as he ordered the sailors to speed up as fast as they can. Unfortunately, it still wasn't fast enough and soon the entire submarine was pulled into the strange force and everyone, including the captain, blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed since the incident and everyone regained consciousness. \"Is everyone all right?\" Asked the captain as everyone nodded. They looked around to see what just happened; the captain, meanwhile, was looking straight at the large front window. There was pretty much nothing in sight, just blue water and that's pretty much it, no seaweed, corals, or even aquatic animals. \"Strange, where did everything go?\" The captain asked himself. Suddenly, a drop of water from a small crack dropped into his mouth, even the water tasted weird, it doesn't even taste salty but more like......chlorine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Unaware to them, they'd been shrunken down to almost mite-sized and ended up in the middle of a colossal swimming pool in a another dimension.)</span></div></div>",

It's too blury to make it out even with a periscope but they could still make out the shape of the object; the bottom seemed to be two circular tower-like structures, but at the top, they seemed to be connected to a much larger object that has two other structures on each side of it. \"What do you think that..thing is, captain?\" Asked the female soldier, but before the captain could say anything, the entire structure begin to move much like a person would as the two structures below walked like legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!

They watch as the towering object walked towards the tiny sub, but when it got closer, they slowly begin to see it in more detail. The giant object they saw wasn't even an object at all, instead it was a colossal human-shape figure that exceeded even the size of the Empire state building by comparison. It seems to have a young feminine shape, probably that of a preteen, and the figure wore a red two-piece swimming costume. \"It's not a giant structure,\" Said the captain, \"It's just a giant girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're not in the ocean,\" one of the crew added, \"We're in the middle of a gigantic swimming pool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could discuss this weird situation but right now we've got to get out of here!\" Yelled one of the navy soldiers.</span></div></div>",

Now how we going to pass her?\" Asked one of the sailors as he and the others looked at the front window and noticed that they were in front of the giantess's thighs; they were also slightly open too. They could slip past between them as they were the right size to do so, but it could be pretty dangerous as she could close her legs and crush them if they aren't fast enough. They could just go past them to the left/right since their size made them quicker than the giantess yet there's still a catch to this; any slight movement from her could still pose a treat to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich path can they take?</span></div></div>",

However, they could see some very slight movement such as bobbing left and right, but so far no signs of bigger movements. They wonder what the giantess is doing right now since she's still standing there; she's probably talking to one of her friends or something. \"We're almost there everyone! Let's keep it up quick!\" Shouted the captain as he looked out the window on the right side of the sub and saw something that made him nervous. The fleshy wall gave a slow movement before very slowly began to descend towards the submarine; she was about to close up both of her legs and unknowingly crush them between them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain!

Soon everyone except the navigator, who was tasked to look around one more time before leaving. She didn't see much other than the giantess, but once she looked down towards the floor of the pool at her feet, she saw that they were slowly beginning to lift up to a tiptoe position. \"What do you see?\" Asked the captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the looks of it, she's probably going to jump towards the surface to swim.\" She said as she left her post to join the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the storage room, everyone else had put on scuba diving suits to breathe underwater.

Meanwhile, the ones that are unstuck think that they have it easier since they can just swim up to the surface as they were now close to the surface; however, that is going to change once she goes back to swimming. Now this time it's the ones swimming who are having a much more difficult time thanks to the currents caused by the giantess's movement. Fortunately, they're still able to keep up as the girl was swimming slowly in order to meet up with one of her friends who they could see in the distance. The ones climbing up her body have it easy, but due to the turbulence, they needed to hold onto the fabric of her swimsuit as they were now on the upper torso, just above her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they finally made their way up to the girl's head, they found themselves nearly getting tangled by her auburn hair. At first, they tried to get around them until the senior captain got a message from a fellow troop who beat them to the head from the radio transmitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab on to her hair and meet me up there, trust me it's worth doing that instead of using the skin of her face.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you right now?\" Said the Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go through the strands, I'll tell you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and the rest of the force grabbed on tightly to the strands of hair. They then climbed across them as fast as they could while the girl swam through the water. It wasn't very easy since her hair was wet from the pool water; however, the crew didn't have to travel too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you right now?\" Said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where right near the ear.\" Said the Captain. \"Why did you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's where me and the rest of the troop are right now. They told me that they were missing you and the others once they climbed up and came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody saw the large ear within the thicket and jumped inside of it. They grabbed onto the edge and hauled themselves up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you all made it.\" Said the one from the radio. He is with several other people who made it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Group Beta</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group were currently pondering on how to get past the frills; they tried to climb over it, but a few of them ended up getting stuck on it. It was difficult to free themselves from the frills, but they managed to get out after several seconds. They did not got a chance to think of a plan because suddenly, Tomoyo started moving her legs. She lifted herself from the pool floor and began to swim across the water. Because this happened so unexpectedly and the crew were still thinking, they didn't get a chance to prepare for the girl's current movements. They were raised up in the air before falling back down into the water by her propelling legs. When viewed from the girls' perspective, Tomoyo is just firmly moving across the pool, but for her passengers, it's a wild ride to keep themselves from getting flung off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let go everyone!\" Yelled one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, they couldn't hold on to the legs much longer and, thus, were all sent flying straight forwards along with the splashes from her swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually landed on something soft and full with strands of some sort. It didn't take much longer to realise that they'd landed on Tomoyo's hair, near the cliff which is her face. Everyone clung to the strands as hard as they could while the giantess made her way to one of her friends. As she got there, they both started a conversation among themselves; they couldn't understand what they're saying and even if they did, the booming sounds of their voices was quite hard to hear. Just when they thought they were safe, Tomoyo then nodded her head in agreement with something which caused the others to slip and tumble down her enormous face; they landed on her upper lip and below her nostrils. They were in great danger right now since she currently talking with her friend. One of them got an idea, however this one is hugely risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got to take cover from up there.\" She said as she pointed to the nostrils. \"We have no other choice as it's the only available shelter at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't get a chance to start their climb as, just then, Tomoyo inhaled through her nose, causing everyone to get sucked in. Fortunately, they quickly grabbed onto the giant nose hairs right at the very moment they entered the nose. Unfortunately, they ended up getting separated from each other as they ended up in different nostrils. They could; however, communicate with their transmitters, but they remembered that they have limited batteries so they needed to use them wisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Group Gamma</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter struggling to get above, they finally reached Rika's upper torso when they managed to unstick themselves from her swimsuit. The mariners think that they could swim up and reach higher up, but they began to notice that this young girl was now moving towards deeper waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it me or is this girl is now going deeper into water?\" Asked a young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears so.\" Said another one. \"But will this give us a much harder chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone thought for several seconds when, suddenly, Rika started to move frantically in the water. Since she's not used to swimming, she struggled to get up. Everyone around her tried to keep themselves from being swept away. Behind them, they could see her friend trying to help her with her swimming. They wanted to go towards her, but their attempts were cut short when they saw the gigantic mouth of Rika getting closer to them. It was already too late to swim away as the current sucked them inside her open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, everyone grabbed onto the teeth, gums, tongue, and everything else that they could see in the darkness. The girl then spat out the water from her mouth after she made it to the surface, leaving everyone just dangling inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody around here, alright? Just give us a sign.\" Called the senior officer from the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody called to the officer in the loudest voice possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, it's best to remain here until further notice.\" He said. \"Try not to get swallowed by this young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agreed, but how long could they hold on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Group Delta</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group's attempt to get up to Naoko's shoulders was unfortunately cut short when she lifted her arms to swim a little faster. The crew were soon launched higher and higher until they were flinged up into the air at neck breaking speeds. They barely got a chance to make out the surface world when they found themselves falling down and onto the girl herself. The group landed on her forehead and then tumbled their way down to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick everyone, grab on to the eyelashes.\" Yelled the senior officer and everyone obeyed his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow latching onto the lashes, they try to keep themselves safe as much as they can. While her glasses made their view distorted, they can still make out another girl talking to Naoko. Suddenly, they got a call from the crew on the other side and told them that they're okay, but they also got another plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to get in her eyelids, it's much safer there.\" One of them said. \"Don't bother contacting this girl from her eye, we tried that and it didn't work. So focus on surviving for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone climbed up across the lashes and made their way to the lid. It was pretty cramped around here, but it's for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Group Epsilon</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiharu seems to be relaxing by herself as there isn't much she could do right now. With this going on, the crew have a much easier situation to get higher up. However, it appears the distance to get to the surface is far greater than they could have imagined; it would probably take much longer to get there before this girl starts moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we're going to last very long.\" Said a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else we could do right now?\" Said an older officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there is that over there.\" Said an older woman, pointing at the large hole above them, which is Chiharu's belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting any time, they made their way towards the navel. One by one, they grabbed onto the edge and hauled themselves up inside. After every last one of them got inside the girl's belly button, they travelled deeper into the fleshy tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I guess we should call ourselves NAVEL officers.\" Chuckled a wise guy. \"Get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for jokes here, lad.\" Said an older man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, they stopped in the middle of Chiharu's navel and sat down waiting for her upcoming action.</span></div></div>",

Access wasn't hard, suggesting to him he could appeal to the residents to let him doss down for a bit, however what he'd entered through was the tradesman's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing a portion of the grounds that had a more utilitarian setup compared to the others Harold came upon a side-entrance to the house proper and promptly knocked. He waited for a while but no answer came, prompting him to conclude that the house was empty or that everyone was in bed, so he let himself in and began to hesitantly nosey-round the servants' quarters, taking a few biscuits to nibble and having a swig of water from a kitchen tap. It so happened that the lack of a response was more to do with the fact that the house was currently operating on a 'skeleton crew' and he was supposed to have pressed the buzzer, for no one was anywhere near the side-entrance to hear him knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold watched the light through the window fade and began to search for somewhere he could rest without getting into any trouble should someone stumble on him while he slept. Wandering through the mansion he rapidly dismissed a number of rooms as looking too good to chance before he seemed to run out of options and looked back through the rooms he'd dismissed. It could've been considered lucky that he constantly missed every member of staff in residence. Snooping around what he thought was just a sitting room he stumbled upon an annex that resembled a private cinema and began to poke around.</span></div></div>",

Picking himself up he then stared at his surroundings, gawking in disbelief. He did his best to pinch himself and then jogged over to a support for a piece of furniture and slammed his head against it, trying to find any evidence that he wasn't actually experiencing this. Eventually he began to register that this most certainly was occurring and he slumped down and held his knees to his chest, wondering if he'd been displaced into a land of giants or if he really had shrunk down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night rolled on and the light inside the room dropped to the point that Harold couldn't make out much colour, however the filtered street light and some of the natural light of the stars with some suggestion of a moon allowed him to identify all available shapes in the room. If nothing else he could find somewhere he could get some shut-eye; mindful of potential pests wandering around he sought out the edge of a curtain and tucked himself into a fold at the bottom.</span></div></div>",

Although they were descended from a noble bloodline they had fallen on hard times. Because of the death of Meilin's father and her inability to use magic they could not touch the family wealth. Instead they had to get by with their self-sufficient farming. Their food was predominently vegetables grown in large allotments on the farmland but they also lay traps for wild animals, kept chickens for eggs, bees for honey and had one dairy cow to provide them with dairy. Surplus was always sold off to provide them with the money for clothing and tools, with any left over being saved to provide for any emergency or any breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Meilin's mother went to milk the cow while Meilin gathered eggs. As Meilin set the eggs on the kitchen table a scream came from outside. Rushing with a feeling of dread Meilin found her mother kneeling next to the cow, sobbing. Looking around Meilin could find no source of danger and then her eyes fell upon the bucket. It was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, mother?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's dry.\" Came the answer. \"Wu's run dry.\" Meilin understood now. Their cow had reached a form of menopause and would no longer yield milk. \"There's only one thing left to do. She'll have to be sold. A good price and we can buy our dairy in the future.\" Meilin looked at Wu the cow. She had grown up with this cow and she knew that milkless cows were usually butchered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother.\" She asked. \"Can I take her into town tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" She answered. \"You can take her first thing. Remember she must fetch a good price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Meilin wondered, \"What if no one makes a good offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to opt for the best that's there.\" She declared. \"But come now, we have other work to do.\"</span></div></div>",

Several customers came and looked her over but many dismissed her as useless or too old. Others made their offers but Meilin knew how much would be necessary at the least and not one offered anything gold. Before long the time came for her to set off, still no wealthier than when she arrived. As she returned she met Eriol again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you made a decision?\" Eriol asked. Thinking it over anything that could be planted would be worth more than the offers made in the market, magic or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" She decided. \"You can have Wu for those.\" With that they made the swap and Meilin set off home, wondering what her mother would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eriol was out of sight she peeped in the bag.

You can't plant jellybeans!\" She threw them out into the yard as she shouted this. \"I hope you're not too fond of milk and its products because we'll be living without it forever.\" Meilin slumped in guilt, wondering what that Eriol fellow was now doing to Wu. Then she remembered what he said about planting the beans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of adventure did he mean?\" She pondered as she went to tidy the allotments before sunset.</span></div></div>",

She wondered if she could get a job as a farm labourer or a servant. She washed her face and other things before starting the morning chores. She was bewildered by the new shady areas outside and the greenish light entering the kitchen. She was just going out to get some water from a well when she saw it. A beanstalk composed of seven mighty shoots coming out of the ground and uniting into one massive column rising so high into the air that the top disappeared into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were magic!\" She exclaimed as she stared. She wondered about the adventure but had something else on her mind. \"How big are the beans it'll produce? We could make a fortune out of beans.\" Forgetting the water she dashed back inside and got out the emergency notepaper, the only writing paper they had. It was starting to go yellow but could still be used. She scribbled out a note in ink made from beetles using a homemade wooden pen. 'Beanstalk in yard. Gone climbing for surplus of beans. Back before sunset (I hope).' With that she slung a foraging bag over her shoulder and made for the beanstalk. She grabbed onto a nook in the stalk and began to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was much easier than she expected. There were handholds all over and the leaves were so large and firm that she could take breathers on them. She had already climbed over a hundred feet when her mother found the note. As she climbed higher she heard her mother calling for her to come down. Reaching a leaf she leaned over the side to respond. She nearly got vertigo but focused her effort and answered her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my fault we didn't get the money.\" She called down. \"There could be beanpods galore up here and I'm going to find them.\" With that she continued as her mother contemplated whether she should persue or not when the clucking of the chickens persuaded her to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeilin continued to climb higher and higher. It was already halfway through the daylight of the morning when she got high enough that her home looked the size of her thumb, including the land that was in their ownership. She noticed thick cloud up above now, which she hadn't seen on the way up. There were still no beanpods around. She continued to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she entered the cloud cover in her search. She quickly figured that there were no beans around but she noticed that her surroundings now looked more like underground than in cloud. She now realised that this was the adventure Eriol had talked about. She continued to climb. The land above was...</span></div></div>",

She could see its top now, rising high above the forest she was now in but she could tell it wasn't a proper forest. Even on this scale she could recognise the blades of grass rising high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" She gasped. Figuring that she wouldn't get much detail sitting on the beanstalk she made a clear leap onto the soil and began to explore. \"This certainly is an adventure.\" She commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked through this bizarre jungle of grass Meilin suddenly found herself at the edge. She stared across a stone plateau composed of flattened stones in geometric alignment, on the other side of which was more giant grass. Meilin knew of only one thing like this, a road. Figuring it was meant for heavy traffic she kept off the stone and made her way along the narrow dirt path between the stone road and the grass jungle. She couldn't understand why there was so little traffic on this road but kept on going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearly noon when she reached the next striking feature. A metal fence rising high above the grass. Looking it over she could identify hinges up above the path she was on and could see no way past the metal column holding them in place. Further observation told her there was a gate here but could not understand why since every animal, every person and every form of transport she could think of could just carry on right under it. Then she realised that she had missed a trick with all that she had seen before. If there were giant plants up here then surely there'd be giant animals. She scolded herself for not keeping an eye out for anything that could've eaten her. But this 'road' she had found and the fence told her that there were actual giant people as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People mean civilisation.\" She reasoned. \"And civilisation means the possibility of help.\" Going over this and hearing the sound of hunger in her stomach she decided she'd have to try and observe the residents of wherever she was without being spotted until she could determine whether they would help her or not. She slipped back into the grass jungle and made her way under the fence and into a garden. She had entered the property of...</span></div></div>",

Her aunt Sonomi Daidouji had given it to her as lodgings until she could either pay the price of the house herself or find somewhere else she could live. She wasn't an orphan but she did want to try and get by on her own even if she was still a child. If she felt she couldn't cope she was free to phone the Daidouji residence and ask for help from their domestic staff but forced herself to only do so when necessary. She was desperate not to get lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one problem that Sonomi couldn't solve for Sakura. Having spent several months in this house she now felt lonely. She had plenty of friends and her second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji, would dedicate her life to Sakura given the opportunity but she still needed someone to share her home with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeilin returned to the footpath, as she now recognised it, and this time walked along the edge of the stone so as to give her feet a stable surface to walk on while being able to leap out of the way if any giants came strolling down the path. She was still wondering as to how it would be to meet a giant in this land but her thoughts were constantly interrupted by her growling stomach. She could now see the cottage up ahead, except that it appeared to be even bigger than her local town. She raced towards it, figuring that a house meant food and it would save her time for when she had to descend the beanstalk as she had promised her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she reached a point where the stone path seemed to circumnavigate the cottage and the vast jungle of a garden was left behind. She craned her neck to look at the cottage. It was a two-storey job with a slated roof and roses around the door, all gigantic like everything else in that land. She quivered as she now understood just how small she was here, about ant-size. She also got her first sight of giant animals. Along some flower beds next to the cottage itself butterflies the size of passenger jets fluttered about as they supped the nectar. Although she knew she was smaller than they were Meilin still found it a rather relaxing sight. Now she had to find an entrance. There were two steps up to the front door and she was reluctant to do more climbing, even though they would surely have imperfections she could use to climb them. The only other way, though, was through some crack in the wall and she could run into some dangerous and hideous animals inside the dark walls of the cottage. What is her decision?</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to make too big a risk and worried about the amount of time it would take to find another entrance she dashed towards the front steps, preparing herself for the second climb of the day. Upon getting onto the first step she rested for a bit, trying to avoid too long a rest, before jogging towards the face of the second step. Finally she got to the top and stared up at the massive wooden door. Meilin now walked towards it and, as she approached, noticed the gap under the door. She wasn't sure but hopefully it would be wide enough for her to slip under. Then she got a whiff of something. Pausing she focused on the smell. Food. It was the unmistakable smell of cooking. Her stomach cried for the source and her mouth watered as she attempted to figure what was cooking. She made a final dash at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching it she could now determine that the gap was just over half as high as she was. She could crouch under there and crawling would give her plenty of room to raise her back. She commenced crawling into the colossal cottage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon picking herself up on the other side she found herself in a hallway, which only had a couple of rugs for carpetting. Compared to her own home, though, even at her scale this would be luxury. The smell of food was all over and was sending Meilin's senses into overdrive. She had to find that food and then attempt to obtain some. Walking along the wooden floor she did what she could to follow her nose. She had just got to the doorway leading into the titanic dining room when she suddenly felt a series of earth tremors, which subsided as quickly as they started. Finding her bearings Meilin now heard a powerful voice bearing the tone and demeanour of someone about her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LUNCH. ALWAYS JUST ME FOR LUNCH WHEN AT HOME.\" The power in the voice intimidated Meilin as she had a vague idea as to how big the individual who said that was but, at the same time, she felt pity from the sadness in that voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" She declared, \"It will be lunch for two today!\" But then she wondered if she should be forward enough to just go straight for the food and introduce herself. If the giant was caring and observant she would definitely have an opportunity to end all of her desperation and her mother's but if not she could very well wind up dead.</span></div></div>",

As she ran her mind wandered to her surroundings as it attempted to procrastinate the hunger. She could improve her mental picture of the giant. The six chairs at the dining room table could each cover one of the farms back home. The table had enough room for two country villages on either end. Along the walls she could see picture frames containing photos of giants, each photo being about one hundred and fifty feet tall. All things told her that this was a civilised abode but also emphasised just how tiny she'd be in the eyes of a giant such as this land was to scale with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Meilin reached the near end of another doorway leading off the side into a kitchen. The smell of food was overwhelming now and what were once tremors could now knock her off her feet. She knew the giant must be in there and, thusly, crept up against the skirting board and braced herself for the sight of what and who were in the giant kitchen. Finally she peered round the side of the doorway. She stared agog. There was a girl who couldn't have been much older than herself towering high into the air. Meilin estimated her to be eight hundred feet high! And yet she had to use a step to reach the hob of the cooker. That meant that an adult must've been something like two thousand feet tall. The smell was unmistakably...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Is was nabemono. Meilin thought really hard about this. The first thing was to get up on the kitchen side, which was about five hundred feet or more above her level. Then she would have to determine whether to try and catch the giant girl's attention or to try and sneak some food without her notice. Considering the size difference Meilin figured that, in the case of the latter, it would be more likely that she would have to dodge giant chopsticks even if she was in plain view, on account that she would most likely go unnoticed by the giantess unless she was already aware of her. With this in mind Meilin dashed across the floor to the side, where she'd have to climb the far end to avoid any complications with a cupboard door. Her eyes spent most of the time on the giant girl, making sure that she wouldn't be taking the food away while she was attempting to reach it on the huge hob and to ensure that she wouldn't end up beneath a descending slipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What luxury she has.\" Meilin mused, figuring that her thin sandals were not much defence against even normal splinters. Finally she reached the side and begin to climb. As she climbed the air was filled with a powerful vocal sound. Meilin knew the giantess was making that sound and was thankful it wasn't too loud or she'd fall. Approaching the top she noticed there were no words being made and understood it was humming. It had a characteristic quirkiness typical of humming while doing housework but also carried a hint of sorrow. Pulling herself up and onto the worktop near a massive mixing bowl Meilin mused again. \"She is lonely. She wants someone to talk to.\" With that Meilin decided she would definitely risk revealing herself hoping that she wouldn't be mistaken for an insect or thought of as just another thing that's edible. Meilin couldn't get herself to run. The sheer size of this girl filled her with awe as she wondered how helpless everyone she knew would be to her, and this was just a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeilin strolled past a salad dish and some cutlery before coming within arm's reach of the giantess. She looked up at her face, wondering what would be the best comparison for it but coming up with nothing.</span></div></div>",

Her stomach was crying out for her to reach the food while her brain said to wait for the opportune moment and her heart said to greet the mighty titaness. Meilin strolled closer to the arm that was using a wooden fork to stir the giant noodles. As she got closer Meilin felt more and more uneasy as she realised just how small and pathetic she was compared to the mountainous young girl looming before her. She fought off these feelings as she told herself that she had come this far and she had to get some food, so she took a deep breath as the giantess stopped humming and bellowed as loud as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIANT MISS!!!\" She took another breath and shouted again. \"PLEASE HELP ME!\" With that she now jumped up and down, waving her arms up at the colossal girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was stumped. She could've sworn she heard a distant voice calling for her. Yet there were things that didn't add up. It appeared to be coming from somewhere in the vicinity of the cooker and seemed to be calling her 'giant'. Bewildered she checked over all that was there; everything seemed as she remembered until she spotted something moving just under her right arm. There was something jumping on the worktop. Her first thought was a flying ant with a broken wing until she noticed the shape was wrong. Breaking off from her cooking she crouched down until her eyes were level with the surface. They bulged out as she recognised what was jumping on the side. It was a tiny ant-size girl! What does Sakura do now?</span></div></div>",

With great care Sakura raised her hand over the belittled girl and curled her thumb and forefinger into a vice-like shape. She watched as the girl cringed in the shadow of her hand and felt really sorry for her, all scared and alone in a world where any person or animal could present a hazard. Small and alone, just as she was feeling while making lunch. With great care she pinched her between her fingers and effortlessly lifted her off the worktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeilin stood recovering from her frantic actions as she watched the amazed giantess crouch in front of her but unease soon returned as she saw a massive hand rising over the edge of the surface and engulfing her in its shadow. Realising just how easily she could get killed she curled up, knowing she couldn't outrun someone so huge. Then she felt it. Two massive pillars of flesh bumping into her and holding her between them. As she was whisked into the air by the giantess she found that it was difficult to get enough air in her lungs, meaning she could only manage so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura scrutinised her between her fingers Meilin managed to get her arms up and rest them on each digit. Sakura watched as she squirmed in discomfort. Realising the power of her grip Sakura quickly brought her left hand forth, palm up, and set Meilin down right in the centre. Remembering her lunch Sakura carefully reduced the temperature on the hob ring and continued to stir the noodles with her right hand while holding Meilin very close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Meilin recovering from the pinching while being overwhelmed by the awe of Sakura's massive emerald eyes and Sakura attempting to make out Meilin's face on her ant-size body who shall speak next?</span></div></div>",

Her clothes were rags and she was terrified of becoming nothing more than a resource.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" Sakura whispered, trying not to upset her with the volume of her voice. \"I won't hurt you. Lunch is nearly ready; let's share it and then you can tell me all about it.\" Meilin wondered what the last bit meant but was happy that she was being so charitable to someone smaller than her fingernail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura realised that she'd need both hands to get the lunch together so she'd have to put Meilin down somewhere, at the same time it needed to be somewhere she wouldn't be forgotten. Finally she set her down on the lip of the salad bowl, giving her about sixty feet clearance between the edge and the salad. \"Don't move.\" She mentioned as she got a plate ready and began to spoon the noodles onto it. Meilin watched in amazement of such a simple domestic act becoming almost god-like on such a scale as this. Sakura now grabbed handfuls of salad from the salad bowl and mixed it in with the items on the plate, always making sure that Meilin would not be accidentally snatched up with them; for Meilin the sight of Sakura's massive hand descending in her direction caused great discomfort for her as she remembered how difficult it would be to spot her on this scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Sakura had her lunch ready and carried it into the dining room. She found that the knowledge of sharing her food with someone small enough to accidentally be food to be theraputic to her lonliness, especially as she knew that Meilin would not be able to take her eyes off her. 'She's alone in a giant world,' She thought, 'I must help her return to normal size somehow. I cannot allow myself to think of her as a pet.' With that she returned to the kitchen and crouched in front of Meilin. This time Sakura held her hand out, giving her a fleshy crash mat to jump on. Getting the message Meilin decided to not let the side down just because she was so puny. She took the best running leap she could muster and plummeted back into Sakura's palm. Doing what she could to keep her hand steady Sakura ferried Meilin into the dining room, every step resonating with her tiny guest, and stood by her seat, wondering where to put Meilin.</span></div></div>",

She looked up at the landscape of food and her nostrils were overwhelmed by the smell, she so wanted to leap in there and eat away to her heart's content, but she forced herself to look up at Sakura and figure how easily she could end up as a part of this meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EAT AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.\" Sakura declared, her voice being like that of a god. \"I'LL START FROM THE LEFT AND HEAD RIGHT, THAT WAY, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T PLUNGE INTO THE FOOD, YOU'LL BE QUITE SAFE.\" Meilin nodded, still feeling rather sober from the reminder that she could accidentally become an appetiser. \"ITATAKEMASU!\" Sakura roared as she lifted her chopsticks over the edge of the plate and plunged the tips into the left-hand part of the nabemono, lifting only a few noodles amongst some of the other ingredients. For Meilin this was only a confirmation of her helplessness; she deduced that the same amount would provide enough for a banquet attended by the entire population of the prefecture where she resided. She watched in awe, adrenaline beginning to surge, as Sakura silently opened her mouth and shoved it in, with only enough noodles protruding from her lips to equal enough food for Meilin and her mother to last a week, in two seconds they were slurped into the massive maw. A terrible groan and ache from her own stomach reminded Meilin why she came here. She walked towards the apex of a curled noodle and knelt upon the plate to tuck in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itatakemasu!\" She declared, feeling like her own voice was naught but a tiny squeak having heard Sakura's thundering declaration. She bit into the noodle; the soft pasta still quite maleable in her mouth suggesting that the consistency of giant food was the same as normal food, only greater in volume.</span></div></div>",

Within arm's reach was a salad leaf; she decided to nibble on that for a while but, while her arm could reach it, her mouth couldn't. Grabbing onto it with both hands she pulled to either bring it closer to her or vice-versa. A shifting from up above made her feel uneasy as she thought that her haste would bury her under one leaf ergo to be part of Sakura's last bite, fortunately her weight wasn't enough to bring it down on top of her and, instead, she found herself jumping to take bites out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura made regular glances at Meilin's tiny form, making sure she didn't get lost in the chaos of the noodles.

She then noticed something else; her ragged clothes were sodden, she was being soaked by the sauce. Not letting such a major opportunity for good food pass up she began licking her hands clean of the sauce. \"WOW!\" Sakura boomed. \"YOU SURE ARE HUNGRY.\" Meilin suddenly looked at her in a new way; not out of fear and awe but with a tone of bother. Sakura, too far away to notice this, returned to clearing the left-hand side of the plate, a single mouthful once again hitting home their difference in size. Meilin continued through whatever she could get at along the right-hand edge of the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO,\" Sakura asked sometime later, \"HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN LIKE THIS?\" There was clearly concern in her mighty voice but how does Meilin interpret the question?</span></div></div>",

As she began to get herself together she noticed something unbelievable, a massive beanstalk stretched right past her window. Getting a better look she found it rose ever higher, right into the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we can have super-size beans?\" She checked. \"And what must I do to repay the debt?\" She then remembered the dream she had; a mysterious figure told her. \"As the gods judge, you must explore beyond what you know to find fortune. The quest is the repayment to them and the fortune is your reward.\" With that Sakura went up to the balcony and hauled herself onto the gigantic green growth.</span></div></div>",

She took a glance down to see how far she'd come, which turned out to be five hundred feet above the ground, but she also noticed that the beanstalk took up the whole of the vegetable patch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing her best to console herself Sakura concluded that, in keeping with the kismet as it was presented, she'd continue to climb and see what she'd find. She kept climbing, focused on reaching the very top, until she'd been climbing for nearly two hours. Eventually she was engulfed in thick cloud that seemed to keep getting thicker to the point that it got so dark it was like being underground. After another pause she glanced round and realised that she was underground; all around her was soil with light filtering down through the fronds of the beanstalk. She continued to climb, wondering what this would lead to before finally emerging into bright daylight and the top of the beanstalk proper, where one solitary leaf held steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura took the opportunity to rest on this leaf and have a look round at this strange new land she'd discovered.

Rubbing her backside in response to the discomfort she stood up and walked through the grass, occasionally having to shove a few blades off as best she could before she came upon a wide open space with periodic breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling the view from the beanstalk Sakura concluded that she'd reached what looked like a path and wondered which way she'd go. Stepping up onto one of the paving slabs she walked around in search of anything when a noise momentarily startled her before realising she was the source of the sound. Since it was two hours at least since she got up and she hadn't had breakfast she was feeling the classic busy-morning hunger. Looking up she caught sight of the corner of the house round one shrub and, thusly, had a ready bearing to use and began to make her way towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another long haul for Sakura as she had to leap across the gaps between the paving stones. She figured it would be after noon by the time she'd reach this house and began to flag from the combination of steady exercise and lack of food before slumping down to get her breath back. Looking up after a couple of minutes she gawked again as she realised that this was a very big house even when compared to the size of the plants in its garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Giant plants,</i> She wondered, <i>And a giant house?

It must've been close to midday by the time she reached the bottom of those stairs and readily identified that they were much too big to climb up even if she wasn't worn out by the trek to get here. She looked off to the side where a bed of giant roses seemed to frame the most readily available entrance to her, a small crack in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had just gone into the crack and thusly found herself somewhere very dark with no idea what could be hidden in this place.

She guessed that the crack she was looking through was in a skirting board hidden under a table as the view up above consisted of a wooden brown cast into shadow and bare boards were laid out before her in shade. To her right she saw a mass of dark blue that looked like upholstery, possibly an armchair or such-like, while to her left she saw the same floorboards illuminated, although not quite as much as if it was in direct sunlight, leading to a great big door painted in turquoise. The rest of the view was a panorama of the gigantic room from where she could see a coffee table, a sofa, a chest of drawers, some gigantic trinkets and ornaments, a wardrobe and, off to the side in the distance, a great bed with a teal-coloured bedspread laid across it. The whole thing screamed opulence, order and, what Sakura took note of the most, civility; the giant that would call this place home must surely be a very rational individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was so awed and so taken aback that she hadn't realised that she'd walked out onto the giant floorboards underneath the table. Her feet left little in their wake even accounting for her comparative size as the floor was so clean. Sakura came to a stop right where the shade of the table would give way to the light reflecting off the walls from the windows that she knew must be there, but she still couldn't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura began to get a hold of herself and try to fathom what it would be that her fate dictated should be her next action she felt some very heavy thuds that built steadily, accompanied by the sound of footsteps magnified considerably. Someone was approaching this room, someone gigantic, someone just the right size for this room. Still worried about how a giant would react to finding her Sakura summoned up enough energy to duck behind one of the table legs and peeked out as the mighty quaking footsteps abruptly stopped. The knob on the door turned with a sound like a clatter but more organised and it swung open, buffeting Sakura with a strong gust, and she gazed up at her first sight of a giant.

As she did this again she giggled as she thought about real people occupying these little buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt half past ten Tomoyo set off as intended.

She figured that, to Tomoyo, she wasn't more than an ant and could be extinguished without a care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must escape,\" She told herself, \"Before I become a smear or a snack.\" She dashed out into the open and searched for something that would give her a safe descent from such a height. Finally she settled on a box of dental floss nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she struggled with the line from the box, attempting to get it over the edge of the shelf, she wandered back again to just how huge Tomoyo's mouth was. If she could use Tomoyo's floss as a rope then Tomoyo could use steel rope as string. Finally she looked over the side of the shelf and then wished she hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo was right there, dozing away, her mouth slightly agape and her chest rising and falling with her breathing. Naoko looked back at the floss. There was no way she could get down to the floor with it so there was only one option. Lower it to within a few inches of Tomoyo's head and then attempt to climb down her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while and Naoko struggled to keep the gigantic floss under control but, finally, she had it as close to Tomoyo's skin as she dared. Making sure that her weight would not change the orientation of the box she then swung her legs over the side, trying not to think about the four-hundred foot or so sheer drop to Tomoyo's forehead, and held onto the floss with one hand as she tried to curl her legs around it. Once that had been accomplised she held on with both hands and shinnied down a few feet at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer descent was very slow when compared to the distance she had to go. Once she had gone sixty feet she began to feel a strange breeze on her legs and the floss-rope swaying slightly. She didn't want to look down but qucikly deduced it was Tomoyo's breath she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this!\" She squeaked. \"I'm dangling from some floss over a girl the size of a mountain.

Although she was uneased by this Naoko didn't look, thinking it must've been wood straining from heat exchange. Her current priority was judging the distance down to Tomoyo's head, and it was very hard for her to take her eyes off such an enormous girl. When the creaking became continuous she felt compelled to look up, just in time to see severe twisting and fraying in the giant floss. Before she had time to make a contingency plan the rope of floss snapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko could not hold herself back. As she plummeted through the air she screamed wildly, expecting the worst. Suddenly she landed on something that cushioned her so that it was like jumping off a high-dive onto a crash mat.

However her screaming and landing had not gone unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo returned to reality as Naoko's minute scream entered her ears; she didn't have time to wonder as to its origin when she felt something hit her nose.

She swallowed in fear as she thought of all possible outcomes that such a gigantic young lady could produce. Her mind was stunned, and was currently recognising the giantess as human, so all she could do was say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, hi.\" Tomoyo could just make out the tiny lips of this tiny person, who's age could not have been much different to her own, forming a couple of syllables but her giant eardrums could not be moved by the sound produced.

From there she slid down her massive neck and, to Tomoyo's embarrassment and amusement, slid under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of a miniscule person who's weight was negligent running across her skin tickled Tomoyo. At first little happened but, as Naoko made a blind panic run down her, Tomoyo began to twitch from the feeling of such small feet patting upon her body. Naoko was only just crossing her tummy when she could hold it in no longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! HA! HA! HA!\" She gaffuffled. \"OOH, STOP IT.\" Unable to remain in the chair she leapt up and landed on her knees, trying to resist the urge to press where it tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swift movement of the giantess was enough to make Naoko change direction in the low light beneath her clothes. She tumbled a fair way until she slipped out through the flap along the buttonline and was flung onto the waistline of the skirt. Tomoyo, still giggling from the tickling, unwittingly sent her flying off her skirt and plummeting towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a longer fall but the landing was even softer. Naoko struck one of the carpet hairs on the side and slid into the forest-like gloom amongst them; the sliding took away enough of her velocity for it to be very much like an actual slide. Picking herself up and dusting herself off she looked up beyond the hairs to see Tomoyo looming like a mountain; her laughter was still swamping the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>OOH! THAT TICKLES! PLEASE! HA, HA! STOP!</b>\" Even with her ears covered they still entered clear as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Naoko screamed and ran like the wind again.

She felt only her own skin and the fabric of her clothes and, fearing the worst, lifted her pinched thumb and forefinger to her eyes.

She could tell she wasn't trying to shy away due to the slow pace she was travelling at. Understanding what Naoko's actions must be for after a few moments of thinking she lay upon her stomach and carefully brought her face closer to the building in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko made her way up the stairwell within this building, which was meant for offices where it came from, thinking about whether or not to go all the way to the roof or to only go as far as one of the upper floors. When she reached the third floor she broke off from the stairwell and looked through an office to the outer window. She could see Tomoyo's chin at this level, clearly indicating the need to go higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible.\" She breathed as the whole scale sank in. \"She's so vast!\" She continued her ascent, figuring that she'd have to get to the tenth floor at least. Eventually she found the tenth floor and, being leg-sore and weary, decided to try and interact with the giantess at this point. She entered an office that provided her with a view up to the bridge of Tomoyo's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU POOR THING.\" Came a mighty voice with a tone so gentle that she must've been whispering. \"YOU MUST BE WORN OUT.\" Naoko nodded but quickly realised that it would be difficult for the giant girl to see her nod. Figuring this she made her way over to the window, taking a deep breath as she felt a rush of adrenaline but with more control, and opened it as wide as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shifting the furniture for a few minutes, amazed at Tomoyo's patience and endurance, Naoko then made a running jump out of the window with a shout similar to that of a bungee jump. After what felt like an hour but was less than half a minute, she landed on the tip of Tomoyo's nose, right where she had first been spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo was relieved as she saw Naoko's miniature form leaping out of one of the thumbnail-sized windows and right onto the tip of her nose. She slowly lifted herself up into a sitting position, making sure not to send her tiny passenger flying anywhere else in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THERE WE GO!\" Tomoyo mentioned, her voice resonating around Naoko as she attempted to steal herself for the re-establishing of communication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, nice giant.\" Naoko peeped. With Naoko having overcome her primal fear and Tomoyo happy that they were in direct contact now who makes the first introduction?</span></div></div>",

Sakura has to reclaim and purify the cards by sealing them again. All goes well until the little and BIG cards. Little is successfully resealed but as Sakura approached the evil version of BIG the maiden of the card taps Sakura on the head gently with her wand of growth. Eventually like with all things little or BIG touch Sakura changes size but a dark aura surrounds her as she grows and her eyes glow red. Now Tomeda needs saved from the team of Sakura-Zilla and the big card who might have bigger plans still for the Card Captor turned building size problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdea # 2<br>\r\n1 day Sakura snaps sick of brother taunting her at breakfast for being \"short\" or a \"runt\"<br>\r\nThrowing caution and rules to the wind she reveals magic to her brother and his friend via using the BIG card on herself in front of them. Sakura then gets payback on anyone ever the least bit mean to her the question is rather this is really just an angry Sakura pushed over the edge or has evil somehow influenced her?</span></div></div>",

She could somehow get Sakura to use the big card to make Tomoyo big and even give her some powers with the use of the other cards, and then they begin the rampage. But things soon get out of hand...
