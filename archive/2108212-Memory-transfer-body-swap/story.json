As your eyes continued to wonder the room, which looked almost exactly like the one you had been in as you died, your doctor and the nurse who had ran out when you awoke entered the room. \"How are you feeling Samuel?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A, a little woozy\" you answered, your voice obviously sounding different and very dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's to be expected with a procedure like this one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me doc. Who am I now?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the question of the day now isn't it\" he replied as he handed you a cup of water with a straw. \"Here, sip on this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as he said, and after taking a sip you said \"I'd say so\". It was at this time that you truly noticed just how different your voice was, sounding softer and clearly feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as for whose body your in the answer is, we don't know. She was brought to us by the police shortly after you lost consciousness. We preformed some brain scans that revealed that she was essentially brain dead. When we asked for her identification, we were informed that she had none. She was found in a shipping container with several other girls. Now, as for who you will be, that's a simpler question. You will still be Sam Baker, however it will be Samantha rather than Samuel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not so bad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured as much. Now for some, bad news\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What bad news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, based on everything we can tell you are now a 15 year old girl. Because we need someone to observe you while you recover and the government doesn't want someone who looks like a 15 year old girl to be living on her own, your going to have to appear as someone's daughter. As you know, your an only child and both your parents have passed away, so shortly after the procedure we contacted your ex-wife and asked if she could be your legal guardian\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You shouted, almost spitting the water you had been sipping on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The government won't let a 15 year old girl appear to be living on her own. It would raise to many questions and this is a procedure that has to be kept on the down low. But once your old enough you can move out and you'll have access to your bank account the whole time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that it could be worse\" you say. \"Could, could I have some time to myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. If you need anything just hit the call button here and a nurse will be here in no time at all\" he said before he left, followed by the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after they left I found a tv remote and turned the rooms tv on. Being that it was the middle of the day there wasn't much on so I settled on the news. However, it wasn't long before that got boring and my eyes began wondering the room. Eventually they found their way to the far corner of the room where my clothes I had worn here were neatly folded and sitting on a chair, with my phone and wallet sitting on top of them. Carefully, I threw off the blankets covering my body and stepped down on the floor. As I stood up I felt a wave of new feelings as my new parts were effected by gravity. Looking down, my vision was blocked by a pair of breasts covered by a hospital gown. Getting sidetracked for a minute I carefully walked over to my rooms bathroom, my hips swaying from side to side uncontrollably with each step I took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was in the bathroom I stared at the mirror in absolute shock. Sure, the doctor told me I was a 15 year old girl now but actually seeing my reflection made it even more real. Seeing her eyes grow wide along with mine, or her jaw drop in sync with me, it just made me speechless. As I stood there, I began studying my reflections face in awe of who I now was. I studied her eyes, which were blue with green flecks though out the irises. Then there was the curve of her nose, smooth and seamless as if her face had been build only to support such a perfect structure. All this was framed by beautiful shoulder length blond hair. As my eyes wondered further down, I couldn't help but stare at the breasts that would rise and fall with each breath I took. I carefully pulled the hospital gown up as I wanted a better look. With the gown pulled up I could admire the new assets now on my chest. They were still covered by a cheep hospital bra, but I could see enough. I placed an uneducated guess that they were a small B cup, and they would probably grow a bit more over the next few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was slowly bringing one of my hands up to have a feel when I was snapped back to reality as I heard the door to my hospital room open. Who was it that entered the room?</span></div></div>",

And thanks to Ms O'Brien's donation you will get to live a long and healthy life, that's the thing to focus on here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it beats the alternative\" You agree \"It's just going to take some getting used to is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit,\" the Doc smiles down at you \"Now we have some tests to run but first I think it would be a good idea if you met the new you first. That's if you feel up to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart hammers in your chest at the thought of confronting your new body but there doesn't seem like much point in putting it off. You nod and carefully avoid looking at yourself as the doctor helps you off the bed. You wobble on your new legs as you take a few shuffling steps. The doctor pulls back a curtain and you find yourself facing a full-length mirror facing the reflection of Katie O'Brien, your reflection now. You raise a trembling hand to your face as you see Katie is....</span></div></div>",

You've given me a second chance and I want you to know how much it means to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shucks,\" she giggles taking a hand off the wheel to land a playful punch on your shoulder \"Weren't nothing but dying.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day you are woken early by a porter bringing you a light breakfast and a change of clothes. You eat mechanically not really tasting the bland cereal as you reflect on the strangely vivid dream. You have never been a spiritual guy but you can\u2019t help feeling you have Katie\u2019s blessing somehow. You still feel uncomfortable with the way your breast shift about under your gown but you are starting to think of them as your breasts not just as Katie\u2019s.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cProgress I suppose\u201d you grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly halfway through your bowl, you start to feel full (a consequence of having a smaller stomach you assume) so you set it aside and pick up a coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, coffee how I've missed you,\" you say taking a moment to savour its rich aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your illness, you had pretty much lived on coffee while you were sick it was on the long list of things you couldn't have. Carefully you take a sip of the scalding liquid only to gag at its harsh bitter taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck\u201d you complain \u201cwhat's wrong with this coffee? It tastes like crap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second cautious sip confirms it, the coffee is horrid, completely undrinkable but not because there is a problem with the drink itself. It's perfectly normal coffee, not the best you've ever had but still pretty much as you remember it. The problem is your new taste buds, they rebel with every sip. It seems you no longer like coffee, yet another unexpected side effect and not the last you are sure. Denied your morning cup of Joe you are forced to fall back on fruit juice and your recently acquired youthful energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know the doc has a bunch of tests scheduled for today so you figure you should hurry and get ready. You strip off the hospital gown intending to try and ignore your new body as much as possible but you can't help getting a good look at yourself as the gown falls to the floor. You blush furiously as your eyes linger in your perky breasts and smooth thighs. You chide yourself for being so ridiculous this is your body now you can't go through the rest of your life pretending not to notice it. Best to face things directly, that has always been your policy. So, you take a deep breath fold your gown and place it on the bed. Naked you walk to the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to fight back a wave of vertigo as Katie steps into the frame instead of the slightly overweight middleaged man you still subconsciously expect to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling like a voyeur you force yourself to examine your new reflection in detail. You take in your long slim legs the thatch of red hair covering your crotch. The way your thighs don't quite meet at the top leaving a triangular gap that seems to emphasise what is missing down there. Twisting you check out your ass. It's the kind of butt you've always appreciated. Full enough to have a bit of bounce to it but still firm and tight. A slim waist flat belly fully breasts that that don't sag at all. Her face pale and drawn but still undeniably beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn. I'm hot\" you mutter completing your inspection <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sure how to feel about that. You are glad you didn't end up fat or ugly but you are also all too aware of how the world is going to see this body and the prospect is a little worrying. You push thoughts of being catcalled by construction workers to the back of your mind resolving not to feel sorry for yourself. Instead, you focus on the positive. For a start, you feel great. Not only are you not sick anymore but truly healthy in a way you haven't felt since you were a kid. You smile at your reflection and the girl's face lights up. You can easily imagine boys making fools of themselves for that smile, more than a few girls too for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy\u201d you giggle \u201cI'm going to be quite the heartbreaker if I'm not careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour confidence growing you run your hands over your smooth skin and feel your nipples harden. The feeling is like a faint echo of your lost erection. You touch them carefully gasping as your exploration brings an answering tingle from between your legs. Your wife always seemed to love it when you played with her tits and you are beginning to understand why. One hand strays to the source of the tingling. Your fingers pushing through the thatch of curly red hair to find the tender folds of your sexy. Even that first tentative touch is enough to make you bite your lip. Tingling grows into a hot ache as touching escalates into enthusiastic rubbing. You whimper and your knees tremble as your probing fingers grow sticky from your excitement. You close your eyes your breath coming in shallow gasps. You feel like you are on the verge of something. But just when you feel you are about to tip over the edge the feeling reaches a plateau. You keep rubbing but the sense of being on the brink slowly fades. After a few minutes, the pleasant sensation of rubbing yourself gives way to an almost painful sensitivity. Finally, you are forced give up your exploration with a frustrated grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cServes me right for being a dirty old man,\" you say,l feeling a pang of guilt for giving in to your urges so quickly \u201cI'm sure I wasn't given a second chance just to diddle myself silly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little guilty at your behaviour you resolve to have more restraint in the future you try and focus on just getting ready without getting distracted again. You wash up and brushing your teeth like you usually would. Use the bathroom, not quite how you normally would but you are just going to have to get used to that. Then, you dress in the clothes provided. They\u2019ve given you some plain cotton panties and a matching bra. You aren\u2019t crazy about wearing girl\u2019s underwear but it proves surprisingly comfortable.  Over that, you wear a pair of sweatpants and a grey hoodie top with the hospital\u2019s logo stitched on the chest. The baggy fabric hides at least some of your girlish curves and helps you feel a little more normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back down on the bed and wait to see what the day has in store for you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking down, my vision was blocked by a pair of breasts covered by a hospital gown. <br>\r\nI continued staring at the mirror in absolute shock. Sure, the doctor told me I was a woman now but actually seeing my reflection made it even more real. Seeing her eyes grow wide along with mine, or her jaw drop in sync with me, it just made me speechless. As I stood there, I began studying my reflections face in awe of who I now was. I studied her eyes, which were blue like the clear cloudless sky.<br>\r\nThen there was the curve of her nose, smooth and seamless as if her face had been built only to support such a perfect structure. All this was framed by beautiful shoulder length blond hair. As my eyes wondered further down, I couldn't help but stare at the breasts that would rise and fall with each breath I took. I carefully pulled the hospital gown up as I wanted a better look. With the gown pulled up I could admire the new assets now on my chest. They were still covered by a cheap hospital bra, but I could see enough. I placed an uneducated guess that they were a good C cup!<br>\r\nI was slowly bringing one of my hands up to have a feel when I was snapped back to reality as I saw that the doctor stood right next to me all the time!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know what he is eluding to. He was talking about the government, or some private organization connected to the government. It really doesn't matter much anymore as the two are intertwined. The doctor continues speaking, \"I guess you should know what little we know of her, your history. We got a call the other night from an individual connected to our funding source. He had an incident with the young woman you now are. She was a high dollar call girl. This man likes to live on the edge. He gave her some of the new street drug to spice things up and she overdosed. This was her first time using this drug or any drug as far as we can tell. Her system was clean. On top of that she hadn't been a call girl very long as he preferred girls that were fresh. She doesn't have an arrest record and did not have any identification on her. The name you know have along with supporting documents was dropped off this morning. That's all I now. You have a new live Ms. O'Brian, a fresh start. I'll let you get acquainted with yourself and be back in a few hours. We shouldn't have to keep you very long. Another individual will come in later and brief you on the conditions of your participation in this project.\" With that the doctor leaves. I look back in the mirror at my new self again. \"A fresh start\", I say to myself. I wonder what I can do with my new life. Thoughts of continuing my previous profession cross my mind. I let out a giggle as I imagine the looks on my previous co-workers seeing me like I am now. They would never take a woman like this seriously.

Strange that a woman so young would feel the need to have a boob job. I suddenly feel sad as I wonder what kind of future she had wanted. What lead her to becoming a call girl. She must have had bigger dreams than that. Then again I had dreams to. For a time I thought I had everything. I had a great job, big house, money, and a beautiful wife. One by one my dreams were crushed. The dream I had of having kids vanished when I found out I was shooting blanks. The big one came last year when the wife turned up pregnant and I found out my partner and best friend, Mark was banging my wife. Just like that I lost both. House was sold and so was the business that I started with Mark. Money was divided and we went our separate ways. Just when I was starting to get back on my feet I was struck down with illness. My mind locked inside a failing body. I look back in the mirror. I realize that the man I was is dead and woman whose body now stares at me from the mirror is also dead.

This may have been your home, but it's now your former estate. Maximillion Gibbons is no more. The weight tugging at your shoulders a constant reminder, and the sloshing of your chest with the least movement, and the mile of cleavage. None of it gives you any chance of forgetting your new body and status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Sam... I need a friend, right now.\" you tell her plaintively. The desperation colouring your words seeping through. You aren't strong, right now, after the procedure, and looking at your body, you doubt you'll ever feel that same sense of power and control from looking at your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose scrawny arms aren't made for the gym, nor those juicy thighs for any activity beyond the bedroom. You shudder, as that image surfaces. Yourself skewered on some guy's cock. Riding it like a bucking horse. That immense arse bouncing and rippling, and your bust heaving and thrashing as you wail and shriek your pleasure at being filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks colouring are hint enough for Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes...

Sam's voice rasping in your ear, as she stands behind you. Your arousal mounts, as her hands proficiently work your body. Knowing when to tease, and tempt and when to apply more pressure. You gasp and moan, sometimes in pain, sometimes in frustration as she keeps you on the verge of cumming. Her nails dig into your tender flesh, leaving you hornier than you like to consider, and without warning... her mauling assault ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan of dissatisfaction spills from your lips, that she's leaving you unfulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your my dolly, to play with, to dress, to entertain me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe playfully ruffles your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my victim.\" she says. The words send a chill down your spine. \"A statusless drone. With no rights, and no identity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorts, \"Hah!\" she walks around in front of you. \"Who'd have thought, when I poisoned your pathetic body you'd end up like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sneers, as she lets her gaze linger in your cleavage. Your squirm, but can't escape... Surely it can't be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I did it, I thought I'd finally be free of your lecherous ways, your wandering eyes,... and cock!\" she practically spits the word in your face. You hoped she hadn't picked up on the times you'd cheated on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, this... this, this is priceless.\" She gestures to your over-stuffed body, in delight, \"Now, I can have my full revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to take her arm as she waves it up and down your body. But she easily slaps it away. As it lands back in your lap, you realise how desperate your situation is. Even if you tell the police of your murder, you'll just sound insane... an insane woman. If you don't tell them who you are... Hell!, You aren't sure yourself, and you have next to no ID for this body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You contemplated for a long time. Eva was a blank slate essentially, she had no friends, family, or any attachments. She was aloof and a drift. She was not really into anything at all. The weight of it all kept you up and resulted in an early awakening. For what had happened, you had a second chance at life. Another shot at being happy and making it big. You tried to see the positives. After making a light breakfast you showered and prepared your self. Eva was fit for her time being dead, she looked a little thin, but her hips don't. They had comeback with an ass that jiggles ever so slightly. her core was slim, yet she fitted a pair of balanced breasts. D's you remeber as you put on your bra. She had long, strong, seductive legs. Something that made you blush a bit when you thought about it. Hell, you ex-wife was never this hot, she had long dark black hair, with Blue eyes, very deep blue, nunatural really. You placed you legs and danced your way into the panties as you did making your self watch in the mirror, being a little happy about it. You found stockings in her drawers and chose to attempt to wear them, sitting on the makeup vanity facing the full body mirror you slowly, put the stockings on. One. Leg. At. A. Time. Your little dance made you feel excited and slightly aroused. Had Eva been someone else, and you a young man, you're certain you would gawk at her, thirstily. After your show you began to carefully construct an outfit, the nurses had fun teaching you the basics, but you had to get serious.  A second chance at life, to be happier and,a the center of it all was Eva. Even if she got a crap degree, she would still be fine. You begin by grabbing a black midi skirt and hooded blouse the blue and white mixing together very well. With some long brown knee boots. It looked very well. Now on to the makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she is very pretty.\" You mutter looking at her closer, or your self. In a new city alone in a big apartment, near condo size. A girl like this would have no trouble getting around. Her glasses, (there's about 20 different pairs) all fit her face exceedingly well. You were helped by nurses on how to style your make up and what to wear, so you had a sort of an idea on. What foundation worked best, how to do your mascara, lips, eye liner, eye shadow etc. You could tell they had fun with it, so you immersed yourself in it. Even going as far as to style your hair in letting it dry naturally to give it a wavy look. Pulling it back into a ponytail, giving a barista vibe. The thick glasses you choose made her eyes look perfect, you smiled and kissed at your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, enough, I need to get going.\" You said. You picked up a backpack filed with papers and a purse filled with information about Eva Heatherton. And stopped at a mirror in front of the door way. Looking at your self over once more, your bangs gently covering your alien face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was I before her?\" You thought. \" A man who failed at everything and lost it all. You stare at your new form, realizing he's mostly gone. That man is probably reported as dead. Died in some accident. Why should you care \"Eva\"? You try to enforce the fact your body is gone, but your mind is not ready yet. It still fights, you're here, alive and well. But not really here, not in your flesh. You look back on yourself, your past life was mired with bad choices, which drove everyone away. You could have finished college, but you didn't. You could have made more money, but you didn't. You could have kept your marriage,But you didn't. No the man you were is gone now. Your what's left, the part that sought redemption. The only part worth keeping his resolve to keep going and endure it all. That small voice telling him to keep going, no matter the cost. <br>\r\nThat there was something out there for him, and he found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" you say to your self, placing your hands above the mirror getting eye to eye with Eva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am Eva Heatherton. A new woman, new personality, and I'll do what I have to make it.\" You say. Her smile is captivating your old soul, making you truely accept it. Your gone in a sense, and that's okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva had a thing for coffee shops and tea shops, she was apparently the kind of girl who would tuck herself away from prying eyes and sit in the back to drink her drinks, so the information on the papers told you. After filling out all of the college papers, legal papers for her millions of dollars inheritance, and, your  hospital vist to ensure everything was working; Your day had finally ended in a quite coffee shop. It was called Sara's falls. A retro styled shop with old wood floors and a second story. Plants grew from little pots and people tended them. They had chess boards and such games, but the atmosphere was good. You liked black coffee when reading your papers. As you dig deeper and deeper into Eva's past you began to pause about her academics, they were good, but not amazing. She had planned to go closer to her home, but now was here. Away from it all. Way down south in Austin, Texas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least it's not New Jersey.\" You mutter. Looking at the University fields of study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Archeology.....\" You muse over it. Traveling had been a big thing to you growing up, but you never had the money. Also you remeber your childhood fantasy of going to Egypt, digging up dinosaur bones, and, treasure hunting. All of it was so surreal. You had to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Miss.Heatherton, we are going for an archeology degree.\" You say to yourself in a very cocky attitude. Living out your dreams was something you have given up. Since you had a wife, but couldn't have children, you had no commitment. This dream was in reach as you pulled up from the booth you went to the counter seeing a man about your age tending it. \"Might as well try to get a job here it close to home and the college.\" You think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little lady! Can I help you?\" He said in a very projected voice. He was very tall, dark and, handsome. Your body involuntarily heated up. Getting a little flushed at him. His name tag read Eduardo Hernandez. A little stubble on his face. And we'll groomed head of hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was looking a job. Wondering if your hiring?\"  You say, playing with your ponytail. Looking at his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll have to check with the boss lady. But can you fill out this application.\" He reaches under the counter to bring out a paper and a pen. As you fill it out he asks you the basic questions about hours and where your going to school at. You finish it quick. But not after finding out he has a boyfriend, which somehow leaves you slightly dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Adam works at the tailor shop on Wilsoe street, if not here I can hook you up there at least.\" he says.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam is hiring?\" You ask sounding a little unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well he does dresses and suits. He needs a model and some hands. You know, I thought I'd ask since some of our regulars employees are leaving and a new batch is coming in. We have a lot of applications to sort through so we will call you in a week.\" He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you say. And by the way Eduardo, my name is Eva. You can consider me a regular.\" You say with a bright smile. He laughs and soon your on way home. Kicking off the boots, eating a light meal, showering and finally sleeping a little better knowing your going into archeology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can be the sexy professor too.\" You joke. Soon you sleeping today was exhausting for Eva.</span></div></div>",

I've got these huge-ass honkers that I've never got to touch before. So.. can I? I mean, it's not like someone can see me right now.. right? So what if I just gave it a small touch. Just a tiny poke. Really. Just.a.poke. Of course, I ended up fooling around with my new body for at least an hour before realizing that maybe it's best to do something else. But those boobs are so squishy! I wish I could be touching them all the time! However, I do need to find out why I'm a woman now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
