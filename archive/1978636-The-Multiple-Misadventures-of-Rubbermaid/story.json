Rhonda/Rubbermaid turns the key in the ignition and begins to pull out of her parking space, when all of a sudden, a tap on her shoulder causes her to hit the brakes, sending both of driver and passenger back to their seats.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOww!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, exclaims little Tommy, Rhonda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neighbor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kid, who always spies on her and follows her around.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTOMMY!

Out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She tells him, and Tommy obligingly removes himself from the backseat of the Hyundai, and waves at Rhonda as she does her best peel-out at the corner, into the busy traffic of a bustling Friday night in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rubbermaid is back, and she has a score to settle with some bad guys and gals in town!

Albert Locke is under the delusions that he is an actual wizard of the old age. Which grates on the nerves of the others, seeing him as a 'child against science!'. What he lacks in reality, he makes up for in power. Easily controlling all weather phenomenon, and a few terrestrial ideas. Albert is a considerable threat to the city, whenever he does complete his 'spells'. A physiological part of him causes Albert to perform a 'ritual' for his gadgets, even if they don't require it. Albert believes Rubbermaid to be a knight trying to stop him; weirdly flexible one, but one nevertheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance wise; Albert is a surprisingly young man, quite handsome in fact. His face is concealed behind an plastisteel mask, resembling a wizened old man. Besides that, Albert wears the robes of a wizard; the robe itself is decorated with various weather phenomena: storms, floods, lighting and hail are just a few of the things on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dr. Otto Bot</b><br>\r\nPossibly the oldest member of the group, no one knows why he picked this city of all places. Otto Bot has been around since the 1930's, and has been a bane to all generations of heroes.A master in robotics,he has made everything from: steam powered robots to electric fiends of today! Otto is evidently the most rational member of the Guild, whenever they form their alliance. The only reason he isn't the leader is because he lacks Phineas's finesse with the others and outside the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance wise;  Only the top half--and half of that-- of his head, his right arm, and his left leg, are the only visible limbs he has left. The rest of his body is a mix match of different era robotics. From steam, to 60's 'space, to the sleek future, to the 40's 'block' bots.</span></div></div>",

Feeling grateful for the act, The Boss did everything in his power to save her life. When all else seemed to fail, Cassandra offered to make Stacy into a \" Polymer Born\" such as herself and others. The Boss sighed off on that, giving Stacy both her life and new powers.

Giving her a reputation around the country that many contest, causing her no end in opponents.

Well, he is a Capo under The Boss, and he does run the smuggling division. Allowing weapons, art, and other goods to be funneled into Spike's market. Besides that, not much is known about his personal origins. He just up and took residence in the bay district and made his name in attacking the other bosses territories. The Boss took interest and  asked him to join, and just like that he was in. Moving his way up the ladder until he hit Capo status, which is more or less delegated to his advisers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Marsh's powers aren't really known, he can: survive underwater, break down brick walls, survive wildfires, fall off buildings, and even physically hurt Rubbermaid with his shovel! Besides his physical action, he seems to be able to appear mostly anywhere in the district. No where is safe there, only leaving the area does he seem to loose that ability. Is he some robot, a super, or is he just playing an complex game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance wise; Mr.Marsh appears to be dressed as a mortician, one suffering from the effect of time harshly. Many of his article of clothing are moth eaten or perpetually dusty. He carries a shovel, almost as tall as him, which is very tall. But no one can tell his exact body type, is it fat, is it muscular, or is it skeletal?</span></div></div>",

It was a painful procedure, and while she did escape, she never forgave Phineas.

Able to reach over eighty feet tall, but it comes with a twist.The bigger she gets, the more intangible and invisible she becomes. And instead of physically destroying things, Mountain Wind whips up gales to blow her enemies away from her. The second ability is for her to grow to three inches high, which instead makes her super strong and tough. Able to lift over twelve tons in weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance wise; Annabelle dresses like she always did before, tweed jackets and long skirts. Her dark,brown hair done in a bun.

Marcus Evans, the man who would be RocJaw, was involved with an accident on the outskirts of the city. A rival mob boss put a hit on him, which he survived by his use of Polymer-X from Cassandra. Unfortunately, he suffered from a case of \"blown off jaw\". Which he paid back that mob boss dearly for.

His ability is to secrete a  sticky,acid like substance that can go through most minerals and stones. With it, he can either mold it into whatever shape he likes, or turn it into a liquid to pour over something. Waiting for the stone to harden again. He can also stick stone to his skin, adding extra protection against something.

Before he disappeared to the shadows, these were like the figureheads of The Boss Mob. All the others either delegated to them, like Spike, or actively opposed them, like Cassandra. Out of every Rubbermaid villains, these two beat her the most.That was until more and more of The Boss's crew started to gain powers, and other villains came into the spotlight.With that,they seemed to leave the Mob to The Boss's wife,The Boss actually forcing them to give her control,and started their own business. Which many of the Boss's personal thought of as betrayal, and now actively harrow the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What many people don't know is that Fric and Frac actually are two imps from some hellish plane. Tricking The Boss into hiring them for his plans, which also drove him slowly into the shadows. Him breaking free of them, and the backing of powerful Capos, caused them to retreat. Now instead of committing high-end crimes, which they still do, they spend their days messing with Rhonda and the others. Pissing them all off at the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Frac</b><br>\r\nA large, brute of an Imp, Frac isn't some dumb buffoon. He is the one that mostly make out the initial plans for the duo. He just doesn't have the patience to see them through, nor the \"on the toes thinking\" that Fric does. He also starts arguing with her for the most obtuse of reasons, but does it at appropriate times. Frac enjoys making fun of his targets, than actually making sure they're permanently done in. Which causes Fric no end in anger. He focuses on when Rhonda:expands,turns into edibles, or comfort appliances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis normal form is a large, Caucasian, man. A flat cap, suspenders, and a cigar are always at his mouth. His imp form isn't that different, if one ignored the red skin, short horns, and tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fric</b><br>\r\nThe constant partner with Frac, Fric isn't the planner for the group. She can think quicker in situations than Frac, but when forced to sit down and plan, she fails. She is mostly the voice of reason to the pair, which isn't saying much. She argues with Frac for pretty obvious reasons, but does it at inappropriate times. Fric see her transformations as an artist does his art, which also means she doesn't jab at them much. Instead doing little skits of comedy with Frac, which may allow her target to escape. She focuses on Rhonda: turning into art pieces, practical appliances, or monuments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer normal form <i>was</i> a skinny,red-hair,Caucasian male.She wore in that form, of all things, a \"Zoot Suit\".It ,thankfully, had enough ambiguous,androgyny that she could easily slip into a more feminine persona. Her Imp form resembles her normal form, if one ignores the single horn on her, the small bat wings, and the goat hooves.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
