Standing a solid 6' and at a weight of 170 he had hardly an ounce of fat on him from years of being an athlete and competing. He had gotten the job at Camp Willix as a way to save up some fast money as it payed better then his current job, but unknown to him this camp would soon be so much more to him then a summer job.<br>\r\nMatt exited his car softly as he surveyed his surroundings. The large, wooden lodge that smelled of pine and chimney smoke stood in front of him like a giant beacon. He leaned against his red truck as he took a moment to clock his surroundings.<br>\r\nThe lake lay to the left, twinking brilliantly as it was nestled between the hills like a mysterious jewel being hugged by the very earth in which it sat. He breathed in the fresh air that smelled of flowers and birch trees and grabbed his bag heading inside the large doors. The inside was just as impressive as the outside with a large  wooden roof. There were many tables here all large with heavy duty benches on each side. They looked as if they could stop tanks if they had to. <br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Matt called out. Finding no answer he placed his duffel bag down on the ground and turned around to head back outside.<br>\r\n\"WHy hello! You must be Matt.\" A friendly voice called from behind him. Matt turned around to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mr. Godfrey extended his large, beefy hand and shook Matt's strong but slender one. His frame was large with a belly that protruded a good few feet in front of him. His arms were strong and muscled however and almost crushed Matts hand.<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you sir.\" Matt said suppressing a yelp.  <br>\r\nMt. Godfrey did a deep belly laugh which caused his entire belly to jiggle uncontrollably. Matt found himself strangely entranced by its jiggling and watched for a few seconds before he caught himself staring. He blushed after realising that Mr. Godfrey had caught him looking. <br>\r\n\"You can call me Ken here.\" He said with a smile. <br>\r\n\"Hey boss! We're all done with cabins.\" Came a voice from the door.<br>\r\n\"Ah Russ! Just in time to meet the newbie.\" Ken said ushering the man towards them. Matt watched as a very attractive man came running up towards them. He had blue eyes that seemed to perfectly center his face. His short black hair was spiked up making him look even taller then he was. He looked as if he had just stepped off the cover of a sports magazine. \"Russ meet Matt.\" he said with a half smile. \"I have some business to attend to so I'll leave you to take care of him, alright Russ.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" he said enthusiastically picking up Matt's bag, and with that they exited the lodge. <br>\r\n\"So where should we go first?\" he asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'd like to see where I'm sleeping first.\" Matt said. Russ flashed him one of his gorgeous smiles as he lead Matt through a path to a cabin. Unlike the lodge which could have doubled as a fortress this house seemed more cozy and homey. <br>\r\n\"It looks rather pleasant.\" Matt said with a smile. \"Do you know who my bunkmate is?\"<br>\r\n\"That would be me actually?\" Russ said with a smile carrying his bag inside. Matt froze for a moment as a smile spread across his face as a million devious thoughts rolled across his mind. After a second he quickly pushed the thoughts from his head. Besides for all he knew Russ was straight.<br>\r\nThe inside of the cabin was much larger then it appeared and only had four beds. He took a seat on one feeling its soft blankets caress his butt. He looked over to the bedside table and saw a picture of a thin man fishing. Thinking nothing of it he then noticed something and pulled the picture towards him for a closer look.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Russ asked.<br>\r\n\"This man. I swear I've seen him before.\" He said nonchalantly. <br>\r\n\"I hope you have. Thats Ken six months ago.\"<br>\r\n\"THATS KEN?\" Matt could hardly speak. The man looked to be literally half the size of Ken had been. He could not have been more then 150, tops. His arms were comparable to the fishing pole he had in his arms. \"What happened? theres no way a man could gain that much weight in so short a time.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know to be honest. It's quite the mystery.\" Matt put the picture back on the bedside table and got back up. \"You know what Russ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I haven't eatten anything all day.\" <br>\r\n\"Sure thing man.\" Russ said with a smile. \"Just give me a second to get my boots and I'll join you.\"<br>\r\nThey left the cabin and made their way back to the lodge. The kitchen was actually a mess hall located on the other side of the building but was just as massive. They entered and saw a thin man playing cards on one of the tables. <br>\r\n\"Hey Tim! Come meet the newbie!\" Russ called out. <br>\r\nThe man pulled his head up and waved towards them. \"Tim, this is Matt.\"<br>\r\nMatt extended his hand, which was still sore from Ken's over zealous shake earlier but luckily Tim's grip was not as strong. Tim was as tall with a bald head and brown eyes. \"Pleased to meet you. My you're a thin one aren't you?\" he said giving Matt the once over. \"You guys go over there and sit for a minute, I'll bring you both out something ok?\"<br>\r\n\"sounds good.\" <br>\r\nThey made their way to a table nestled in the corner of the hall and waited patiently for their meals creating small chit chat of a various nature.

The smell of cinammon, meat and exotic spices floated to his nose immidiately setting his stomach grumbling. It was this moment when Matt realised just how hungry he was. It had been hours since he last ate. <br>\r\n\"You look hungry.\" Russ said with a smile as Matt realised that a small trickle of drool was leaking from the side of his mouth. Matt blushed a little and looked up into Tims twinkling eyes. <br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" He said with a smile. \"I can always get more if its not enough.\"<br>\r\nMatt laughed a little. \"I think that this is more then enough.\" <br>\r\n\"Dig in.\" Russ said with a smile. Matt didn't have to be asked twice. Grabbing an oversized sticky bun he sunk his teeth into the soft, warm crust, feeling it melt in his mouth. Before he had even finished his first bite he took another, and another, and before he knew it the entire bun was gone. Hungry for more he grabbed a chicken wing, deep fried in a delicious batter crust and almost immidiately finished it. After that he found some cookies, then a salami sandwich topped with cheese and lettuce before and before long there was nothing left to eat. Matt looked over at Russ with a sruprised look. \"We finished all that?\" he asked with a slight laugh.<br>\r\nRuss smiled at him. \"We didn't, you did.\" <br>\r\nMatt looked at him surprised before looking down at his stomach to find it was...</span></div></div>",

He rubbed his hand over the new curve and looked to Russ. <br>\r\n\"You actually mean to say I ate all of that?\" Matt asked incredulously. <br>\r\n\"I think you're belly right there proves it.\" He said with a devious smile. Matt lifted his shirt and saw his gut poking out over his jeans. to relieve some tension he unbuckled the top button which almost shot off. His stomach felt sore and stiff from the large meal he had just eatten. \"You have been eatting for a half hour.\"<br>\r\n\"I ate all of that in a half hour?\" He asked. He was shocked, for it seemed as if it had been over almost as soon as it began. <br>\r\n\"YEah you did. No worries though. would you like me to show you the rest of the camp now?\" Russ got up and offered Matt one of his rough yet strong hands. Grateful Matt accepted and heaved himself up. Despite the shift, his pants were still fastened tightly to his waist even without his button. Taking a moment to poke the flesh he smiled. <br>\r\n\"Guess I should slow down eh?\" he asked with a bit of a chuckle.<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I think you look good this way. So where should we go first?\"</span></div></div>",

People used to do it here as part of an old Indian tradition.\" <br>\r\n\"Are you sure it's alright to call them Indian?\" Matt began to ask, but as he was about to Russ got up and began to remove his shirt. \"What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious? Invoking the spirits on a nature walk.\" Russ said with a laugh as he removed his pants. \"Are you coming?\" <br>\r\nMatt smiled and got up, removing his pants and shirt until they were both standing there in nothing but their boxers. <br>\r\nThey looked so funny. Matt noticeably bloated, and Russ with his trim figure standing next to him. Matt wondered how it would feel to have Russ worship his swollen belly. He rubbed his belly and felt something like electricity buzz through his body. He began to go hard and immediately stopped rubbing his belly. Luckily Russ didn't notice, or if he did he didn't let on. <br>\r\n\"So are we supposed to do this naked or...?\" Matt asked nervously. <br>\r\n\"We can. Would you enjoy that?

As he rubbed his stomach, a feeling of electricity shot through his body resting directly on his hardening cock. Before he could stop himself he was hard as a rock and showing no signs of softening. <br>\r\nMatt ripped his hands away from his belly in hopes that it would decrease the erotic sensation, but it didn't... Instead Matt was just as hard as before and he could feel his bloated stomach shift up and down as he walked. Luckily Russ, in front of him hadn't noticed yet. The path was surprisingly easy, and despite the protuberance around his stomach, Matt could keep up no problem.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, with his persistent erection, MAtt was begining to loose focus on Russ in front of him, and when Russ bent over to tie his shoe...</span></div></div>",

Matt's face flushed as Russ took his hands and placed them on either side of his distended belly and gave it a rub. <br>\r\n\"Be careful with that thing.\" He said with a smile.

Shaking his head in disbelief he began to follow Russ who was running and laughing as he entered the forest. Matt couldn't help but laugh too. The feeling was contagious and soon the two of them were running through the forest... well Matt was waddling, but the intent to enjoy themselves was there. After walking a little ways, Russ began to pick some nuts and berries and gave them to Matt. Matt was surprised by the amount of food around in the forest. <br>\r\n\"It's very fertile land.\" Russ said. \"some say too much so. Some of the best nuts and berries grow here. Some grow here and no where else.\" <br>\r\nMatt was fascinated as the two of them talked. Not so much by the foliage, but more so by Russ and his naked body. So toned, so tasty, so amazingly sculpted. He was sure that Russ had caught him looking more then once, but for some reason he just kept giving Matt berries and nuts and talking about the forest. Some of it was interesting. Talking about ancient curses, the tribal customs, magical imps and the mystic fat berries, so called because they grew large and red. <br>\r\n\"Sound tasty.\" <br>\r\n\"Well you tell me. You've ate more then a couple of them.\" Russ said with a laugh placing one hand on Matt's belly. <br>\r\n\"Really? Huh, they taste good.\" <br>\r\n\"That's just the beginning... You should see what else they have in the forest. There's a shrine not too far from here I can take you too... Or if you need a break we can always go to the lake.\" </span></div></div>",

Well, let's head up the hill here.\"<br>\r\nThey walk up the hill and Russ seems to have chosen a more agressive path. Mat has to walk harder and his steps are taller. Some of his steps even push his legs against his swollen belly, which is very uncomfortable. Quickly, they have to stop, and almost no sooner does Matt think that then there's a clearing up ahead.

He considers asking Russ what he's doing, or telling him to stop, but the feeling is profoundly relaxing. Matt lays down in the clearing and Russ moves closer, massaging now with both hands. The closeness doesn't bother Matt, which surprises him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt only realizes time has passed when it's suddenly sunset and they're still laying there. The boys...</span></div></div>",

Matt saw him for only a second before he hit the water, and then his glistening chest rose out of it again. While wet, every curve and muscle glistened and seemed even more impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was suddenly hesitant, but Russ sensed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in.

They've gained 10 pounds a piece, and it shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the shore, drying off, they take a moment to examine themselves. Two days damage has now had a week to speed up, and it's beginning to show. The slight changes of the past are becoming more present. The padding, once slight hint of softening over ripped muscles, is now nearly disguising them. Matt's clothes, that he actually wears, are tighter. And his stuffed belly pushes down on his shorts, reshaping the whole waist line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuss is no different. Though he started later, his desires on Matt turned out to be smaller than his own appetite. Russ is the same size as Matt, but looks bigger by the clothing he wears. Russ has always worn form-fitting clothing, but now that his form has changed it's not just fitting anymore, it's tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Matt can't get enough of the air on his belly, Russ prefers the feeling of tight clothes. On his growing and stuffed bellly, his shirt highlights every ounce and gives it form, like being touched everywhere at the same time. Russ's shorts are constantly strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the cabin, there's a note from the lead camp counselor.</span></div></div>",

Another week later, 10 lbs is put to shame by 15 more, and their muscles aren't so much disguised anymore as disappeared. Real bellies are forming on both men, round and hard after eating, and a little bit rounder and softer each time inbetween. Their stomach capacities are growing too. Between the two of their influence, the other is rarely allowed hunger. They stuff each other more and more, and leave the cabin less and less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the camp, things are changing too. While the campers were delayed, the food that was to feed them was not, and the camp counselors are pressured to eat.

He massaged it for a few moments completely forgetting that Russ had even been there. Matt simply gazed transfixed into his own belly and began to explore all of his body. He turned his head around and could see that his butt had also grown slightly, almost filling his jeans. He reached one hand to his chest and also found a new softness where there once had been a flat and hard chest. Suddenyly Matt could feel something stirring below his crotch and immidiately stopped feeling himself. A slight sweat broke on his forehead as he became nervous as to what this could mean. He had spent so long trying his hardest to become a \"rock hard god of a man\" and now he found himself with a belly... and liking it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt felt felt his entire body drain quake for a second or two, jiggling his new stomache. The cave around him began to twist and blur like a painting that had a cup of water poured on it. The colors drained away until he was in a sea of vast white emptiness. Matt's heart raced in wonder. In confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was Russ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWTF?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon new colors replaced the old, coming as fast as the others had left. The swirls and blobs organized themselves to reveal somthing Matt might call a Greek temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassive pillars towered over a grand foyer, holding up an intricatley painted battle scene on the ceiling. On one side, a group of apparent poets and artisians casting stones at their opponets, well muscled Demons and Serpentmen. The colors were vibrant and rich. Matt could see the pink flush of the tallest, roundest poet's cheeks and the fiery red of the largest Demon's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExotic and beatiful sculptures lined the walls depicting eveything from mothers cooing over babys to a man burning in fire with a gleeful look upon his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Matt noticed however, was the long table in the center, surounded by intricately carved chairs lined with plush, silk pillows. Upon the tables there were bowls and plates overflowing with foods. Towers of steak, mountains of mashed potatoes, rivers of gravy, feilds of pie, and plate upon plate of every kind of sweet Matt could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt hesitated but continued to stare at the food. His body seemed to be suddenly wrapped in hunger. His mouth watered. It seemed so silly to not explore, to not find some one. To find some sanity in this crazy dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Matt was saved from having to make a choice by a stranger, clearing his throat to get Matt's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt whirled around in surprise to find three very handsome young men, bowing to him. All three were georeous in their own right. The one to the left had vivid green eyes, blonde hair and a perfect white smile. His lack of shirt revealed a six pack and hairless chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one to the right was thinner but still athletically built. He had long black hair held back with in a pony tail and and fair, flawless skin. He had small glasses that made him look intelligent and inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle prevented Matt from not smiling. He had messy brown hair and a rugged stubble. His eyes were a deep blue that bore into Matt's own. Matt tried not to blink so he could continue to look into them for as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle man spoke first, \"Hello, brother! You caught us just in time for lunch!\". He beamed at Matt and grabbed his arm, placing him in the largest, widest chair. All three men grabbed a dish and placed it in front of a very confused Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion, however, melted away at the smell of mashed potatoes and roast beef. As if in a dream that hardly made sense, Matt picked up a fork and dug into the pile of food before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt moaned in ecstasy at the first bite and quickly shoved another into his mouth before he swallowed the first. The food filled Matt with warmth and comfort. The flavors made him feel alive and vivified. All curiosity about these three strangers and where he was could wait. Right now, he was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him wondered if he should offer some of the food to these men but they seemed so pleased and fasinated to watch Matt eat. When Matt finished one plate one of them would eagarly rush to the end of the table and select another saying, \"Next! Eat this one next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was shocking himself with how much food he was putting away. Eight steaks, two bowls of potatoes, three bowls of rice, two pies, sixteen cookies, and  half a bowl of pudding all built pressure up in Matt's pants but these strangers still begged him to eat more and Matt couldn't think of anything more he wanted to do that please the beatiful men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally threw back in his chair and moaned with pleasure the men didn't protest. They simply beamed at him. They breather heavily and were sweating as though they had just expeirienced nothing short of a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality began to drift back into Matt long enough for him to look down at his belly and see....</span></div></div>",

It wont get any smaller but you can keep it that size if you work on it every day like I told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour little asshole was stopping you up and it looks like your going to need regular probings to keep you from getting all stopped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was so depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere take this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor gave Matt a pill and said take this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a sedative you are a bit worked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt realized he was a bit worked up and took the pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost two days later when he woke up and his body was much more filled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic Matt jumped up and missed his breakfast all together. He ran or rather walked to the workout building and started to work out all day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking on his ass and his abs and his arms and legs but it was a week before he realized that he had been neglecting his pecs and they were now getting quite flabby.

It was hard to explain. <br>\r\nHe brushed it off, pulling himself out of bed which seemed to take much more energy today. His eyes, still groggy had not opened completely yet. With a yawn, he got up, pulling himself off the bed and walking to the door to get a chance to head to the bathroom. He walked over to the doorstand to grab his robe when he passed by a mirror. for the first time, he realized something was tremendously wrong. <br>\r\nHe backed up looking at himself in the mirror.

Matt was shocked at first, but now came to his senses and realized who he now was. Russ was now kissing Matt up from his stomach to his neck very slowly. As this was happening, Matt looked in the mirror and saw himself getting larger, and larger, and larger. He was so big that only a few inches of his tall legs were visible from under the chubby fat and he could no longer move. Russ, now out of his clothes, was on top of Matt which for Russ, was like a giant, soft mattress. Russ was spread out like he was making a snow angel face down on top of the now, super chubby obese Matt. \"It's gonna be alright now Matt...I'll take good care of you....\" Matt's eyes closed, he now felt like his huge 86 inch wide spread belly was being covered in something...something that made his stomach growl and vibrate. \"I'll cover you in chocolate and lick off every single drop of it...\" said Russ holding a paint roller with a big bucket of chocolate. The paint roller being rolled on Matt made him so horny that he made moaning sounds. He moved his super chubby face toward the mirror which had chocolate splatters on it and saw he was growing bigger again! \"I'll make you the biggest man ever in this camp...which is not called Camp Willix...more rather Camp Superchub.\" The small bathroom with faux wood walls they were in now was too small for Matt's now extremely fat belly. The walls broke and yet he continued to expand and grow. Russ was still painting chocolate on him and he was still lying on top of him with his eyes closed. Russ was now about 1/4 the size of Matt and slowly began to sink down within Matt's belly. However, out of nowhere, Russ began to gain a superchubby belly as well. The cabin was too small for Matt's fat body and it broke. They were now outside in the dark with nothing but a single light illuminating this event of amazement. Matt's arms were not visible anymore and you could only see his gigantic chubby hands sticking out. He was growing so large, so fast, yet he was so horny that he only felt pleasure out of this slow but welcomed transformation. Other campers came to Matt and climbed onto him and Russ. Suddenly, Mat heard a buzzing, it was his alarm and he was lying in bed..he was sweating and a bulge was coming from his sheets. He looked under his covers to see that his belly...  </span></div></div>",

The numbers zoomed by in the little display and finally stopped at the number 453 lbs. \"What! How is this possible!\" A voice came from behind him in a devilishly calm voice. \"It is possible...anything is possible here in this camp Matt. I drugged you last night and force fed you eclairs and cinnamon buns until your belly was an acceptable size,\" said Russ. Matt felt a shot of eroticism through him as Russ grabbed out of a closet what appeared to be a metal drum with a hose running out of it. \"Lay down and open your mouth...it''ll only take seconds before you feel amazing...\" Chills ran down <br>\r\nMatt and he moved slowly over to the bed and layed down with a thump. His belly jiggled with every movement and he loved every moment of it. Russ crammed the tube into Matt's mouth and sealed it so nothing would be lost and it'd all go down into Matt's big, beautiful, chubby belly. Russ also tied each of Matt's four limbs to the bed posts and Matt ended up be stretched so Russ could see everything. \"I'm going to fill you with a special pudding that enables the body to gain beyond any thinkable limit...your going to be the biggest man in the world Matt....and your going to love it...\" As Russ was saying this, he was rubbing Matt's belly almost uncontrollably. Without haste, Russ turned the valve and Matt's body began to fill with the special pudding. At first, nothing really happened, but then it became noticeable that his belly was getting bigger, and quickly too. Soon, his legs began to inflate, then his arms, and even his face began to get more chubby. Russ got a position on top of Matt and rose as Matt's belly rose as it filled up with pudding. Matt's body was gaining weight in every spot thinkable, soon his arms were growing so big that they weren't visible, not even his hands! His legs had vanished and been overtaken by his continually growing belly. Russ turned off the valve from on top of Matt's belly which was incredibly soft but still about 3 feet high. <br>\r\nRuss was stroking the belly and pushing on it slowly. Matt got incredible pleasure out of this and asked Russ to turn the machine back on and this time don't turn it off. He obeyed the lump of fat that was Matt and turned the machine back on. Matt grew faster this time and now his stomach touched the ceiling with Russ still on top of it! <br>\r\nRING! RING! RING! RINNG!

It began to churn and before long a slab of ice cream fell over the side and slapped him in the face. The cool, creamy goodness falling mostly in his mouth but drizzling down his chins and cheeks as well. The next items fell, and he felt a pizza hit him just in time to pull it off as a collection of fries showered down on him.<br>\r\nHelpless to escape, helpless to move, he was forced to eat everything that fell.

Matt, sitting in his chair, just mezmorized by the growth on him. \"W...why do this to me? Why make me huge like this!\" said Matt with an angry but not loud voice. \"Because you'll grow to love it...and after all this is a camp of fat kids, so we want them to feel good about themselves by seeing you,\" said Ken. Matt thought it sounded like they wanted him bigger than he already was, and why would he love this? \"Trust me Matt you'll love having a big beer belly like me...it's heaven!\" Matt's shirt rode up a little and you could see his belly button.

The fish ate it, but this time, he ate it right off the hook and returned to his former position. Amused, Matt laughed and reeled the pole in one more time and placed another worm on the hook.

Matt had decided to not tell Russ about his encounter with the talking fish, the main reason being that Matt could hardly believe it himself. Fish don't talk, simple as that. Though, somewhere in the back of his head, Matt remembers a rhyme he learned when he was young. \"How did it go again?\" Matt said to himself. \"If fishes were wishes I wish I could be... Damn, can't remember the rest.\" it was something silly, and meant to entertain kids in kindergarten or something, but he felt that it applied to this situation. \"Wait wait, i'm thinking about a talking fish, there's no way that could have happened. Whatever, Russ probably put something in the sandwiches.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt makes a point to avoid Russ throughout the rest of the day, the only time he had to really talk to him, was at the mess hall for dinner, there were only a few other counselors there, notably, everyone was male. But Russ and Matt only made small talk before going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMat had finally drifted off to sleep, trying to convince himself that he wasn't crazy, and that he didn't see what he thinks he saw. But come early morning, when you remember your dreams most, Matt saw the fish in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm disappointed human.\" The fish said to him. Matt tried to reply, but he was unable too. \"I thought you weer different than other,honest and trustworthy, but I see thats not true.\" The fish doesn't sound angry, more remorse and regretful. \"But so you'll always remember your missed opportunity, I'm going to change you, and how you affect people.

A rather odd punishment Matt thought when he woke up but then again, it was a dream after all. And with that he rolled out of bed and padded his way toward the communal showers at the camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter washing up Matt returned to the his bunkhouse, drying off as he began looking for a pair of clothes. No-one else was around and as he looked Matt found that Russ's musky athletic sent was wafting up into his nose as he searched through his suitcase. Visions of Russ's sexy smile and tight body danced through Matt's head for a few moments as some of his more primal urges made themselves known in his nether regions. Without thinking his hand moved automatically to his cock, his fingers feathering it lightly as it began to plump up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked around, knowing instinctively that Russ had likely gone for breakfast. No sense in wasting an opportunity he thought to himself, his hand already lightly griping his rapidly hardening cock. As Matt stroked himself, visions of Russ flitting through his head, Matt began to notice the soft bit of sleek blubber that had accumulated around his love handles and stomach had started to shake. With each stroke the soft fat seemed to quiver and move sluggishly to the beat of Matt's steady rhythm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was certainly a new development Matt thought momentarily, before another wave of pleasure washed through his body, banishing the thought. Again visions of Russ filled his mind, Matt's body taut and strained as he edged closer and closer to the point of no return. But then there it was again. The soft fat was remarkably distracting and the distraction seemed to get more and more pronounced as time went on. In fact he was almost certain that what had begun as an insignificant quiver had graduated to something far more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling somewhat ponderous over this new situation, his free hand drifted up his body and moved towards his stomach, surprising him when it made contact much sooner than he had expected. Shocked he looked down and saw a soft wobbling spare tire replacing what was formerly just a slightly flabby tummy. Matt was entranced the moment he saw it. His fingers gently squeezing and probing his new soft blubber, as his cock surged. Matt was lost in the pleasure, his hand coming down for one last stroke. As he completed the motion, his soft belly suddenly expanded in his hands, suffocating his probing fingers in hot flab. Matt couldn't handle it anymore, and his cock exploded all over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt lay there for a few minutes, his mind trying to comprehend what had happened to him. He slowly climbed off the bed and wandered over to the mirror. He was shocked at the reflection in front of him. Staring back at him in the mirror was a plump soft belly that jiggled slightly as he moved. It sort of just hung off of his body. A nice loose pillow of flab. That wasn't all though. His chest seemed fuller now and his nipples slightly plumper. In fact they seemed to shake a little as well. Matt was shocked, unable to process the situation. I mean the fish was real???? WTF?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck am I gonna do?\" he said out loud to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt funny on him now... tighter then usual. returning to the mirror, he examined how it fit and was disturbed by what he saw. It was tighter showing a soft and gentle chest that sloped out ever so slightly. His belly now looked as if he was hiding a small balloon under his shirt, and the shirt that was once loose now couldn't quite meet the hem of his jeans. Examining the damage in the mirror he began to rub his stomach. It felt odd. Like his entire belly had turned into a giant water balloon. He picked it up in his hands and dropped it, feeling it shake and quiver as he did so. There was something so odd about the feeling. It was incredible and terrifying at the same time. He tried to suck it in, but it didn't do a lot of good. His belly was just a sack of jelly now hanging loosely on his frame. <br>\r\nLifting up his shirt he began to push it back and forth and was shocked by how easily his weight shifted around now. It was such a strange feeling... alien and somehow... arousing. <br>\r\nHe didn't realize it, but somehow durring the time he was playing with his belly, he had become aroused. Very achingly so. Odd. He hadn't even been playing with it... He kept rubbing his stomach and quickly realized that the pleasure he was feeling was directly connected to the feeling on his stomach... It was incredible like lightning striking him as he touched it... He quickly found himself in a lustful trance as he rubbed, feeling the softness, the shape how easily it moved around... </span></div></div>",

He was becoming very aroused over nothing... He had to go and find that fish, and he had to find it now! Grabbing his jacket, he tried to put it on, but as he whipped out the door, he ran into Russ and knocked them both over. <br>\r\n\"Watch where you're going Tiger.\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Matt blushed looking down on Russ. As he started to get off Russ, he soon found himself unable to, as Russ began to play with his softer stomach. <br>\r\n\"You look ... different.\" Russ said smiling slightly. <br>\r\n\"I... I need to...\" <br>\r\n\"You need to not talk so much.\" Russ said as he slowly got out from under Matt and stood up. Russ stripped off his sweaty shirt and Matt was transfixed by the display of man in front of him. Despite trying, his erection was not going anywhere and was quickly becoming more and more insistent. <br>\r\n\"I'm just about to head for a shower? Want to come with me? We can go to the gym, or grab something to eat... could be fun!\" Russ said with a cheeky smile on his lips.

He rubbed his stomach and soon felt himself being filled with more and more pleasure, coursing through his body like a snake. The feeling began from inside, but soon he was too hot and horny to even realize what was going on. <br>\r\nTo a mix of confusion and pleasure he came all over the mirror, despite the fact that he had got off just minutes earlier. There was something so intensely sexually pleasing about his stomach that it had taken control of him. <br>\r\nSuddenly, his shirt which before had fit snug became tight as it was pushed up by his protruding stomach. His chest pushed out, stretching the fabric against his now semi sizable breasts. His belly pushed out forming a wide arch with a deep belly button situated in the center. The shirt now lifted up by a good inch exposing a thick tire of fat that hung over the tops of his now too tight jeans in the form of  burgeoning love handles. <br>\r\nEven his face looked different, thicker somehow... He looked closely and quickly realized he was getting the start of a significant double chin. Matt began panicking and quickly tried to button the pants, but was finding it incredibly difficult. leaving them unbuttoned, he ran out of the cabin... <br>\r\nrunning was strange. His entire body shook violently as he did, and the way his legs chaffed together was incredibly uncomfortable. His jeans threatened to pop off and his shirt was riding up with every step he took. He hoped no one could see him, but couldn't really care at the moment. He ran to the end of the dock and began yelling at the water. <br>\r\n\"Where are you? What did you do?\" </span></div></div>",

Matt felt his face flush with embarrassment as he turned to face Russ feeling his gut wobble slightly as he did so. As he turned he could see the look of shock appear on Russ's face. Gone was the trim fit young guy who had first appeared at the camp, and in his place was a much plumper young guy with full rippling rolls and a soft set of growing tits. He looked like he had spent his life in front of the TV munching on snacks rather than outdoors playing sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you man?\" Russ said with something approaching awe in his voice, his hand reaching out almost unconsciously to assess Matt's body gently caressing the soft sack of blubber Matt now had hanging in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno man.. \" Matt said with despair in his voice. \"I had this weird dream about a fish cursing me to gain weight every time I get off... and then this happens when I wake up and well... you know\" Matt says while making a pumping motion near his crotch. He realized at this point Russ's hand still hasn't left his belly, instead his hand had slipped underneath the tight shirt, his fingers curling around the soft thick spare tire orbiting Matt's waist. Despite just getting off twice Matt feels some remote sexual stirrings in his crotch as Russ does this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you gain weight every time you get off now?\" Russ says with a grin stepping a little closer to Matt, closing the distance between them, his other hand moving up to cup one of Matt's tits. Matt inhaled sharply when he did this, feeling a burst of please rush through him. His chest had never been this sensitive before he thought, as he felt Russ's warm hand gently massage the pliable fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. I guess so.. unless I find that stupid fish..\" Matt said distractedly, enjoying the sensual attention Russ was showing him. As he did though, he felt a familiar tingling sensation moving through his body and ever so slightly he felt the hem of his shirt edge upwards as his fattened body threatened to expand. Man.. it's like I can't even get turned on Matt thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to know Matt\" Russ says again with a smile. \"That weight looks pretty sexy on you by the way... you should definitely think about keeping it\" And with that he walked off towards the main buildings leaving Matt standing there pondering what had just occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Matt do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a quick stare that confirmed they were both thinking the same thing, Russ smiled back and dropped his bag on the front porch and made a break towards the lake. Matt followed suit and quickly tailed him. Both were laughing as they made it to the sandy beach. <br>\r\n\"Think you can find it from here?\" Russ said with a laugh.<br>\r\n\"Man this lake is beautiful.\" Matt said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Yeah it really is. It was actually made by an asteroid god only knows how long ago.\"<br>\r\n\"Cool. I'll add that to my useless knowledge pile.\" Matt quipped. With that Matt removed his shirt revealing his tight six pack and perfect pecks. His skin was tanned and Russ caught himself staring at him, a fact that was not lost on Russ.<br>\r\n\"Hey perhaps later you could let me know how to pitch a tent.\" Matt said with a smile. Russ turned around in embarassment and heard the sounds of splashing behind him. \"wow this lake gets deep quick. You coming in buddy?\" he chuckled. Russ hesitated for a moment and pulled off his shirt revealing a soft midsection that hung a little over his belt. His chest was less then firm and sagged a little and he looked to weight quite a bit more without the tshirt. <br>\r\nHe made his way slowly and carefully into the lake and Matt watched as his soft flesh gently shook with each step. He was oddly intriuged at the sight of him and smiled as he dived in beside him splashing him with the cool crystal water.<br>\r\n\"You look good man.\" Russ said with a coy voice.</span></div></div>",

Since your in such good shape, it's easy to keep up with him. When you get to the rock, Russ is winded a bit, and stops to take a rest. The rock is very large, it could probably fit a small house on it. And from the look of it, it goes down all the way to the bottom of the lake. After a few minuets, Russ is ready to go. <br>\r\n\"Stick close to me. we're going under water.\" Russ instructed.<br>\r\nHe dives down and you take a big breath and follow. The water is rather murky, so you can't see to far ahead. Just far enough to see Russ slightly tubby legs infront of you, and the very long rock from the surface next to you. For about 15 seconds you swim underwater, until you come to a large hole in the rock.<br>\r\nRuss motions to go in, then swims inside. You're a little hesitant. Your lungs are getting hungry for air, and there might not be any in there. After a split second, you dive into the hole. Almost immediatly, you surface! The hole led to an air pocket inside. You look around and see a large patch of land next to the cave wall. You shiver as you get out, the air is really cold in there.  Theres another opening in the cave and seeing that Russ isn't there, this must be the way he went. You follow it for a few minuets, when you hear him calling you.

How?\" You say a little nervously.<br>\r\n\"It's cursed to make you gain weight.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You're having difficulty deciding if he's nuts, or telling the truth.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I didn't know it was cused when I found it, so I took a huge handfull. I immediatly became fat. One pound for every coin I took actually.\"<br>\r\n\"So why arent you that fat anymore?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"I put the gold back. The cure for the curse is to simply put the gold back. But you don't change back right away. It takes about as long as it would to exersice it of. I took some gold, made me fat, and a year later, I'm almost back to normal.\"<br>\r\n\"So if I took some gold, I would automatically become fat?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

He dove under the water, following Russ as best as he could, but as they swam through the narrow channel, Matt could feel a weird tingle around his butt as he kicked. He could feel his skin start to loosen as if he was wearing a jacket. He felt bloated and slightly dizzy.   He watched as Russ surfaced and quickly followed. HE breathed a sigh of relief as he breathed in the night air. He must've been out longer then he thought. Matt found himself out of breath for some reason. Swimming had never been so strenuous before. <br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" Russ asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Matt answered quickly. \"What should we do?\" <br>\r\n\"Here, swim to shore. Don't worry, it took me a while to gain fully. You should be fine for a while.\" <br>\r\nMatt nodded and followed Russ to the shore. He could swear he felt something slither past his leg as he began to swim for shore, but brushed it off as probably being a piece of sea weed. <br>\r\nAs the aproached the beach, Matt found himself completely exhausted. Russ and him lay on the beach in the dark. It was warm out tonight and on the comfort of the beach Matt found himself growing weary. Soon the night faded away and he was asleep. <br>\r\nWhen he awoke the sun was just peaking above the hills in the distance. The sounds of birds chirping filled the air.

Somthing didn't feel right, other then the huge bruse on his head. He looked around and saw that Russ was either asleep or unconcious on the floor. He also saw that when he fell, his hand fell to lay on the coins!! He quickly jerked his hand back, but he already knew it was too late. He looked down and saw that his stomach bulged out from his body. His chest was softer, but looked pretty much unchanged. He fingered his face and found it was rounder, and he felt a slight double chin. his arms and legs still had thier muscular look. His butt though, was fleshier and softer. His shorts were tighter and the button threatend to pop. He also noticed that his body was harier. Russ never mentiond that. His stomach had some fur over it that crept to over his belly button, and his chest had hair sprinkled over it. Even though he shaved that mourning, his face had thick stubble over it. His arms and legs were hairer too. He looked like a collage student with a beer gut. He fingered it and saw that even though it looked firm, it was pretty soft. He walked over to Russ and saw that he didn't have any bruses, so he assumed he was asleep. After resting for a minuet, he decided to... </span></div></div>",

Now suddenly an idea sparked and he eyed the gold pieces again. Russ appeared to be unconcious and Matt figured that he could get away with a bit more weight. Matt dug into the pile again and lifted up aproximately thirty coins. The change was immidiate. His chest burst into a pair of soft heavy cones that matched his growing belly. His belly began to sag and stretch his shorts to their limit. He could hear a rip in the back as his butt grew to a much wider size. His face puffed up giving him an odd feeling as a double chin formed slightly below his chin. His arms and legs puffed up slightly giving him a less toned look. His fingers started to look like thin hot dogs and seemed stubbier somehow. His gut shook violently as it grew at a rapid pace becoming softer and softer with each additional inch. He became dizzy and had to sit down which immidiately caused his shirt to ride up revealing a thick gut which now settled around his middle like a fleshy rubber tube. Suddenly spurts of hair began to fill in on his belly. His belly button, once shallow, was now a deep sunken cave with a trailer that led down to his bulging shorts that could hardly contain his girth. He felt an itch appear on his chest, belly, legs, arms, and especially on his face. It was at this moment Matt got a wicked idea. He could place the coins on Russ and he'd never know. Two cursed victims for the price of one, or he could just get them both out of here... Matt weighed his options carefully.</span></div></div>",

Matt was easily much bigger then Russ was, but that didn't matter at this moment. With every step their bellies shook like jelly.

He quickly tires out and stops at a bench along the trail to catch his breath and examine his gift. The small jar, about 12oz, is unlabeled but does appear to be honey colored. Matt looks around to see if anybody is near then carefully unscrews the lid. With the final twist, a sudden overwhelming burst of aroma overtakes Matt as he lifts the lid off. The aroma wraps around Matt spurring a ravaging hunger. Matt takes a scoop of the jam with his hand an licks it ravenously from his fingers. This spurs another uncontrollable rush of hunger prompting another handful of jam. Five handfuls later there is conversation heard coming up the trail. Matt suddenly snaps back to reality, slamming the lid on the now half-empty jar, and jumps behind a nearby tree. Coming around the bend is Ken, the camp leader and the cook. They appear to be arguing.<br>\r\n\"What a fine young boy, the Matt is. I'm sure he'll enjoy his stay at the camp.\" Says Ken.<br>\r\n\"Zat iz if Ee can feet into 'is cabin after one week\" The cook says with a laugh.<br>\r\n\"That boy is not like the others,\" Ken says, \"this camp needs a strong athletic type to lead the others and that is just what he will do. Now you best not spread your influence on him.\"<br>\r\nAngerliy the cook exclaims \"I have alvays provided vonderful dishez for ze children, 'ow dare you accuse ME of ze children's bad 'abits\". <br>\r\nWith that the cook storms back up the trail towards the kitchen leaving Ken alone with his thoughts. <br>\r\n\"This place is falling apart at the seams... literally\" sighs Ken as he turns back towards the main office. <br>\r\nMatt realizes he had been holding his breath for some time and takes a deep breath. What had he just heard? Where are the other camp councilors? And why was the cook so defensive? Matt ponders these questions as he makes his way back to his cabin with hopes of seeing Russ. Before leaving the tree, Matt stashes the jam within the bushes but realizes it is not as easy to bend down. He lifts his shirt to find his once slender waistline is sporting a bit of pudge. <br>\r\n\"How can that be?\" Thinks Matt. \"I know its been awhile since I last looked in the mirror... how interesting\". <br>\r\nWith that, Matt hurries towards his cabin.

Russ quickly jumps up, pulling his shirt down and hiding something behind him in the process. <br>\r\n\"How's it going Matt?\" Asks Russ, almost sheepishly.<br>\r\n\"It's going alright but something seems odd.\" Matt says.<br>\r\n\"What? Huh? Oh. No. It's just your first day, you'll learn to love this place. It's my second year here, you know\" Russ says, sounding better once again. <br>\r\n\"Yeah... that's true. Even still, the only people I've seen are you, Ken, and Tim the cook. Where is everyone else at?\" <br>\r\n\"You actually arrived early, camp doesn't start for another week. This isn't the first time the camp fliers have been misprinted but I'm glad you're here, this place gets lonely until everyone else arrives.\"<br>\r\nMatt tries to hide his blushing and says \"Well mistake or not, its great to be here and keep you company too! Say, what was it you hide behind you there?\" <br>\r\nRuss stumbles again, \"Oh, uh, nothing. Er, a gift actually, from Tim, its nothing.\" <br>\r\nMatt thinks to himself, \"he too received a gift from Tim, something seems funny here.\" <br>\r\n\"Aw, I have a gift myself and its very tasty\" Matt ventures to say.<br>\r\n\"Oh, um. So is mine...\" Russ says. <br>\r\nWith that, Russ pulls from behind him a small jar with about a quarter missing. Matt grins and reaches for the jar.<br>\r\n\"No no no, I'd better hold on to that.\" Stammers Russ. <br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I try a bit\" Asks Matt.<br>\r\nMatt sits beside Russ and takes his hand holding the jar. The two seem to melt together with this quiet touch and cautiously lean in for a kiss. After a quick embrace, Russ slips the lid off the jar releasing the powerful hunger evoking aroma. Matt and Russ quickly gulp down the jar and lay back feeling heavy and satisfied. It does not take them long to notice the thickening layer of fat only slightly lifting up their shirts. Slowly they begin to fall asleep with thoughts of happiness and content. <br>\r\nA while later, a knock at the door awakes Matt and Russ. Matt races for the door as Russ cleans up their mess.

Matt has graduated college two years early and is looking for activities such as this camp to keep him busy and yet allow him to travel before settling into his career. Russ has finished his third year of college and enjoys the peacefulness of the camp, and the hearty pay. This conversation carries them to the mess hall where they find Ken, Tim, and a younger girl chatting at the entrance. <br>\r\n\"You boys are just in time!\" Says Ken. \"Let's plop down for some grub, Tim has made us a light meal\". <br>\r\nMatt noticed a faint look of anger flare within Tim's eyes upon hearing this statement. <br>\r\n\"We're starved.\" Says Russ. <br>\r\nThey enter the mess hall and chit-chat over a meal of salad, chili, and toast. <br>\r\n\"I would like to introduce you two to our camp nurse, Jessica.

We need to review the rules and responsibilities of camp officials.\" <br>\r\nThe meeting lasts into the night, finally adjourning close to 10pm. The group discussed a lot, from responsibilities to activities, from day one to the last day. Despite being such a lengthy meeting, this was only one of many before the other councilors and campers arrived. <br>\r\nMatt and Russ left the mess hall feeling tired and began to make their way back to the cabin.

Matt and Russ each numb from the neck down grow incredibly horny and erotic from this \"miracle\" jam they have been given. Still eating, still growing larger, eating and growing....eating and growing...and then the jar was empty. Matt and Russ both gasping look at each others bellies and smile. Even their limbs looked like chunky, inflated hot dogs. Their faces took on a new look as the cheeks were like big balloons. \"I want to stay like this forever and countinue to grow on top of you Matt!\" said Russ. \"Me too...stay on top of me forever! I want to feel your gigantic belly pressed upon me as long as I live Russ!\" Their bellies were huge beyond thinkable limits...about 640 pounds of jiggly, soft, belly fat were on each of them. Luckily, they were out in the forest where no one would ever find them. However, a figure appeared as if from nowhere. \"I see you have found the jams effects on the human body.\" It was Tim, and he was larger than before, about 300 pounds and chubbiness. \"Do you have more jam for us Tim? We need to get bigger, bigger, bigger!!!\" said Russ. \"Of course I do...I brought you a couple of oil drums filled to the brim with it! But be careful, becuase the effects are quite permanent...but you want this don't you...don't you......\" said Tim in a hypnotic calming voice. \"Yes.....we want the jam...\" Russ and Mike said in harmony. \"Good...\" He had 15 drums of this golden miracle jam connected together with two big tubes that looked as if they could stretch forever. \"Are you ready for me to put these in your mouth and turn it on boys?\"  </span></div></div>",

Their bellies were already super chubby and they were both extremely hard, but the bellies between them kept everything separated except for their heads which were locked in an everlasting kiss. <br>\r\nWithout further ado, Tim turned on the flow of jam on and it flowed into their big, giant, hot, chubby bellies. \"Oh yes! My belly is getting HUGE! I can feel it growing into yours,\" said Russ. \"I can feel mine growing into yours,\" said Matt. They were so horny that they made loud, low groaning sounds. The bellies of both of them were so chubby and soft that it didn't grow up as much as it just expanded outwards and grew up at the same time. They were so gigantic that the belts that gave their bellies what looked like a crevasse, popped off and released their bellies so that they both looked like two blobs on top of each other.  As they got bigger together, their legs and arms just became stuck in one position as they could no longer move them they were so chubby and fat. They now exceeded 1200 lbs but still felt nothing. <br>\r\nThe smell of the jam kept them hungry for more, and in a state of eroticism and pleasure that they no longer cared what happened to them, as long as Matt and Russ were together...it'd always be like this. Once again, they began to rise because the fat could no longer push out sideways and lifted Russ into the sky very slowly. The sound of the fat gaining was like filling a balloon with a constant, steady flow of hot air. Their bellies were still squishy and chubby yet it was like a basketball. \"Oh! OH! Matt! We're huge! We are amazingly fat and still going!\" The jam continued to pour into their mouths and into the bellies of Matt and Russ and showed no sign of stopping anytime soon. \"Russ, let's stay here forever, with this jam, with you...I've never felt so horny in my life! My belly and whole body are massively packed!\" <br>\r\nSuddenly, Russ rolled off of Matt...on purpose. \"I'm sorry Matt, but I've been tricking you.\" Russ came out of what looked like a big balloon filled with...the jam. Russ was still slender and buff, but the effects on Matt were quite real. Matt's belly now expanded faster than before as Russ shoved both the tubes in his mouth. Matt's huge giant chub belly was already about 1700 lbs and now gaining about 2 lbs a second. His whole body jiggled with each struggle; he wanted to move...but no longer was that possible. \"I love you Matt, but I must make you gigantic! It will please us...\" Russ was wearing a body suit the whole time! He tricked Matt into doing this to himself! Matt looked like one big horny marshmallow and now his face (which was already super chubby) was being overtaken by his belly so you could only see about half of it. Matt struggled and tried to turn over on his back, which was like watching a turtle trying to flip over. His belly jiggled and reverberated like ripples on water and suddenly made Russ want to get on Matt. Russ climbed onto Matt's squishy belly, which was now about 18 feet tall and 20 feet wide, and layed on him grasping the squishy flesh and making his body taught. Russ put it inside Matt's giant belly button and started to vibrate. \"I will make you so huge...don't you want to be huge? So big that you'll never have to do anything ever...again? Besides, being big makes you horny does it not? Let the jam fill you up...let it do what it's supposed to do...and let your body expand and grow...as it was always meant to do,\" said Russ with a dreamy, hypnotic voice that made Matt even more hard and made him feel weightless. \"Yes...I want this...I want to be expanded.....I want to be obese... blubbery... plump... fat and huge...\"<br>\r\nMatt was now about 2600 pounds and now couldn't even struggle to move. He was stuck in this position as the jam continued to pack him tight. His arms didnt show anymore, neither his legs, just hands and feet sticking out of a big blob of fat. His face was now almost so overtaken that he soon wouldn't be able to see anymore. \"That's enough!\" Someone came from the distance...and then Matt heard a buzz. It was his alarm and he was in his cabin. He looked under the sheets to find that...         </span></div></div>",

He walked up to the old wooden door and knocked lightly. To his surprise the door swung open by itself and so he let himself in. He stepped and heard a crunching under his foot. Matt lifted his boot to see that he had crushed a cookie. Soon he realised that the entire room was covered in cookie and choclate wrappers. It looked as if an entire party had taken place here and left it looking like a pig sty. What really caught Matt's eye was Luke. He was passed out on a chair in the middle of the cabin. He was shirtless with one hand down his pants. What really caught Matt's eyes was his large swollen stomach. It stretched out as if someone had inflated a basketball under his stomach on an other wise toned and fit body. MAtt was shocked. Could Luke had really eatten all of this food? It wasn't possible. <br>\r\nMatt took another step forwards and called out. <br>\r\n\"Luke?\" <br>\r\nLuke didn't stir. <br>\r\nHe tried a little louder, \"Luke!\" <br>\r\nLuke shifted his arm in his boxers but besides that didn't move a muscle. Matt poked Luke in a attempt to get him to move but Luke again did nothing. Matt marveled at the stomach. It was so big and swollen, it looked painful. He placed one hand on it, it felt tight as a drum. Matt began to rub it, hypnotically and inexplicably drawn to it's shape and feel. After a moment Luke's eyes fluttered. Matt withdrew his hands as Luke began to wake up. He grabbed Matt's arm and looked deep into his eyes. Through strained breath he looked straight at Matt and said \"...Feed me...\" <br>\r\nMatt was astonished that he could even think about food at this point. <br>\r\n\"you can't be serious...\" <br>\r\n\"FEED ME!\" He said insistantly as he squeezed Matt's wrist. <br>\r\n\"Ok!\" Matt took a candy bar from a half opened package on the ground. \"Here...\" Matt said as he handed Luke the choclate bar. Luke shook his head and this time with an almost coy attitude said. \"No, feed me. I want you to feed me.\" <br>\r\nMatt felt Luke's hand cup around his ass as he moved closer to him. Matt took the choclate and fed it to him lowering it gently onto his lips. Luke sucked it up quickly eatting it and even lingering his lips on Matt's skin as he finished the bar. <br>\r\n\"Thanks, you're a lifesaver.\" <br>\r\n\"Aren't you sore?

He walked over to the counter that Luke had pointed to and found a packet of brownies that looked half eatten and carried it back to Luke. Luke slipped his arm around Matt's ass again as he came closer as Matt took a piece of the brownie and fed it to him. Luke devoured it quickly and as soon as he had, Matt had another piece ready for him. The process repeated until the brownies were practically gone. Matt found himself getting excited at this, and from the way Luke began to shift his pants it was clear he was enjoying this too. Suddenly Luke grabbed Matt's crotch with the hand that had been cupped around his butt and stared deep into Matts eyes. Matt felt slightly uncomfortable at first but soon relaxed. \"What do you want Matt?\"</span></div></div>",

They were delicious and Matt was instantly hard as Luke fed him the first one. With one hand on his engorged memeber and the other feeding him cookie after cookie. Matt used his hands to stroke Luke's thick firm belly. It was surprisingly maliable. Matt was in extasy. It was fantastic. More food then he could count and a handsome man feeding him every bite. <br>\r\nAfter the cookies were gone Matt wanted more, but Luke just stood there smiling. <br>\r\n\"Don't you even realise what you just ate?\" <br>\r\n\"A carton of cookies?\" Matt said sweetly playing with Luke's engorged belly. <br>\r\n\"A carton of special cookies.\" Luke said with a smile. \"They were modified.

His belly had begun to resemble a soft sack of jelly that hung heavily over his straining waist band. Even his tits had plumped up into little gelatin like cones on his chest. They seemed to sway along with his belly with every step. Matt couldnt believe he had another (what he estimated to be) 200 more lbs of this to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Luke had found another soft bulge on Matts ever expanding body to explore there was a knock at the door to the cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He eyed Matt for a minute, his eyes slowly wafting over his engorged body, so ripe and plump with a thick soft sheet of blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo your making some progress are you?\u201d He said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked at himself, his body straining his clothes and turned bright red in embarrassment. How could he let himself eat like that? How could he let himself turn his body into that of a lazy blubber boys?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm..\u201d Matt stammered for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah your gonna fit in real well here\u201d Russ said in a condescending tone, \u201cYou and Luke were voted to be the fat counselors, you know....so you can relate to the fatties\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt again didn\u2019t know what to say. How could they have just  made that decision without him? Not that he wasn\u2019t loving it on some deep primal level, but he knew that being a whale was not good in the long run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat line of thought was cut off as he felt a warm rush sweep through his body. He felt a sudden pressure around his soft waist and the seat of his pants as his fat again seemed to swell and rebel against the tight constriction of his pants. His hands instinctively moved down to his belt to undo the taut piece of leather before it cut him in half. He was surprised though as his hand didn\u2019t make contact on his first pass. Instead he found that the soft sack of blubber that was previously his tight muscular stomach had expanded and drooped further downwards covering the buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Luke laugh as he attempted to undo his belt, fumbling at it with his noticeably plumper fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere..\u201d Luke said as he knelt before Matt, lifting his quivering belly with his warm hands and then undoing the belt and then Matt\u2019s pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen what does Luke do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Matt is delirious from the intoxicating feelings he is experiencing as Luke eases his shorts down over his now plump thighs and sighs in delight as he sees Matt's blubbery bulk sag downwards now that it is no longer restrained by his unforgiving pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pants slouch to the floor, Luke's head gently drifted toward the underside of Matt's belly to softly lick the almost liquid fat that had accumulated there. His soft tongue made delicate lazy sweeps along the flab there, causing a barely noticeable wobbling in the jelly that had formed on Matt's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Matt thought this couldn't get any better, he felt Russ's strong arms slip around him underneath his arms, his hands cupping the new fleshy breasts that had grown on his chest. As Luke's lazy licks slowly drifted downwards, Russ leaned in closer to Matt, his lips barely brushing Matt's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt..\" he whispered softly \" we need you to get really fat for the job... extremely fat... but well make it up to you\" he finished with a soft chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt just moaned in pleasure, as Luke had finally suck low enough to take his throbbing member into his velvet mouth. His tongue, swirling around its length like a cyclone of warmth and wetness. Matt could still feel his blubber expanding and pushing outwards into Luke's face, encasing it in a soft shell of pure jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets feed you some more fat boy\" Russ whispered \" it will amplify the cookies effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Matt moaned out loud, only this time he heard words slipping from his lips, seemingly of their own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...feed me..make me fatter..I need it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Russ opened a box of pizza and dangled a slice in front of Matt's lips. He could see Russ's lips curved into a mischievous smile as Matt closed his mouth around the greasy slice of pizza, taking a large portion of it with him. He felt the food slip down into his belly trying desperately to fill the hungry void that was gnawing at his stomach.  Feeling a desperation he had never known before he took another large bit and another. Soon he had grease dripping down his face and slithering onto his soft tits and yet he still ached for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a lucid moment Matt again wondered how this had happened. Just that morning he had been a buff strong college boy, with confidence and charisma. Now his body had atrophied to the flabby figure that stood before both Russ and Luke. He had become the lazy pig boy he had worked so hard not to be, all in the span of a few hours. And yet he still felt incredible and insatiable. He needed whatever was happening to him, just like he needed air to breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the pizzas were done and Matt's body had expanded even further. They were all lying on the bed in the room, neatly tucked around Matt's swelling body, causally touching every new bulge as it developed. Matt still hadn't finished and he knew that there was still the whole night ahead of them. He knew that by the end of this night they would all be permanently affected. He knew that after tonight he would never be able to go back to being a tight jock boy, no this was a feeling that he could not live without anytime soon. </span></div></div>",

It wasn't until he went to yawn that he realized something was wrong. <br>\r\nYawning big, he reached his hand up to his mouth to yawn and found it heavy, leaden. It felt as if he'd been sleeping on it all night. He felt weak. He felt tired, so he didn't think much into it at first, but it was something that did bother him. He rubbed his eyes, and let out a yawn as he stretched out. <br>\r\nAs he opened his eyes he realized how dark it was in the room. He could hardly see anything besides the sun that danced through the blinds. With a frustrated sigh he pushed down on the matress in order to get up. The scent of cinamon buns was tempting him to the other side of a door. However, when he tried to get up, he couldn't. For the first time he noticed a large heavy weight on his chest that was preventing him from moving. On his back, he tried pushing the object off of him, but it simply shook. After a moment he realized that whenever he reached out to touch it, he could feel it, as if the large heavy sack was a part of him. Suddenly his blood went cold, and he gulped.<br>\r\nThe memories of last night flooded back instantly. How much had he ate? How many cookies? How much did he weigh? How large was he now? As he tried desperately to get up, flailing desperately in a vain attempt to sit up, he found his efforts constantly stopped by his large belly which had expended to freakish proportions overnight. <br>\r\nAs he flailed his entire body shook with a violent force. Crumbs and shreads of his old clothes flung off his body as his entire body shook, vibrated. He could feel his once flat, tight chest bounce and jiggle like jello had been implanted under his skin. His belly shook and wobbled every direction at once, and with every movement it bounced erratically. Even parts of his body he didn't know could jiggle were. His chin swayed back and forth with every laboured breath, his legs shook, his arms quaked... And he suddenly found himself becoming very aroused. He was so large that his stomach would rub against his member, and with every jiggle, he found himself getting more and more excited, more aroused, closer and closer to that oh so dramatic climax.<br>\r\nSuddenly the door whipped open and Matt froze. His belly still jiggled happily however, and didn't stop for another couple moments. In the doorway was a familiar figure, but Matt wasn't drawn to that right away. On the ceiling was a full length mirror. For the first time he saw how massive he was and he couldn't believe it. What also surprised him was how hairy he'd become. Almost overnight he'd grown a thick five o'clock shadow, with a light pelt of hair covering his tits, belly, legs and everything else. He was surprised to find he couldn't even see how big he was. <br>\r\n\"How much do I weigh....\" </span></div></div>",

Even while Matt was struggling to fold his newly massive and doughy belly in half to achieve an upright position, he couldn't help but subtly admire Luke's own growing body. It seemed Luke had opted for a more leisurely pace in his growth but he was definitely not skinny in any sense of the word. Through his shirt Matt could see that his belly, no longer taut with food, hung low over his waist forming a soft rippling pillow that seemed to wobble with Luke's every stride. The most impressive feature though, the one that really caught Matts attention, was the size and shape of Luke's tits. Although they were partially obscured from his view Matt was sure they were huge for a guy the size of Luke. He could only see their vague outline against Luke's baggy shirt, but whatever Matt couldn't see his imagination filled in for him. He pictured two soft plump cones of flab standing out somewhat from his chest, but slowly losing the battle against their own heavy weight and sagging downwards as their owner grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" Luke said with a smirk as he caught Matt watching. Just as Matt was about to respond Luke leant over Matt's swollen body, closing the distance between them and let his own fat press softly into him. It all felt soo strange, Luke laying partially on top of him, feeling him pressed tightly against his obese body. Matt was unused to feeling someone touching him, yet still being that far away from his face. His belly he realized took up a lot more room than he previously realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we get you on a scale big boy\" Luke suggested slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...ummm...sure\" Matt managed feeling his face heat up. As embarrassed as he was by his now gargantuan body, he also felt another type of hot flush shoot through his body. It made him extremely curious about how large he had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big was Matt?</span></div></div>",

Matt stepped down from the scale and tried to sidle his way past Luke to the bathroom mirror. Tried being the key word he thought, as Luke careened to the ground, forced there by the sheer bulk of Matt's new obese body. It seemed that for the next few days he would be doomed to repeat the obnoxious fumblings of a teenager going through a growth spurt. At least until he got used to his new proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ops.. sorry..\" Matt said nervously as he bent down to help Luke up, acutely aware that even bending was harder now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok big guy.. these things happen when you grow..\" Luke said with a smile as he grabbed Matt's hands and allowed himself to be raised to his feet. Even as he did that Matt couldn't help but again admire the quiver of Luke's own flabby abdomen. He had beautifully fattened curves to go with those spectacular moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\" Matt asked blankly, looking at himself in the mirror. \"I mean.. why did I let myself get so fat..?\" Matt said as he grabbed several handfuls of soft fat from his belly and gave it a shake sending ripples throughout his whole body. It was a strange sensation, to feel the tremors of fat ripple through his body as he did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were the fat counsellors this year, remember?\" Luke said with a smile, \"We've got a lot of fattening up to do before the campers arrive! Last year the fat counsellors were at least 450lbs, but the director says that we should probably be bigger than that this year...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?

His eyes tracked all over Matt's body, drinking in every new soft bulge that had formed over his once muscular body. He seemed to revel in every sinful gluttonous detail of this whole experience, and Matt was beginning to worry that in the haze of his own desire, Luke was really starting to rub off on him. Matt was really starting to enjoy feeling this fat and sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were going to make you soo huge Matt\" Luke says as he came up behind him attempting to wrap his arms around Matt's obese form. \"It's going to be amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen what happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luke grabbed him, and heaved mightily to stop him from falling. \"You'll need some time to get used to your new proportions,\" Luke remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ops.. sorry..\" Matt said as he straightened up again with Luke's help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK big guy, these things happen when you grow,\" Luke added with a smile as he grabbed Matt's hands and pulled Matt back onto his feet. As Luke helped him, Matt couldn't help but admire the quiver of Luke's own flabby abdomen. He had beautifully fattened curves to go with those spectacular moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\" Matt asked blankly, looking at himself in the mirror. \"I mean, why did I let myself get so fat?\" Matt assked as he grabbed a handful of soft belly fat and gave it a shake, sending ripples throughout his whole body. It was a strange sensation, to feel the tremors of fat ripple through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're the fat counsellors this year, remember?\" Luke said with a smile, \"We've got a lot of fattening up to do before the campers arrive! Well, I do anyway, you seem to already be up at the desired level.  Last year the fattest campers were over 450 pounds, and the director says that we should be bigger than the biggest camper... chances are a few of them will be pushing 500 this year, so I gotta get to that size, and you might want to put on a few more pounds.  550, 600, to make sure you're the biggest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!? 600? That's huge!\" Matt yelled with surprise, \"There's no way I'm gonna get that big... I mean look at me already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... look at you... \" Luke whispered quietly, \"You're already huge Matt... and after another week, I'm sure you're going to be the biggest counsellor we've ever had...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as the tone of his voice, Matt could see the lust in Luke's eyes. Luke's eyes tracked all over Matt's inflated body, drinking in every new soft bulge that had replaced the formerly muscular frame. Matt began to worry that in the haze of his desire, Luke was starting to rub off on him - Matt was starting to enjoy being this fat and ... oddly....sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were going to make you soo huge Matt,\" Luke said as he came up behind him, and attempted to wrap his arms around Matt's obese bulk - his arms scarcely covered Matt's sides. \"It's going to be an amazing summer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen,<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Luke is really perplexed by this new weight and gives Matt some strange looks. Under his breath so that Matt couldn't hear him Luke says, \"He'll be the biggest person anyone here has ever seen, I'll make sure of that...\"<br>\r\nThe mess hall was large and smelled like buttery cinnamon buns. Matt heard plates being moved around in the back kitchen, with the smell of all sorts of exotic foods. \"You wait here Matt...I'll tell Tim we've arrived,\" said Luke softly. Matt wondered if Luke had something big planned for him here in the mess hall. <br>\r\nAfter a while, Luke came out with a big plate of assorted foods: Brownies, cookies, muffins, sticky buns, bagels, crispy chicken, corn, french fries, and chocolate pudding. \"Eat up big fella, we need to get that tank filled up!\"<br>\r\nMatt knew what Luke was doing; he wanted a bigger belly to mess around with...but was that such a bad thing?

Matt then grabbed a leg of fried chicken with one hand and a brownie with the other. He was now shoveling food down at an enormously fast rate. Luke just watched with one arm resting his head up, staring at the giant beer belly that was on Matt. As Matt was about to finish a plate, Luke motioned Tim to bring out another one filled with even more food. Matt couldn't control his urges to eat...and get bigger....and bigger. He just kept stuffing this food into his mouth and gulping it down with chocolate shakes. He just couldn't stop... <br>\r\nAbout 2 hours later, Matt was full, but Luke still wanted Matt bigger. However, he thought this was good for now. Matt in a slight daze had a jolt of eroticism shoot through him as he felt his belly, it was massive! Luke had a devilish smile on his face as he saw Matt's reaction. \"H..how could this happen to me?\" Matt said. \"Easy...you love being big and I love feeding you so that your desires may become reality,\" said Russ with his eyes clearly gazing at Matt's beer belly. \"Come now, let's weigh this beast and see how much sexier you've gotten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are just too much!\"<br>\r\nThey walked up the trail to their cabin, which was getting a lot harder each time, and opened the door. Inside Matt saw boxes and boxes filled with these cookies, but where did they come from? \"I ordered more of these babies as soon as I heard you were coming here Matt, you see, this camp revolves around fat and being obese. We need our staff huge in order to make the campers feel good about themselves! And...once a camp staff becomes fat off these cookies, they'll never regret it!\" said Luke. Matt opened one of these boxes when Luke was still talking. \"Hey! We gotta weigh you first by giant buddy! Step on here.\" <br>\r\nMatt obeyed and stepped on the white scale. \"What! Already 540! How is this possible after one meal!\" exclaimed Matt. Luke was now rubbing Matt's beer belly from behind him, the overhang of his belly was so long that it almost covered his thighs. \"You ate about 12 plates of our special food my dear chubby friend...the food has special chemicals in it that make it extremely heavy once it is digested. So the big gain hasn't even come yet...\" <br>\r\nMatt got hard all the sudden from the belly rubs and squeezing. Matt closed his eyes and made groaning sounds. Luke pulled Matt to the bunk and dropped him on it. The belly jiggled along with the moobs that were now there. Luke grabbed a box of cookies and crammed a cookie into Matt's big mouth and he swallowed it quickly. Luke sat on Matt's superchubby belly like he was riding a horse while he fed him. His belly rumbled while Luke was force feeding Matt and that made them both as hard as a rock.<br>\r\nLuke got off and said, \"Oohh! Your belly is gonna explode 'cause it's so big! We need to hit the scale now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Matt lugged his belly overhang which was longer than last time...the scale reads...  </span></div></div>",

Grinning like a madman Luke pulled him out of the bathroom, not stopping until they had collapsed back onto one of the beds. It groaned under their combined weight and Matt marveled that it was able to hold them up at all. That night was fantastic, even better than the first one with Russ when Matt was just starting his gain. Luke loved every roll of fat on Matt's body, and wasn't shy about showing it. When they both finally fell asleep the faint twilight before the dawn just barely peeking through the cabin window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey woke up late the next morning, Luke still squeezing Matt's soft gut like a child with his favorite toy. Matt's stomach rumbled again underneath the thick layer of fat, and he patted his belly pensively. \"Luke, you said the camp only needed both of us to weigh around 550, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke nodded, burying his face in Matt's squishy belly. \"The rest of this is all you. I know you like being big, and you know I <i>love</i> it when you get bigger, so whatever happens next is up to you.\" He lifted his head, a worried look crossing his face. \"You weren't thinking about losing some of the weight, were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook his head, or did his best to anyway. At this weight it was hard to even do that much. \"Not at all. I was just thinking that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Matt finish his sentence?</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile you haven't gained an ounce since I first met you, and I doubt you weigh even a third of what I do now. That just won't do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Luke hesitated. It was clear that despite his engorged state when they'd met, Luke was far more interested in fattening up his partner than he was in fattening up himself. \"Maybe you could just make up the weight for me?\" he asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on my little friend,\" Matt chided. \"I'm not asking for so much. All I want is for this,\" he reached out and grabbed a chunk of Luke's fleshy middle, giving it a small shake and watching it jiggle, \"to start looking more like this.\" With his other hand Matt grabbed his own belly and shook. The difference was substantial, the rolling waves of Matt's flesh clearly outmatching Luke's quivering jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke sighed, knowing he was beat. \"Fine then, have it your way,\" he grumbled, pulling himself up off his fleshy bed. \"I'll need an incentive however, something to make me want to gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt thought for a moment. This was where negotiations could get tricky. Might as well start big. \"How about a complete halt on my gaining then?\" he asked, struggling to get up himself. \"I'll refuse to put on a single pound more until you've at least doubled in size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke laughed, scoffing at Matt's first offer. \"Nice try Matt, but we both saw how you ate yesterday. There's no way you could handle restricting yourself to just the bare minimum.\" He reached out and offered a hand to help Matt up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke had him there. Matt was already hungry, and even the thought of not eating just made him hungrier still. He supposed he could easily eat double what Luke could even when stuffing himself. All right then, how about...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat deal should they make to help Luke gain weight?</span></div></div>",

He stepped on the scale to see that he did indeed weigh the 550 pounds that was part of the deal. He played with the new fat around his midsection. Unlike Matt, Luke didn't enjoy having all this fat on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Matt, Luke then peaked to his right to see Matt lying in bed. The sight made Luke jump for joy. Matt's belly formed a large mountain of fat that Luke couldn't wait to touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey fat boy. Wake up!\", Luke shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tried to sit up in bed, but the size of his midsection made it impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Luke.

All the fat needed some place to go, and because some of the fat went to his back, Matt towered over Luke in terms of height as well as girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke screamed \"I love this. I love you and I love your fat!\" He then gave his \"friend\" a hug around the midsection, although his arms didn't even make it halfway across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Luke's hugs and screams, Matt looked at himself in the mirror. 1300 pounds of man was something he had never seen before. His gut stuck out at least a foot in front of him; his arms and legs were mostly flab and his thighs were nearly on top of each other. With his very thick hand, Matt slapped his belly. It made a drum sound. Luke watched it all vibrate, and he got even more excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

You know this is never going to end well, with the warm cookies putting you to sleep, you doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up from a nightmare--your eyes bolt open and you try to sit up--you can't.

You oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst sandwiches, pastrami, Ruben, peanut butter and jelly, crab melt, it all tastes so good...then duck, chicken, pork, ribs, plate after plate piles up next to you and you're still craving more. You finish your third whole pig and your gut rumbles again, you look down, then at Luke, and dig into the desserts. Cake, ice cream, jello, frozen yogurt, every dessert you could think of was piled high on plates. You maniacally shove food down your gullet, letting it plop down in your  hungry belly. You see Luke with some cakes in his hand, and you shove a whole cookie pizza into your mouth. You feel full, no...stuffed. Finally, you lean back and let out a moan of pleasure, rubbing your ponderous pot, letting out moans all the while. You look at Luke, and he has about four cakes in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not done yet, are you?\" Luke asks, he takes a slice of an 8 layer cake and shoves it into your mouth, you slowly chew and swallow. He shoves more and more cake into your already stuffed gut. It hurts so much, but feels so good...you swallow the last slice of cake with a loud moan. You look down at your stuffed gut. It lets out a rumble, <i>there is no way I'm still hungry...</i> you think, and you know you're not hungry when your belly expands forwards, as well as your arms, chest, thighs, and face. You feel a fourth double chin forming on your neck, and the fold on the back of your neck is turning into two. Your belly--which already poured so far over your knees, spreads further, onto your shins as you sit on the floor. Every time you think you're done growing, you seem to grow even faster, pound after pound piling itself onto your body, taking up more and more space. Luke starts to grow too, but you're focused on your own growth--you like it. A lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...so...huge...\" is all you can manage as you feel your enormous gut as it grows, the fat sliding around in your hands like water as it expands in all directions. You're so soft, pillowing, fat billowing in all directions, you hug whatever you can reach of yourself, and pinch yourself on your love handles and back. The growth slows and eventually stops and you feel plenty more than double your size earlier, maybe ever three times bigger is a better statement. You attempt to get up--you don't know why you did. The second you try you know you'll need muscle cookies, and lots of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme some muscle cookies, gimme 50,\" you mumble with a slight slur from the fat on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, big boy,\" Luke says, handing you a couple boxes of muscle cookies. You stuff them into your recently stuffed gut (though it has some room from your growth) and feel your chest, legs, and arms growing stronger with every bite. You look down and see that the floor seems to be getting further away with each bit of muscle cookie you eat as well. Must be a side affect. You finish your 50th muscle cookie, and attempt to get up. You actually manage to launch yourself into the air a little bit and land with a massive thud. Cracks spiderweb from the tile beneath your feet and continue to spread a little farther, a slight but noticeable indent carved into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta eat the fat cookies too, fatty!\" Luke says, handing you even more fat cookies. You eat the 100 fat cookies you need to eat, boy, are you getting huge. The fat cookies seem to be a bit more immediate this time, your body expanding with every bite. Your ponderous gut yet again descending farther and farther down your legs, and your butt spreading out farther away from your back like a shelf. After you finish the 100th cookie, you try to get up from where you had sat down. It takes a lot of effort, though you do manage to (single-handedly) get up from a sitting position. You lay down and attempt to get up, with some trial and error, you figure out how to roll onto your side and push yourself up with your arms. You can't sit up from a laying position though, but you can still get up from a laying position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do I weigh...\" you mumble past your fat lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get two scales...one for each foot.\" Luke suggests, he walks off with his new fat body and comes back with two scales, both snap under your weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we need a car scale...\" you say, walking towards the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..\" Luke says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to your right at the dull weight display and it says...</span></div></div>",

That your body can't get any bigger, or something terrible might happen. Like a bomb, set off by a certain size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, you can, and you will, okay? Now find yourself some clothes, big boy!\" Luke says, you can hear a steely edge hidden behind the shroud of flirtation Luke is giving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What clothes? Everything I've seen in the buildings are tents! I've never seen any clothes for someone my size here!\" You say, bewildered at how you would find clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look closer at those 'tents' then...\" Luke says with a toothy grin. You oblige and look around for the tents. When you pick one up, with some unfolding, you find that these \"tents\" lying around the camp are just clothes made to fit somebody your size! Maybe bigger! You find a pair of pants that looks more like a tarp and pull them up. They're absolutely huge, they are loose even when you pull them up over your belly, and your thighs barely brush the sides of the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...how heavy is the biggest guy ever?\" you ask hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time I checked, its 12450, though he's been gaining slowly. You'll catch up in no time!\" Luke says, as if he's reciting lines from a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...how can one man be so huge?!\" You say to yourself, tying the pants as tight as they can get, they're still a bit loose, though they'll stay on your waist. You find a shirt, and find the complete opposite situation. It's extremely snug around your arms, belly, chest, neck--everywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got anything...oof...bigger than this for shirts?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, usually they ditch shirts at around 5900, you're the latest one to wear shirts,\" Luke says, staring at the massive shirt struggling to hold together against your mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this thing'll be better than nothing, try to get me some bigger shirts though.\" You say. You hear some distant sounds of tires against dirt, \"They're here.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just get the shirt on as much as you can, okay?\" Luke says, \"Oh and, you're gonna eat as much as you can tonight, get it? Its staged, but your gonna eat until you feel you're going to burst, get it?\" Luke finishes the sentence with a calm intensity to his voice, cool but slicing through your ears--and belly--with every word. Your stomach groans hungrily in response. \"Good, you should be nice and hungry for the challenge, we've got some...special food for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yank the shirt as far down on your belly as you can, and walk towards the campers, the biggest there looks to be about 525, nothing compared to Luke, and a drop in an ocean compared to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>At Dinner</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, zis special food iz made juz fo' you! Enjoy!\" The cook says, with a thick French accent, pointing towards a buffet that looks more like a battleship with food on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of special?\" You ask hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each of ze different kinds of foods have special surprises in zem!\" the cook says, gesturing as if he had a growing belly in his hands, you don't understand, he sighs and says, \"Each kind of food will make you gain a random amount of weight. The maximum gain from one food is 100 a serving. The least being 1, oh, and some make you hungrier.\" the french mans accent disappears as he explains this to you. Bowing his head and leading you to the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention everyone!\" Luke yells, tapping his glass with his fork, \"my <i>big</i> pal Matt over here is going to try to eat all of this!\" Luke explains, gesturing at the massive buffet, \"if he's still hungry afterwards...well, best of luck to all of us.\" Luke says, earning himself a lighthearted laugh from the audience. As if to prove a point, your gut lets out a roaring thunder like none other, reverberating throughout the mess hall, and hunger bolts through your belly, you <i>need</i> food, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dig into salads first, they're set up in huge heaps that are separated, you guess that's the serving size. You mash it all together in one massive pile and shove your entire face into the salad, everything becomes a blur of chewing and swallowing and you then realize that the salad is gone, you move on to sandwiches and entrees. Chicken, pork, duck, pigeon, pastrami sandwich, everything you can think of is piled high on the tables. As you finish a bite of chicken, a surge of hunger darts through you, stronger than when you had started, you eat with a new passion, you're oblivious to how heavy you'll be. Next. Desserts, cake, ice cream, fondue, every dessert you can think of, so sweet and...filling. The raging hunger you experienced less than an hour earlier has fizzled into feeling full, eventually you feel stuffed, you fell so massive, so gargantuan, so...<b>huge</b></span></div></div>",

Piercing pain laces throughout your stomach, <i>Did I eat too much? Did my stomach explode?</i> you think to yourself. The black dots in your vision seem to close in from all sides, eventually fading your vision to black, through your last seconds of consciousness, you see tubes out of the corners of your vision. A thick tube connected to seemingly hundreds of pipes...that's all you get to see before you slip out of consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open, you try to pull your head around, and find you can't--at first you think its because you're just so <b>huge</b>, it certainly feels like that, but you shift your vision down to see a thick pipe, about the thickness of a class, shoved into your mouth, it bends slightly under your teeth, and your jaw feels sore, you feel it curving down into your throat, and down...into...your...stomach...? You blink at the thought, and your vision wobbles, and your head spins, you hear a massive groan come from your stomach, you feel so full...but...you're so hungry you feel sick...or maybe you feel full because you're too big. You don't know, but for now, you'll have to wait. After about five minutes of hunger torture, a man, Luke, actually, walks in, wearing a large suit, and an ebony tie that trails just barely down to his bellybutton. Your belly laces with hunger, and your entire core tightens with pain, you moan through the pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hungry, are we, big boy?\" Luke says, all you can do is mumble \"mmhmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's not quite easy to achieve...you see, you are the first to push yourself past your cannibal threshold, you have made yourself too big, and your mind has...well...it convinced itself you need to eat humans to sustain yourself, and you won't feel <i>full</i> unless you eat a person, now, that is where these pipes come in,\" Luke says, pointing at the many pipes connected to you, \"if you could see all the way around this gargantuan thing,\" Luke continues, slapping your gut happily, it jiggles and gurgles again hungrily in response, \"you would see there are tubes in your belly button, leading straight to your stomach, this feeds you, now so do the pipes in your mouth, but first, we must give you an oral testing medicine, it is supposed to keep you from cannibalism, though it has side affects...lets see...\" Luke says, looking at a large machine, saying <i>Medicine</i> \"extreme weight gain...gas...hunger...may intensify urge to eat people...of course its not perfect.\" Luke says with a nervous laugh, he knows if this doesn't work, you'll eat him. \"Lets just hope it works!\" Luke finishes, pulling a lever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear hundreds of machines whir to life and see pipes from above your head into your mouth. A thin, cold-medicine tasting liquid enters your mouth, and down into your belly, the tube leaks slightly and you taste a foul sourness in your mouth, you want to gag, but the tube prevents that. You feel a shot of hunger dart throughout you, seemingly getting stronger as it continued to overtake your mind. All you can think about is eating...just food, and how <i>hungry</i> you are. You hear a moan escape from your mouth, and a loud groan reverberate from your belly, you see your already massive amount of girth expand further, pushing tubes away and thickening your already titanic arms and legs. You feel your back shift upwards and feel yourself get taller, your back stretching. Hunger laces through you again, your belly lets out a deep moan, and you grow faster, hundreds of pounds pile onto you, and they just keep coming. You feel too big, too huge, just too much weight to bear, but you like that feeling. Somewhere, under thousands of pounds of fat, you fell your member bulge to life, poking into your underbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let her rip!\" Luke yells past the engines, he pulls a second lever and you see thick brown liquid pour down through the pipes, into your mouth, you feel tubes moving about in your belly button, and that must be the food. So much food is being stuffed into, and your body seems to be matching the pounds of food your eating, pound after pound piling itself onto you, synchronizing with the food. So much of your body...too much of your body...and so...much...<b>hunger</b>. You attempt to say, \"I need more\" but it comes out as incomprehensible mumbling. You try again, just saying, \"More,\" and Luke understands you, he moves the latch further down, and sits down, sighing, you see beads of sweat trailing down his face. You feel thousands of pounds pressing down on your frame, each pounds making you feel hungrier and hungrier almost. You motion your hand to turn the machine off, and wait as the machines whir to a dead stop. You slide the tube out of your mouth and say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need muscle cookies, I wanna move,\" you say...you feel yourself still growing slowly from your past stuffing, you attempt to move. You slowly but surely get up, though you can't get up and stay up, you lose your balance upon trying to stand (you hit your head on the ceiling) and fell back down with a thundering thud. You plot on what to do when you get the muscle cookies, yes eat them, but what then? Get more food? Something in you feels like that won't satisfy you...Luke is back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snatch him up when he hands you the muscle cookies, and you eat three boxes full in a few bites, the three boxes fit in your had...you're way too big, but you don't care, you feel too small at the same time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>WHERE ARE THE OTHERS!?</b>\" you bellow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other room, they're eating now...please don't eat me!\" Luke begs, you ignore his plea, and shove him towards your mouth, you swallow him whole, his belly squeezing past your lips, and down your throat into your stomach...now...</span></div></div>",

Remember, this is a fat camp, no one cares what you look like, as long <br>\r\n                  as your happy with yourself and your enjoying the fat, I'll make as much food as you could ever want...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           Your new personal chef,<br>\r\n                                                   Tim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was drooling without realizing it. He threw the lid off the first tray to find a bunch of vanilla cupcakes covered in frosting. The second tray uncovered Curly fries, and the third tray had greasy Fried chicken. The pattern repeated down the entire mess hall; the whole place was packed with chicken, fries, and cupcakes. On one table, sat about 30 chocolate milkshakes with whipped cream. Matt couldn't take this all in by himself, but he started to dig in. He shoved one cupcake after another into his mouth downing them with milkshakes. After finishing about 12 cupcakes, he went for the fries. He just shoveled them in without chewing and just washed 'em down with another milkshake. Then...the fried chicken...oh he loved fried chicken. He brought a piece up to his giant mouth with one hand and rubbed his belly with the other. He belly was greasy from the chicken as he had pulled his shirt off at the start of his \"midnight snack\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was passed out in the mess hall and the sun rose from behind the mountains. He awoke on his back on the ground with his shirt completely ripped off due to the massive food intake. There were trays and food scraps littered throughout the mess hall. \"Dear lord, I feel amazing!\" He couldn't even feel his body from the neck down. In fact, he couldn't even see over his belly anymore. He got up with much a struggle. The other people in the camp were waking up and coming out of their cabins. they all looked as Matt walked and jiggled his way back to his cabin atop the hill. He had to lift his big belly to keep his legs from knocking it as he walked. He opened the door and saw Luke standing in the middle of the cabin, expecting him. \"Well...I see you found the buffet...Look at you you're amazingly unbelievably enormous! I thought 700 would be a hard goal to reach, but I think we've past that! Let's hop on the scale !\" Matt waddled onto the white scale once more and the number read.</span></div></div>",

Matt your getting close to the point where you can't walk anymore!\" exclaimed Luke. \"And I love every pound of it..\" Luke pushed Matt down onto the bed which cracked and creaked with every movement on it. Matt's fat body \"oozed\" off the sides of the bunk bed and Luke got on top without haste, nude. He ripped off Matt's shirt and pants so nothing was left except his stretched-to-the-limit boxers. Luke got a rope and tied it around the bed and Matt tightly. He grabbed more cookies and began to crush them in a glass with milk. \"I'm going to make you bigger....bigger....BIGGER!\" It was getting to much for Matt to handle and he started to moan in sexual excitement. Luke grabbed a funnel and shoved it into Matt's incredibly super chubby face with about 3 extra large fat chins. He poured the gainer cookie shake down the funnel and in it went into Matt's stomach. After about a half an hour, Luke had stuffed about 20 cookies into Matt's already extreme belly. <br>\r\n\"Matt...your going to be huge...and you..are...going...to...love it!\" said Luke with an airy voice. Matt didn't know how many cookies that Luke had stuffed into him, but he knew that if he went to the trouble of grinding them up into a shake, then he was in for one hell of a weight gain. <br>\r\nLuke left Matt tied up, because if the cookies do what their supposed to do, Matt won't ever be able to leave this cabin ever again and he'll stay Luke's personal chub boy toy as long as he lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate that night, it started to happen, his belly started to rumble and expand slowly. The rope that was tied around the bed and Matt stayed and it looked as if there were two bellies growing. Matt awoke in the middle of this and got really horny feeling the sensation of expanding. The rope shot off and the belly was free to grow. Luke awoke and took his clothes off as soon as he saw this new gain starting to happening. The belly was growing soft and it spread out in all directions...the limbs of Matt became extremely thick with fat and he could no longer move them. \"Oh god Matt, this is the moment I've been waiting for my entire life! A one-thousand pound man that can't move to be my personal sexy toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was shocked! However, he thought of nothing bad of this:<br>\r\nHe'd never have to move<br>\r\nHe'd never have to work<br>\r\nHe'd never have to feed himself again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was so massive now, beyond limits anyone has seen. His limbs were sticking straight out of his bellly and he could not move them. His neck was like a giant pillow of blubbery fat. His belly, now very tall with a large overhang, was about 1020 pounds of chubby goodness. Luke was on top of this horny just bouncing up and down. Would they really stay here forever? Was this a dream? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Luke continued to feed his superchub slave Matt and continued to bone him. Matt was always horny from his overall body size and weight. He never moved again, with the exception of a wobble or two back and forth in bed. Matt was happy and Luke was happy. But was this all just some kind of crazy dream?   </span></div></div>",

He threw his shirt off. His broad shoulders leading to a pair of fat arms. They were padded in a layer of fat. He started to unbutton his pants. He had some troubles as he had to lift his massive belly to get to the buttons. Finally he got them unbuttoned and took them off. All he had left was a pair of too tight boxers. You stared at thinking some dirty thoughts. Another thought crossed your mind. How big was he? He must have been over 700 pounds. Well, only way to find out is to ask. Before you could open your mouth, you felt something hairy and soft hit your face. It was Ken's gut. At that moment you felt pure extasy, it was so hot and perfect. You snuggled your face to his belly and he put his hands behind your head, pushing your head harder against his manly gut. You broke the contact with his gut, because you were running out of breath.

It's too be expected durring the changes.\" Luke said with a laugh.<br>\r\n\"Changes?\" Matt asked.<br>\r\n\"You'll enjoy them.\" Luke said, placing one of his hairy hands onto Matt's distended stomach. For the first time MAtt realized how distended it was. How far and evenly it pushed out into the air,  defying the constriting nature of his pants. He stepped off of Luke quickly to get a better view of himself in the mirror. What he saw surprised him. His shirt as pulling up a bit at the front revealing a sexy little patch of dark belly hair. <br>\r\nHe watched as Luke got up from his chair, his large bloated stomach hanging in front of him, came behind him and wrapped his strong arms around Matt's middle. He lifted up Matts shirt, and watched, slowly rubbing his stomach up and down. <br>\r\n\"That feels amazing.\" Matt whispered.<br>\r\n \"Just wait until you see what happens next.\" Luke said as he gently nibbled Matt's shoulder. With every rotation of Luke's hand on his bare stomach, Matt could see more and more flesh moving with his hand. His stomach was slowly inflating out, although it wasn;t getting any bigger, it was simply settling into a fat roll around his stomach. He could feel his stomach softening, until finally it jiggled like a block of jell-o.<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\"<br>\r\n\"The cakes settling into your body baby.\" Luke said between nibbles. \"Just like it's settling into mine. It dissolves into fat and is instantly absorbed into your intestines, creating a soft, lucious layer of flabby delight. <br>\r\n\"That feels incredible.\" Matt said. He suddenly realized how aroused he was. <br>\r\n\"You're pitching a pretty big tent there.\" Luke said gruffly.<br>\r\n\"I am.\" Matt said. <br>\r\n\"you want to take care of it? Or do you want some more food?\" <br>\r\nMatt looked at himself in the mirror as Luke removed the rest of his shirt. His chest now drooped slightly, coning out into two small breasts that nestled above a noticable, and rather thick belly. He looked to be about 190, with a significant overhang. His muscles were still noticable, but primarily just on his arms and legs. All over he looked thick. He rubbed his belly once, letting it bob up and down with gravity. He looked good, like an ex baseball player gone to pot. </span></div></div>",

He's definitely looking soft Matt thought to himself. His belly was large and ball-shaped and stuck out like a big fat basketball that hung strangely. The image of it was sexy and Matt could see by the way his shirt had burst open that he had gained this massive weight very quickly. Matt estimated him to be about 220. Not far from him, but big enough for that weight to look incredibly large and soft... He took a step and the weight on his stomach shifted and jiggled violently. Matt immediately felt himself growing more and more horny. He felt a drop of pre cum at the end of his dick and his hand longed to just reach out and sink his hands into the massive expanse. <br>\r\nIt looked incredible. And Matt wanted more. <br>\r\nHe put one hand on his own belly and was shocked by how soft it felt. His entire body felt soft and flabby - as if he'd never worked out before. <br>\r\nThen he looked deep into Lukes eyes and whispered. \"I need more... Give me more.\" <br>\r\nLuke smiled and grabbed Matts soft belly, giving it a hard jiggle. Matt looked into his eyes as he gave him a deep, hard kiss. <br>\r\n\"You're getting more big guy.

But Russ just turned halfway and barely registered surprise. \"Sure. As soon as we unpack, I'll take you down there.\" Matt's eyes lit up and he stammered, \"Err, great.\" or something like that, talking fast on their way down the stone steps from lodge to keep from look strange. Matt and Russ carried their bags down the rocky path to the cliffs, Matt staying behind Russ so he could watch Russ's t-shirt ride further and further up so his giant stomach, bouncing violently from the way down, bulges out more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the lodge, Mat couldn't have been more satisfied; It was snug, wide, and almost totally secluded. Russ sets his bags down and turned to Matt, his shirt already sliding over the swell of his deep navel.  Matt had bent over to set down his things, and as he leaned up, he stared straight into Russ's plush navel with thin hairs coiling around it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on while I put my trunks on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuss walked past, jiggling on all sides, into the bathroom. Matt's eyes followed him until he was gone, then he pulled his own trunks out of his bag and self-consciously removed his own clothes, slipping the suit on while he had the bunk to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe head rustling nearby and the distinct sound of clothing sliding over fat. It sounded like a bit of struggling--Matt imagined it would have to be a LITTLE tricky to tug a swimsuit under that enormous hanging gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of Matt just wanted to glance around the corner and sneak a peek.

Russ was side on to him, and what a sight it was!  Russ's speedo jammers were a larger size than any Matt had ever seen before, and explained the sounds of tight clothing being pulled on that he'd heard earlier - and the low-slung swimwear passed under Russ's substantial gut, leaving it fully exposed, and if anything making it look bigger!  Matt had worn speedos in swimming competition, but couldn't imagine even wearing speedo jammers to the beach with his toned body, yet here was fat Russ in the latest skintight spandex.  Matt had to admit, Russ must be very confident in his looks to pull off such a look - especially in the wildly striped red and black suit Russ had on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuss turned his head at that moment and spotted Matt.  Caught!  But Russ didn't seem to care - he turned towards Matt, and took a wrestling pose, and said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He walked past Matt and let the subject drop, to spare Matt some embarrassment and break the spell over him.

His throat ached from the lump that was caught in it, but did his best to keep the nervousness of his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn.\" Russ said, relinquishing the bathroom. Matt nabbed his suit and ducked inside to change. When he awkwardly stepped back out, Russ was reclined on a nearby bunk, his arms and head overshadowed by his mammoth belly and legs, which stretched out before him. Matt followed suit and sat on the opposite bunk in his swim trunk, staring across the floor with unease at Russ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" Russ asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if you are.\" Matt replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're just getting settled in, we could just hang instead.\" Russ grunted and stood up; the bunk creaked, his fleshy gut rolled down over his legs, and the  underside shook and loomed in front of Matt's face.</span></div></div>",

He quickly disposed of the thought when he felt his groin moving, he realised it was immpossible to tell if Russ was hard or not, his belly always covered his groin.

Matt couldn't help but stare at the movement in his but as he waddled towards a huge building. That's the childrens dorm. It's three floors, all floors are divided into zones A, B, C and D, like 3C means a kid is staying in zone C on the 3 floor. Russ walked past the huge building and began walking up a hill, at the top was another building. The hill wasen't very steep, but it was long, about 300 meters, and soon Russ was panting heavily. Matt had no problem, he was used to run far steeper hills up and down for excersise. They were about halfway when Russ had to take a break. He stood there panting and sweating. Matt almost felt ashamed about not even being tired. After a few minutes Russ gave out a sight and began walking again. He needed one more break before they were up, but finaly they were there.<br>\r\n\"This ... is the ... mess.\" Russ said, still tired from the climb.<br>\r\n\"Matt took a look around the building while Russ sat down on a bench for a short rest.

Matt has never been stuffed before and the feeling makes him nervous. He gets into the cabin and lies down on his bed. He unbutton his jeans and lets out a sight of relief. Wearing slim fit jeans when overeating is not wise. After about 20 minuttes he hears some heave footsteps on the front porch, then Russ enters. He looks like he's had another cake, his belly looks even bigger now, and his pants are also unbuttoned. He sits down on the coach, it's made for 3 persons, but he takes up half of it. He sees Matt lying on the bed and asks: \"Are you allright?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, my belly hurts, it feels like it's going to explode.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Matt, your just stuffed, a good nights sleep will take care of that. Man, I've never seen anyone get stuffed from so little food.\"<br>\r\n\"I think I will go to bed, I'm not able to do much anyway. Don't let me stop you watching TV or anything. I just need to lie down and close my eyes, rest, not sleep.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem, I was thinking about going to bed anyway, all the walking and swimming today has tired me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gets up. He goes into the bathroom and brushes his teeth and such.He strips down to his boxers and looks at himself inn the mirror. His belly is really stuffed he thinks, it bulges out half an inch. When he gets out, Russ is standing there in his underwear, ready to do his stuff. The look makes Matt stare in awe for a few moments. The blubbery body of Russ always amazed him, the belly that hung halfway down his tights, his tigths, rubbing agains each other, huge love handles, gigantic moobs and an enormous ass. It's amazing he can walk at all. As Russ moves past him he notices how he has to swing his legs slightly to the side so his tights don't crash with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt lies down to relax, but his hard belly makes it hard to get comfortable, but he falls asleep quite quick<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Matt woke up the next morning he glanced a look at his watch. 05:40 AM.</span></div></div>",

He wonders how he can breath under all that fat, then he notices he's wearing a CPAP mask to help him breath. Matt shakes his head and goes into the bathroom. He takes a look at himself in the mirror. He is quite certain his abs were more defined the previous day, but decides that it's probably just the light and some paranoia after the stuffing the previous day.<br>\r\nMatt is used to sunny LA and takes on his normal excersising gear, a really short pair of shorts, just a bit longer than hotpants and his I-pod shuffle. He took a look out the window, it was pouring rain. He walks out on the porch, it's rather warm despite the rain. He leaves the I-pod at home and goes running anyway. The cool rain is nice, it keeps him chilled and he feels nice. He runs to the little lake. Once there he's already soaked, so kicks off his shoes and swim across the lake and back again. He takes a little stretch before jogging back. Back inn the camp he finds himself a tree and usess a branch to do pull ups. As hangs there Carl walks by under an umbrella.<br>\r\n\"Hi there,\" he calls, \"You know Matt, we have a fully equiped gym indoors.\"<br>\r\nMatt lets go of the branch, \"I know, but I prefer the outdoors.\"<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" says Carl, \"But don't get sick.\" Then he walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather was getting worse, it was blowing a cold win now, and the rain got more intense so he headed back to the cabin he shared with Russ.<br>\r\nRuss was in the shower when he got inn, so he just continoued his work out, next on the program was 50 sit ups and 50 sit ups, then a good stretch. He was halfway through the sit ups when Russ came out from the bathroom wearing only a towel around his waist, wich was rather small compared to the belly hanging over it. He chuckles when he sees Matt and asks: \"Panic after eating that cake yesterday?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I do this almost every day, but now that you mention it, maybe I should do some jumping jacks to.\"<br>\r\nRuss just laughs and goes to find some clothes. Matt goes to shower. When he gets out Ross is clothed and is watching the morning news, it's 07:30 AM.<br>\r\n\"I't's gonna rain for the rest of the week they say, looks like you will keep getting wet.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"If it gets worse I just use the gym instead.\" Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left for breakfast. Just as the day before, Russ needs two breaks inn the hill up to the mess, but once there his energy returns and he eats like a whale. Matt, thinking about his lines tries to find something healthy, but it's just eggs, bacon, pancakes and buttered toast. He ends up with eggs and toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he sits down he asks: \"Why aren't there any healthy food there?\"<br>\r\n\"It will be once the kids get here next week, but for now we're saving money on food by buying whats cheap.\" says Russ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was just about to leave when Arnold, the chief got up to give a message: \"The tailor will come today to take meassurments for new uniforms. Those of you who already have some, try them on to see if they still fit.\"<br>\r\nHe sits down again and Matt leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt has just brushed his teeth when Russ enters the cabin they share. He walks straight into the small side room he usess as a dressing room. You her him walk around there a bit, it's easy to hear him since his steps are so heavy.

The sound of cutlery and chatter filled the hall, but Matt could only focus his attention on one thing: the massive, billowing belly that, until mere moments ago, had never existed. He kneaded it, squeezed it, even hugged it, all in an attempt to see if he was dreaming or if this was really happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith prod, it jiggled. With each poke, he giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned adoringly at the huge soft mass that sat lazily on his lap. He smirked at how big some of these shirts would have had to be to stop this gut from wobbling exposed! His hands travelled further, trying to feel the effects of the rest of his body. All other sounds, sights and smells faded as his hands explored the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers traced the circumference of his thighs, each one wide enough, it seemed, for another human to comfortably sit on. He felt the rolls that ringed the sides and back of his inflated torso. He counted three, four, <i>five</i> bouncing layers of blubber that rested on his massive hips. He had to shift around on the two chairs that supported him as he tried to feel the size of his new posterior. He gasped to himself. No wonder he needed an extra chair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms had become difficult to move about, too. He looked at the upper arms, each of them resembling a semi-inflated sphere of flesh. He chuckled to himself at the thought of them becoming <i>fully </i>inflated spheres of flesh. Soon, thoughts of himself as a great, big ball of dough made him smile wistfully. He looked across from his left arm to his right, his vision panning across the rounded peaks that formed his chest. He looked at his hands at last, and smiled as he saw the conical forearms, the rounded, ham-like palms and the inflated digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe adored how he felt. Everywhere his hands went, he felt a wonderful, soft, doughy sensation, as if he had become his own gargantuan plush doll. It was not too long before he was hugging himself. His arms wrapped tightly around his pillowy belly, and he nuzzled his own soft, bouncy chest. He was wrapped in a complete euphoria! Nothing could break that spell of ecstasy now-!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt? Are you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuss's voice woke him with a start. He gasped, blinking, and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from Russ, he was the only person left in the Hall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Matt finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuss grinned. \"You were too busy pinching your tummy to keep track of the time! Or to keep an eye on your lunch,\" he shrugged apologetically while rubbing his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch? Lunch!

It wasn\u2019t. Matt began to eat. Half way through the meal, Matt began to slow down.

The ice cream pasted his hair to his head, and he could feel himself filling up again... The ice cream melted down his front as he continued to eat, feeling more like a stuffed pig every second, but addicted to the feeling. He felt, big, heavy, dominated, and helpless to do anything else... Why was he enjoying this so much? <br>\r\nHe could feel his consciousness fall away from him being replaced by simpler passions. Eat. More. Lust... More...<br>\r\nRuss' strong hand kept him in the ice cream, but Mat soon realized that his other hand was no where to be seen. </span></div></div>",

Russ took him by a rec hall, which Matt noted was half lined with giant tvs and beanbag chairs, and half with weights. From there the two ventured down a trail that ended up at a lake. Matt spied a dock further down the beach, with a few boats tied to it. For a minute, it actually looked like a normal camp scene... And then Matt turned to look at Russ again. He was slowly adjusting to such a sight, but still! Almost 300 pounds of pure muscle! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of getting huge grew on him as the tour continued, and by the time the pair were standing outside of the mess hall again, Matt was beginning to get excited about packing on weight this summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now while the first few days of camp for any new guy is just stuffing down carb after carb, protein gram after protein gram, newcomers have to decide whether they're bulking for muscle or fat before their first week is up.\" Ryan said, as they entered the cabin. \"So you don't have to choose for awhile, but I'm sort of curious as to what you're leaning towards right now.\" Flexing both biceps, he gave Matt a grin. \"I'm pretty sure it's obvious which one I'd recommend, but it's still your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I already know.\" Matt said excitedly, \"I'd really love to...\"</span></div></div>",

Tim dried himself off and shook his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, nice to meet you,\" he said as they exchanged pleasantries. \"Did you two like the turkey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really good.\" Russ exclaimed. Matt was a little more interested in the sauce that was poured over it, since it was almost better than the chicken itself. \"That sauce...\" he asked, \"I've never tasted anything like before. What's in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secret family recipe.\" Tim said (rather unconvincingly). \"Listen, if you like it so much, you're both welcome to some of the leftovers from lunch. I was going to throw it out anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt glanced at Russ, who seemed ready to dig in for more. But for some reason Matt felt wary. \"Is there a lot??...\" he asked. \"Not that much. I mean, compared to dinner anyway. Really, two young, growing guys like you will finish it off in two seconds.\"</span></div></div>",

You can eat in my room, I sleep right over here.\" Tim opened a door and led Matt and Russ into a dimly-lit cabin with a sturdy table and two wooden bunk beds. Russ's flip flops shuffled over to a chair while Matt took the adjacent one and sat down. Russ's upper body was still that of an average toned boy, but his portly, tanned gut looked like a donut with a trail of hair crawling inside. The slight overhang of his belly shook over his shorts as he slumped into the seat and the wooden chair legs groaned beneath him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get some stuff. Wait here.\" Tim disappeared back into the kitchen while Matt and Russ exchanged shrugged looks. \"Are you sure you handle more food?\" Matt asked. \"You already look pretty packed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle it.\", said Russ leaning back in his chair to stretch. \"He said it was just some leftovers right?\" His shirt pulled up as his chest reared back, fully exposing his pot belly and the flabby rolls separating his firm chest from his portly midsection. The writhing hairs on his navel pulled apart as he stretched his arms behind the chair. Russ just slid his hand up and down his gut, obviously ready for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim burst in with giant, steaming platters in each his hands. Matt stared in disbelief as he set down a huge helping of turkey burger and a pile of fries, onion rings, and other deep fried assortments in a heap in front of him -- The heavy *clunk* of the plate actually made a bunch of rings topple down off the heap. \"These are LEFTOVERS?!\" Russ shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I've got more in he back. It's not too much for you, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was about to formulate some way of saying \"Yes\", but his growling stomach betrayed his hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim set down a similar platter in front of Russ. \"Now hold on while I sauce these babies up.\" Russ took a large ladle and dumped it into a pot holding the sweetest, most mouth-watering stuff you've ever smelled. Matt stared at Tim's ladle with a pained look as it scooped up and dripped a thick, shimmering red drapery of sauce all over his burger, sausages and fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder which one of you guys can finish first.\" Tim taunted as he scooped another ladle for Russ's plate.</span></div></div>",

He greedily smooshed the whole cookie inside his cheeks, lips smacking and teeth chewing until, until his mouth was totally crammed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chocolate ground up between his stuffed cheeks and Matt barely took time to wipe his face for smears and crumbs.

Then you have some more free time - there's the lake to swim, there's our gym and training centre, there are trails for hiking and biking, there's canoes - just use the buddy system for all water stuff, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Matt replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, go up the staff cabin behind D, unpack your bag, and we'll see you here for lunch,\" Rob said with a broad grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt followed the signs to D staff cabin and unpacked while marveling at the generous accommodations - of course, he and Nicky had to spend all summer here, but still, the double bed, flush toilets, and refrigerator were more than he was expecting.  He headed down to the cookhouse again, where he could see Nicky and Rob, and a variety of other counselors, some his age, some older, most Nicky's size or bigger - he might actually be the lightest guy here, Matt thought idly to himself.  Weren't camp counselors usually lean, sunburnt types?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat beside Nick, and then they all trouped up to the serving windows for their food.  They sang Johnny Appleseed, then Matt made to sit down, only to realise nobody else was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, fellows, welcome to Camp Willix for those of you joining us today, we're going to have a great summer,\" Rob began.  \"As our camp slogan says, after summer camp we and the campers will be ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand the other counselors joined in loudly, \"HAPPIER, HEALTHIER, and HEFTIER!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they all sat down.  Matt wasn't sure he heard right, so after his first mouthful he turned to Nicky and asked quietly, \"Happier, healthier and heftier?  What's that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,didn't read all the literature, huh?\" Nicky replied.  \"That's the Camp Willix motto - Happier, Healthier, and Heftier.  Kids come here and leave in better shape than when they arrived, but we don't starve 'em - we're no diet camp - in fact they're heftier in muscle and fitness when they leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" replied Matt, surprised.  \"Do you mean...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grabbing a couple of the cookies he put them in his pocket as he got off his stool and followed behind Nicky. He watched as he walked out of the kitchen and moved back through a path in the woods. Matt followed at a distance, drinking in his masculin image. There was something incredibly erotic about this man. After a while of following him he came to a clearing in the woods where there was a wood pile. Matt chewed on his cookies as he watched Nicky move through the clearing, grabbed an axe and began to chop wood. Matt found himself getting hard as he ate and watched this fit man work up a sweat chopping wood. Nicky's belly shook slightly with every chop, which Matt found stranging intruiging. Matt longed to walk through the clearing and grab the mans soft looking midsection while pressing himself into his hard, muscular back. Matt checked his pockets and suddenly realised there were no more cookies. He had no idea how many he'd eatten but suddenly he had a desire for more. He turned down and could see the slightest outline of a belly emerging, but Matt didn't care. He was just full... but the desire for cookies was growing with each passing minute... Matt wasn't sure to go back for more, or to keep watching Nicky chop wood. </span></div></div>",

Some beads of sweat clung to the long trail of light brown hair trailing on Nicky's soft, jiggly stomach.  Nicky wiped his forehead with the back of his hand and set the ax down with the other.  A quick glance from his eyes startled Matty, and soon Matty knew he had been discovered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky bent over and his stomach made a distinct roll over his jeans as he picked up a bottle of milky liquid.  He chugged the bottle's contents and made his way over to Matty who was frozen behind a large bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, it's not polite to stare,\" Nicky reached over and stroked Matty's chin.  An audible scratching noise could be heard as flesh brushed against stubble.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I need to shave,\" Matty chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  I kinda like the rugged look.\"  He rubbed his own darkening five o'clock shadow and seductively smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just following you because there doesn't seem to be anyone else around.  I thought maybe you could... umm, help me get better acquianted with this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you snuck out here and watched me chop wood instead of getting a counselor?  Guess you want the tour from my perspective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.. I just thought you wouldn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't mind?\"  Nicky smiled and stretched a bit.  \"Nah, I guess not.  'Course I dunno how I'm gonna give ya the full tour since I've only been here for about a week.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatty finally come from behind the bush and stood up.  He noticed that Nicky was about 5 inches taller than him, and his muscular body seemed thicker than before.  But the setting sun probably added a shadow to his body that made him look heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" Nicky smiled as they started back to the camp, \"you must have put away some of those cookies.\"  He reached over and patted the soft, flabby belly that stretched out the shirt on Matty's normally lean torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" Matty tried to sound indifferent, \"it's just cuz I was really hungry and those cookies are addictive.  I'm just a little bloated is all.  It'll go down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.  Looks pretty soft to me.  Looks like the Camp already agrees with you.\"  Matty would have sworn there was another quick wink thrown into that short pause.  \"Hell, I got here about a week ago, and ever since then, I've not been able to stop gorgin' myself.\"  He idly rubbed his rippling gut that was covered in its brown hair.  \"I just can't stop drinkin' the cooks energy drinks.  Loads of energy, but they kinda stick to the waist line.\"  Nicky chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is your job, Nicky?\"</span></div></div>",

As he stopped to take in the rich aroma of sweets, the main courses, and appetizers, Nicky had continued to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he walked right into Matty's back.  A little jarred, Matty regained his footing and felt Nicky's warm belly hugging into his lower back.  They both stood there, frozen in their steps, basking in the erotic sensations of Nicky's exposed gut to Matty's lower toned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get outta the kitchen while I prepare dinner!\"  The cook yelled with a slight smile.  \"Can't have you boys ruining your surprises!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our surprises?\" Matty choked on the word and was snapped out of his lust filled moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the cook chortled, \"the other members have had their introductory dinners.

He propped his well muscled leg on one of the arm rests and continued his way through his light snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matty approached the other chair, he noticed that his own cookies had vanished and the sweet taste of chocolate and dough lingered in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat, Matty.\"  Nick gestured as he licked his fingers clean.  \"Those cookies are pretty damn addictive.

He watched Nicky walk to the table, his eyes never missing the noticeable swagger the other man had.  He drank in Nicky's tight pants and how well Nicky filled out his pants.  But as his eyes continued up Nicky's legs, he noticed that there were very predominant love handles resting on the waist band of the pants.  The well muscled shoulders seemed thicker than before but with less definition, and the ripped arms seemed to be the size of small trees now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You comin', Matty?\"  Nicky called over his shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt rose to his feet.

He started shoveling food into his mouth.  Spaghetti, raviolli, potatoes, steaks, corn, everything his stomach craved.  Before he knew it, Tim was dishing out even more food.  There was a large pain in the underside of Matt's stomach but he couldn't get enough of the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't worried--OUCH!\"  Nicky yelled a bit and looked down at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt wondered what happened to him when he realized his stomach wasn't hurting as badly. He looked down to see that his pants button had finally had enough with the stress and flown underneath the table and pegged Nicky.  \"I'm so sorr--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Nicky smiled.  \"Next time, undo your pants.\"  HE stood up.  \"Like me.\"  He gestured to the pants that had once sat below a soft belly.  Now the zipper had been forced down by a large swollen gut.  Matt could feel his own erection pulse harder as took in what he saw.  Nicky's normal toned pecs looked swollen with fat.  His arms now large mounds of muscle and lard.  And the hair... Matt hadn't noticed how much hair Nicky had on his chest.  His forearms were darker with a forest of hair, his chest was engulfed in a field of wheat colored hair, and his model like face has the beginnings of a scruffy beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done, Mr. Matt?\"  Tim asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRRRRPPPP!\"  Matt let out in satisfaction.  He surveyed the damage done by the two of them.  The cart was now stacked with cleared plates and empty glasses, and before him sat an empty plate.  Matt couldn't believe how much he ate.  He and Nicky had managed to clear the entire feast.  \"Yeah, Tim, I think I'm--\" RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky smiled and leaned over the table, his swollen gut brushing the top of the table, and patted Matt's exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time Matt had noticed.  His polo shirt was hanging on only by the button close to the collar.  His large and magnificent belly and finally ripped his shirt into pieces.  Then he felt Nicky's hands caressing his tight skin.  It was only when he felt Nicky tugging on his hair did he notice one thing:  he was significantly hairier.  His dark soft dark brown hair looked far more dense than his admirer's.  He felt his pants jerk from the pulsations of his erecation, and he wondered how they even had room.  Standing up he looked eye to with Nicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way to the room, buddy?\" He asked Nicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First you should see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky led Matt and his swollen fat gut over to an old oak framed mirror.  Matt couldn't believe what he saw.  His once toned and athletic physique was contorted into a large mass of fat and hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a scale down the hall, we should see how big you've gotten, cutey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time Matt looked into Nicky's eyes.  Very smoothly, he cocked an eyebrow and led him down the hall.  Once they reached the scale, Nicky let out a sigh of relief when the seam of the seat of his pants ripped in half.  He waddled onto the scale and let out a boisterous laugh when he discovered how large he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how big are you, Nicky?\"  Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I got here I was a lean 185.  Now I'm tipping the scales at 230.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's 45 pounds in a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wait til you see your weight, chunky,\" Nicky joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was shocked when Nicky read out his weight of...</span></div></div>",

Before he responded, he had lept off of Nicky and had started shoveling the cookies into his waiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky had to be honest.  He had never been more turned on in his life.  He loved the sight of Matt gorging himself, and he rubbed his belly absentmindedly.  That's when he felt the hair on his belly.  Sure he had to admit he'd gained some weight and the hair growth had been sporadic, but it seemed as soon as he began to fret over these issues, he would love it even more within the next minute.  While Matt seemed preoccupied with the cookies, Nicky snuck a look at himself in the full length mirror on the back of the door.  He barely recognized himself.  His face had filled out considerably and his once well chiseled jaw-line was covered in dense dark facial hair.  His once powerful shelf of pecs were softer and rounder with a mat of chest hair swirling around on it.  His huge muscular arms had become tree trunks of fat and muscle.  His legs were easily ten times the size of arms, but it all paled in comparison to his huge gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after gorging himself, he tried to shake the round ball of stuffed flesh, but when he tried to shake it, his hands sunk into the softest belly he'd ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it couldn't have been more erotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a loud belch snapped him back to reality.  He turned on his heels to look at his roommate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he stood, possibly a few inches taller, but definitely bigger.  Gone was the lean body of the former twenty-something, and here before Nicky was the most succulent man he'd ever seen.  The former sparsely haired and toned legs were transformed into tightly stuffed sausages that were no longer covered by jeans, but by dark brown hair.  Even his boxers were seemingly painted on and the hole in front of his underwear was forced open and an even darker tuft peeked through.  His arms were larger and plump, his shoulders broadened by his weight gain, and his face now round and thickly covered with hair emphasized his beautiful eyes.  But his belly was his true achievement, with its round shape and deep dark navel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!\"  Matt proclaimed, \"I think I finally made my stomach's quota.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have really wanted to get bigger,\" Nicky smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Matt couldn't help but smile as his inner secrets seemed to bust through the roof almost as quickly as his weight, \"and there's one thing I want more than anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"  Nicky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want...\"</span></div></div>",

He felt groggy, almost like he did when he had his wisdom teeth taken out.  That feeling that his body was rapidly falling asleep.  It washed over him, and leaned back on the bed while Nicky finished up the last of the cookies.  Matt wasn't sure, but before his head hit the soft mattress, he would have sworn that the cookies Nicky was eating were twice as large as Nicky's hand.  The sleeping sensation felt magnificent and he truly felt satisfied with his full, bloated belly.  As he curled up on the bed, he felt Nicky spoon ever so slightly with his own bloated body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up the soft, seemingly hand-knitted sheets, he grabbed Nicky's swollen fat hand and placed it on his hard stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night progressed into the day, Matt woke up to find..</span></div></div>",

The pressure built and Matt knew what this felt like: he was hung over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly problem is, he didn't remember drinking the night before.  In fact, he knew he hadn't.  The sunlight streaming in through the log cabin's window blinded Matt's eyes, and made his brain hurt even more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever I did to deserve this,\" he seemed to speak to an all knowing diety, \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sound of wood chopping ceased, Matt realized his ears were too grateful for the peace and quiet.  There were approaching foot steps, and Matt hoped that it was Nicky as he was in no mood to deal with a guest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' sunshine,\" Nicky said cheerfully.  Matt noticed that Nicky was shirtless but wearing sunglasses.  His body seemed better than before.  Not only was his belly soft, malleable, and hairy, but it looked as though he had been working out.  His arms, shoulders, legs, and pecs were beefier than before.  But Matt's eyes were drawn to the size too small jeans that seemed to accentuate a rather large basket in the front of Nicky's jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to be so cheerful?\"  Matt asked in a grumpy tone although his body language reassured Nicky that Matt was glad to see him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head's hurtin', ain't it?\"  Nicky asked, grabbing a bottle of the milky liquid he continually seemed to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's about ready to bust.  What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hurt me too the first night I was here.  I ate too much and my head felt like there was a jackhammer pounding around in my skull.\"  He approached Matt and handed him the bottle.  \"Drink this.  It really helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stood up and felt his headache ebb away.  His stomach grumbled and he felt the heaviness of all the weight added to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicky,\" Matt said looking at his puffy and fat body, \"I'm huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and that belly of yours ain't the only thing that grew,\" Nicky playfully tugged on Matt's engorged member.  He leaned closer to whisper into Matt's ear.  \"Don't worry.  It did the same thing to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed and his stomach grumbled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for breakfast, Fat Matt,\" Nicky joked.  \"First, let's get you into my clothes since you busted outta your boxers last night.  Then, we'll weigh you before we plop down to our meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching the closet in the room, Matt found a counselor's uniform that seemed tailor made for him.  The length seemed too long, but apparently he had grown two or three inches.  Since he had gotten so large, he figured that maybe this camp food didn't just make you fatter.  He smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Nicky had to rush to the mess hall and dining area due to the fact that they were both so hungry they could have eaten a horse.  The told Tim to rush them as much food as possible.  Matt noticed Tim looking a little fuller as well.  \"Maybe the food's getting to him as well,\" Matt thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky pulled him to scale in the hall, which to Matt seemed larger as well.  Nicky hopped on the scale (or bounced, since his whole body seemed to jiggle) and let out an audible gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're what?\"  But he saw what was wrong.  Nicky weighed 275 pounds.  \"Holy crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn,\" Nicky said stepping off the scale, rubbing his unclothed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes...\"  Matt was shocked when the scale said...</span></div></div>",

The room had a thick smell of grease in the air, but Matt just only smell the succulent smells coming from the stack of food on the table. <br>\r\n\"It is, trust me.\" Nicky said with a smile patting his own plush stomach. Matt took a moment to place his own hand on his stomach. <br>\r\n\"I am getting pretty hungry.\" Matt said as he sat down on the bench. Nicky sat beside him as they eyed the food. \"Do we just dig in?\" <br>\r\n\"I think thats the plan.\" Nicky said examining the food. Matt didn't need to be told twice and took a handful of eggs and tasted them. They were delicious, much better then any eggs Matt had before. Before Matt knew what was happening he had taken another scoop and was busy downing those eggs, he used his free hand to grab a sausage and quickly stuffed that in his mouth. Then a piece of toast with some more eggs... Before long Matt was in full food frenzy mode. He really couldn't explain what was going on. But before long the banquet that was spread out before them was almost completely descimated, but Matt couldn't stop eatting. It seemed as if anything that was eatting was almost immidiately replaced by another food just as succulent as the last morself. Matt felt his new pants tighten already. It was almost as if everything he ate was simply turning into fat. His jeans felt tighter and even the new shirt. A new feeling also emerged as his face felt itchy and he began to itch all over his body but Matt couldn't stop. After feasting and gorging on everything in sight he finally collapsed in a platter of eggs. <br>\r\n\"Are you full?\" Nicky asked. Matt simply nodded. His stomach felt like it was going to explode from the pressure of the food in his gut. <br>\r\n\"I'm afraid thats not an option.\" Nicky said. Suddenly Matt felt something hard come around his neck. Nicky pressed himself into Matt's butt and pushed him over the table. Nicky inserted a tube into Matts mouth and with his free hand massaged Matt's fattening tit that hung down low paying especial attention to the erect nipple and engorged food filled belly. Matt looked up only to find a mirror there. It was an odd picture. Matt saw that he was now considerably hairier then before, there must be some kind of steroid in the food he thought. His hair was now long and shaggy and he had a scruffy beard, but what really caught his eye was his stomach. Flabby and hairy, he was on his hands and knees on the table, but his stomach extended all the way down to the table. Nicky was an intimidating force behind him pressing his rock hard jean covered cock into Matt's ass. Despite Nicky's obvious excitement he was surprisingly gentle and playful, his own belly shown in full naked glory under his cowboy hat. <br>\r\n\"We're going to try something fun now.\" Nicky said with a slight laugh.</span></div></div>",

Matt was actually a little frightened that the table might buckle under their combined weight of 530 pounds, but that was soon disregarded when Nicky literally ripped Matt's shirt off his chest.  Not that it was covering much since Matt's torso had fattened up so much that it didn't even cover his belly anymore.  But his pants were proving to be an issue, Nicky could get to the button between wrestling with his own belly and Matt's larger belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take care of it,\"  Matt smirked as he relaxed his large table muscle.  The button pinged off the table and rolled onto the floor and the zipper was stressed down, making it easy for Nicky to strip his newly fatten friend of his last garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sugah, I'll be gentle,\" Nicky cooed softly into Matt's ear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had never had something like this happen before.  He would have sworn he heard Nicky rip a few garments of his own, but since he was on his hands and knees, he couldn't see much.  Then he felt the rock hard cock rub between his ass cheeks.  Then he bended over a little more in a more prone position, and began sucking hard on the concoction that came through the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt continued to suck the creamy, milky liquid through the tube, he felt that his skin was ultra-sensitive.  He could feel every inch of his skin that was being touched by Nicky.  It was almost as if they were one person.  Whenever Nicky would get more pleasure and become more aroused, the more Matt sucked and felt pleasured himself.  The seconds seemed to elongate and the minutes pressed on for what seemed like hours.  Soon, he felt Nicky tense up one final time, and the tingling sensation turned into an erotic electrical shock that caused not only Nicky to climax, but Matt as well.  Both were soon making such <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a heep on the table, Matt finished the entire vats contents, and was surprised when he didn't even remotely feel bloated.  Nicky pulled out and couldn't believe what he saw when he looked up into the mirror above the table.  There he was kneeling behind his bloated and fattened friend, that apparently had just become his new boyfriend, and he couldn't even recognize himself or Matt.  Both had become so large and hairy that they were something of two young bears.  Nicky felt so turned on again, even though he just exploded in his new lover's body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt,\" Nicky asked softly, \"you feelin' all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt said...</span></div></div>",

There was a massive surge of gravity, or so it felt.  All the contents in his swollen stomach seemed to finally settle and he felt overly full.  It felt almost as if his whole body felt full.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt,\" Nicky began, \"do you feel like--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you've just filled yourself full of food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Nicky smiled, \"let's get you back to the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I feel all right.  I just wanna weigh myself.  I don't know how much food I've eaten, but damn, I feel like I've gained at least 30 pounds.\"  He turned slowly to smile at Nicky, but saw something he wasn't expecting.  In all his life, he'd never seen anymore more beautiful.  There Nicky stood, a tanned blonde god of immense size.  He pushed back his wild mane of blonde hair and tucked it behind his ear which revealed a fully grown, thick, brown beard that slightly accentuated his large double chin.  But the hair didn't stop there.  His whole body seemed to have sprouted large amounts of hair.  His arms were covered with wheat colored hair from knuckle to massive bicep.  He started too look like a giant football player that had gone to pot.  As Nicky bent over to pick up his underwear from the mound of clothes on the floor, Matt noticed that he seemed to struggle bending over.  His large swollen gut looked like it had been pumped full of air and was harder than a basketball.  No, a ten foot in diameter basketball covered in a tan bag.  His large belly bulged out with a dark hair covering the entire thing.  As he pulled the boxers up his engorged legs, he had trouble pulling them over his inflated butt.  Once he finally managed to squeeze himself into them again, his large basket seemed to weigh the entire piece of underwear down.  Even the waist band was aching to be free from under the massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha lookin' at, sexy?\" Nicky chuckled as he walked toward Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Matt had been staring for quite some time as he had gotten completely hard again.  \"Huh?  what?\"  He stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd poke somebody's eye out with that thing,\" Nicky joked as he pulled on Matt's swollen member.  \"Let's get you back into your undies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that proved problematic.  Nicky had to help Matt squirm back into his undergarments due to the fact that he couldn't even see his feet for his own gargantuan stomach.  Matt had never felt underwear cut into his skin before.  This was a new feeling.  The large amount of pressure put on fabric by his skin was unparalleled to anything he had ever felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I wanna get weighed,\" Matt smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just ate, so it won't really matter what it says,\" Nicky smiled like he was hiding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know as well as I do that our weights have changed since we ate.  There's something in this food that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Nicky put his hands up to end the conversation, \"if that's what my porky little boyfriend wants that's what he'll get.\"  Even when he joked around, Matt felt that Nicky was irresistable.  As they walked toward the scales yet again this morning, Nicky approached them first as usual.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tapping of the scales weighing system echoed through the dining hall.  When the numbers finally slid to where they were going Nicky let out a howl of satisfaction.  \"Broke the 300 mark.  Now I'm 305.  Must have gained 30 pounds.\"  He turned to his bloated lover and said, \"Your turn now.\"  As Matt waddled up to the scale, Nicky's heart fluttered a bit at the sight before him.  This formerly toned twenty-something had become this huge mass of lard before him, and he couldn't get enough of it.  He wanted to take Matt back to their cabin and truly adore him like he should be adored.  He thought about how he could just lather Matt in lotion and rub that mound of jiggling flesh before his eyes.  He wasn't lying about what he said before.  He wanted more of Matt.  A lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\"  Matt yelled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem?\"  Nicky rushed to his side and say what was completely and utterly shocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbers read out 305.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're as big as I am,\" Nicky said as his mouth hung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you got some catchin' up to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just then....</span></div></div>",

Matt couldn't exactly see the man that it came from as Nicky's large girth blocked his line of sight.  All he could hear was the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me gents,\" the voice had a bit of a stern repremand to the tone, \"but just what in the hell do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... well,\" Nicky stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know damn well what you were doing,\" the man continued, \"it was a rhetorical question.\"  He sauntered over to the two large, food stuffed men, and finally he came into Matt's line of vision.  He was a great bear of a man.  Easily as tall as Nicky but much larger.  Oddly enough, the first thing Matt noticed were the hands that reached out and placed themselves on Nicky's shoulder.  The reason he noticed was because Nicky instantly slouched over as if those gargantuan hands weighed him down.  Matt's eyes followed the slab of an arm covered in dark red flannel all the way to the heavily stuffed red plaid shirt seeminly bursting at the seams.  While the man was as tall as Nicky, he was easily twice as big.  An odd combination of fat and densely packed muscle covered the man in every way possible, except for the large round ball shaped belly, which Matt wanted to poke to see whether it was firm or soft.  That's when Matt realised the entire time he was drinking in the appearance of this man, he and Nick had been talking for some time about something.  For a split second, Matt damned his ability to tune people out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why I can't have the two of you canoodling on the Mess Hall tables.  I mean for Pete's Sake boys, people eat there,\" his voice had seemed to lose the entire severity it had once held and now become more jovial and father like.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" Nicky smiled, and he turned to look at Matt, who seemed lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you two get back to your bunk and get cleaned up.  Shape up those beards.  We can't be letting everyone think we're just wild woodsmen up here, now can we?\" The large lumberjack man seemed to smirk and waddled off back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" Matt asked with a bit of confused humor in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell ya when we get back to the cabin,\" Nicky chuckled.  Matt watched as his belly shook slightly.  As they walked through the hall, Tim the cook was cleaning up their mess, grumbling soflty under his breath while they shuffled past.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they returned to their cabin, Matt and Nicky were both stunned to see...</span></div></div>",

Had them specially made for the both of you.

It doesn't say.\" Nicky smirked.  \"Guess we'll find out when my pants are too long on your and my belly busts out of your shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up, Cowboy,\" Matt said playfully as he rubbed Nicky's gut, \"this thing is starting to be small in comparison to my growin' gut.\"  Matt tried to add a southern twang to his tone when he emphasized the last two words of the sentence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Nicky inched closer to Matt's face and smiled his rueful smile, \"guess we better get some rest.  Campers should start showin' up soon.\"  Nicky's hands gently ran down Matt's fuzzy chest to his soft round belly.  \"Can't have you too tired to handle 'em, can we?\"  With his other free hand, Nicky turned off the bed side light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Matt could see was the wide body of his new boyfriend outline by the irredescent light of the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as the lights were extinguished, Matt bent over to feel the bed after Nicky had already sprawled himself out on the soft plush mattress.  The bed seemed larger than before, almost as if it had transformed from a queen sized bed into a king.  Maybe even bigger.  But something more alarming just happened, as a loud ripping noise echoed through the log cabin room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the sam hell--\" Nicky began, but was stopped by Matt's laughter.  \"What's so damn funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned on the lights.  Once again the room was illuminated by the incandescent light being thrown from the two end table lamps.  Matt turned his back to Nicky, which gave him ample view of Matt's exposed butt.  When bending over, Matt's immense weight gain was apparently all the cotton boxers could hold.  All the remained of the seat of his underwear was a strained waistband and flapping plaid fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have finally blown the seams,\" Matt said through bursts of laughter.  Soon, both men were laughing rather loudly.  They each thought that this must only be funny due to their lack of sleep and sheer exhaustion, but their laughfest was soon stopped by the loud gurgling noise resounding in Matt's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That don't sound good,\" Nicky paused.  \"You okay, babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\"  Matt cradled his own belly, and soon after that the noised stopped.  But what Nicky saw was something he'll never soon forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's fingertips were nearly touching underneath the swollen member.  But as time slowly ticked by, a distance grew between them, as if Matt's gut was growing before their very eyes.  Nicky sprung from the bed, his own underwear adhering quite nicely to his own stuffed body.  Matt's eyes widened as he felt his gut inflating, but didn't express any signs of distress or fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's goin' on?\" Nicky verbalized as he crouched down and put his own hands on his lover's gut.  Nicky looked up over the mound of flesh at Matt's face only to be smacked moments later by the boxer's elastic band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can't.... STOP IT!\"  Matt yelled.  He rounded the corner quickly and rushed into the small bathroom near the front door of the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky, still recoiling after the abuse from the band, collected himself and rushed to the bathroom door.  He knocked fiercely on the door and pleaded with Matt inside.  \"Matt, ya need to calm down.  Don't do nothin' drastic.  Just relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL WAS IN THE VAT?!\" Matt screamed from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some growth hormone.  It's supposed to nullify your metabolism.  Set it at a restin' state, and as a side effect make you become bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm just some PRIZED HOG you created?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Nicky stopped yelling, and his tone changed to a more gentle tone.  \"I had you to start takin' it cuz I thought you'd want it.  You told me the other night you wanted to be bigger.  So I thought this was the best way.  I didn't know it'd make you continually grow.  I mean, I've been takin' it and I haven't expanded that rapidly.\"  At that thought, Nicky did feel heavier standing at the door, than what he did moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bathroom, Matt stared at himself in the mirror while his body continued to widen and grow slowly.  He wasn't mad with Nicky, just scared.  What if he got too big to move?  Or what if he had a heart attack?  He contemplated that maybe coming to Camp Willix was the biggest mistake he ever made.  But then he thought about the other man on the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Nicky began once more, \"Winston said that this stuff would NOT hurt us.  And I believe him. He said that in all reality as long as he just remain active, at least for an hour a day, like walkin' or swimmin', we won't have any health issues.  You saw how big he was.  He told me that he takes the stuff himself, and I don't think he'd wanna hurt us.  Trust me, Matt....\"  His voice trailed off, as if he went into a mode of contemplation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked hard at himself in the mirror and that's when he noticed the large bottle of the milky substance sitting on the window sill above a small wicker table.  \"Nicky,\" Matt spoke softly.  He moved slowly in the bathroom and according to his reflection he hadn't grown anymore.  \"Nicky?\"  He repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" a feeble voice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you promise to not keey anymore secrets from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiled sincerely, grabbed the bottle, and opened the bathroom door.  \"Then, I want you to....</span></div></div>",

Before Matt knows it, he's pushed against a wall with both his bulk and Nicky's gut pressing against him.  It's quite possibly the most erotic thing he's ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Nicky smiles his most amorous smile and pops open the top of the bottle, and chugs the entire contents of the container.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT? WAIT--\" Matt protests as Nicky drinks the creamy liquid.  He tries to move, but the tremendous amount of weight pinning him to the wall constricts his movement.  He can't do anything but watch as Nicky drains the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPP!\" Nicky's belch almost reverberated off the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\"  Matt complains once he frees himself from the pressure of his lover's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I wanted to show ya somethin',\" Nicky cooed as he softly approached his ever-widening boyfriend.  \"I wanted to show ya that I don't want ya to be a prized hog, unless I am.  I want us to be fat together.  I wants US to be big.  I needed to show ya that I'm not just makin' ya fat, but I am gettin' fat too.  Here.\"  Nicky quickly shuffled through his endtable and drew out a photo.  Much to Matt's surprise there stood a heavily muscled Nicky, jokingly posing as some bodybuilder.  His body looked to be carved out of the finest stone and there seemed to be no trace of fat in his physique.  \"Now, look at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned to look at Nicky.  The widened face with the thick facial hair led to a flabby neck and rounded shoulders.  His muscular arms now hidden in fat and his meaty pecs now looked like they had fat directly injected into them.  As Matt followed the dirty golden chest hair down to his round, beer belly shaped gut, Matt saw that the boxers were being stretched to near breaking point.  Even the fly on the boxers was opened wide to show a dark patch of hair that Matt knew covered something even bigger.  His wide hips curved down to thighs that rubbed against one another and finally ended with his chunky calves.  \"You actually like looking like this?\"  Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love every pound, just as I love every pound on your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why didn't you make me drink it, like I asked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I can't have ya gettin' bigger than me.\"  He grinned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt walked slowly to Nicky and hugged him gently.  \"Thank you for being honest with me, Nicky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" his said with his faint southern drawl.  \"now, let's hit the hay, and maybe tomorrow, we'll see how much you've grown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll...</span></div></div>",

He tried to button his clothes shut but about four inches of soft pliable flesh prevented the fabric from closing. Nicky looked equally as rediculous, squeezing into his clothes which made Matt laugh at the sight. There was something that was incredibly silly about how he looked, but equally as erotic. The sight of Nicky was almost too much for Matt to take. With a glint in his eye Nicky turned off the lights and slipped into bed beside Matt, wrapping his big strong arms around him. He kissed him softly on the back of the neck sending shivers down Matts spine. Matt purred as he cuddled into Nicky and within minutes they were asleep. Matt smiled as he felt the warmth of Nicky keep him warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt woke up in the middle of the night, a new chill freezing him to the bone. Something wasn't right with this picture. He felt cold as he tried to wrap the blanket around him. Matt opened his eyes after a moment when he suddenly remembered the events of last night. He sat up, his new stomach resting on his thighs like a large flabby bag that protruded. He could feel it's growth. He felt around the bed when suddenly he realised he was alone. Matt turned on the lamp beside the bed and looked around the room. There was no sign of Nicky. Outside the sky was pouring rain which caused soft pangs of rain to pelt the window. Matt tried to swing his legs off the bed but they felt heavier then he had ever felt before. He felt dizzy and cold, very cold. He got up, slowly adjusting to his new weight as strips of fabric fell off of him as he did. His stomach was massive with huge breasts that could be compared to melons. But right now Matt didn't care about his body, he didn't care how his body had inflated, and how he had grown a thick beard and crows feet around his eyes. He didn't notice how his temples had greyed and his hair had thinned with a bald spot on the back of his head. He didn't notice anything except that he was alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment Matt saw a note resting upon the bed side table. He looked over to the side of the bed where Nicky had been only hours before. It was cold and the sheets looked as if they had hardly been slept in. Matt trepidaciously tip toed as best as he could in his new flabby body to the table and grabbed the note. To his surprise he found himself out of breath and had to rest on the bed. Mopping the sweat from his brow he opened the letter and read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Matt, Nicky.\" ... Nicky had left him in his sleep. He'd left him. Nicky was gone leaving him fat, old and alone. Matt was in shock and simply starred at the letter until finally he could no longer hold back his emotion and began to cry</span></div></div>",

Nothing could have prepared him for this sudden departure, and the worst part was: he was alone.  All alone.  This man, whom he knew so very little about, had up and left him.  His body was ravaged with pain and sorrow.  The rain outside came down harder and the darkness seemed to press itself in on Matt harder and harder with each breath.  His chest twinged in pain and a painful numbing sensation went down his left arm.  Was he having a heartattack?  Was he going to die, alone, fat, and in the middle of the woods?  Was this truly the end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as suddenly as all of this had happened, Matt opened his eyes and the bright flourescent light from the bedside table beamed into his head.  Soon a large dark shadow covered his and he felt his body beind shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugar,\" a thick southern voice drawled, \"you okay?  You was havin' a nightmare.  Look at you, you're a mess.  You were cryin' so loud it woke me up.  What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's eyes finally adjusted to see the wide, fat outline of Nicky's face, just as full and round as he had left it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicky,\" Matt said slightly upset still, \"is that really--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O' course it's me, ya goof,\" Nicky tussled Matt's hair, \"it was a bad dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you left me and my arm,\" Matt said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh,\" Nicky calmed Matt, \"I ain't leavin' ya, and you were layin' on your arm.  Prolly fell asleep almost as fast as you did.\"  He leaned in and kissed Matt's lips softly.  \"Besides, I ain't never cared about someone so much in my life.  'Cept maybe my dog Sadie, but she wasn't nearly as fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt chuckled, \"That and she was a dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" Nicky rubbed Matt's facial hair, \"although you're startin' to look like some wild bush man over here.  In the morning, we need to get you some trimmers so you can tame that wild rat's nest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lights turned out, Matt cuddled up to Nicky's belly and tried to wrap his arms around his stomach.  A feat that he wished he'd never accomplish.</span></div></div>",

Matt had reserved himself to hiding his head under a pillow wishing that Nicky would stop.  Suddenly, his wish came true when a small phone rang from the bedside table.  Nicky thudded his way to the receiver and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Counselors cabin number 3, this is Nicholas speaking,\" Nicky smirked at Matt who finally emerged from his pillow fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatty mouthed, \"Have the campers arrived?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky held up a finger as he continued to listen, \"Uh huh.  Yes, sir.  No, sir, we'll be fine.\" Another pause went on and Nicky chuckled, \"No sir, we know where the mess hall is, sir.\" Another laugh, \"yes, sir.  We will, sir.  Okay.  See you at dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" Matt yawned slightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Winston, the camp owner, tellin' me about how the campers will be delayed cuz of the bad weather.  Apparently the rain last night was bad enough to wash out some of the roads gettin' here.  So they're gonna wait a few more days for the roads to clear up and then they'll bring the campers.  In the meantime, Winston said for us to make ourselves at home and for us to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, trim our beards,\" Matt rolled his eyes since that was becoming Winston's slogan for him and Nicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, some of us listen to him,\" Nicky indicated to his recently shorn face.  He now sported a tight light brown goatee on his chin that heavily accented his growing double chin.  \"Now, chunky butt,\" Nicky playfully pounced on Matt, \" let's see if we can get your luscious round belly clothed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you've got clothing that could fit either of us?  Since you're just wearing a towel.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Nicky stroked his goatee, \"let's see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter roughly twenty minutes, Matt had managed to squeeze himself into the shower stall in the bathroom and trim his beard.  Unlike Nicky though his kept the whole thing but just kept it more neatly groomed.  He loved how his new beard made his face look huge, almost perfectly round.  As he proceeded out of the bathroom, he noticed Nicky was barely dressed in clothing.  His gargantuan belly had the stock red counselor's shirt stretched over it.  Even the largest size barely came down to his shot glass sized navel.  His belly hung over the top of the pants that were obviously unbuttoned and almost unzipped.  One final thing that turned Matt on so much more was the fact that the sleeves on the shirt had actually ripped at the seam in an attempt to cover Nicky's larger than life arms.  As Matt approached Nicky, Matt saw....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't know if I could even pack on one more pound.\"  Matt shook his round, hairy belly and then dropped it abruptly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, but if you get any bigger, sugah,\" Nicky smiled, \"we'll never get you enough food to keep from bein' hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up to smile at Nicky only to see him opening another bottle of creamy liquid.  They both knew the effects, and how much bigger Nicky would get so his instincts busted out.  \"Don't you know what that thing will do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicky began to drink he shrugged as if it didn't matter.  Once he got his fill of his drink, he replied properly.  \"I don't think it'd possible for me to get any bigger either.  Besides, normally when I drink one of these, I usually feel heavier seconds after drinkin' it.  Now, I just feel less thirsty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Matt wondered as he padded over to his robust friend.  \"Let me try.\"  Matt put the drink to his lips and chugged a few gulps from the container.  He waited, burped, and then noted he felt nothing.  Not a churn in his stomach.  Not a sense of heaviness.  Not even a slight twinge of hair growth.  The only thing he did feel was that he wasn't thirsty anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't it weird?\"  Nicky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is.  Well, let's get dressed and head down to the dining hall before Tim puts away all the breakfast stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky nodded in agreement and they both finished dressing.  As they approached the dining hall, the heavy fog slowly shifted into a steady rain.  So that by the time they had finally stepped foot into the hall, they had a slight dampness to their clothing.  The smell of the heavenly breakfast spread overwhelmed their senses and they both felt their stomachs growl from the depths of their guts.

Just watching himself grow made Matt's penis erect. He felt his newly trimmed beard begin to grow out.

Then after a while of stuffing they took a big gulp and grabbed there drinks and poured them in. they didn't even care that food was in there beards or there drinks were pouring out of their mouths and falling all over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That- was-great--\" Nicky said huffing out of breath. \"But I -- still need more--\" He leaned back in his chair that creaked as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was picking food off his beard and stuffing it in his mouth, licking his fingers enjoying every moment. Nicky looked as Matt and said softly, \"Great-idea.\" He began to also pick his beard. They both finished stuffing themselves and then Matt struggling to get up, using the chair and table as support looking down at Nicky and said, \"Lets-get some -more---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky smiled, \"Yeah the chief has--to have more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed on their way, their legs rubbing against each other. Matt let out massive farts and Nicky belched uncontrollably, both didn't mind as long as they got their food.  Opening the door they both tried to get in at the same time but were unable ti fit in together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt wobbled in first and was shocked to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt didn't understand.  There he was, standing amidst a large kitchen stocked to the brim with gallons and gallons of this mysterious white liquid.  A part of him was fearful of this all-consuming hunger rising in his belly, but an equally powerful part of his mind screamed to make his body bigger.  In his mind, Matt stood there contemplating his decision for hours, but in reality mere seconds had passed before he marched over to the large island and downed a gallon jug of this liquid.  Nicky, who had quickly followed suit after he pulled off the remains of his pants, chuckled at the idea of the two of them growing larger and larger.  He too had an unsatiable thirst and hunger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their second gallon of the mysterious liquid, both Nicky and Matt had managed to sate their massive appetites.  Having grown too large for their own clothing, Matt noticed that he stood several inches taller and Nicky was in fact taller as well.  Whereas Matt was a thin and lean 5' 10'' a mere week before, he was now a lumbering mass of belly and blubber that proudly protuded his large physique at over 6' 2''.  Nicky who was originally this height now stood at roughly six and a half feet tall and was a massive combination of fat and swollen muscle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, son,\" a large booming voice echoed from what appeared to be a large dry pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Nicky and Matt nearly jumped out of their skin when they discovered they were not alone.  Out of the pantry came the head counselor and owner, Winston, who appeared to have packed on some weight himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both look like you've indulged too much,\" he said.  Even though his words were harsh, he held a large jovial grin on his face.  \"You shouldn't have drank so much of my Origuad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ori-what?\" Nicky asked in his southern twang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Origuad.  It's an old world secret recipe that the Vikings brought over to the New World years ago.  It was supposedly lost when the Europeans tried to conquer most of the known Canadian world.  Ever wonder why Vikings were described as large bears of men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Matt, that you've both been slowly turning into the legendary Viking warriors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not possible.  I mean, I'm not even remotely from around here.  My parents were raised in Georgia and before that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinston interrupted Nicky with a raise of his massive bowling ball sized palm.  \"I didn't say you were born a Viking, you are just taking on the form of one.  You'll have a natural predisposition to get bigger and bigger and bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what kind of camp is this place?\"  Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought that we were going a camp for some kids, and I mean it's been a week and there ain't been no kids here yet,\" Nicky looked thoroughly perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Matt smiled as he put two and two together, \"there are no campers coming.  We are the campers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinston smiled, \"Correct.  I've been helping you grow larger and larger until you hit the roughly estimated size of normal Viking men.  In fact, Matt is the approximate size of a man his age, but Nick, you're far too muscular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Matt's ears seemed to perk up. \"Is there anything I could do to fix that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinston smiled and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Winston smiled and said, \"Yes, definitely.  We just need to feed him more Origuad.\"  Then he paused and seemed to be thinking, \"actually.  I'm unsure whether or not he'll lose his muscles.  You see Origuad increases a man's body size, his hormone production, and vastly increases his appetite while decimating his metabolism.  But for some reason, you both seem to have adapted to this ale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ale?\"  Matt inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, technically it's an ale.  That's what the Vikings used it for primarily, but I figured you both would be extremely intoxicated by the time you finished half a bottle.  There's approximately the same alcoholic content in one cup of this ale as there is in a twenty-four pack of beer.  It's astonishing.  But the alcohol isn't necessary, there's a whole different recipe for a non-alcoholic version.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, should we get to work on fattening Nicky up?\" Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Winston and Nicky smiled broadly at that concept.  Soon all three men were in the dining hall as Nicky sprawled himself out on a large dining table.  Bringing a funnel out from under a cupboard, Winston attached a long hose to Nicky's mouth.  As Matt pulled the cap off the first jug nearest to him, Nicky reached over and rubbed the underside of Matt's protruding belly.  The sensation was electric and Matt nearly popped out of his underwear from his engorging member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Matt couldn't wait and started to pour the liquid down the funnel into Nicky's eager mouth.  At first, Nicky seemed like there wasn't enough liquid coming down the funnel.  By the time the jug was empty, so was the funnel and Nicky was making grunting noises that echoed out of the opening of the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ore.  Ore.\" Nicky tried to say more but without the usage of his lips, all he could get out was the ending sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Matt was in a frenzy to pour more and more into Nicky's waiting mouth, and every once in a while he'd take a few swigs of the drink himself.  After about thirty minutes and five gallon jugs of liquid, Nicky was finally slowing down.  But much to Matt's dismay, Nicky wasn't changing.  Not a single ounce gained, nor did his muscles shrink into the fat.  Even Winston looked shocked and confused.  Neither of them said anything to Nicky as he looked as if he was ecstacy.  Soon Nicky held up one of his pudgy hands, as a signal he was done.  Matt surveyed the damage and noticed that Nicky had consumed nearly nine gallons of this liquid all on his own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the funnel out of his mouth and sitting up rapidly, he suddenly spoke in shock. \"I'm still the same.  Why ain't I fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I---I don't know.\"  Winston looked bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to his feet, Nicky padded around shaking his already sizeable belly.  \"I'm still just the same.  Why ain't I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large gurgling noise was eminating from Nicky's gut, and he then let out a massive belch.  Nicky's chest vibrated from the force of the sound resounding from his swollen gut.  Then what happened next, astounded all present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Matt, it reminded him of all of the sudden morphing pictures on the internet he swooned over.  To Winston, who was a bit older, he was reminded of a comic character he grew up with:  the Hulk.  Only instead of just muscle, Nicky was packing on fat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin mere moments, Nicky seemed to expand all over.  First, it seemed the room actually shrank, but in reality, Nicky grew three more inches.  His face expanded underneath the bushy beard sprouting from his chins, and his neck nearly disappeared into growing muscles and fat.  His shoulders broadened and rounded out.  His arms, instead of losing muscle, seemed to swell larger.  His pecs drooped some more but still retained their under muscle.  His gut though, expanded exponentially.  Before it merely jutted out over his clothing, now it looked as if someone had inflated it.  It was amazingly ballooning out from his chest and waist.  The chest hair bloomed down his stomach marking a path to his engorging member.  His expanding butt ripped the underwear from his body, and led to his legs that would easily support the weight of an elephant.  As his body grew, his feet did as well to balance his new accumulated size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the size of an actual bear found in the wilderness.  If Winston had not been behind Matt, he would have surely fallen to the floor in a dead faint of glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deeper southern voice eminated from Nicky's mouth, \"Now Matt, it's....\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt looked shocked.  He felt his face contort in fear a bit at being Nicky's size.  I couldn't imagine being that, well.... that massive!  Nicky's gigantic body loomed closer and closer with his big chest and huge arms slowly encompassing Matt's entire body.  As Matt's right ear pressed in between the two pecs, which had become mounds of muscle and lard, he could hear Nicky's heart beating fierce.  That organ must have grown with the rest of Nicky's body since the thump-thump, thump-thump was strong, fierce, but not at all irregular or fast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately,\" Winston sighed, \"there's no more Origuad left.  Nicky just drank the remaining tubs of it.  I'll have to make some more tomorrow because it will take a while for me to make another batch.  The Origuad has to set a bit overnight.  It becomes more potent once it sets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Nicky groaned as he released Matt to ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt fell about 6 inches to the ground and he realized how much larger Nicky had really gotten.  While he had always been taller than Matt, Nicky was truly a mountain of a man now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, boys,\" Winston said as he stretched, \"you had better be getting to be getting back to your cabin before this mist clears.  I'm afraid if any park ranger flies over head in a helicopter, they wouldn't be able to miss little Nicky here.\"  Winston powerfully patted Nicky's arm, which barely budged except for the small ripple from the layer of fat padding his upper arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Matt smirked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the remnants of clothing that now littered the ground, Nicky felt a draft around his legs and realized he was completely nude.  \"Winston,\" Nicky's voice seemed to bounce off the walls like a sonic boom, \"what about clothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" Winston said as he walked through the kitchen door, which he had to not only stoop but turn sideways to fit through, \"I'll see if Tim the cook can make some other clothes for you.  He has amazing sewing capabilities.  In the meantime, wrap a bed sheet around you waist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Nicky looked like he was genuinely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinston merely nodded as he disappeared into the kitchen.  The sound of a door closing told both Matt and Nicky that Winston had probably returned to his cabin for the recipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get you a sheet then,\" Matt smiled as he checked out his bunkmate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicky approached the door facing the direction of their cabin, he crouched to the doorway and realized he would have a hard time fitting through it.  After a few moments (and a serious sucking in of his gut) Nicky managed to force his way through the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt,\" Nicky sighed as he released his gut to its normal gargantuan proportions, \"we're gonna have to lay off on the Origuad for me.  Otherwise I'll never be able to fit into another doorway again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Matt smiled, \"maybe we should just make you grow so big that you can never leave our cabin again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's another thing,\" Nicky sounded a little down trodden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, baby?\"  Matt said rubbing his lover's hefty back side as they walked through the morning mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we going to fit into anything outside of this summer camp?  This is a great job and all, but where are the campers?  What will we do once we leave this place?  I mean I've gotta go home to Tennessee again, and you've gotta go back to your place.  What will we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know,\"  Matt seemed stunned to think about it.  He even stopped in his tracks for a few paces.  \"You're right.  We've been here nearly a week and there hasn't been any sign of campers or anything.  And... I don't know,\" Matt inhaled sharply, \"what we're going to do when this place closes for the summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both walked in silence until they reached their cabin again.  After another struggle with the door, which resulted in Matt actually pulling Nicky through the door into their cabin prompting a bit of laughter, they mostly sat in silence in their cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun began to rise in the sky, the mist didn't dissipate but turned into a heavy fog with dark cloud cover.  Nicky pulled a set of clean sheets from a small cupboard in the bathroom and wrapped himself up in it underneath his massive gut.  Matt made their mutual bed and tidied up the room.  All in silence.  Chirping birds and random woodland noises were heard through the cracked window, which allowed for a gentle breeze to circulate the air in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Nicky broke the silence, \"I don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Matt asked after he jumped from Nicky's booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what we have to do,\" Nicky said as he moved closer to Matt, \"I'm not leaving you.  I'll do whatever it takes, but I'm not losing you.  Besides, what's a little weight.  I mean we both could shed a few pounds and fit into normal society, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure, I mean--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just couldn't handle it, Matt,\" Nicky said, taking Matt's smaller but still big hands into his, \"I love you, babe.  I don't want to be away from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you--really?\"  Matt smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Nicky said in reassurance, \"and maybe Winston could find us some jobs.  I mean we're in the woods.  Surely there's a lumber yard or something nearby.  We both look like we could carry a tree trunk between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smacked Nicky's legs through the sheets, \"You mean these things?  Nicky, you are a tree.  Maybe you're right, but what if--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky stopped Matt's worries when he quickly, but gently grabbed the back of Matt's head and brought it closer to his with the lips interlocking in a sweet, powerful kiss.  Both of their heads swam in passion, and their body temperatures' rose.  Until....</span></div></div>",

Then a voice speaks up, \"Hello, boys?\"  Winston's voice booms through the earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt pulls his head away momentarily and then returns his ear to the phone, \"Yes, Winston, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, have I got some news for you!\"  Winston said joyfully, \"I was looking through the recipe and found a transcription in it that I hadn't fully translated from the original Viking language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Nicky asked, but Matt shooed him to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it say?\"  Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says that once you've partaken of this Origuad, you shall remain a blood bred Viking forever.  Isn't that great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  Matt inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean that you'll be able to be Vikings with me forever.

You see in its hayday Vill Oxen was very self sufficant.  We gathered and grew our own food, built our own towns and homes, and lived as a city away from other civilization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Matt's face was slowly graced with a joyful expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my dear boy,\" Winston laughed loudly on the other end of the line, \"would you both be happy in joining this town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Matt started, \"let me talk this over with Nicky and I'll call you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your times in deciding, boys, take your time.

His eyes traced his large outline every single detail of it, especially the newly sized \"member\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky placed his large, puffed hands on Matt's shoulders, which had grown larger than Matt's shoulders, looked down and deeply said, \"Lets go find Winston.\" A large smirk grew on his face, his fat cheeks puffed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile grew on Matt's face just at the thought of being as big, or even bigger then Nicky. He quickly rushed to the door. He was a few steeps away when he heard a loud \"thud\". Turning around he saw the Nicky could no longer fit throw the door. Nicky sucked in his gut but his enormous body was now far to big to even try that. His \"member\" just waved back and forth hitting his thick hairy thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I will just have to stay here.\" A small look of disappointment grew on Nicky's face.

I promise\" Winston stared straight into Matt's eyes. \"You just gatta wait a little longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt bit his lip, his body was telling him to just grab it and drink, but his head told him not to. \"Okay, I will wait.\" He said walking away disappointed, \"But it better be the best one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me it will!\" Winston shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10X bigger...\" Matt repeated to himself as he walked back. \"10X\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Matt had reached the cabin he heard a strange noise.

His eyes were closed, mouth wide opened. \"AH!!\" He moaned, \"Ah, what-what ah- happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was in complete shock. He stood still, his huge body making no movement. \"What, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't-ah-AH- know. It happened shortly after you le-ah-ah-AH-eft!\" His huge body was pulsing up and down, thudding the bed harder onto the ground. \"I just felt it grow I tried to stop it but it has-ah it has a mind of it ow-OWWWNN!\" His voice boomed with  that last moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked at Nicky and noticed that he was not under any sheets, just completely naked on top of the bed. And what was shocked Matt even more was seeing how big Nicky's \"member\" had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had grown 2X the giant size it was before, and even thicker. It shot straight out, between his gut and bugling sack. But the strange thing was that Nicky was not rubbing or touching it at all, in fact his hands were spreed across the bed, yet he acted as if in sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need, I need to fuck you..\" Nicky said softly, his deep voice spread through out the room. \"Ple-ple-ple-AHH_se.\" His mouth opened wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt quickly  undressed and through himself on top of Nicky. The new found width of Nicky's Penis was so great that Matt was barley able to fit it in. It was far to long to fully fit, but Matt tried his best to suck on it, but was cut off by Nicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't want you to suck it, I want it to be in you.\" His face seemed as if in a sexual trance. Pushing himself up he forced Matt on the bed, with his butt in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think it will fit...\" Matt said with his head turned to face Nicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a trance look in his eyes, Nicky smirked and softly said, \"Yes it will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned around and waited for it, then he felt a sudden thrust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" Matt's ass tightened, he could no longer speak, the enormous size was for to much. It barley went in and Matt' s ass was tight as rock. On his back he felt Nicky's enormous body on him, his gut pounding on his back, his large boobs jiggling, and the enormous dick running back and forth within his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, oh OH!\" Nicky's deep moans of freedom boomed far out of the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This- this is a little-- strange\" Matt cried out, he could fell Nicky's hard breathing against his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, I need to go deeper, deeper.\" Nicky then rapidly moved his hard, long, thick dick deeper into Matt's ass. Nicky then felt a sudden stop to his dick, he seemed to have reached the limit of Matt's body. \"No I need more!\" Nicky's dick was only 1/3rds in. He continued his thrusting, and soon reached the tip of his orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even removing his penis Matt's ass oozed out semen. Nicky  slowly removed his dick, which was decreasing in size, yet still enormous, and pushed himself up. Matt laid on the bed, his ass in the air, and filled with semen. Both were breathing hard, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky's face had a huge smile, his eyes slowly coming back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's mind was racing. \"That was...strange it hurt, but yet I loved it.\" He thought. \"What happened to Nicky? Will that happen to me?\" he laid and drifted to this thought. \"I wouldn't mind it, actually I would like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he felt a great force lift him up. Nicky was holding Matt up from his armpits and lifted him several inches from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...why aren't you bigger?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Winston said he didn't have it ready, to wait till tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

Matt then looked eye level at Nicky, his face meeting only to Nicky's chest. His boobs were covered in a forest of wheat colored hair, actually Nicky's entire body was extremely hairier then before. \"I just...cant be that big...what about our lives out of here?\" Matt's voice was cracking, he fought to hold back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you fell that way...\" Nicky's voice sounded cold and harsh. \"But you must get bigger like me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky placed his huge, plump hands on Matt' shoulders.

Get off---of---m-e\" Matt could hardly breath underneath his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick reached down and grabbed the phone. His pudgy fingers could no longer hit an individual button, instead he used a pencil that was next to it to dial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Winston? Its me Nicky, I need you to bring some Origuad right now.\" Nicky was emotionless and cold in his tone. His deep voice boomed around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt couldn't hear Winston and was to out of breath to cry for help. All he could do was hear Nicky's half of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats great! Can you leave it outside of the door? Thanks.\"  Nicky hung up the phone and let a large long sigh of relief. \"It seems that Winston had a few tubs of Origuad left in his cabin, so he will bring those for now and keep making the batch for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's heart dropped. He couldn't think of living a life that massive. Nicky could no longer live in the outside world, his body was extremely noticeable, and clothes could no longer fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, once you're bigger like me you will love it. Trust me.\" Nicky, still on top of Matt, faced toward the door. \"I love being like this in fact I want to be even bigger, but I need you to change with me.\" Nicky now was looking down at his newly grown \"member\". He hadn't seen it in so long, and now at its new size he was vary proud of it and wanted to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a deep rumble that vibrated the bed. Matt jerked at the sound of it, Nicky seemed un-phased by it, he merely looked down at swollen gut. He then stretched out his arms, opened his mouth wide and suddenly let out an enormous belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPP!!!\" It seemed to be like a mini earth quake. \"Oh yeah!\" Nicky let out a huge grin of accomplishment and scratched his hairy chest of lard. Matt was in complete shock. \"Just wait till I get even bigger!\" He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the door they herd a loud hard \"thud\". Nicky looked up and lifted himself from on top of Matt. Waddling his was to the door Matt laid still even though he could try to run but he was to out of breath from the weight of the new Nicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, yes this should be enough.\" Nicky giggled.

Picking up Matt as if he was tiny toy, Nicky threw him onto the bed. He moved his humongous body as close as he could, and smiled a sinister grin. Matt stared in horror at the giant human that stood before him as the Origuad moved closely to his lips. In a last attempt to keep his body the way as it is, Matt trashed himself violently against Nicky, but his puny body was no match for the monstrous bear that was once his friend. All Nicky had to do was press his palm against Matt's chest, and use his thumb and middle finger to pry open the mouth. Unable to do anything else, Matt gulped down the lardy liquid substance. <br>\r\nAs soon as the mixture hit his tongue, Matt began to down the Origuad. When he had finished the first barrel, he yelled out loud,\"MORE!!\"<br>\r\nExcited that things were going the way that he had expect them to go, Nicky grabbed the closest container of Origuad. He ripped the top off and poured it down Matt's throat. <br>\r\nMatt greedily drank the juice, and from the look in his eyes, Nicky sees that he wants more. Before Matt finishes the barrel, Nicky takes the lid off the last one and put it against Matt's lips as soon as he finishes the previous one. <br>\r\n\"BBBBUUUURRRPPPP!!!\" <br>\r\nThe sound echoes through out the cabin when all of the Origuad inside Matt.

His arousal reaching collasal levels, he licked his lips and suddenly saw Matt for what he was, a pig. A big fat piggy just waiting and begging to be fed more. There was a lust in Matt's eyes, an insatiable hunger for more. <br>\r\nNicky flipped Matt over and removed Matt's pants, rubbing his hands along Matts thick, juicy ass. He was erect in an instant rubbing Matt's softening ass. With every breath Matt took, it was like he was expanding, inflating with fat. Any trace of muscles disappeared under layers and layers and layers... Every curve of his body was thickening, every breath he took was becoming more forced until even his gasps were sounding more like grunts. <br>\r\nNicky couldn't take it anymore and ripped off his own pants, freeing his already painfully erect penis. Rubbing himself with his hand he plunged himself into Matt.<br>\r\n\"Squeal like a pig.\" Nicky said under his breath. Matt obliged, but not out of will. The force of the entry was so rough and intense that it sent a mixture of pain and pleasure coursing through his fattening body. As he yelled a chin dropped down from his face giving him a rounded, bloated look. His chest heaved again drooping so far down it was nearly touching the floor. His belly was already tracing along the ground and spreading out fast. He had no idea how fat he was getting, but unlike Nicky he wasn't developing muscles the same way. He was getting fat, and hairy. He was Nicky's pig. <br>\r\nNicky thrusted in and out, yelling and unleashing his wild sexual urges. Matt was in pain, but at the same time, his body was growing so quickly and intensely, that it was driving Nicky even more wild. <br>\r\nMatt wasn't sure how big he was, but by the time Nicky was done with him, he could hardly move. With his might, Nicky rolled him over on his side, and with much effort onto his back. <br>\r\nThere was one problem... Matt was still growing...</span></div></div>",

Matt gulped down the mysterious liquid as fast as he could, despite the bitter taste.  Finally, Tim removed the empty bottle and placed it aside.  Matt sighed in relief as the pressure was removed from his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better,\" He remarked, rubbing his still swollen but no longer growing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Matt...\" Tim muttered, scratching the back of his head, \"There are some side effects of the antidote you may want to know about.\"  Matt raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"  He inquired suspiciously.  Tim shrugged lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" He replied \"As I said, the original solution concentrated weight gain in the stomach area.  All the antidote does is redistribute weight gain all over the body.\"  Matt's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean-\" He started to say, before he was interrupted by a weird sensation flowing through his body.  Fat deposits began to grow across the length of Matt, excluding his bloated belly.  His thighs began to thicken with fat.  Slowly and steadily, they expanded outwards, growing wider and heavier.  Matt's fatty thighs cushioned out against the bed as the blubber grew and grew.  Soon, his jeans became immensely tight as his fattened thighs pressed against them.  His swollen legs began to rub together.  His large thighs bulged ahead of Matt's torso.  Pressure built up against the seams of his jeans and his underpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Matt's ass began to expand.  He already had a soft rear which curved out slightly from the back of his jeans.  Now, a steady stream of fat was being pumped into it, causing his buttocks to balloon out.  More and more fat built up until Matt's ass hang over the back of his fat thighs.  Combined with the expansion of his thighs, Matt's fattening buttocks placed even more pressure on his jeans and underpants, as the former became taut and the latter rode up the curves of his large ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll over his body, a similar process occurred.  Matt's arms became thick and heavy.  His cheeks rounded out and his face became more cherubic.  Fatty deposits spread out along his frame.  Even his already substantial gut surged out a little further, forcing Matt to wrench off his belt as his sagging gut pushed downwards.  Finally, the growing stopped, and Matt lay back on the bed, his fat body expanding inwards and outwards as he breathed heavily.</span></div></div>",

There seemed to be all types of people - mostly young, but some older too. Of the group of guys approaching from the beach, there were two things they all had in common - they were all blond, and they were all VERY fat!  Matt had played enough pick-up football in college to know that just being fat didn't stop you being an athlete, but MAN!  Matt figured each of the guys approaching him, clad only in swim trunks and towels, had to weight twice what he did - they definitely had the 'off-season' O-line look going on.  Certainly the polar BEAR swim was well named here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what were so many fat guys doing working at a summer camp? Matt wondered. For the fat campers who came, wouldn't it be better to have athletic counsellors like himself as role models?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the 'beach boys' got closer, Matt realised that he'd underestimated their weights, if anything - so what were all these fat guys doing here.  Just as he and the leader of the group of swimmers, Matt blurted out, \"What are you fat guys doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front guy halted, as did all the blond bear-like guys behind him - and up close, Matt's brain noted, they really did look like blond bears, and the one leading them had to be pushing 400 pounds.  \"I could ask you the same, skinny guy!\" this first of the blond guys retorted.  \"We're camp counsellors, just like you.  It takes all kinds to run a camp, and we just happen to be the BIG kind!\" he continued, grinning.  \"Maybe someday you'll join us in the big leagues, eh what?\" he added, and one big padded paw - oops, hand - reached out and patted Matt on his flat stomach.  The big bear rolled back into motion and Matt watched as the whole gang of them disappeared into a washroom building, only to reappear moments later in shorts and t-shirts, their swim trunks carried in their towels.  Again, the huge guy was leading them, and he stopped beside Matt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, skinny, good to see you again.  I guess our massive good looks just have you rooted to the spot.

Before long he had found a trail that seemed to lead into the middle of the woods. Thinking it was a main trail he followed it through the thick birch woods in an attempt to find more buildings. Soon he found himself at an old fashioned well that was situated by a small cluster of cabins. He continued past the quaint cabins and the outhouse to a trail that appeared to go up into the mountain. Intrigued by this new path he decided to follow it. The path itself was dirt, like the last one, but was a much lighter shade that seemed to suggest that it was important for something. <br>\r\nThe scenery was gorgeous with thick forests and lush greenery abounding, adding a subtle earthy smell to the air. There were also quite a number of animals around, but most were larger then MAtt was used to.

Every inch of him had fine brown hair and on his face he wore a neatly trimmed goatee that gave him a very handsome face.

He tried not to blush but nodded his consent. Winston took a cigar out of his cigar box on the counter and gave one to him as they continued into the kitchen. After showing Matt how to smoke one Matt took his first puff. He coughed and gagged for a minute which made Winston laugh. He handed Matt a glass of water and told him not to worry about it. Still embarassed he tried again and managed to breathe it in without choking himself. Winston slapped him on the back in a congratulatory way and Matt felt a mild sense of accomplishment.<br>\r\n\"That'll put hair on your chest.\" He said with a chuckle.

Soon Matt found his balance a bit off as he made his way through the house. It wasn't until Winston finally sat Matt down at a table when he noticed something was up. As he sat he felt a tremndous pressure release from his pants. When he looked down he saw that his stomach was now distended a good foot and a half in front of him. He was shocked and soon realised that he was so fat that he had blown off the button to his jeans! Matt felt his new gut to find it rather soft and extremely pliable. He looked to Winston who now just sat in his chair leaning back displaying his huge gut and rubbed it lusciously. Matts mouth watered as he got himself up to examine his new body in one of Winston's full length mirrors. <br>\r\n\"What did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\" <br>\r\nMatt examined himself. His once tight and flat body had expanded to huge proportions. He looked like a completely different person. His face had exploded and now had a double chin, that is he would have had he not grown in a thick and full beard. His stomach hung a good foot over his blown out pants. His chest had formed two large man breasts that stretched his shirt tight. His back now formed two giant love handles that resembled a giant tire around his waist. His shirt now barely covered his chest and his gargantuan stomach that was once smooth and flat was now inflated and hairy as Winstons must be. His arms, once defined, were now flabby and as hairy as the rest of him. His legs now resembled tree trunks and stretched his jeans to max capacity. Slowly he saw Winston appear behind him with another cigar. <br>\r\n\"You didn't answer me boy. Do you like it?\"</span></div></div>",

Soon Matt couldn't even run anymore and collapsed in a pile. He felt bigger, much bigger, and it seemed the further away he got, the more he would grow. He looked down at his massive chest and estimated himself to weigh more then three hundred pounds by now. He sighed. Confused and cold he figured he had two choices. He could try going back, maybe if running away had caused weight gain, perhaps going back would reduce it. Or he could make a break back to the camp. It wouldn't be that much further from where he was now... Perhaps it was best to just sit and wait for Winston to come and find him. Surely Winston would know what to do.

It seemed with every step he took things were becoming more and more difficult. He was surprised to see the mansion not very far from where he was. He had traveled uphill for so long he hadn't realised that the mansion was still easily reachable. And the mountain seemed to slope right down too it. Grateful Matt found the downwards slope much easier to travel through and arrived at the gates in a very short time. Looking down he wasn't sure how big he was now but it was clear that his weight hadn't decreased. With a sigh he breathed out causing one of the buttons to fly off into the distance. Matt looked down and saw for the first time his flabby, fairy chest and was shocked by how it looked. Had he gained weight coming back too? Desperate Matt stormed through the gate and began to waddle towards the door, with each step a button flew off of his shirt until he was at the door of the mansion. By the time he reached his pants were so tight that they unbuttoned and the sides of his pants were splitting. <br>\r\n\"Winston!\" He yelled banging one flabby fist on the door. Every move he made now sent shockwaves through his thick, fleshy body. He felt so different now it was shocking to him. \"Winston! Come out here!\"</span></div></div>",

His body jiggled with each effort to lift himself up. His tree trunk legs slapping each other with each movement made him waddle side to side, causing his ass to swing into the door. His belly was so big, that his buttoned shirt was no completely unbuttoned, flapping at his sides, and his white undershirt just filled out to his above belly, revealing a hairy belly with a huge naval. His Pants were so tight now that he couldn't zip jis pants anymore. His pants button were the only thing holding them  together, and barely. If he exhaled too strongly, that button would become a speeding bullet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed Winston in the mansion, staring at his tight ass the whole way.

Make yourself at home for now,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Winston went off into his walk in closet, Matt began to undress from his now to small clothes. He unbuttoned his pants first. The minute he did that, his belly just bounced forward and sagged over his waistline, revealing even more belly. He had to struggle to take his pants off since they were sticking to his now enormous and hairy legs. Then, when He tried to take his shirts off, he realized that his arms were simply to big; he couldn't take his shirt off without trappin himself in his own shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I'll be wearing this anymore,\" Matt thought. So he just grabbed the center of the undershirt and ripped it with all his might, revealing his bare chest. Where there used to be a pair of rock hard hairless pecs was now a pair of soft, bouncy, and hairy moobs. He examined his new body. He picked up his moobs and let it bounce on top of his belly, causing a ripple of fat. He looked at his hairy arms that could be considered bear arms now.He looked at his mammoth legs that could squeeze a watermelon now without effort. He felt his soft, tender ass, squishy and juicy in his plump hands. He didn't know why but he kind of liked this new Matt. It felt right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I thinking!\" Matt quickly thought. He decided to just lie down  on his side and wait for Winston to come back, ignoring his urges.

Winston, not expecting this, got the wind knocked out of him and let out a big fart from the pressure of the sudden weight on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the smell of manly musk,\" Matt said in a seductive voice. In response to Winston's addition to the ambiance, Matt let a big fart escape his cheeks, causing them to slap each other in a reverberating manner. Winston moaned in response to Matt and shoved his hands under the already stretched out elastic of Matt's underwear. He squeezed his ass and ran his hands all over them, feeling the hot sweat that came from it. Winston wrapped his legs around Matt as much as he possibly could, barely having his toes meet on the other side, and squeezed with all his might. Matt groaned and gave Winston the biggest bear hug he could muster, causing Winston to moan in response. Matt then, being bold, ran his mouth along Winston's hairy chest, licking and kissing every part he could muster. He sucked Winston's moobs like he was a baby calf trying to get milk, and Winston just patted his head and moaned in ecstasy. Winston pulled his head up and started sucking on Matt's beard  and went down from there, sucking and breathing all over Matt's chest.

Ken was so big, that Matt could feel the ground shake a little with each step he took, even seeing his own body slightly jiggle! Matt just wanted to tackle Ken and caress that massive ball of fat! Seeing the wild look that Matt was giving him, Ken walked up to Matt and slowly pushed his belly into Matt's face. Matt's senses immediately went crazy: Ken's overpowering musk filled hit nostrils, the hair on his belly tickled his face, the heat radiating from his enormous body caused him to sweat profusely. Matt ran his hands all over his belly like a mad man, eventually reaching around to his giant ass. He squeezed with all his might and pulled Ken as close to him as he could, enveloping his whole face in his fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yah.

They both were caressing his whole body and squeezing him tighter and tighter, bringing Matt closer and closer to the point of no return. With one final squeeze, Matt released everything he had. They all collapsed on top of the bed, which immediately broke down from the combined weight of the three gargantuan men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that was fun and all, but know let's get down to business,\" Ken said, maneuvering his belly unto his lap, and placing one hand on top, while placing the other one on Winstons's mountain of a belly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Matt's belly was soft and squishy and spread out all around him. His limbs were almost unmovable because he wasn't adjusted to this much fat on him. Winston walked over to him with a bottle of baby oil that appeared to glow a very small amount. He opened the bottle and rubbed it all over Matt's cushy belly. \"You'll learn to love being fat...regardless of your own free will.\" Winston smiled as he rubbed the oil on liberally...he was obviously getting a lot of pleasure from this. \"What have you done to me?\" demanded Matt. Winston laughed a little bit and said, \"You'll find out soon.\" Matt was struggling when trying to get up; there were no ropes or chains restraining him...but only his own weight. As he struggled, he jiggled and vibrated just trying to move an inch. Suddenly, he felt weightless and a strange feeling of ecstasy came over him and his stomach felt a tingle. He no longer wanted to leave and shot of eroticism went through his body and gave him goosebumps. Winston turned around to find Matt no longer struggling. \"Well...how do you now Matt? Do you like this?\" Matt felt light and erotic and said, \"Yes...I like this now.\" Winston smiled as he looked at the IV still in Matt's inflated arm. \"Do you want me to take the IV out and make you light and buff again?\" Matt was staring up at the mirrors just adoring his giant belly covered in oil. \"Please, never change me back. I want to stay here forever.\" <br>\r\nWinston then...   </span></div></div>",

Winston just laid, stomach down, right on Matt, but Matt didn't feel pain from Winston's giant bear belly. He then tried to wrap himself like a starfish around Matt with his arms grabbing behind his shoulders and his feet wrapping around Matt's legs. They moaned and both got really hard from the combined mass of the two of them. \"Well, your almost perfect my dear Matt...there's just one more thing missing.\" Winston slipped off of Matt which made Matt's belly bounce up.

Matt gladly accepted breathing in it's pungant smell. Suddenly he felt Winstons hairy paw wrap around his belly. He tried to protest but before he knew it Winston was giving him one hell of a belly massage. Matt sat down on a nearby chair as Winston worked his magic.

It smelled almost classy in its own way, and surprisingly comforting. Winston began to emphasize small things in the rooms, like chess sets and elegant crests. Matt caught his reflection in one of the cabinet windows when he noticed he looked slightly different. His clean shaven face looked to be much darker, like he hadn't shaved in a week or two. He brushed it off though. After all the room was very dark. Soon they found themselves at a hall full of portraits. Winston explained every one as they walked through the hall. He was finding the tour fascinating and as the cigar in his mouth burnt out Winston made sure to offer him another one. <br>\r\n\"Would you like to see some of the rooms here? I wouldn't want you to leave until the storm stops.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you know the way back to the camp?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I do. I'd be glad to show you back. But that might not be for a few hours. Are those clothes wet at all?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah a bit. I think they must be, they're feeling alot tighter then normal.\" Winston smiled and showed Matt where the bathroom was so he could get changed. MAtt thanked him and walked into the exquisite looking bathroom. The bathroom was huge and expensive looking. Matt walked to the sink as he took off his shirt and pants and washed his hands which were still filthy from the dirt hike. That's when he first noticed the change. His hands looked much thicker then before and he had thick black hair sprouting from his arms that had not been there before. He looked at both his hands shocked at the change. They still moved and felt the same even thought they looked much thicker then he had ever seen. He then looked in the mirror and noticed the rest of his change. He was shocked because his face which had been clean shaven this morning now looked to have a beard growth as thick as a middle aged man. He looked closer at the mirror and swore he looked older. He brushed his thick hands over top of his beard and enjoyed the thickness and feeling of it. However after a moment or two he realised that his entire chest and stomach was covered in this thick black hair. Shocked he began to feel it to find that he was also much thicker then before. Unsure what to make of everything he tried to leave but soon found the door blocked by Winston. <br>\r\n\"You're looking good.\" He said with a smile around his cigar. <br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Was all he could say. After all he didn't dislike it. <br>\r\n\"Would you like some clothes?\" He asked holding out a beer for him. Matt eyed the beer for a second and took the beer with a smile.<br>\r\n\"I don't really think I need one. Do you?\" Matt took the cigar that he still had in his mouth out and took a long chug of the beer.<br>\r\n\"I like the way you're thinking.\" He said with a crooked smile. <br>\r\n\"Is this permanent?\" Matt asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"If you want it to be it can be.\" Winston said smiling. <br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" </span></div></div>",

He had the chest of a body builder with arms that followed suit.

My nose had flattened out, forming a small pig snout that stuck out from my face. My once beautiful face was now the face of a true pig.

Matt always seemed to be entranced with Winston's belly and when it jiggled...he felt weightless and not in control anymore. As he pondered his thoughts, he wondered if this was really a better life: no stress, no job, just him and Winston living in a mansion. \"Ok, ask me questions because I know you have some on your mind right now.\" Matt replied, \"What are you and how did the computer make me this pile of blubber.\" Winston thought for a second but then said to Matt, \"Well, first thing is that I am a professional hypnotist and have powers that people cannot understand.

Winston began mushing his 450 pound belly in Matt's face and moving side to side massaging his face. Matt got so hard that he made low groaning sounds. Winston heard these as a sign that his hypnosis was working.<br>\r\nHe began thrusting in and out on Matt's face with his belly, which was hairy and sweaty, until Matt was under a permanent trace. \"Can you hear me Matt?\" asked Winston deeply.

Matt nodded slighty and Winston smiled. \"Listen carefully...you love big giant men...you love being huge and chubby and you always desire to be bigger...you love big, soft, obese, fat bellies and you get extreme sexual pleasure from them...\" Matt was in a trance, and his eyes were open but he wasn't there mentally...it was pure ecstasy for Matt, but if he had known what was really going on, he would have been out of here in a second. <br>\r\nWinston continued to repeat this while shoving his belly in Matt's face, naked.

He tried not to breathe but it didn't stop his stomach from churning loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not in the mood for sweets,\" Russ continued, \"I bet you'll want some of this.\" Matt turned around and saw a big, steaming plate holding a massive smoked ham, surrounded on both sides by equally juicy piles of ribs and a tray of sausages.

The nearest highway had to at least be 20 miles away and this sure wasn't a residential area. Sure enough, though, there were cars in the parking lot and it didn't appear derelict. Matt thought of turning back but the sky had rumbled tremendously and the rain fell down much harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the building, he noted it's rustic, cabin design and saw a sign reading <b>\"Jack's Flapjacks!\"</b> Even before he opened the door, he was overwhelmed by the sweet scent of maple syrup and cooking batter. Matt's mouth started to water, but he tried his best to ignore it. After all, this didn't look like a place that knew what portion control meant. He went inside with a soft jingle from a bell hanging by the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior didn't disappoint. The walls were covered with some typical home country goods and pictures. The tables and booths were all made of maple wood that had been roughed up over the years. And in the far wall was a giant stone fireplace. Even though it was summer, a crackling fire was burning. Matt didn't mind as the warmth enveloped him, almost making him drowsy. He became aware just how wet he had gotten by the time he got inside. His t-shirt, already snug, clung to his broad chest and abdomen. The white fabric was almost transparent when it touched his skin. His jeans had soaked up a bit and felt heavy on his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waiter, originally with his back to Matt, turned around and greeted, \"Welcome to Jack's! Where your fill is never enough.\" Matt smiled sheepishly, feeling out of place in his wet clothes. \"Looks like you got left in the wash.\" The waiter said and had a chuckle. He didn't appear too much older than Matt, probably 20 or 21. He was rather lean, except for a small paunch forming in his abdomen. <i>A few extra sit ups and that would be gone</i>, Matt thought. \"Yeah, I was taking a walk when it started to rain...\" Matt explained, trailing off and unsure what to do. He barely had any money on him. \"I'm Nate,\" the waiter introduced himself, \"and you'll catch cold in those clothes.\" Matt shifted uncomfortably. \"Why don't you come in the back and we'll find you something to wear while these dry.\" Nate motioned Matt to follow him into the kitchen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two went through a large swinging door into the most massive kitchen Matt had ever seen. Huge pancakes were cooking to perfection. Crispy golden waffles were coming out of irons and being drizzled with chocolate and whipped cream. Eggs and bacon and potatoes by the dozen were bubbling away. It was all carefully monitored by a husky man in an apron. Matt was amazed as the aroma had intensified back here. He heard his stomach gurgle slightly. It must have been the smells of the food because Matt swore he wasn't hungry a few moments ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jack!\" Nate hollered at the busy chef, \"We got a wet one!\" Jack made sure nothing was on the verge of burning before bringing his attention to Matt. The man had to be at least 6'4\" and built like linebacker. Broad shoulders, large bulging biceps, and a barrel of a chest. Matt could even see his legs were muscular as the man's jeans clung to his huge thighs. His hair was a dark auburn red with a handsome but distinctive face. And a jaw, Matt observed, you could break a hammer on. The only thing that seemed somewhat out of place was the belly. A decent sized beer gut was hiding under the white apron, making it bulge slightly. Even fit and muscular Matt felt meek. \"Welcome!\" Jack said with a friendly smile, shaking Matt's hand firmly. \"Cool place.\" Was all Matt could muster and Jack let out a hearty laugh. Matt was quick to see Jack's belly jiggle slightly. \"Go get him some dry clothes, Nate\" Jack told the waiter. Nate went into a back room and returned with a printed baseball t-shirt that read \"Jack's Flapjacks\" across the chest. He also had a pair of old school style basketball shorts that said the same. Nate was smirking \"Sorry if they're a little roomy. It's the only sizes we had.\" Nate handed Matt the clothes. Matt read the inside label and saw it was an XL. \"We don't really get a lot of smalls and mediums around <i>here</i>.\" Nate added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt went into the back room, which appeared to be a small lounge for employees. There were boxes of the shirts, ranging from XL to XXXXL. Matt was astounded. He didn't even know sizes went up that high. He peeled off his wet clothes and rubbed his hand on his taunt abs. It was amazing to think people would let themselves get that big. Though Matt had to admit he occasionally admired thicker guys with confidence. In fact, he thought back to Jack's bulging gut under his apron. The string was cutting into the fat slightly. Matt was almost lost in thought when he snapped himself back. He slipped his wet jeans off as well as his briefs, then slide the shorts on. At least they fit properly, Matt thought as they cupped his ass nicely. Maybe he would try to take a pair back. But the shirt was another issue. He put it on and it hung very loose on him. Almost like a tent. He felt silly. It was only temporary anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came back out of the room. \"Almost a perfect fit.\" Jack told Matt. <i>He must be joking</i>, Matt thought, but smiled anyway. Jack went back to the ovens, exclaiming to Matt \"Now how about some grub!\"</span></div></div>",

And I'm sure of sending you out there in this weather. Have a seat a and I'll send you one of my specialties.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt thought it over slightly. He was hungry.

I just need a minute or two to get back on my feet. It takes a lot of energy.\"<br>\r\nShelly looks at me and laughs, her boobs bouncing almost as much as my fat when I am walking at a medium pace. I managed to get back on my feet with the help of Shelly and her small child Jessica. I took awhile to catch my breath, my chest in pain as my heart felt like it was about to explode out of my chest. I looked up to get a better look at Shelly. She had a tight stomach. Not my normal type really. Her daughter was more my type, she was a very chubby girl for her age. I guessed at least 190 pounds, which was astonishing for only a 5 year old girl.<br>\r\n\"Just what do you think you're staring at?!\" Shelly shouts at me. She had caught me looking at her breasts.<br>\r\n\"Nothing at all, I was just catching my breath. I require a lot of it, if you couldn't tell.\"<br>\r\nShe looked at me and smirked. Maybe she wanted me to look? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way to my cabin. The door wasn't very large, obviously not for weight advantaged people. I looked up and down at the door frame and let out a long sigh. I went for it. I thought I could make it, but I suddenly came to a halt. My fat rolls were caught in the door. I struggled a bit to try and free myself, but it wasn't happening. I didn't know my own strength. I had tried to get in with too much force, and I was now stuck in the door frame. What am I going to do? I'm exhausted, and extremly hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey again.\" someone said from behind me. A familiar voice. It was Shelly's. <br>\r\n\"Oh, hello again Shelly. What brings you here?\" I said trying to keep it cool.<br>\r\n\"Just passing by... it looks like you're in a bit of trouble.\" she said as she moved in closer.<br>\r\n\"Who, me? No I'm just hanging out is all.\"<br>\r\n\"Looks like you are stuck to me...\" she said as she leaned over from side to side to see my huge fat rolls wedged in the doorway. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry though, we can fix that.\" she said, as she took something out of her bag. What did she mean? What was she about to do?<br>\r\nShelly had a tub of butter in her hands. She opened the top and reached in to grab a large clump of it. She sat the container down and then put her hands together to smear the butter on them both. She then reached for my love handles and started to smear the butter on them, massaging them. It felt amazing, and I was getting hot. Her boobs pressed against my back. I started to sweat, my shirt getting soaked from my fountain-like underarms unleashing a heavy stream of sweat. <br>\r\n\"How does that feel?\" she said in a rather seductive voice, her hand motions getting more aggressive.<br>\r\n\"It feels wonderful Shelly.\" I said, just barely. I was in a state of ecstasy. The butter trickled down my fat. The sweat ran down my body and into the butter, causing a mixture of both sweat and butter, making it almost greasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you ok?\" Jessica said. I jerked a little bit and looked around me. I must have fallen asleep in the doorway. The wood beneath me was completely wet. My shirt and shorts seemed as though I had just been swimming with them all. I tried to shake myself a bit to attempt to free myself. It worked! The sweat was just enough to free me from the door. My shirt tore on the door frame as I came crashing down with a tremendous thud. I'm sure the cabins next to me heard the noise. That really took it out of me. I rolled over on my back, and just sat there. Jessica was standing in the door looking at my now naked chest, my moobs jiggling as I tried my best to get enough air inside of my 600 pound body.<br>\r\n\"Wow, you look just like a beached whale that we saw at the beach a few weeks ago!\" Jessica said, her eyes wide open in amazement. I smiled and looked at her.<br>\r\n\"Why... why thank you young Jessica. It is rare that I get such a lovely compliment.\" I struggled to say. My eyes grew heavy and I felt light headed. I wasn't getting enough air. I tried to speed up my breathing, but it was too late. I had passed out on the cabin floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I came to, I was greeted by...</span></div></div>",

Rober\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d exclaimed Robert, \u201cOh I was jus..\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGOULET\u201d the now annoyingly senile entertainer said.<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Ok Johnny. It\u2019s alright. I am here to assess the situation and determine if you are indeed gifted with what they call, \u2018an overabundance of gifts\u2019 for the festival.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, which caused my moobs to sway like the utters of a meandering cow. The slight breeze from the doorway behind Robert Goulet gave me a chill. The never-ending sweat was infusing with the cool breeze to lower my core temperature which unfortunately firmed up my glistening belly and substantially reduced the size of my moobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, overabundance of gifts, are you referring to?\u201d I said with a smile on my face as I became slightly aroused by the thought of my fatty body. My pants grew tighter <br>\r\n\u201cAnd who are they that you are referring to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re highly attractive sacks of fatty tissue in your abdomen, legs and arms. They usually like a lot under the chin and around the neck, but you\u2019ll do just fine\u201d Robert winked twice, where one wink would have been enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was wondering if I should be worried or afraid of whom Robert was referring to. He seemed to dodge the question. Second time\u2019s the charm, eh? I\u2019ll ask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Robert. Who was it that was interested in my provocative gifts?\u201d  I said. Pretending as if I had long hair, I flicked my neck to purposefully cause my moobs and gut to sway like a plastic grocery bag filled with cottage cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ll find out shortly\u201d Robert said, as he helped me off the floor. I wondered why he was unwilling to assist my horribly flaccid and immobile body previously, standing with his crotch about 5 inches from my face for the last few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe began walking towards the door.

We shouldn't waste anymore time here, you are bound for much greater things.

I grabbed hold of the unicorn's back to attempt to climb on. I struggled for the first 5 minutes as I was not used to climbing things. The massive amounts of sweat that was pouring out of my fat body didn't help my cause. After 15 more minutes I finally managed to get on the unicorn, and immediately collapsing on it's back, winded from the journey to get up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up to find myself surrounded by darkness. I noticed the stars all around me. I tried moving my neck passed my known limits to check to the side of me. To my surprise I saw the planet Earth. It wasn't a dream after all, the unicorn had really taken me to space. What wonders would await me out in this vast universe? The best part is that out here I don't weigh a thing! Goodbye limitations of our planet, I was set to start gaining even more weight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mathew. You have awakened from your fat induced slumber.

Not because it seemed to just float there with what looked like it's own atmosphere, but because I was famished and the rolls of my stomach were speaking to me as if I was their huntsman and they were my hungry villagers. I couldn't remember the last time I went this long without eating. Maybe it was the fact I was in an oxygen deprived vacuum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to salivate vigorously causing the unicorn to neigh in discomfort. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, sir\" I stated, as I began wiping the saliva from the mane of the unicorn with my quivering belly. \"It's alright. It's just unicorns are known for being clean and pretty, is all\" said the unicorn as his galloping seemed to magically speed us up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting anxious and started squirming like the fat kid I was. I couldn't help myself. It was as if I was in the store rubbing ice cream all over my moobs already. And then it happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOO!!!\" screamed the unicorn as his course was already set by the small amount of thrust caused by his galloping.  I had fallen off of the back of the unicorn. My squirming could no longer be contained by my love-handles which acted as a saddle for these many hours. \"I cannot turn, for I have no wings! I AM NO PEGASUS. WHY CAN'T I BE A PEGASUS! WHY!?\" the unicorn screamed as he began to cry and float away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, I still had momentum from my morbidly obese body flopping off of the unicorn into space. Fortunately, I was headed in the direction of what may be the only thing that could save my sanity. Ben &amp; Jerry's, where I could gorge on as much ice-cream as my pre-pubescent heart could handle. I waved goodbye to the unicorn as he tipped his top hat to me like the gentleman he was. I knew I would see him again someday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I rolled, turned and fidgeted closer to the ice-cream parlor, I imagined the magnificent and alien space-ice-creams I would sample. I envisioned ice-creams made of glowing plasma and gaseous fumes rising from the cone of an alien ice-cream delicacy. And then. All of the sudden, I hit something. I thumped and rolled, like I do on a daily basis when I trip over my ankle fat. - It's pretty funny and I usually laugh at myself with others, because I'm like a turtle when it comes to getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greeeeetings sirhowmay, I, helpyou\" said this shadowy figure with an accent that resembled the sound my bowels make after adjusting to abundance of room within my abdomen after using the bathroom. <br>\r\n\"Oh hello. My name is Matt. I was looking to sample your ice-creams.\" I said with a slight stutter due to the fact I was at my fat camp hours earlier having my fat massaged by attractive women.<br>\r\n\"Ahyes, I also, likethenameMatt, I see. Yes, yes, yes, we do indeedhavethe icecream that you are interestedin\" the still cloaked figured stated, \"We also have, no. No you wouldn'tbeinterested in that.\"<br>\r\n\"Interested in what?\" I asked with as much of a joyful sound to my voice as I could considering I was struggling to even get to my knees. <br>\r\n\"We have a special. Thinkofit as a gameshow, that youcanpick multiple winnings\" he said rubbing his hand-less arms together.<br>\r\n\"Well what can I win? Is there something bad?\" I mustered as I was almost out of breath while coming to a standing position after this lengthy conversation.<br>\r\n\"All I can say. All I can say is that youeatall, of, the winnings you win\" as the shadowy figure pointed to a wall with two doors. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt follows behind Shelly, watching her fat thighs rub together as she wobbles towards the Main Dining Hall. Matt has always been attracted to larger women and Shelly was just his type. She was a very beautiful, and big, woman obviously weighing <b>over 300 hundred pounds</b>, most of it in her double stacked belly and wide thighs. Shelly has lovely tan skin giving her an almost caramel-like complexion, long wavy black hair tucked into a loose bun, and large lively green eyes. Despite Shelly's age(36), her face has shown no signs of age, sporting two fat checks with a very small chin on top of a second chin. To Matt, Shelly was a blubbery goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, Shelly, and Jessica enter the Main Dining Hall. Matt looks around the Main Dining in awe, surprised by the size of it. The Cafeteria/Main Dining Hall was the largest building at the campsite, with ceilings tall enough for an old tree to continue growing and long/deep enough to fit at least ten of the camper's cabins in. The dining hall and almost everything in it was made of wood, giving it an old cozy log house vide. The trio makes it halfway through the dining hall before they could hear a noise coming from the kitchen. Shelly lets out a sigh, knowing exactly what was making the noise and yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MINDY, your bubble butt better not be eating all the food,\" Shelly calls out playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman replies with the familiar sound of someone talking with their mouth full, \"Um, no... Of course not\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you get done, 'Not Eating' come out here and meet our newest concealer,\" said Shelly with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Shelly watch the kitchen door, hearing heavy steps behind it. Out the kitchen, entering the dining hall came a large woman, much larger than Shelly, with bright shoulder length orange hair and a spot of chocolate on the side of her round face. The redhead had to be at least <b>hundred pounds heavier</b> than Shelly, with most of her weight in her smooth round belly and breasts that were bigger than Matt's head. As the Redhead wobbles her way to Shelly with a nervous smile on her face, Matt could see a candy bar, poorly hidden between her breasts as they bounced uncontrollably. Shelly and the redhead spread their arms embracing each other in a hug. Matt couldn't help but feel a 'warm' sensation watching two obese beauties bumping bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly leans back, with the redhead still in her arms and giggles, \"Girlfriend, if you're going to lie, you have to get rid of evidence first\". Shelly take her index finger and wipes off the chocolate off the confused redhead's face. Shelly shows her chocolate covered fingertip to the guilty redhead just before sticking it in her own mouth to eat it. The girls laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" Said Shelly trying to hold back her laughs. She put her left hand on Matt's shoulder, keeping the right on the redhead's shoulder, \"Matt, I like ya to meet concealer Mindy, and Mindy, meet Matt\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to met you, Mindy,\" said Matt nervously holding out his right hand, prepared for a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be so formal were going to working together all summer long,\" replied Mindy giving Matt the softest hug he had ever received. Matt sank into Mindy's doughy body, deep enough to feel the candy bar she had hidden between her breasts. \"It's nice to meet you too,\" finishing her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt steps back, red-faced looks Mindy up and down. Mindy was a young woman(24) around Matt's age(22) and height with big blue eyes surrounded by chubby round face. Mindy's lovely bright orange hair was very noticeable, but not as much as her bountiful bosoms pushed together and upward due to a bra that was slightly too small. Like her breast, Mindy's soft extended belly would jiggle with any movement she made. Matt thought Mindy was one the biggest cuties he had seen in real life. Mindy was definitely Matt's type and he prayed that that first hug wouldn't be his last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that's out of the way. How about we get something to eat,\" asked Shelly holding her top belly fat roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH! Ice Cream\" squealed Jessica!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, ice cream,\" Mindy says repeating Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you Matt, want some ice cream,\" asking Shelly turning to Matt, growing impatient for the frozen treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'll just stick to a salad,\" answered Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" replied Shelly as all three girls wobble into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt enters the kitchen finding Mindy setting three large ceramic bowls, that seemed too big to not be a novelty, on a counter in the middle of the kitchen and Shelly carrying the biggest tub of vanilla ice cream he had ever seen. Shelly opens the tub as her daughter hands her an ice cream scoop the size of a garden trowel. As Matt gathers the fruits and veggies for his salad the girls were filling their bowls full of ice cream. Matt, hearing the sound of candy warper, turns around and sees Mindy pulling a candy bar out of her cleavage then breaking it apart into the ice cream. Shelly and Mindy moan in pleasure as they consumed their ice cream, distracting Matt as he chops veggies and giving him another 'warm' sensation. Matt finishes his salad and joins the girls, who have eaten more than halfway through their mountains of ice cream. Matt couldn't help but stare at the two ladies inhaling ice cream, wondering how none of them got brain freeze and how the small stools they're sitting on supported their weight. Watching Shelly and Mindy eat, it was more than obvious to see how these ladies grew to such girths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy was a slobby eater with bits of chocolate and ice cream around her mouth, eating faster than everyone. Mindy would lick the sides of her mouth between bites, while drops of melted ice cream rolled down her face and fall onto her breasts. At one point, Mindy pauses and lets out a small burp that Matt thought was hot. Mindy was a cute slob girl.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly ate at sound barrier breaking speed, eating mouthfuls of ice cream at a time causing her cheeks to look bigger than usual. Shelly use a large spoon, the size of a small spatula, to shovel in her mouth. The way Shelly ate gave her a competitive eater's feel, eating large sums of food in small amounts of time. Matt admires a woman who knew how to eat. Shelly was a woman who could eat far more than she let on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was refreshing,\" said Shelly with a pressured look on her face, rubbing her belly up and down with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" replies Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOD, I'm *burps* so STUFFED,\" said Mindy whose moans of satisfaction have turned to moans of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what you get for pigging out beforehand,\" said Shelly somewhat disgusted with Mindy's burp. \"Okay, the campers will be here soon and we have a meeting with Camp Chef Wanda and get our new uniforms, concealer June and Camp Cook Rosemary will be there too,\" continues Shelly as she wobbles her way around the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can get up without some help,\" replies Mindy turning to Matt and winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up, I don't want to be behind schedule,\" said Shelly as she and Jessica make their way out the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt standing at the sink watches Shelly walk out the kitchen door, then turns to a stuffed Mindy whose resting her hands on top of her slightly extended belly just under her breasts, still sitting at the counter. Matt wonders, what he should he do next? </span></div></div>",

He felt his head nod, as if in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy grinned, staring oddly intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Matt repeated at last as he swallowed, his lips curling up into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it, huh?\" Mindy gave a good-natured jab on the arm. \"That's just one of the bars. I can show you more later, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Matt repeated. Again. He rolled up the half-eaten bar in the wrapper and fumbled it into his pocket. \"You have a little...\" He gently stroked a finger along her plump cheek, wiping it clean of the ice-cream there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Mindy repeated, smirking. \"Well, let's not keep Wanda and Rose waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded as he opened the door for her, admiring her enormous physique before he followed her out.

He could see the first coaches in the distance; it would be a while yet before the campers arrived.
