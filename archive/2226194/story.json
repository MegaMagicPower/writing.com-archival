She finishes putting the finishing touches on the VR helmet, double and triple checking her work, \"This will be perfect. Soon as I put this on, I'll finally get to feel what it's like to be a cartoon.\" With a deep breath, she loads up the list of old cartoons and selects her favorite, Rescue Rangers. \"Well... here we go.\" She nervously puts on the helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately she knows something is wrong. She is unable to move her body. On the screen, an image of her appears, and next to it the characters start rapidly cycling by. It finally stops on Gadget and the words \"Closest match confirmed. Initiating change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didnt program this\" she thinks, but before she can think further, her body starts uncontrollably spasming. She blacks out wondering what she did wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby feels herself face down on the ground. She tries to get up, but her face seems to be stuck, \"Eww! Did I land on some gum?\" After trying a few times to push herself up unsuccessfully, she has the idea to grab her hair and pull it back. Even as her hand grabs her hair, she thinks \"What am I doing this will never wo-\" with a popping suction cup noises her face comes loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swears she can hear birds as she tries to regain her balance. \"Wait, no, I can see birds. Whats going on?\" She stumbles in a daze to what looks like mirror and stares into it in amazement. It's definitely her in the reflection, but her face is flat as a pancake. With a firm shake of her head, her features snap back into place. Except instead of her normal human face, she has a slightly pointed nose with whiskers coming off it. Her eyes are unnaturally big with long eyelashes. She's about 6 inches tall. She sees a pair of pink ears at the top of her head, and when she tries to pull them off they stretch but stay attached. Realization dawning on her, she feels around her but and pulls a long tail in front of her. \"OH MY GOD! IT WORKED! I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby looks around and sees she's not in a cartoon. She's in her dorm room. Checking the reflection again, she sees that she does indeed look like a 3 dimensional version of an ink and paper cartoon mouse, but she's still in the real world. \"This isn't how it's supposed to work! I have to use it to turn back to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby hears a pop behind her, and turns to see smoke coming from the headset. She's frozen in horror since its the only thing she knows that can help her. She starts towards it, but then the door bursts open and her roommate Meg comes running in with a fire extinguisher. \"GABBY HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU TO DO YOUR SCIENCE BULLSHIT SOMEWHERE ELSE!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not cow poop... hey I didnt say cow poop, I said cow poop... aww heck, cartoon characters can't swear...\" she sad about this until she hears the roar of the fire extinguisher. Horrified, she watches her only hope destroyed in a spray of chemicals. Mega dismissively picks the mess up and declares it's going in the dumpster before it explodes or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby watches her leaving and tries to decide what to do,</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Gabby is a girl who goes through a process that turns her into a real life cartoon mouse version of herself (think like Gadget from Rescue Rangers), but only 6 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer life is now governed by cartoon laws. Her body is very malleable when subjected to a force, and her body will regain its normal shape at the first opportunity. She doesn't feel a lot of pain, but will always react like she did. For example if she get caught in a mouse trap she will feel the snap and scream, but will only feel as if she's being pinched.  The part squished by the mousetrap would unflatten within a few seconds unless someone thinks it is entertaining (see below).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also means cartoon tropes affect her behavior, so if she runs off an edge without realizing it, she'll continue in a straight line until she does. If she sees what looks like a tunnel painted on a wall, she'll be compelled to run through it as soon as she has a reason to, even though she knows logically that its fake. If someone acts friendly enough to her, she'll eventually be compelled to trust them, or at least give them a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis extends to her \"keeping things entertaining\". Unfortunately for her, what is entertaining is decided by the tastes of anyone nearby. If someone thinks having a cartoon mouse pancaked under her foot would be funny, the universe will find a way to get her under the person's foot no matter how hard she tries to avoid it. Thankfully this will also make the universe contrive ways for her to escape after the \"joke\" goes on long enough, such as a strong gusto of wind the next time she isn't being crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, almost everyone else in unknowingly cast in the role of her antagonist. They just can't resist the urge to catch and torment her. Even worse, that's the ONLY part that affects them. They aren't forced to pick up the idiot ball and do things that self sabotage themselves. If they're creative enough, they can force a \"joke\" to be dragged on indefinitely. They will have to deal with reality trying to free the toon girl, but it's possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite always managing to get away so far, the toon girl instinctually knows it is possible for her \"show\" to end if someone is creative enough. Since it wouldn't be \"funny\" for her to quietly accept the end, she knows she wouldn't be able to tell if it's is finally the end. She would just be stuck with the thought that it MIGHT be possible to escape, never knowing that its not. This has made her naturally terrified of being captured, and she will always try to avoid it and escape no matter how non-threatening her predicament is. After all, even if her current predicament isn't too bad, there's no guarantee the NEXT thing the person does won't be the end of the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few rules.<br>\r\n- Only female characters, no male interaction.<br>\r\n- Animals have enough sense of self that she can't possess them. A creative girl may realize that her body is her property and make her into a body part, but in general she possesses objects.<br>\r\n- No pee, scat, or gore. This is purely personal preference, sorry. Farting is okay.</td>",
