Sarah then kisses  Sakura on the lips Sakura is surprised at this she whips her head back and moans \"MMMMHHP\" she puts her hands on her mouth as a liquid like substence melts over her mouth she looks at Sarah and moans \"MMMMNN\" Sarah blows a kiss at her in that moment Sakura jumps out of her chair moaning and hits the corner of the room \"MMMMMNNHP\" The two guards try to pin Sakura against the wall but Sakura sees them coming she tries rushing through them but they pin her to the wall she moans as she hits the wall \"MMMMNN!\" \"MMMMMNNHP!\" Sarah says to her \"Your body is super sexy Sakura makes me feel Sweet so tell you what I'll pour syrup all over this table then I'll fuck you and make you cum sooo many times you'll never look at syrup the same way again.\" Sarah leaves the room and Sakura tries to struggle against the guards but they're stronger Sarah comes back with dozens of syrup bottles and she has a Dildo on!? Sakura stares at her in fear struggling as hard as she can she moans a lot as she struggles \"MMMMNN!\" \"MMMMMNNHP!\" \"MMMMMNNNNHHPP!\" Sarah puts the chairs out of the room and asks Sakura \"are you ready baby?\" Sakura shakes her head (No) and moans as loud as she can \"MMMMMNNNNHHPP!\" \"MM-MMM!\" \"MMMMMMNNHHPPP!\" Sarah walks over too Sakura and rips open her Black button shirt and takes it off she does the same too her bra, pants and panties (footwear as well) Sakura is now completely naked as Sarah is too she moans as her breasts are revealed too the room \"MMMMMMMMMNNN!\" \"MMMMNN!\" Sakura's nippes are hard cause of the cold air in the room Sarah pick up two bottles of syrup and sprays it all over the table when they're empty she told her guards to throw her on the table and leave Sarah add two more bottles of syrup too the table when they're empty she throws them in to a barrel with empty syrup bottles she backs away from the table and the guards throw Sakura on it as she moans \"MMMMMNNHP!\" \"MMMMMNNNNHHPP!\" (breasts facing up) the guards leave the room then Sarah looks at Sakura with syrup bottle in her hand she tells her \"Don't even worry I'm gonna make sure you get the full package and the experience\" Sakura moans again \"MMMMMNNNNHHPP!\" \"MMMMMNNNNHHPP!\" Sarah pours the bottle of syrup all over her dildo and says \"By the way I used syrup because it's one of my kinks\" she rubs it nice good covering her dildo with syrup she then grabs two more bottles and pours it on Sakura she moans as her whole body is covered in syrup \"MMMMMNNHP!\" \"MMMMMNNHP!\" \"MMMMMMNNHHPPP!\" Sarah smiles at Sakura and shoves her dildo inside Sakura as she pumps her in and out she tells her \"You know why you can't escape from the syrup cause it's not syrup it my special Experimental Syrup it's mixed with a glue like substence that I made so enjoy.\" Sakura moans as she gets fucked by Sarah \"MMMMMNNHP!\" \"MMMMMNNHP!\" Sarah does this for about three to four hours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours later... \"Well that was the best sex I've had in months now I'm gonna let my friends fuck you too.\" She takes out a sliver box and pulls out four mechanical like chips she presses a red button on all four of the metal chips they start to grow into worm like things with a scorpion like tail and six tendrils on each side. Sakura looks at the weird bugs in confusion as she moans \"MMMMMNNHP?!?\" the bugs get covered in a weird green gel like substence as they grow they go up to eight inches then suddenly the gel pops she moans in fear as Sarah leans in close with them \"MMMMMMNNHHPPP!\" \"MMMMMNNNNHHPP!\" Sarah drops all three of them on her face and drop one on her leg. She freaks out as they start moving down her boobs \"MMMMMNNHP!\" \"MMMMMNNNNHHPP!\" The bugs move down her breasts and on to her belly the other bug moves toward her pussy it stretches her lips with it's tendrils and wriggling to get inside one of the other bugs make it too her belly button it reaches in with it's tendrils and stretches it open it dives it's thick head in to her belly button she moans as it's tail whips her belly \"MMMMMNNHP!\" \"MMMMMNNNNHHPP!\" \"MMMMMNNHP!\" The second bug now enters her navel it's quicker now cause her belly button is now stretched she moans as the second disappears in her navel \"MMMMMMNNHHPPP!\" \"MMMMMNNHP!\" The third one is the biggest out of all of them it stretches her belly button more and dives in as she moans and struggles \"MMMMMMMMMNNN!\" \"MMMMMMNNHHPPP!\" it's tail wipping her belly as it enters \"MMMMMMMM!\" \"MMMMMNNHP!\" Sarah is now wet from the sex and is now really turn on from watching Sakura get bugged she lick her own lips and kisses her belly button Sarah checks Sakura's pussy to see that the bug is inside she looks at the worn out Sakura who is barley struggling and says \"Oh no you don't we're going for one more round don't  pass out yet she thinks about if she should bug her again or fuck her and bug again and this time I'll play with your breasts and nipples.</span></div></div>",

The figure was wearing a large black coat and mask, completely removing any noticeable features hat could\u2019ve been seen otherwise.<br>\r\n\u201cHum-... mph... Mmm!\u201d Hinata felt like her lips were sealed literally, and she couldn\u2019t speak.    The figure then picked her up off the ground and placed her on the Table, sealing her to it with the same technique used to seal her mouth together.<br>\r\nHinata started to wake up and got nervous as to what was happening.    \u201cMmm!   Mmm!\u201d Hinata went, but the Figure didn\u2019t respond.<br>\r\n\u201cShh... it will be over soon, if you tell me what I want after this.\u201d The figure said, trailing their finger over Hinata\u2019s now sealed mouth before finally reaching for her jacket, opening it up to get to her shirt.<br>\r\n\u201cMmm!\u201d Hinata tried to scream but they weren\u2019t loud enough for someone to hear.    The figure pulled up Hinata\u2019s shirt and took out a small case from a pocket inside his coat, opening it up.<br>\r\nFrom inside came a mechanical/organic looking mess of a creature, that Sprawled our of control.    The figure took it out and placed it on Hinata\u2019s waist, waiting patiently as the creature looked around for a target.<br>\r\n\u201cMMm!!!   MMM!!!\u201d Hinata was starting to struggle really hard, but her arms and body were stuck to the jacket just as much as the jacket was stuck to the table.<br>\r\nThe creature began to make it\u2019s way up to the left side of her belly looking constantly for a target, getting crazier and crazier by the second, eventually stopping right on her belly button, looking directly down at her innie navel, seemingly scanning it.<br>\r\nHinata was petrified at this point, not moving a muscle and completely frozen.   It was all she could think of to hopefully bore off the creature, but then as she looked down in horror, the creature seemingly grew 3 long needle like appendages and stretched out her navel enough to where the creature could get inside.<br>\r\n\u201cMMMH!!!\u201d The action hurt a lot and Hinata screamed as loud as she could trying to see in anyone could help her, and then as she continued to look, the creature inserted itself into her navel, almost entirely with a small bit dangling out.<br>\r\nHinata didn\u2019t move a muscle knowing it would at the very least delay the creature\u2019s voyage into her belly button but the figure, watching the whole thing went on to press down on the creature in Hinata\u2019s belly button, aiding it in moving through, this also hurt a lot and Hinata finally got free of her jacket and started to squirm, messing up the figure\u2019s balance and delaying the creature from getting inside her navel.<br>\r\nAfter a bit of squirming she finally got off the table but the figure was fast, stupid fast, and practically warped in front of her before giving her a really hard punch in the lower belly.<br>\r\nHinata fell to the floor and looked up as the figure began to reveal it\u2019s arm, showing many attachments organic and mechanical.<br>\r\nThe figure choked Hinata and slammed her against the table again, securing her to it by sinking her hands and feet into the table, it was at this point Hinata felt a sharp pain in her navel and looked at her belly to see the Creature fully inside of her, she hadn\u2019t even known it was finished.<br>\r\nThe figure then took out it\u2019s other arm, smaller and less attachments to it, taking off a drill like thing that was attached to It\u2019s first arm.<br>\r\nAfter that the figure stabbed and turned on what was definitely a drill into her belly button, surprisingly only a small amount of blood cane out, and that blood only hanged around in her navel, but that didn\u2019t mean the stabbing hurt a lot.<br>\r\nShe felt the sharp drill twisting in her belly button, causing her to cry from the pain, she was struggling a bunch compared to when the creature was being inserted into her and it sure hurt a lot less than this.<br>\r\nBut then as the bloody drill was taken out of her navel, the figure stuck their thumb and index finger into her now drilled through, belly button.<br>\r\n\u201cMMMM!!!  MMMMMM!!!!\u201d She cries in agony, the Figure then pulled out the same creature from before \u201clet\u2019s try this again... but this time not your navel.\u201d they said.<br>\r\nAnd after reaching for her jacket again, the figure fully pulled it off.   Then the figure went for her shirt and lifted it up all the way, exposing her bra.    \u201cThis will be much more painful than before...\u201d the Figure said as it pulled the bra straight off.<br>\r\nHinata\u2019s breast\u2019s were fully showing and it was unpleasant for her.<br>\r\nThe figure pulled out a needle and injected a substance into the creature, making it shrink but also gain more needle like appendages.<br>\r\nThe figure threw the creature right above Hinata\u2019s breasts just below her neck where her collar bone was.    The creature circled the area and looked for a target, it climbed up Hinata\u2019s right breast and reached the top, looking around however all it found was Hinata\u2019s nipple which it messed with for a bit, but never saw as a target, it then went for her navel again, Hinata looked back at her Navel and then saw it was fully healed \u201cWas it the figure?\u201d She thought, but that thought quickly faded away once the figure took out another smaller Creature... and another... and another... an another until there were about 6 of them on her belly.   All with many sharp needle appendages.<br>\r\n2 of them went to both of Hinata\u2019s breasts, climbing up them from the other side, Hinata wasn\u2019t even able to struggle, as the figure had sunk her more into the table.<br>\r\nAs the 2 Creatures made their way to her nipples, they went and climbed a little higher before realizing that there were tiny passage ways into her breasts, and both decided to go for it.<br>\r\nThey stabbed their needle appendages into her nipples, \u201cMMM!!!\u201d took them out and then started to climb in. \u201cMMMMH!!!!\u201d<br>\r\nEventually both made it in, Hinata was traumatized by this, more than the other because it hurt so bad.<br>\r\nAs the creatures forced their way painfully through, squeezing tighter than Hinata could imagine, her breasts swelled a little because of the damage and she cried even more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow... what with the other 4 Bugs do?</span></div></div>",

She was on a table. \"Where... If this was a prank from Naruto...\" She saw a woman walk in. \"Hello! My name is [Y/n.] You're sexy and all mine..\" She grabbed an injection, and injected it into in, it made a weird liquid spread over her mouth and limbs, trapping her. [Y/n] put a blindfold over Ino, and proceeded to take off all of Ino's clothing. \"Mhh.. Mhnp... MHNPHM.. MMMMMMM....\" Ino moaned. She tried getting up, but she got whacked in the head and passed out, moaning; \"Mhmm.. Bnnmh... Pmnp... Plhm..... Lmmnh..\" She woke up, still bount an hour later, and [Y/n] grabbed a mini creature with lobster claws, duplicated it, and put them on her body. The robots had found Ino's navel, so they stretched it open, and all tried getting in. Then [Y/n] started to fuck Ino multiple times for 5 hours, and shoved more of the bots up her navel. \"Plhmp! Mhnp!! Bmnh!!! Wmpl!\" Ino started to twitch and babble. After the biggest bot stretched Ino's navel so far and went in, the blonde kunoichi started to scream and moan; \"MHMMHHH!!! MHPLNNMHH!!\" This went on for days, and even if the mouth seal went off, Ino had no idea how to speak, as the tranquilizer was permanent. \"Mhnp...\" She said.</span></div></div>",

She lets out a sigh of relief as she finishes the last of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" *Sigh*, I'm so glad THAT'S over with. I'm gonna go take bath.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*As she stands up, Konan enters the room along with 2 large women. The women accompanying her were about 6'5 and were fairly muscular. They were wearing demon masks and had on matching red, sleeveless dresses.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade asks \"What are you doing in my office? I'm very tired and I'm about to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonan smiles and says \"Show me your belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade replies \"What? No. Get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonan insists \"I going to need to take a look at your belly button. Hold her down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade jumps over the desk and tries to attack one of the Large women but before she can do anything, the other one gets behind her and grab her by the arms and stretches her back. The other one tries to get her legs but Tsunade kicks her in the chest and knocks her over. However, she quickly bounces up and goes after her legs again. This time she grabs Tsunade's ankle and stops her. Then she grabs the other one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pull her over to the desk and pin her down on her back. Konan lightly walks over towards the desk and opens her Akatsuki robe, revealing a tight sleeveless belly shirt and really tight, black pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade tries shaking violently but it's no use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yells for help but Konan slaps a paper seal onto her lips that prevented her from moving her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonan slowly starts unraveling Tsunade's robes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans over and starts to spread Tsunade's belly button open. She gets so close, Tsunade can feel her breath on her belly and navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade blushes and starts to wriggle her torso. Her breasts were flailing violently and her belly was expanding and contracting as she found it harder to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonan smiled and started fingering Tsunade's belly button for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonan then reached into her bra and pulled out a small wooden case. The case had an Akatsuki style paint job with small red clouds over a black background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens it up and removes a strange organic fluid filled sack. Inside the sack was a small organic bug looking creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonan lifts it up to Tsunade's face and she squints, trying to see what it is. It starts spiraling inside the thin film. Tsunade's eyes widen in horror. Her heart races. She thinks to herself \"Oh jeez. What the hell is that thing? What's she gonna do to me. I have to get out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries as hard as she can to break free, but they keep her pinned. She uses the last of her energy and has to lay back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeads of sweat trickle down her forehead and between her breasts. She looks at the bug and it's getting bigger and bigger until the casing pops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat comes out is nothing short of a nightmare. It has a long, metallic carapace, 8 long, slender tendrils coming out of it's sides and a thin, proboscis coming out of it's head. It arches it's spine and looks left to right, flailing it's tentacles violently, looking for something to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonan lowers it down to Tsunade's belly and lets it go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt starts to wriggle across her stomach and spins itself around and reaches her belly button. She can feel it tickling her belly as it slides it's tentacles towards her navel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shoves the smaller wires in one by one, then it uses it's larger wires to spread her navel open so it can go in for the final blow. Tsunade reels in pain as it penetrates her navel. It's tail thrashes left and right, up and down and all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's tentacles reach around inside of her, spreading her intestines around to it can slip in between them. It starts to slide further and further in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screams from the pain \"MMMMMMMMMPH! MMMMMMHOOOOMPH! MMMMMRREEEEEEE! EEEEEEEE!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes roll back and the bug slips completely inside her belly, flipping it's tail all the way in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wakes up at her desk. Fragments of the memories of the event flash through her mind. She sees fuzzy, half second flashes of her being pinned down. Followed by flashes of the bug transforming. She tries to stand up, but stumbles. She opens up her robes and examines her belly. Everything looks fine. Then more rapid flashes of the bug flipping and squirming into her navel enter her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doubles over in pain. Her guts feel like they're on fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around the room and at her stomach. There's no blood anywhere. She thinks to herself \"How could that be real? It doesn't even make any sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets up and walks out, but can't shake the feeling there's something horribly, horribly wrong. Like, everything she does is being watched somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune shows up and tells her good morning. She saw how sweaty and freaked out her boss was ask asked her what's wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was lunch time at karakura high and Rangiku was called down to the main office of the school. When she arrives at the entrance 3 men in black suits stood waiting for her. \"Ms Rangiku come with us,\" said the leader of the group. \"Ok, but why?\" Questioned Rangiku. \"All will be explained when we get there,\" replied the leader. The agents take her to a black suv and drive off. Rangiku sat nervously in the back seat through the entire car ride. They stop at what seemed to be an abandoned warehouse, a building she had never seen in Karakura Town. They get out of the car and the agents escort Rangiku through the abandoned building. They walk down a long hallway and stop at one of the side doors and an agent holds the door for Rangiku allowing her to enter first the room before her was dimly lit by a greenish light and a metal table with to chairs on each side. Rangiku gulps and walks in. Instantly a blue light outlines her body and her gigai form falls to the ground. She now stood in her Soul Reaper robes and was looking down at her human form in fear. \"H-how did you?\"....... \"What you didn't think we knew what you really are? Take a seat,\" Rangiku takes a seat, she feels that her powers had been drained just by being in the room, she thought to herself nervously \"ok just act confused and innocent\" Rangiku spoke first: \"Look, I have no clue what is going on right now and why I can see myself on the floor over there or why I'm wearing this robe either.\" \"It would be unwise to lie to me Ms Rangiku, we know you are one of the many soul reapers from the Soul society, and that is why we have you here, so tell me Rangiku how does one reach the Soul Society?\" asked the leader agent. \"I don't even know what the Soul Society is! So let me go!!!\" Demanded Rangiku. \"Very well then, since your mouth doesn't speak the truth then it is time to get rid of it,\" Said the leader. The leading agent stares into Rangiku's blue eyes. She sits there confused by what he said, suddenly her mouth became dry, her jaw tightened and strings of goo formed between her lips fusing them together, lastly skin molds over her entire mouth leaving her mouth completely sealed. She jumps out of her chair in panic and tries to scream but only moans through her unusual gag. The two bodyguard agents push her against a wall and ripped open her robes revealing her stomach, breasts, and panties, they then threw her on to the table and held her down. Rangiku writhes and moans in distress. \"Your going to help us Ms Rangiku Wether you want to or not,\" said the leader as he pulled out a small metal device with a dormant light on it. He presses a button and the light turns red the device began to morph. Gel coated over the device and it began to wriggle, it was growing in length, tentacles suprisingly sprout out on the side and the gel breaks. The thing in the agents hand was now a worm like bug with several tentacles on the sides and two tentacle arms along with two legs. Rangiku moans in horror when she sees the bug transformation. The agent dangles the bug over her naked torso and drops the bug. The insect lands just below her breasts. She moans as the bug crawls downwards on her stomach, it's tentacles flailing everywhere tickling her soft smooth skin. The bug stopped at the edge of her bellybutton. It traced the rim of her deep vulnerable navel, Rangiku moaning in the process. It slips one tentacle into her bellybutton testing it's depth, then one after another the other tentacles go in causing painful tickling. The bug uses its tentacled arms to stretch her bellybutton further and then plunges in her exposed orfice. Rangiku was trying so hard to scream but her goo/skin sealed mouth gag only let out muffled moans that aroused the agents in the room, she was also buckling frantically causing her breasts to slightly bounce and the bug's tail to whip around outside her navel. The bug now reached her knotted unbulicus and began to untie it with its tentacles causing pain. It was now able to make its final push into her bellybutton, Rangiku throws her head back and moans as the bug crawled and wriggled deeper and deeper into her navel, it was nearly in, Rangiku looks down between her cleavage and catches the horrifying bugs tail disappear into her bellybutton. She then passes out from the pain and the agents exit the room. To be continued by somebody else(:  ...........</span></div></div>",

A door opens 3 female agents walk in. \"You've been a bad girl Ms Rangiku, and now we have to punish you, secure her!\" Said the leading female agent. The other two agents start walking toward her, Rangiku jumps out of her chair, \"Stay away from me!! Don't you tou... \"MMMMNPHHH!!!\" Rangiku moans as one of the agents gags her with duct tape, they pin her against the wall, she struggles as one unbuttons her blouse and rips it off, her big breasts and bellybutton are revealed to the room. The other rips off her skirt, \"MMMNMPHH!\" Rangiku let's out a muffled scream when her panties are forcefully ripped off her exposing her tight pussy. Lastly one yanks off her necklace and throws it across the room, She moans in suprise when she gets slapped on her ass by an agent then thrown back first on to the table, the two agents held her down, the leading women stands over her. \"HaHa, look at those fine boobies there better than I ever imagined!\" Said the female agent. \"MMMMNPHHH\" \"MMMMNPHHH!\" The agent gently gropes her breasts <br>\r\nMaking her nipples become erect. Rangiku squirms as the agent licks the tip of her nipples, \"MMMMMPHH!\" She moans. The agent then stood by the midsection of the table, looking at Rangiku's stomach. \"Goochy Goochy goo!\" Said the women as she tickles her belly, \"MMMMNNN!\" \"MMMNMPHH!\" She screams more and squirms on the table. \"Lets let my little friends out to play,\" the woman reaches into her pocket and pulls out two small metal devices she presses a button, the devices morph and suddenly thin tentacles start flailing out, they had turned into small nightmarish insects, \"Time to bug the babe, hehe\" The woman said in a sadistic tone. She holds the bugs over her chest and she releases them ,they land just above her breasts.She squirms as the bugs crawl on her mounds, one bug on each breast. As she struggled in vain her breasts shook but the bugs stuck to her like glue. They reach the top of her breasts ,\"MMMNMPHH!\" The insects tentacles glide over her wide areolas and reach out and tease the tip of her nipples, then there tentacles work very precise as they stretch the opening of her nipples and dive their thick steel heads in the nipple. \"MMMMMMMMMMMPHHH!\" Rangiku moans loudly in shear pain through her thick tape sealed mouth. The bug's thrash around, the female agents are turned on at the site of insect tails flipping and wriggling outside of their bound captive's nipples.The two bugs make one final push into her nipples, Rangiku screams when she sees the tails slip in. \"Oh don't worry Ms Rangiku, your punishment is far from over, I think I got someone who wants to play with your belly,\" said the leader as she stroked Rangikus long blonde hair. \"MMMMNPHHH! \"MMMMNPHHH!!!\" Rangiku moans in horror. The agent opens the case again and pulls out a larger device and lets it morph, long tentacles sprung out and the bug in her hand was a couple inches longer. She dangles the bug over her belly and drops it, the bug lands below her breasts and crawls downward. It writhes about on Rangiku's creamy goosebumped belly, she feels the bugs tentacles caress her skin, she moans when she realizes it was crawling down to her bellybutton. The bug was now at the edge of her deep navel, it begin to circle her crater teasing it, she buckles wildly when the bug inserts it's tentacles and stretches her bellybutton. It plunges in headfirst it's tentacles tickling her umbilicus, she writhes and flexes her stomach as the bug squirmed and crawled deeper, \"MMMNMPHH! The tail of the insect whips side to side hitting her tummy , she moans loudly, and the tail slipped in her navel and out of site, her bellybutton left as a gaping hole. The leader agent looks down at her pussy and notices that it was wet. \"Looks like our kitty cat wants something to make her pur,\" She takes out another bug device, the same size as the one that went in her navel, the agent holding her legs spreads them open. \"MMMMNPHHH\" \"MMMMNPHHH\" Rangiku moans and shakes her head pleading the agent not to do what she was about to do. The bug transforms, tentacles wriggling around like mad, the agent drops the bug on her firm bush. Rangiku screams, The insect rakes it's tentacles through her soft blonde flower. It crawls further downward, tentacles searching for something it finally finds it \"MMMNMPHH!\" Tentacles spread the wet and fragile lips of her pussy and shove it's head in worming it's way through her wet canal, Rangiku was receiving unwanted pleasure from the bug fondling her pussy. Her moans were even louder and echoing throughout the room. The tail was the only thing wriggling outside her lips, the tentacles tickle her vagina driving her insane, she throws her head back and moans repeated ly, \"MMMNMPHH\" \"MMMMNPHHHHH\" MMMMMMMMNPHHH\" the bugs violent tail slips inside And she let's out one final moan concluding her orgasm, \"MMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNPHHHH!!!!!\" She passes out the women begin to leave, The leader peels off the tape and gives Rangiku's curved soft lips a kiss and leaves the room with her naked on the table .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For two years this poor girl has been away from those she calls her closest companions, and by now. it's about damn time she meets up with her old crew! She returns to Sabaody Archipelago, heading to a bar for a quick drink and to find out more on what happened to the Island while she was gone. But not all was well, as a fake Straw Hat pirate crew set their eyes on her, specifically their captain \"Luffy\". The fake captain offers her a drink, but she refused, causing some tension in the bar. Nami showed no emotion, playing it cool, especially as the \"Cat-Bugler Nami\" approached her. pointing a gun right in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here is where Usopp shows up and surprises everyone on how great he's gotten... except in this story, he doesn't show up, not at all. Nami defended herself and disarmed the fake Nami, taking the gun with her. She backed up to leave the bar, that was until she accidentally back up into the fake Luffy, who hit her on the head, knocking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red headed pirate navigator woke up in a room in the back of the bar, all her limbs tied up tight to a table with very tight rope. Nami struggled to get out of the ropes grasp. Around here were a few members of the fake crew, namely the fake Luffy and Nami. Each of them had a sinister grin on their face, eyes with dark intentions, and each laughed hardheartedly over an idea they both have that the real Nami was not aware of at all. The fake Nami handed fake Luffy a jar. The jar was closed and it couldn't be seen what was inside by looking from the outside, and there was some writing on it that merely said \"BBBs\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two, let me go! You have no idea what trouble you'll both get into if you do anything to me! I will kick both of your asses once I'm free!\" Nami excitedly said with red hot passion, just wanting to beat these fools up, as she moved so rapidly that the table started to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, heh, heh, heh. Quiet you child,\" The fake Nami smacked Nami hard on her gut, causing a slight red mark to show up. The sting was felt all over Nami's body, as she curled her toes and hide her facial expressions of the pain she felt. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to only wear a bikini for a top?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't hurt her up too bad, you're gonna ruin the fun for me!\" Fake Luffy then punched Nami in the gut, causing Nami struggle to breathe as she nearly blew all of the air she had in her lungs, and was having difficulty to breathe back in air. The table stopped shaking, and the two fakers were ready, \"Now, you might feel a slight pinch...\" the duo giggled as fake Luffy opened the jar. Nami was quivering in fear, while also struggling to catch her breath. She breathed in and out, in and out, sucking her belly inwards and slightly bloating it with air outward. Nami wasn't ready for they had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big fake captain pulled out a creepy crawly bug out of the jar. It looked bizarre, not made naturally, rather as if it was made by scientists within the field of robotics. Since Nami was focused on breathing and her energy was low, she couldn\u2019t try to shake herself to either get out at all. She felt trapped, and she was. There was no escape for what was to come next, though what did happen surprised even herself. The fake captain lowered the shaking bug over Nami\u2019s belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like what you see? Belly Button Bugs. I got them for cheap, and they have come in handy multiple times so far when It comes to dealing with people like you\u2026\u201d The captain lowered the bug so low that the bug was not only nearly inside Nami\u2019s tight little innie, it was actually holding on to the innie and struggling to get off fake Luffy\u2019s hand by gripping and pulling itself. The initial shock of the bug\u2019s grip sent shivers all over Nami\u2019s body. She felt frightened and slightly queasy. The noises the bug made was unnatural, and it made the situation even more unnerving to the poor navigator, as she breathed even more rapidly due to her anxiousness. The bug gripped harder and harder, clawing itself a bit inside the girl\u2019s navel, which stung almost as much as the earlier slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeisty little critter. Alright, set him free!\u201d The fake Nami said too fake Luffy, to which he did. Once set loose, the bug quickly dug itself into Nami, and that is where the real fun began. As the bug started to dig, Nami began to moan in pain, but she didn\u2019t scream. She didn\u2019t want to because she actually was feeling quite enthralled by the experience. In fact, you can say she was enjoying herself because of the bug. The critter dug deeper and deeper, moving its head around quicker than a sea current going upstream. It was painful to go through, and yet Nami was still enjoying herself. The feeling of something powerful penetrating her with such force just made her lips quiver. She curled her toes again, but this time for reasons other than a stinging pain. She twisted her body slightly and turned her head as the bug entered her innie. Her moans became more erotic in tone and her face was more of satisfaction than of fear. Once the little bug was finished with entering her, Nami made a loud orgasmic groan that was heard throughout the bar, she reached a climax, as her belly button quickly closed and healed itself. This confused the two fakers, with both nodding in agreement to place another bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new bug was bigger, meaner looking, and had tentacles coming from its backside. They quickly dropped the bigger bug, too which Nami giggled and bit her lip. The bug was dropped on her general midriff, so it searched for the navel itself. The little steps it made while searching around tickled Nami slightly, giving her a giggle before her \u201cpunishment\u201d began. After a few seconds, with the bug searching low and high for the navel, accidentally going around her breasts or almost getting under her pants, the bug found its target. The bug circled around Nami\u2019s navel fist before diving in, getting comfortable, and once it was, it took its head and shoved it in the belly button, causing Nami to feel even more force and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Nami was starting to feel regretful, as the bug was trying even harder, which made the experience more damaging to Nami\u2019s belly. Nami groaned in pain, causing the fakers to cheer up a bit as now their torture worked. Well, it did for a short while. Once adjusted to the pain, the red head felt ticklish again, as the tentacles were brushing on her sides by accident, alleviating Nami of some pain. Once that started, Nami began to moan and twist in pleasure again, feeling her body tingle in excitement and pleasure. The bug dug deep as it could, moving itself very quickly, even to the point its tentacles were whipping the sides of Nami\u2019s exposed tummy, causing Nami to only express her continued mixture of pain and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese fakers were losing their minds as their bugs weren\u2019t working! The fake Luffy was confused, shivering in fear, wondering why this girl was resisting so easily! Fake Luffy then made his biggest mistake, he dropped the jar! It fell on the floor and cracked open, leaving a whole swarm of bugs to crawl around the back room! Two of them crawled to the fake Luffy and Nami, as they forcibly entered their belly buttons during their struggles. Both were screaming for help and crying in pain, but once the duo had the bugs enter their system, they were knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other bugs however found Nami fascinating, and they all decided to enter her. Waiting for the biggest one to enter, the others soon went inside Nami one by one, all causing the girl to climax over and over again, making her very, very wet in the process. Once all the bugs went inside the girl\u2019s tight navel, Nami decided to rest a bit, feeling tired after what she just went through, sweating alarmingly high. Nami\u2019s belly, even though it was filled with bugs, was surprisingly flat looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Usopp entered the room to find out what was all the commotion he heard about earlier while talked to patrons of the bar. He found Nami and untied her. Once free, the navigator jumped in excitement and joy to see her old friend again. The bugs however were also excited\u2026 they sensed new victims to exploit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After reuniting with each other back at the Thousand Sunny and pulling off a daring escape from the marines, the Strawhats have submerged and were on route to Fishman Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were informed of the dangers that they could face on the way down, the trip had been pretty peaceful and the crew was taking advantage of this and enjoying the ride in their own ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy, Ussop, and Chopper were audibly marveling at the sights, Franky was keeping the ship on course, Zoro was taking a nap on the barrel that held Caribou, Sanji was in the kitchen making treats for 'his' ladies ( keep dreamin'...), Brook was testing the strings on his guitar, and Robin was on a lawn chair, reading a book, and occasionally looking up when ever the first three said they saw something 'awesome'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Nami?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in the Women's Quarters, on her bed, and rubbing her belly. Feeling her countless new guests wriggling and squirming inside of her. She could feel every bump and ridges within her stomach. While they did not show on her skin she knew they were in there, and it truly felt like there were even more of them constantly being added, as if they were replicating within her. And she was loving the feeling. Not only that, but she felt her mind matching their earlier excitement, like they were connected, and a part of her. And she knew they were asking for. They wanted to spread, and go into women who were just as perfect as her. They no longer would accept just random hosts, they would only take the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you want right?\", she asked, looking at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey responded with more erratic movement, almost making her climax right there. Biting her lip to keep a moan in, she arched her back and then rubs her stomach even more to calm them. She took that as an affirmative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing foot steps outside the door, she quietly steps over and looks out the doors port hole, she saw Robin, but she didn't notice. Then looking down, Nami saw it. Her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their 2 year separation, Robin's attire had changed as much as everyone else. A pink, sarong-like skirt that hung of her hips, and a purple, short-sleeved, half-jacket was her top. But Nami was looking between them. Robin's outfit had left her entire belly exposed, with her soft, pale skin, and especially her deep looking, almond shaped navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami knew for sure it was perfect. The bugs moved around again, as if telling her to do it. She rubbed her still flat belly again unconsciously. She'd give them what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing opportunity, she stuck her head out the door and called out,\"Robin, you mind coming in for a minute? I need your help with something.\" Then she quickly pulled her head back into the room, hiding next to the door. Hearing the footsteps approaching the door, she prepared herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Robin had stepped in,\"Miss Navigator, you said you needed me?\", she asked while coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this Nami had quickly but silently closed the door, then lunged at the raven haired archaeologist, pinning her to the bed. While Nami may not come off as very strong, when she wants something, there is no stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin tried to struggle and call out, but Nami covered her mouth with her right hand and was able to hold both of Robin's arms above her head, and straddled her hips with her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hungry look in her eyes, Nami inched closer to Robin, belly first, while saying,\"It's ok Robin, just let this happen, you'll like it soon, I promise...\" And at the end of that sentence, both their bellies were mere inches away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Nami had ordered out in her head, and somehow the bugs responded,\" Go my darlings...\" completely lost in the euphoria. And with that, she pressed their abomens together, almost like their angels were kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin, still held down, could not even comprehend what was happening, what had happened to Nami? Why was she doing this? Such thoughts that went through her head stopped, as she felt a rumble on the surface of her belly coming from within Nami's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Nami's perspective, she could feel a whole swarm of bugs was moving towards the same tight, little opening they first entered from. Then they came forth, using the combined belly buttons as a bridge, they traveled into Robin's navel, which was wider and more spacious than Nami's. But that just ment more of them could go in at once and give Robin the same pleasure Nmai felt, her screams of initial pain muffled by Nami's hand, while she felt the same pleasure of them going through her navel all over again and forced herself to suppress a moan, not wanting anyone to walk in on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, while the bugs were still going in, but Robin's screaming had stopped and was then replaced by moans of pleasure as she closed her eyes and embraced the same euphoria Nami had felt. Nami smiled at this, her first target being a success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they felt the rush stop, and Nami pulled away, just in time to see a long centipede-like bug slip it's way into Robin's navel, going in much like one would slurp a spaghetti noodle, even making a light 'pop' sound as it finally wriggle it's way into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally disconnected, Robin sat up on the bed, and proceeded to rub her own belly with both hands, feeling her new occupants get acquainted with their new home. Nami one else across from her, smiling at her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how does it feel?\", she asked the second female to join.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with closed eyes and rubbing her belly, Robin replied\", Oh, it's incredible. I may have resisted at first, but now this is the most amazing I've ever felt.\" She never knew having a multitude of creatures inside of her could feel so... amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami smiled a little wider at the notion, and while proudly rubbing her belly again, she replied, \"Great that you feel that way, because I plan on giving these to many more. They have a refined taste now, so we'll only give them the best.\" While she initially didn't like the idea of giving any of the bugs up at first, she could already feel the rest making up the difference by producing more inside her. She'd never run out, and the thought appeased her greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin merely mumbled out an affirmative, still too caught up on the pleasure to properly respond, though she seemed to have slowed the rubbing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this and smiling again, Nami moved her face closer to Robin's stomach, between her hands. \"W-what are you doing?\", the archaeologist manages to mutter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving them a parting gift.\" And with that, Nami plants a passionate kiss on Robin's belly, right on her round navel. This sends the bugs within her into a frenzy, moving around faster and more intensely than before. Robin couldn't even let out a moan as she fell back on the bed and went back to rubbing. It felt like they were trying to burst out of her, and she positively adored the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking and standing back up, Nami left Robin to her own pleasure, and exited the room. Sighing with a smile, she looked down at her belly again and rubbed it even more. She felt as if it was the center of her new world, and now with Robin, they were gonna increase that worlds population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sighed again in slight sorrow, wishing she had gotten her new guests earlier. All the others she could have let them spread to. But got over it, not worrying about missed opportunities. Giving it a final loving pat, she proceeded down to the deck, and sat on one of the lawn chairs and decided to nap for a little bit, and decided to dream, after all,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been given a gift, and she was going to exploit it to the fullest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the now destroyed and gas filled halls of Punk Hazard, a light buzzing sound could be heard if one were to really concentrate on hearing it. The source was a small metallic insect that bared resemblance to a mosquito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreated by Doctor Vegapunk himself, it takes DNA from men and women, then creates children from the combined source. It was mostly the World Governments idea, they wanted to look to the public and say that it was for helping areas with population declines, but it was mostly so they could have stronger soldiers by combining the DNA of already powerful humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it being the first and only one of its kind (A 'queen if you will) it was also designed to make drones that act the same as it does, but can't produce more drones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut due to Ceasar Clown turning the facility into a toxic waste land, Vegapunk was forced to abandon the project before it could be finished, and as such its programming was unfinished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the destruction didn't help either, as it corrupted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow while it still knew to sample the DNA of a powerful male, the objectives to find female DNA and a place to hole up and incubate the new life became the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow free from its case due to the chaos, it set out to exit the facilit to fulfil its purpose.<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\nAfter some time, the subject had left the facility and now hovered above a large gathering of humans. Following its programming, and its highly advanced scanner that acted almost exactly the same as observation haki, it searched for the strongest male specimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had several choices that stood out, a man with whitish hair and two cigars in his mouth, a man with a spotted cap and a long katana, a blonde man with an irregular, swirly eyebrow, and a green haired man with a scar over his left eye currently napping, just to name a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one was better than the rest, he had black hair resting underneath a strawhat, and eating an absurd looking amount of meat while speaking animatedly to another young man with a long nose, and what looked like some kind of horned tanuki. To many, the young man might have seemed unassuming, but with the bugs haki like sensor, it could tell this young man was currently the strongest male in range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowned out by the sound of the festivities, the bug was unheard as it flew down and quietly landed on the back of the young mans neck. Then it gently stuck its needle-like proboscis into his neck, the doctor had made sure to make the process completely painless, and started sucking blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds it had enough and flew away out of their sight, the only proof it was there was a small drop of blood on the same spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it hovered back over all of them to find a female/ its new forever home, as part of the faulty programming. It was very slowly getting bigger as its inner mechanations were replicating the sample to increase the number of children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it saw it, the first female to enter its view. Long orange hair in a ponytail, big brown eyes, and from the bugs knowledge of the female anatomy, a buxom and curvaceous figure. She was heading towards a ship with a figure head resembling a lion, and so the bug darted after her.<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n3rd Person POV:<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs the Nami boarded the ship and entered the Womans Quarters, she didn't close the door all the way and the bug was able to fly in, perching itself on the ceiling and watching her, even it the slight darkness of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had taken off her jacket and in a puff of smoke, it turned into a piece of rubble in her hand, simply dropping it on the floor. Underneath the jacket she had a bikini top colored a mix of red, white and orange, barely containing her large breast, and low rider jeans that clung to her lower half. Her slim and soft looking abdomen was completely exposed. She stretched a little bit before deciding to lay down, her belly facing the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her without the jacket, the bug, which at this point had grown to the size of a roach, the bug knew that she would be a perfect candidate for completing its purpose. Silently, it glided down and rested on her thigh, then slowly crawled up to her uncovered hip. It would have to be careful, her being asleep might be the best chance it had to complete it programming. Still carefully moving up Nami's body, she had yet to react to the bugs movements. The bug then stopped next to her surprisingly deep and perfectly round belly button. It had deduced that this would be the fastest route to its destination. Slowly it began to crawl in going further down until it reached a road block, the bottom of her navel. With its front legs and proboscis, it slipped them into the tiny gap and started pulling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami had responded to the sensation by slightly giggling and letting out a slight moan, finding the action ticklish, and unconsciously rubbing the skin around her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bug had pulled the skin far enough apart for it to slip through, and it did. It's larger thorax wiggling around the rim of her navel before going in. It then proceeds further in to its final stop, her womb, it's shape bulging her skin out just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then, Nami had opened her eyes abruptly and sitting up. Looking around her room, she says,\"I thought something was watching me.\" She then looks down at her stomach, feeling that it was a little tender. Rubbing it gingerly, she laid back down,\"Probably just imagining things.\" She says to herself before turning over and going back to sleep. Totally unaware that the bug had sampled her DNA while crawling in and had now taken root within her, and it wasn't moving for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with both sources of DNA within it, it was time for its real work to begin. Creating new humans from the combined samples, and making drones to carry the replicated samples of male DNA to other females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new generation of humans will soon be birthed. And it all starts within Nami's belly, which had slowly began to round out as the Queen was accelerating its own growth process to carry all the children and its new drones.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Perona screamed after the bug scurried across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just flailed around, terrified and screaming how gross they were, yet was unable to move due to her left arm being glued to the wall. Ignoring what the long-nosed guy said about it being some kind of bug star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started squirming even harder when when she felt them get into her clothes. She just kept crying hysterically, calling out for Kumacy even when she knew he wasn't coming back. Now she was at this weirdo's mercy, and the look in his eyes said he had none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She flinched as another bug crawled across her exposed midriff, it was the most sensitive part of her body, 'If I knew this would happen I wouldn't have worn this!' She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsopp had her dead to rights, he was about to use the fake 10 ton hammer, but he saw how she was reacting to the bugs he threw on her, and flashed back to all the crap she put him through during this fight, and how she humiliated his friends. And she just laughed it all off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know,\" he began, his voice strangely low and imposing, \"after everything you did to me and my friends since we got here, I thinks it's befitting to let you suffer through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he just turned and left. This caused her to start panicking even harder, \"What!? No! Come back! I'm sorry, get them away! Please!\" She flailed and cried, but he just left, and soon he was out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Usopp as he walked away, he let out a relieved sigh, \"Man, glad I was able to sound cool in that last moment, and I got to save the fake roaches by using those weird ones I found out in the forest! I call that a win.\" He then left to find the others, whistling with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Perona, she finally stopped screaming, and was just reduced to whimpering as the bugs crawled all over her body, unable to move with one arm stuck, and wouldn't dare try to touch them with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she felt one of them actually stop on her skin. Looking down she saw it right underneath her exposed navel. It was pink, and somewhat resembled a stag beatle. Then slowly and almost deliberately, it started to crawl into the surprisingly deep indent of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frantically shook her middle, trying to get it off her, but it stood firm. Then it went completely in and despite her pained and disgusted grunts, it pushed through her flesh and soon it was in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but scream again, her beautiful body had just been violated. She could feel it crawling under the skin of her belly, and it freaked her out more than the first guy who was immune to her hollows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she soon felt all the other bugs on her stop moving as well. Looking around herself, she saw that they had all rotated, and we're pointed in one direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they all took off like rockets. Scurrying towards the little hole and crawling in there themselves and entering her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore screaming soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly three whole minutes after, she sat in that same spot, staring afraid at her middle, which had actually expanded slightly to contain her new tormentors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly, once thought by her to be the most attractive part of her body (hence why she leaves it uncovered) now looked like she had just eaten a rather large meal, sticking out past her clothes quite notably. The bumps and ridges that ran across its still soft and pale surface reminded her of her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite her fear, the slight strain on her gut was begging for her to rub it, and so with her free hand she did. But as she did, all movement within just stopped. And when she took her hand off, it resumed with more intensity, as if asking for it to not stop. So she continued, and now instead of pain, she started feeling pleasure from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, why does this feel good?\", Perona asked herself as her hand moved to around her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because you like it'. A voice echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that?!\", Perona called out, head whipping around in shock, and hoping it wasn't Long-nose or anyone she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Try looking down'. The voice went off again. And reluctantly, she did what it said. And at the top of her belly, looking right at her, was a small basic face sticking out of her skin. She wanted to scream again, but another twitch from the bugs made her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good. I hope I have your full attention.' It said, sending shivers down her spine from how her skin moved with the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" She whimpered out, the sensations she was feeling almost compelling her to rub her belly, and never stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're already doing it.' Perona grew more confused at this. 'All of us merely wish to help you reach perfection. Look at yourself. You're beautiful, a vision of everything a woman should be. And that's all thanks to me commanding my brethren to make this pleasurable for you. All we want you to do is embrace us.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words the voice said into her ears felt like sweet nothings, sending shivers down her spine. And as she looked at her belly now, she didn't see it as disgusting, rather as a thing of beauty. She felt like a mother, and the insects no longer felt like invaders, but now her charges that she would nurture and protect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the adhesive that held her arm back had dissolved, after checking to make sure nothing was wrong, she brought her hands to the sides of her belly. She felt pressure on the inside towards her hands, the bugs were responding, showing their appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled like a proud mother and stood up, testing the weight and her new center of gravity. To her surprise, while the weight was there, she had no trouble walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to revel in her feelings for as long as possible, but then she heard footsteps approaching. She grew nervous again, while she had embraced her new role she didn't want others to see and question her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut almost as if they heard her thoughts, the bugs shifted once more, and suddenly her belly was flat, as if nothing happened. She mentally thanked them before getting back to her previous attitude before this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the rest of her wild zombies, all worried about their mistress. She informed them of all events, previous and current, and her plan to leave with the Strawhats ship. While they were sad about losing their comrades, they got to work prepping all the supplies and then bringing it to the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as she was alone now, she gave a command for the insects to return. They did, only instead of all at once, they came slowly, letting Perona feel every sensation. Earlier she was disgusted, now she was on cloud nine, rubbing every bit of it as it stretched from her body, even pulling her shirt up to her breasts to give it more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No thanks is needed for hiding ourselves. They wouldn't understand, not like you do.' The voice went in her head again. She just smiled, it didn't matter to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we're leaving this place for good. No one will ever come between us and we'll be together forever.\" She said in a slight singsong voice as she swayed, hands rubbing the sides of her belly. She felt her guests wriggle more as she spoke. They wanted this as much as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And whats better, our family will get bigger, and when that happens, you'll only get more beautiful. More beautiful than anything this world has to offer.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerona just imagined it, her glorious belly filled with countless more insects, growing bigger endlessly, that sole part becoming her entirety, her little body simply the organ supporting it, people praising, worshiping her, calling her a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would achieve that dream. And her guests would help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in pleasure of the thought, she gave her belly one last proud rub and walked off, she was going to leave this island, and make that dream reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What's next?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things had not been going well for Vivi and Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey and the rest of the crew had faced many road blocks on the way to Alubarna to stop the Rebel Army from making their move on the capital. But this was something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a short break using rocks for shade, and a big combination of EVERYONE'S unique eccentricities, the two females found themselves in a dark cavern somewhere under where they were resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami had been angry for a while, but Vivi had been able to calm her down relatively quickly. See how getting mad was gonna get them nowhere, they chose to lay down and rest until the others managed to find them. They laid their cloaks down as impromptu beds, leaving them in the dancer girl outfits Sanji got for them. After that, they closed their eyes and sleep quickly took them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, the sand near them started to sift. And out came two scorpion-like shapes emerged. They looked similar, but their pincers looked more suited for pulling, and instead of stingers, their tails had a glassy shine similar to gems, and ringed around them was gold colored material. The main difference between them was that one was sapphire blue and the other was emerald green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly they scuttled over to the girls still forms , blue going to Vivi and green went to Nami. They crawled onto their bellies, towards their navels. They were small, tight little circles, seemingly too small to fit the scorpions, but they could fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTightly but gently, they each gripped the edges of each girls respective navels carefully, then tugged them open wider. Blue going first, it dove headfirst in to Vivi's navel, and wiggled it's way in, the sensation waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up as she awoke, looking down where she felt something digging into her, all she caught was the small length of a tail, before all that was left was the tip, now wedged snugly in her navel. The glassy surface and the golden ring around it made it look like she had a decorative navel gem. But she knew exactly what this was, and before she could say anything;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd this come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to her side, she saw Nami, who had now awakened as well, looking down at her belly, where she now had a gem of her own, this one being green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nami didn't know how or why it got there, she was pleased to have found what she believes to be something expensive. She reached down to take it so that she may examine it closer, but when she grabbed and tugged at it, it wouldn't budge, as if it had been glued into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? What's with this stupid thing?!\", she exclaimed, more confused than angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't just going to come off Nami, and if it is what I think it is, our situation is about to get VERY strange.\" Vivi had said back, not trying to be ominous but failing. This got Nami worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you talking about?\", the navigator asked, a scared stutter in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the princess could explain, the both stood up abruptly, like they had no control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening now?!\", Nami yelled, now really freaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen before anything else could be said, they both had begun to dance. Not just any dance, they were belly dancing. Very sensually, with lots of emphasis on their abdomens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami couldn't even say anything at this point, she was so shocked. All she could do was look at Vivi with a face that pleaded for an answer. Luckily she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you saw weren't gems, they were the tails of Dancer Scorpions. Instead of stingers they have those to attract prey and distract predators.\" The bluenette explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't explain what's happening!\"; at this point, Nami was embarrassed beyond belief at being forced to do this. Sure she had no problem showing off her body before, but at least then it was her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... this only happens... during their mating season...\", Vivi replied back nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was silent for a moment, before screaming out,\" WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING EARLIER?!!\" \"I NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN!!!\" And for the next few minutes while continuing to dance, it consisted of Nami screaming at Vivi while the princess just apologized repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as abruptly as it started, they stopped. \"Finally, is it over?\", Nami asked while panting. While she wasn't in control of herself, it still took her energy to dance.\" \"Yeah I think so.\" Vivi replied, tired as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she said that, they both now found themselves on their backs, arms at their sides. While that was happening, they felt the digging sensation again and looked back down at their bellies. Catching the gems wiggling slightly, before being pulled into them, as if they were never there. But they felt them.\" You said this was over!\" Nami screamed again. \"I forgot! That was only the first half!\" \" Okay, you'd better explain everything now!!\", their little back and forth went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mating rituals for Dancer Scorpions is opposite to regular ones! Instead of females coming to the males, it's the other way around!\", Vivi yelled, fear back in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wait, so that means--\", you could hear the scared tone in Nami's voice, but before she could finish her sentence, they heard more sand sifting, and looking to their sides they saw themselves surrounded by dozens more scorpions, all of varying colors. The main difference between them and the two from before is that they were notably larger, signifying they were male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without any warning, they all began to march forward towards the girls, who in turn felt more movement within them. Being able to look down, they saw the gems pull themselves into their bellies, leaving their navels open once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all of this, they struggled to get themselves to move, but their efforts were futile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, two scorpions crawled onto each of them, both once again gripping their navels and pulling them open, and with two of them they were opened wider than the previous time. Only now they were wide awake and felt everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the opening created, all the other scorpions dove in, the girls shrieks turned to grunts as their middles fought to accommodate all of their new guests. They tried to break free and regain control, but with the original females still within them, they weren't going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially as their bellies soon began to dome out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Several minutes later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-- Ooooh-- never speak of this. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUn-- Hmmm-- understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the conversation between the two girls. Who now had swarms worth of scorpions within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir stomachs now looked like the had swallowed grown men. Their bellies were large and spherical, the skin pulled taught. So large in fact, they couldnt see anything past them or wrap their arms around them. And on top dead center, were the gems, still attached to the tails of the pest that did this to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth couldn't help but let out a moan or whimper as a tremor or bulge ran across the surfaces, reminding them all too well of their predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much longer-- Mmph-- will this last?\" Nami asked exhaustedly, hand instinctively rubbing where she felt the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't-- Eeee-- be much longer nooooow...\" replied Vivi, trailing off at first because she felt the sensation pop up near her belly button, the one spot she couldn't reach, but then she felt more pressure build up, unbearably, in that same spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was about to ask what was wrong, but then she felt the same build-up within her. But in their state they could do nothing but scream, and clutch what parts of themselves they could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they could actually see their bellies stretch out with their navels still being the tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, almost with a pop and hiss, the gems retreated back into them, and the swarms of scorpions came scuttling back out. Crawling off them, heading into random directions, then sinking back beneath the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, their bellies were flat again and they found themselves able to move of their own accord. They were then treated to the sight of the scorpions who started this whole experience leaving, oddly with a male next to them, tails intertwined, the sink as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls could do was still watch them, hands rubbing their middles, still in slight disbelief of what happened to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami the looked to Vivi and said,\" Again, we are never to speak of this to anyone. Clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't get any argument from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were then treated to the sound of,\" I think I hear them through this wall!\" Chopper's youthful voice sounded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Several hours later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew, after reuniting with the female members, were now camping in the night, still ways away from their goal, but getting ever closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men had fallen asleep, and the girls were just getting ready to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, I just want to go to sleep, and forget this whole day.\" Nami said, tired of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivi could only let out a non-verbal agreement, too tired to say anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both just laid down, an allowed sleep to take them, now sure that nothing else would happen. Not in real life at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their dreams, they were blushing, reliving the earlier events in vivid detail. Both had secretly been enraptured by the whole thing and now their imaginations were running wild in their sleep. Even rubbing their bellies again while they slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cause? If you could seen their bellies, you'd find a multitude of tiny bumps poking out against the soft, delicate surfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently a guest didn't want to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt like a thousand tiny fingers tickling the walls of her innie, while a tiny mouth frenched her knot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivi, weakened by the sound of Nami's slowy growing laughter, finally cracked and started laughing herself. \"Ahahaha, ihehhem Sorhererey Nahahahami.

A Namekian's Wish Granted!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast Time on Dragon Ball GT, Goku, Pan, Trunks and Giru were in their ship, searching for the Black Star Dragon Balls in the vastness of Space, when suddenly, Giru detected a planet with 7 Dragon Balls! How could this be possible? And then suddenly, the ship was seemingly being pulled to the planet, and was going to crash into it at an extremely high speed? Are there more planets with more Dragon Balls other than Earth or Namek? Will our heroes survive!? Find out on this episode of Dragon Ball GT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan was lying down in a dark forest, far away from her ship. The \u00bc saiyan girl landed in an odd position, with her legs straight, one hand behind her head, and the other on her exposed belly. Pan was wearing her usual outfit, an orange bandana, gray pants that have chains on the right side, finger-less gloves, and her red midriff-bearing shirt, but her shoes were missing as she took them off before the ship\u2019s accident. Her stomach felt slightly queasy, so she rubbed her little tummy while she was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slept, she was having a dark nightmare. She had creepy, freaky alien looking bugs surrounding her, while Pan did not recognize the area where she was, at all, save for seven pillars around her and the bugs. Soon enough in the nightmare, spotting an ancient looking building close to her, Pan dashed away from the bugs to the structure\u2019s entrance, and she just noticed that she was naked as well. The girl didn\u2019t know what was going on or where exactly she was, and soon enough, the bugs caught up to her. Pan tried to blast them away as much as she could, but they overwhelmed her and crawled on to her body, weighing down her arms and legs, causing her to fall. Shockingly, they were strong enough to hold her down to the floor, making Pan not able to get up at all. Pan sensed a dark powerful figure approaching. She turned her head to see an adult humanoid male looking creature covered in shadows. He picked up one of the smaller bugs, examining it carefully. He nodded, and threw the bug directly to Pan, the bug landing on her tummy. The creepy bug bit around her belly for a bit, causing Pan to squirm as she felt the sharp pain on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, let me go you weirdo! Or else my grandpa will beat you up! And that\u2019s only after I beat you up,\u201d Trying to put on a strong fa\u00e7ade did not help the girl however, and without warning, the bug dug its way inside her belly button. The power it forced made Pan lose her breath for a bit. After breathing in to regain air, she looked down at the bug wiggling inside her little navel. She tried to wiggle her stomach to shake it off, but instead it latched even harder to Pan by using its claws to hold the sides of the belly hole. Pan tried to then fly up and use her ki powers, but she couldn\u2019t for some reason. She was weakened by some unknown force, trapped in some sort of hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadowed man snapped his fingers, causing the bug already in her belly button to dig in even faster. Pan however, started to enjoy it. Her face was blushing red, her body felt hot and had an odd and new tingling sensation. She moved her toes upward and directly curled them inward a few seconds later. The bug was now over halfway in, and Pan was slightly arching her back, and giving a slight, hard to hear moan. She closed her hands into fists, and she clenched her fists very tightly. She bit her lower lip to stop it from quivering, all as the bug wiggled its way, penetrating her tiny navel. Once in, Pan lied flat on the ground again, opened her hands, uncurled her toes, and she breathed anxiously, waiting to see what this shadowed man has in store next. Her belly button looked fine, as if nothing even touched her navel, with the only signs of something having been on her belly are the bite marks caused by the bug around her innie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadowed man laughed with a loud, booming voice that echoed in the chamber they were in. The laugh stopped in and instant though, as the man snapped his fingers six times in a row, and six more bugs of similar size to the one that entered her already crawled to Pan\u2019s belly. One by one, they entered her belly button, wiggling their way through, causing the sensation Pan felt earlier to last longer. Pan moaned loudly in pleasure, and she was sweating profusely. Even though she was trapped and uncomfortable, Pan was having an amazing time. After all the other bugs entered the young girl, the shadowed man huffed loudly and clapped his hands once, and in a bright flash, the nightmare was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-what in the\u2026\u201d Pan woke up, and she had slight trouble getting up due to the pain she received after the crash, but she thought she could just walk it off. Her pants also felt slightly wet, but that wasn\u2019t due to pee, if you know what I mean. Looking around, the Earth girl found no signs of life on planet, save for the plant life. Thick and tall trees that seem to go on for miles that cover the sky, alien flowers blooming, a running river nearby could be heard, and beautiful blue grass around Pan\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoku, Trunks, Giru, where are you!?\u201d Pan cried out. While the site was pretty, Pan was more worried for ship-mates. Pan heard no response, and she wondered where she landed and how far they are from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, gonna have to find them myself,\u201d The girl flew up high to get a bird\u2019s eye view, and to her surprise it was actually day time, and more importantly, she found out that she wasn\u2019t in a forest at all, but rather, a tower that reached high into the sky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! What is this place? This is just like Kami\u2019s tower back home! Wait, that could mean\u2026\u201d Pan had a thought, what if there was a Namek on this planet too? What if the Dragon Balls that Giru detected were the ones a Namekian made on this planet? Pan just had to find out, so she flew back down in the \u2018forest\u2019 and started searching. While walking through the forest, her tummy was starting to feel queasy again. While Pan didn\u2019t feel like she was going to throw up, or that she was hungry, she just feels like she has a stomach bug or something, though she can\u2019t remember the last time she was sick. After patting her tummy, she went back searching. It wasn\u2019t long before she found a Temple-like building in the forest, but there was no one to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe-hello?! Anyone there?\u201d Pan moved closer to the temple, \u201cUh, if there is someone here, I\u2019m wondering if you can help me out. You see, I crashed on this planet by accident, and I\u2019m now separated from my friends!\u201d Pan\u2019s feet got on temple ground, which was made of stone instead of the ground being simply grass. Pan treaded carefully on the unfamiliar land, making quiet steps to try to not bother anyone who may be there. The quarter-saiyan looked around and noticed something strange and enticing, seven pillars around the temple. She looked up at one of the pillars and noticed how far it went up in the sky. They all seemed familiar to the girl, but she couldn\u2019t put her finger on it. Pan flew up to the top of one of the pillars, and once she was there she found a tiny Dragon Ball that was inside a hole on the side of the pillar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a\u2026\u201d Pan picked on the Ball, and it fell accidentally but she caught it just in time, \u201cNo way!\u201d Pan went to the other pillars to see if they also had Dragon Balls, and to her happiness, they do! Each pillar had a Dragon Ball, each in its own hole, each pointing to the middle of the temple ground. After grabbing all seven and fitting them neatly into her pocket, save for the 4 Star Ball she chose to hold in her hand, she flew back down to the ground, \u201cYes, yes, yes! I can use these to really help out Trunks and Grandpa get back our Dragon Balls, or at least use these to find them!\u201d Pan held the Ball in front of her, looking at it and smiling. However, she didn\u2019t notice that there was now a man behind her, who coughed rather loudly to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there miss,\u201d the man behind her said out-loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAggh!\u201d Pan was surprised and accidentally tossed the 4 Star Ball into the air. She turned around and immediately went into a fighting stance, but as she guessed, Pan was right. There was Namekian here! Pan got out of her stance and stood up straight, scratching the back of her head in embarrassment, \u201cOh, hello there, heh heh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHrrmm,\u201d The Namekian snatched the Dragon Ball that was falling from the sky, catching it before it hit Pan on her head, \u201cI believe this is mine?\u201d The Namekian held the Ball next to his face, \u201cAnd I assume you have the other six. Am I correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, yes sir,\u201d Pan sounded disappointed and handed the other Dragon Balls to the man, and bowed to apologize, \u201cForgive me sir!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can also assume that not only you know what Dragon Balls are, but you need them for something, right?\u201d The green man held the seven Balls between each finger, leaving only the gap between his right ring and pinky finger free, \u201cWell, what do you need them for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan shot up quickly, looking slightly distressed. She explained to the man about her home planet going to explode, her missing friends, and her crashed ship. She also gave a brief explanation on how she knows about his species, as well about Kami, Piccolo, and Dende.<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I see. It seems that the son of Katas did end up somewhere. Fine, I will help you with your problem. Also, you can call me King. That\u2019s what the inhabitants of this planet call me whenever I make an appearance to them,\u201d King gave the seven Balls back to Pan, and she held them all in her hand. Pan was overjoyed, jumping up and down in glee, jumping very high up before gently floating her way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do I need to say anything to get these things working King?\u201d Pan asked, \u201cAlso, how did you get here or even know how to make Dragon Balls?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Take a seat somewhere if you want,\u201d King replied, \u201cOver there possibly,\u201d King pointed to a table looking structure nearby, to which Pan quickly dashed to and sat on, waiting for King to start, \u201cDuring the drought of my people, I and a few of my Namekian brothers decided to build a space craft to find a new planet suited for Namekian kind. We built a single ship, similar to the one the Namekian of your home. As we flew off, searching planet after planet, we were shot down by large ship. We sensed that the presences inside were many, but also that they were a few very powerful beings inside. Our ship began floating around endlessly, with no power or resources to keep us safe, and soon enough, we were near this planet\u2019s gravitational pull. I was covered by one of my ship mates, and when the ship crashed, I was the only survivor\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d Pan felt terrible for King, and unbeknownst to her, there was a swarm of bugs forming behind her, \u201cSo what did you do then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurvived. I fought many battles against the indigenous creatures of this planet. I found some civilized inhabitants, and they are all very weak. I never harmed them, but whenever I showed them my power, they began to fear me. Though one day, while I was sleeping in a hut of one of the tribes, a giant beast came to attack the village. I went out and defeated it quickly, protecting the village. The people rejoiced, and then held me as a God of sorts. I then started to help out more, and connected the tribes of these people together, creating a connection to these inhabitants. I was given the name King by the leaders of the tribes, and that name stuck with me since. It has been so long since my days on Namek, I forgot my old name!\u201d The Namekian laughed a bit, which started to scare Pan slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s an interesting story you got there King,\u201d Pan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, my life did become interesting,\u201d King stopped his laughter in an instant, \u201cBut then I decided to build a tower, so I can overlook this planet. I also decided to make my own Dragon Balls, in order to wish myself off this planet and see how my own planet is doing. Sadly, my power isn\u2019t strong enough, which is why the Dragon Balls you carry in your hands are so small. I did make my own wish, to at least see how my planet is doing, and I was relieved to see it thriving after all these years. I also built these pillars so when the Balls are flown away, they always land in the holes I placed on the pillars and I can resume them whenever it is truly needed. There are however two major flaws,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing snapped his fingers, and the swarm that formed behind Pan caught her by surprise, and held her down to the structure. The Balls were taken by King, and he formed a sinister smile. Pan tried to fight off the bugs, but she couldn\u2019t, her ki wouldn\u2019t work and she couldn\u2019t fly off! What\u2019s going on? Wait, memories of that dream started to form back in Pan\u2019s head. It was still very fuzzy, but she was having a great sense of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, these Dragon Balls are powered by the bugs that hold you down. They can slightly lower your energy, but if enough is latched on to you, you are powerless!\u201d King exclaimed, as Pan tried to struggle her way out, \u201cBut if I insert a single bug into someone through any hole, they can absorb their energy and then power the Balls,\u201d Pan\u2019s belly began to move, as many bugs inside her now were wiggling to get out, causing Pan to freak out and shriek, \u201cSadly, to power a Dragon Ball usually requires sacrifice. So anytime I capture someone and use them to power a Dragon Ball, they always die after the bug exits their body and power up the Ball. However,\u201d King placed one of his Dragon Balls on top of Pan\u2019s belly button. While it wasn\u2019t small enough to fit inside it, it was still being kept in place because of the navel. Soon, one of the bugs began to exit Pan, wiggling its way out, making Pan feel that tingly feeling she had in her dream. As it got out, it was absorbed into the Ball, making it glow bright orange. And the best part for King, Pan was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKing, what did you do to me? What\u2019s happening to me?! HOW DID YOU GET THESE BUGS INSIDE ME! IT WAS ONLY A DREAM!\u201d Pan cried out to the high heavens, hoping that maybe, just maybe, her grandpa and friends could hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but it wasn\u2019t a dream. You see, after these bugs enter your body, you only reinterpreted the event as a dream. I took you into my temple last night, and while you wear bathing, I found my chance! Plus, the nightmare was actually better than the reality,\u201d King smiled even more sinisterly, his eyes filled with evil intent. Pan then remembered that night in even more vivid detail, and while she was being bugged, she remembered that King was also naked, and took advantage of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth about King is that he\u2019s not the real King at all! He is a parasitic creature that desires to take over planets and rule the people. They find the world leaders and take over their bodies, though some \u201cgrowths\u201d have happened to the bodies the parasite takes over, usually when a certain \u201cgrowth\u201d wasn\u2019t there at all. Pan began to cry, \u201cI\u2019m in some odd hell, only a dream, she\u2019d be saved, anything, let anything happen that can end this!\u201d she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing took the Dragon Ball, and placed a new one over her navel, starting the process over. A new bug wiggles out, causing Pan to moan and curl her toes again, it enters the Dragon Ball, it regains power, repeat the process. After six Dragon Balls have been restored, King decided to have a little fun. He walked over the end of the alter Pan was on, and held on to her feet. He placed each of his fingers between her toes, and he moved them around, all to freak Pan out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I can\u2019t remember when I had this much fun. I\u2019m usually so busy, dealing with this planet\u2019s people, but today\u2026 today I get to have some fun!\u201d King let go of the girl\u2019s feet and climbed on top of the alter. He was over Pan, but his head level was on Pan\u2019s navel level. He looked up to Pan and grinned. He took out his tongue out, and licked the area over Pan\u2019s belly. She winced slightly, feeling violated and powerless. King moved his tongue all around, and then he circled his tongue around her navel, and directly afterward, King inserted his tongue into Pan\u2019s tiny navel. Her belly button got all wet and slobbery, making Pan feel extremely uncomfortable in the process. King stopped licking her belly, and cleaned the saliva with a piece of Pan\u2019s short he just torn off. The false Namekian was ready to place the final Dragon Ball on Pan\u2019s belly button, and once the final bug made it out, all the Balls were repowered once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing giggled with glee, he was ready to make his wish. He placed the Dragon Balls over Pan\u2019s belly, and he cried out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRISE ETERNAL DRAGON! GRANT MY WISH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky turned black, the atmosphere became dark, and from the Balls came a powerful looking Dragon! While it wasn\u2019t as large as the Eternal Dragon of Earth, it looked mighty, and more closely resembled a European-styled Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have awoken Master. Make your wish,\u201d The Dragon was stoic, uncaring to the sights he saw beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDRAGON! I WISH FOR THIS GIRL TO KNOW WHERE HER GRANDFATHER AND FRIENDS ARE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon gave Pan visions of Trunks, Goku, and Giru on another planet entirely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour wish has been granted. Until we meet again, master,\u201d The Dragon retreated into the Balls, and they began to float in the air and fly off into different directions, but because of the pillars, they were stopped in their tracks!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou see? Your friends are simply looking for you,\u201d King pointed to Pan with his pointy finger, over her tiny navel, \u201cSadly, they\u2019re far from their destination,\u201d he then inserted his finger in her belly button, and started to wiggle it around for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you doing this to me? Why?\u201d Pan was broken, she couldn\u2019t cry, scream, or even fight back, only question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?!\u201d King inserted his finger even deeper into Pan, hurting the girl, \u201cBecause I can! I am King of this planet!\u201d King took out his finger and recovered the Balls. He snapped his fingers, and seven bugs went inside Pan once more, wiggling their way inside. King repeated the process of summoning the Dragon, this time wishing for Pan\u2019s companions to find a CLONE of Pan on the planet they are on, all fine and good. The real Pan however, was now stuck with this madman for who knows how long. King knew what he was doing, he likes his partners broken. He found them more\u2026 favorable that way. King repeated the process one last time, now wishing for Pan to be wearing a revealing royal outfit, \u201cNow little one, you will now be my Queen! Do you accept?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan was now in a new outfit that resembled something more a belly dancer would wear. She had no more bandana, but instead a small yellow tiara. Her top was a red bra with tassels on the bottom. Her pants were replaced by a long skirt that had a split that exposes her legs. Lastly, Pan now wore barefoot sandals, with its lace made out of a golden lace and covered in tiny orange pearls that resembled Dragon Balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quarter saiyan was trapped, she now can only accept her fate as Queen to this King, \u201cYes Master King, I do,\u201d Her eyes were dull, blank from the stress she\u2019s gone through. King was happy, and now, she was ready for his final wish. However, a Dragon didn\u2019t need to grant this wish. King snapped his fingers again, and a large version of the bugs came out from the temple. It was almost too big to fit inside Pan\u2019s belly button, however, it will try. The bug got on top of Pan\u2019s belly, found the navel, and it dug its head right in her, causing the largest amount of pain that Pan has felt in a long time. Pan felt nothing though, not even pleasure, she was too broken. The bug pushed and shoved, wiggling itself in as best as possible, slowly but surely entering her body. As the bug was getting inside, Pan\u2019s belly grew larger and larger, it wasn\u2019t overtly huge, rather, she looked a few months pregnant, with a firm and round belly. The bug got inside, and Pan\u2019s mind finally broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPan, you are now my beautiful Queen, the mother to our children, and soon enough, you will birth new bugs for us to rule the universe with,\u201d King was excited, now his plans can come into motion. His next target, Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan struggled to stand up, mostly due to her new weight. Once on her two feet, she extended her arms to King, \u201cYou are my King, you are my Master, you are the father to our children. King, I love you,\u201d Pan said, her mind now warped and broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to the real Pan? Will she ever be saved? Will her friends, or even Goku figure out that they don\u2019t have the real Pan? What will the new couple do first as the all-powerful rulers of the planet? Find out next time on Dragon Ball GT!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Asuna was walking home with Kazuto from school one day, they had taken a detour down a dark alleyway because the sidewalk was being redone. Unfortunately for the two, especially Asuna, it was an elaborate ruse to trap unsuspecting victims. The couple kept on walking but felt uneasy, they were halfway through when Kazuto stopped. Asuna turned and looked at him, he had a very serious look on his face. She started to open her mouth and ask what was wrong when he pushed her down as something shot towards her, she looked up and saw that he got hit. he stood there for a few seconds then fell on the ground. Asuna rushed towards him to check his pulse and breathing, but was grabbed from behind, she struggled against the person and managed to get free from them. She saw a man standing above Kazuto and was holding a needle in his hand. Asuna froze, she knew what the man was about to do. She dropped to her hands and knees and cried, \"Please don't kill him. I'll do whatever you want.\" The man stopped and looked at her, the needle was actually meant to remove the memories of the current incident and what was to come, but she didn't know that. He chuckled and went along with it, \"Well we don't need him. You will do just fine. If you come along with us quietly, we will spare his life.\" Asuna nodded and went with them, meanwhile another man that she didn't notice with a second needle injected the serum into him and took him to a second van hidden elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Asuna was in a van being taken to a secret facility where a secret government test was taking place. This test was to insert a small probe into the top of a persons spine next to the brain and use it to manipulate memories and to use the persons own eyes to spy on the world around them. The problem has been the same however. The person always had a problem with one part of their body or worse, death. But they believe they figured out a way of making it work, and Asuna is the first person to be tested with this. The van finally stops and everyone gets out including a blindfolded and handcuffed Asuna who is escorted to an odd room. It was small, had a door that led to an even smaller bathroom, there was no tub though just a shower. But the main room had a small table, a chair, a queen sized bed and a small dresser, it was much better than Asuna was expecting, almost homey, if she hadn't been kidnapped by strange men and brought to a strange place. As the men shut and locked the steel door behind her she couldn't help but go to the bed and start crying, Kazuto was hurt and almost killed by these men, she was now their captive, who knows what will happen to her. She was scared and worried, but before she knew it, she was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Asuna went and took a shower her beautiful hair clinging to her body like a skin tight shirt. She was already trying to figure out a way to escape this place and try to get to Kazuto and the police. When she finished she went to the dresser to get some new clothes on, they were all so nice looking too, she settled for a silky violet shirt and black yoga pants. Not her style but it'll have to do since that's what it all was. She sat down at the little table pondering how to escape when the steel door was unlocked and a skinny guy walked in. He was dressed in a full black suit and pants. 'This is almost too good to be true, but it could be my only chance to escape this place and get back to Kazuto,' Thought Asuna she acted as though she was still scared and backed away from the guy as he came in. \"I am here to escort you to another room for testing. Please, follow me,\" the man said with a slightly familiar voice but it was too monotone to be certain. \"NO, PLEASE LET ME GO, I WANT TO GO HOME,\" She cried in agony. It was easy to sound real since that was what she truly wanted. 'Come on take the bait and walk towards me,' she thought. If she hit him in the head she could knock him out and begin her escape out of there. It worked, the guy walked over to her. When he got close she struck him in the head and he went done hard. She ran towards the door when the guy said, \"Asuna, why did you hit me like that.\" She stopped dead in her tracks and turned around. That guy was Kazuto. \"Kazuto? Why are you here,\" she said before she herself was grabbed and her mouth covered, then blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke in an empty room in a chair in front of a metal table. She looked around and found the door. Before she could get up the door opened and three men walked in. The man in the middle sat down in a chair across from her. 'Must be the leader of this group,' She thought. \"That was an unexpected turn of events. You managed to break the connection of our hypnosis with that. Thanks for showing us that small problem, we will have to fix that,\" the man said. \"Surprised to see your boyfriend here. We did promise to not kill him, however we couldn't just leave him.\" \"You bastards are going to pay for this, I can promise you that.\" Asuna said with extreme anger almost murderous sound in her voice. She wasn't going to forgive them for that ever. \"Is that so?\" The man asked, \"I think we need to do something about that attitude of yours little girl.\" With that the man snapped his fingers. In seconds the two other men in the room grabbed her arms and pinned her to the wall. The man at the table got up and left as another came in and took his place. \"Asuna, you know you shouldn't be so threatening to people. It's so mean you know,\" the new guy said, Asuna looked at him and her eyes got wide. \"Kazuto, what are you doing with these people. They kidnapped us and have us stuck here against our will and...,\" She didn't finish her sentence. Kazuto had walked up to her and kissed her on the lips. Asuna was shocked. As Kazuto pulled away she felt her lips stick together. She tried to open them but for some reason they were stuck together like glue and all she could do was simply moan and groan. \"Mmphm mmmmph mmmph\" Asuna was scared and panicking, she fought against the men pinning her to the wall but couldn't escape. Kazuto then ordered the men to tie her down to the table and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they left, Kazuto turned his attention to Asuna. Unfortunately for Kazuto he was able to see everything he was doing and what he was going to do. He wasn't able to control any part of his body. He walked over to a writhing and moaning Asuna who still didn't understand what was happening and grabbed her shirt she was wearing. She looked at him questioningly. Then he ripped it straight down the middle causing her to let out a small squeal. She had a white bra on. He then tore that off as well. Now her gorgeous boobs and nipples were exposed. Asuna moaned as her nipples were exposed to the cool air. He wasn't done yet though, he then tore off her pants and panties in a single quick move. Now completely naked on the cold table Asuna was twisting around trying to get free from her restraints. Kazuto had reached into a pocket and pulled out this odd looking device and turned it on. Asuna was watching this device slowly grow longer and longer. After a few seconds its stopped growing. It then twitched a couple times. After a couple seconds it broke out of its shell. The device was a long scorpion looking thing with thin wire like tentacles and began flailing around. Asuna was screaming at this point. She hated bugs and anything that might resemble them. She was thrashing about, doing everything she could to get loose, but to no avail. Kazuto then lowered it down over her face, then to her chest. Asuna was trying to get away from this crazy thing. Then Kazuto dropped it on her chest. Asuna whet ballistic screaming and thrashing about trying to shake the thing off. But the bug had a great grip on her and was moving down her body. As it did it started tickling Asuna as it move making her start to giggle slightly. The bug had made it to her navel and was circling around it. Quickly it started sliding its tentacles into her belly button, as it was doing that Kazuto started to massage Asuna's breasts and her privates at the same time making her feel pleasure from the fear. Asuna was starting to enjoy what was happening for some reason though, the bugs tentacles were tickling her even in her belly button. Now that Kazuto was massaging her private spots, it was becoming almost enjoyable. As the bugs head dove in Asuna kept writhing on the table, but not in a panic. It was more pleasure than panic. She moaned in pleasure as the bug burrowed into her navel and Kazuto inserted a finger into her. Her toes were curling and uncurling quickly and she hadn't stopped writhing either. She watched the bug slowly enter her, all that was left was a whipping tail that tickled her tummy. As it vanished Asuna let out a long orgasmic moan as she came. Suddenly she felt something moving inside of her. The bug was moving towards her heart then it moved around to her spine. Then she screamed in pain as the bug forced its way into her spinal cord and moved up towards her brain, when it did she blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke in Kazuto's room next to him. He woke up as well and they looked at each other. Asuna explained her dream to him and afterwards he told her his. They basically had the same dream. Question was however, was that actually a dream or what happened. They didn't care though, they were glad to be next to each other. They both knew one thing was certain. That was the weirdest dream either of them had experienced. They kissed each other for a long time and then they went back to sleep embracing each other lovingly</span></div></div>",

At the time she was doing Higa's dirty work in exchange for chiho's continued medical care, but Higa had other plans. He had to make sure that Uzume wouldn't betray him so he sent two of his Sekirei: Ichiya and Toyotama to take care of the problem. They entered the hospital with guest passes that they aquired, and they wore casual women's wear to blend in with people there. They entered an unoccupied patient room that was one of many rooms alongside the hallway, and they waited for there chance to take Uzume by suprise. Uzume was now walking down the seemingly abandoned hallway and as soon as she was walking passed the patient room Ichiya snatched her by the arm and quickly pulled her in the room, Toyotama locked the door and pulled the blinds down on the window door \"Sorry about this but this is just the order of things, well actually I'm not really sorry I'm gonna enjoy what happens next, hehe\", said Ichiya in a sadistic tone. \" What the he'll are you... \"MMMMNPHHH!\" Uzume moans when Ichiya slaps duct tape over her mouth, Toyotama then takes hold of Uzume and holds her hands behind her back. Uzume Sturggles in vain to get free but her strength is no match of the two skilled MMA fighters in the room. Ichiya grabs a pair of medical scissors and starts cutting Uzume's pink and purple star shirt and then rips it off completely. Baring her stomach and bra. She then udoes the snaps to her bra and flings it across the room. She let's out a moan when her breasts made contact with the cold air in the room. They then throw her down on her back on to a patient bed and hold her down. Toyotama held Uzume's legs while Ichiya ties her hands above her head, Toyotama then ties her ankles to the bed frame. She was now bound and helpless contantly moaning in distress. Ichiya pulls out a tiny liquid gel sac with something in it , it starts growing. Uzume moans during the process. Suddenly the sac bursts and a silver tentacled scorpion like insect was presented before Uzume, she squirms and moans as she holds the bug above her bare chest. Meanwhile Toyotama unbuttoned Uzume's jeans and pulled both her jeans and panties down a little bit to expose more of her lower belly and caused a small amount of Uzume's pubic hairs to be revealed. She did this to give the bug more wiggle room on her tummy. Ichiya drops the bug and it lands between her breasts. It begins to crawl south between her cleavage, it's long flailing tentacles flicking her erect nipples accidentally along the way. More moaning escapes through her tape gag. The bug was now crawling on her upper stomach, Uzume felt violated at the feeling of its weird fleshy body wriggling across her belly, and with its wild tentacles tickling her soft goosebumped skin. It was aproaching her sensual deep navel and circled it. The bug crawls down passed her bellybutton a little to her lower tummy, then quickly whips around facing upwards and reaches out to her nude bellybutton by grabbing the rim of her wide sexy oval crater with it's tentacles. The first tentacle slips in, Uzume arches her back and moans, more tentacles enter one after another,she bucks her hips like mad, her breasts bounce slightly. It shoves the front portion of its head into her bellybutton causing disconfort, it wriggled violently as it squirmed deeper. The bug's carapace rubbed against the smooth walls of her navel causing Uzume to feel both pleasure and pain. (Moaning continues). It's tail whipped in all directions, slapping her upper and lower tummy. Some of the tentacles were still sliding across her belly outside her navel tickling her as it burrowed itself farther in. Toyotama was watching their \"damsel in distress getting bugged\" from the south side of the bed and she noticed that Uzume's panties were wet, most likely from the pain/pleasure from the bug. She smiles and begins pulling down her pants and panties the rest of the way. Uzume peers between her perky hard nipples and sees a bug tail still whipping around outside her bellybutton and her delicate moist flower being revealed. Now completely naked she accepts her fate and lays her head back on the bed. The bug was nearly in,it untied her unbelical knot and was on for the final push. It was wriggling so hard that it could be seen under her skin on her stomach. Her moaning was louder than ever, her nipples hard as rock, Her sexy lips to her womanhood dripping, the bug slaps her goosebumped belly with the tip of its tail one last time before completely slipping into her gaping bellybutton. A loud muffled orgasm escapes through her tape but is cut short by a chop to the neck........... To whoever reads this, I will not write another bugging until I see at least 1 new bugging from someone else!!!! I know everyone has talent, and hey even if it's cheesy at least give me something to read besides my own stories(:</span></div></div>",

In front of her was a metal table with an agent sitting in a chair calmly, and 2 similar agents standing beside her. \"You know why you are here,\" said the agent in front of her. \"Fuck off,\" Trinity yelled as she gave the agent the middle finger. \" Perhaps were going to have to do this the hard way,\" said the agent. Suddenly, Trinity's lips began to fuse together, her mouth was sealed shut by what seemed to be goo gagging her. Mmmmmphh mmmn! she moaned as two agents held her against<br>\r\na wall. One ripped off her leather jacket, black vest,and undid her bra revealing her sexy curvy torso and her breasts, while the other ripped apart her trousers and panties exposing her clean shaven mound. After getting her naked they threw her down on to the table and held her still. Mmmmmn!!!!, Trinity tried constantly to cry for help, but her mouth had been gagged too well. The main agent pulled out a silver metallic probe with a light at the end. The agent switched the probe on and the light came on, the device in the man's hand began to grow and extend, and suddenly wiry tentacles explode from the device, the thing he was holding looked to like a robotic bug. Trinity moans in horror as he drops the bug on her chest, tentacles writhing around, it begins to travel downward.One of the bug's tentacles briefly caressed her vertically erect nipples as it travels between her breasts, mmmmmphh mmmn, she moans more as the insect approaches her circular and deep bellybutton. The bug circles her navel with its tail, teasing it, as if it knew that she was bound and gagged. Quickly, the bug uses it's tentacles to spread her navel open, then like a flash, the bug shoves the front portion of its metal body into the center of her nude navel. Mmmmn mmmmmphhhh mmmmnn! her sexy struggling moans echo throughout the room, she tries to shake her tummy to get the bug off her, only causing it's tail to whip back and forth across her smooth beautiful belly. Trinity was reaching her climax and was becoming tired. She glances down between her breasts one last time to see the last of the creatures violent tail disappear into the orfice of her bellybutton. When this happens her juicy creamy liquids shoots out of her pussy and across the table and floor, she let's out the biggest muffled orgasm ever. \"Now I presume you are ready to communicate with us Trinity\".</span></div></div>",

The leader of the group snaps his fingers and suddenly Trinity felt her lips become soft and sticky and they began to fuse together and continued until her mouth was completely sealed. \"MMMMNPHHH\" she tries to speak. She puts a hand where her mouth would be only to find out that it was completely gone. She jumps out of her chair with fear \"MMMNMPHH\"!!! \"MMMNMPHH\"! She tries to scream, two of the men push her against a wall and while she struggles with her glued mouth they rip off her top revealing her stomach and deep bellybutton, the leader watching the process smiles evilly at the site of her nudity the two men then remove her bra\"MMMNMPHH\" Trinity moans as her breasts are exposed to the open cold room. The men throw her on to the table backfirst and held her down. \"MMMMNPHHH\"! The leader pulls a small object out of his suit pocket he presses a button turning a red light on. The device coats itself in some tips of gel, the cacooned object in his hand begins to wiggle, it grows longer and suddenly the coating breaks and suddeny long tentacles sprout out, the device some how turned in to a tentacled insectoid \"MMMNMPHH\"! \"MMMMNPHHH\"! Trinity moans as he dangles the bug over her breasts, it's tentacles reaching for her nipples, he drops the bug, it lands between her breasts. The bug starts crawling on her left breast and begins teasing her hardend nipple with it's tentacles \"MMMNMPHH\" she moans more, the insect was trying to find an opening to crawl in, but it wouldn't be able to fit through her nipple ducts. The bug crawls down her breast and on to her upper belly it proceeds further down, the bugs tentacles brushing and tickling her stomach along the way, her moaning continued, the fine hairs of the bug gives Trinity's skin goosebumps as it crawled on her. The bug stops above her navel, it circles and teases the rim of her bellybutton admiring the crater \"MMMNMPHH\"! The bug inserts it's tentacles one by one it spreads her navel further, it quickly thrusts the front portion of its body into her helpless navel \"MMMNMPHH\"!! \"MMMNMPHH\"!!! Trinity struggles desperately under her captives, her hips buckling side to side constantly moaning in distress meanwhile the bug's tail whips in all dierections slapping her tummy outside her bellybutton, the bug unties her unbelical knot and crawls further down, Trinity picks her head up and peers through her erect mountains and sees the horrifying bugs tail still whipping around the outside of her navel and suddenly it slips in her navel. MMMMNPHHHMMMNNN!!! She moans loudly to the conclusion of the rape of her bellybutton. Trinity's nightmare was not over. The leader nods at one of the men. The man undid her belt and pulled off her trousers at the same time the leader was preparing another bug. The bug came alive tentacles flailing around, the man rips off Trinity's panties exposing her mound, moaning continues as the men forcefully spread her legs apart. The bug is dropped on the lower part of her tummy between her bellybutton and pubic  area, The bug crawls south, it's tentacles brush across her trimmed bush, it finds its destination \"MMMNMPHHMNMMMN\"! she moans in horror as her pussy is molested by the bug's tentacles, it's tentacles spread the lips of her tight pussy it begins to squirm in the canal, the leader walks over to her face and kisses her on her sealed lips, he rubbed and squeezed her breasts and licks the tips of her erect nipples, he then moves down to her stomach and tickles her tummy \"MMMMMMNNNMMMN\"!!! \"MMMMNMNMMN\"!! MMMNMPHH!\" between the bug  penetrating her pussy and her breasts and tummy getting attention, Trinity couldn't take much more, the bug was now about to enter her uterus, tentacles tease and tickle her vaginal walls it makes one final push it's tail wiggles and thrashes around violently and suddenly it's tail slips in her tight pussy a long loud muffled orgasm escapes her lungs \"MMMMMM MMMMMNNNNPPPPHH\"!!!!!!

She exited the building and started walking home, she was walking beside a parked all black escalade with pitch black windows the back door opens and suddenly she is stabbed with a needle and is pulled into the vehicle, Kate goes unconscious and is driven to some uknown location. Kate wakes up in a chair in a blank white room with a man in black sitting calmly across from a small metal table in front of her and two identical men standing beside her. \"Wha-Where am I?\" She asks studdering. \"Your location doesn't matter baby,\" replied the man sitting in front of her. \"This is ridiculous I want to leave immediately!\" She yelled. \"But you can't.\" The man said with a sadistic smile. \"Oh really?! And why is that?\" She asks. \"Because I have some friends in this little case of mine that want to play with you.\" Before she could even give an answer to the odd statement, she felt her lips loosen, the muscles in her jaw flex, strings of goo form between her lips the goo thickens and seals her lips together, skin molds over her entire mouth, she suddenly finds herself with a mouthless gag. She jumps out of her chair moaning panicking with her sealed lips, she charges for the door, the two men originally standing behind her catch her and push her into a wall, they keep her against the wall, one of the men started unbuttoning her shirt, The third man who was relaxing back at the table lets out a soft chuckle as her slim tanned stomach and deep bellybutton were revealed to the room, her belt is taken off and her pants fall to the ground, Kate let's out a moan of embarrassment when her bra is removed and her well sized breasts are exsposed, her nipples hardening in the process. Lastly her panties are ripped off exposing her pubic mound, now completely naked she is slammed on to the metal table on her back with her hands held above her head on the table and her legs held in place firmly. The man she spoke to in the beginning puts a finger on her skin sealed mouth and sais \"shhhhh, relax were just gonna have some fun.\" Kate moaning the entire time, the man opens up a case containing what looks like regular trackers of two different sizes, big and small, the man takes two of the small ones out, one in each hand he activates both of them a red light switches on both trackers they began to morph growing in length and wriggling in his hand, suddenly shards of glue break from the devices and and tentacles flail out of the device, the things in his hands were no longer trackers, they were small tentacled bugs, Kate screams and moans as he holds them over her chest, he drops the insects both landing right above her breasts, The two bugs begin crawling almost simultaneously one proceeding to each breast, they begin crawling up her soft mounds, she moans more, she constantly buckles under the men holding her but it was no use, the insects made it to the top of her breasts, there tentacles rake over her rich colored areolas tickling her and causing her nipples to be as hard as can be, the bugs swing their wiry tentacles around her aching nipples to thrust themselves foward, Kate moans and screams travel throughout the room as the bugs spread the thin edges on the orfice of her nipples. Then as quick as light, both insects plunge into her nipples with the front portion of their body squirming inside and the tail still whipping around outside the nipple, her moaning grows louder from the pain, Kate throws her head back against the table not wanting to watch the horror, but instantly, the man who dropped the bugs on her picked up her head a bit forcing her to watch the bugs  squirming in her nipples, she witnesses the last of their wriggling tails, catching them disappearing into her nipple ducts. She moans loudly to her orgasm. Hoping it was over the man walks over to her side, looking at her tanned and smooth midriff, at the same time Kate was moaning and squirming on the table as she feared what he would do next. He glances at her bottomless bellybutton and smiles. He opens his case again and takes out one of the larger trackers. He activates it, Kate moans as the bug morphs, it transformed into larger bug with longer tentacles  he dangles the bug over her belly, moaning continues, he drops the bug below her breasts, it crawls downward,it writhes around on  her bound stomach tickling her soft sensitive skin. The man bugging Kate signaled for his wingman to spread her legs, her pussy tight and wet, he begins running his finger on her soft mound and begins caressing the tip of her vagina Increasing Kate's muffled moans, meanwhile the bug crawled its way down to her bellybutton,it tickles the outside of the rim, its tail circles her navel tormenting her and making her pussy even more wet, tentacles are inserted one by one into her bellybutton, Kate arches her back as the bug spreads her navel wider and begins to crawl in, the bug wriggling in her belly, the man caressing her pussy, her soar nipples, barely being able to breath because her sealed lips, Kate throws her head back and moans to her domination,her moans grew louder and louder as the bugs tail slapped her naked tummy and crawled deeper into her bellybutton, \"MMMMMMNNNMMMNMMMMMMMMMMNMNMMPHHH\"!!! the bug's tail slips in.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ariel was enjoying her new life as princess to a surface kingdom. While she missed her old life and her family and friends under the sea, she was happy where she was. Sadly, for her, this was all about to change. While lying in bed with her husband, Ariel awoke to the sounds of a familiar voice. She opens her eyes slowly and turned her head to look around the room, it called out for her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAriel\u2026 Ariel\u2026 follow my voice Ariel\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for some reason, she did. The red headed princess got up from her bed, still wearing her night gown, and simply followed. It was hypnotic, entrancing, inviting even. With each quiet step, she got closer and closer to the voice. Walking all over the castle, walking as gently and carefully as she could through the dark hallways, she soon made it outside to the beach. Ariel regained some control of herself before her feet touched the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, who are you? Where are you?!\u201d Ariel cried out to the dark sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnter the water child, and all will be answered\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel gulped, though she was once again hypnotically entranced by the voice. Ariel took off her night gown and her undergarments, leaving her bare naked to the elements. She slowly walked into the water. The water was cold, but Ariel didn\u2019t mind, she was used to drastic ocean temperatures. Once her entire body was covered in water, the voice called out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwim my child, swim\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red headed princess did just that, as she dived under the water and swam as fast as she could, reaching further and further into the ocean. While swimming, the princess noticed that she wasn\u2019t having any trouble breathing, and that her legs and feet felt different, yet familiar. A glowing light was coming from Ariel\u2019s lower half, as her body was transforming back into the mermaid form it once was! Ariel noticed, but she did not care, the voice as too hypnotic, grasping all of the young lady\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor hours the red head swam to reach the voice, it was far, it came from the deepest and darkest parts of the ocean. She was heading to an underground sea cave that gave her memories of Ursula\u2019s home. The shocking memory was enough to break Ariel out of her hypnotic hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, what am I doing here? I better get out, I gotta find Eric or daddy, wait\u2026\u201d Ariel looked down and then it hit her, she was a mermaid once more, \u201cOh no, oh nononono!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes child, oh yes\u2026\u201d The voice echoed through the caves, this time sounding foreboding and closer than before, \u201cCloak, Dagger, seize her!\u201d Two stingrays came out of the cave, swimming at extremely fast speeds, getting to Ariel before she could even react properly. They surrounded the princess, swimming close to her, with their stingers right on her belly. Cloak pinched Ariel a bit on the side with his dagger, stinging Ariel slightly, while Dagger placed his stinger tail right in Ariel\u2019s tight navel, and any time she moved slightly, her belly button felt a slight cut or sting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA menacing figure out of the caves, it was a woman with eight long tentacles on the lower half of her body, and an aura that screamed \u201csea witch\u201d. However, unlike Ursula, this woman was thin and slender. The woman talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well, look what we have here. The famous little mermaid herself, daughter of Trident, reason of my sister\u2019s demise! Ariel,\u201d The witch laughed as the look on the mermaid\u2019s face became one of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrsula\u2019s sister?\u201d Her heart pumped and her body shook slightly, which only made the stinger inside her belly button hurt her even more, and the other stinger continually poked the side of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sister. You have, what was it, twelve of them? Must have been a pain, growing up with Ursula was dreadful. Mother always compared her to me, criticizing every little thing I do,\u201d The witch than began to do a mocking voice, \u201cOh Morgana, why can\u2019t you be more like your sister, your witch craft is too weak, why aren\u2019t you good enough?\u201d Morgana went back to her normal voice, \u201cBlah, blah, blah, blah, blah!\u201d The witch then turned around and commanded the stingrays and Ariel to follow her. The rays moved Ariel along with them so she wouldn\u2019t get a chance to swim away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeeper and deeper into the caves, they settled into an area that seemed to be the witch\u2019s home. The witch spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Ariel, while I don\u2019t like my sister very much, I still don\u2019t like what you did to her. I wanted to one day kill her and overthrow the sea kingdom, but I guess I\u2019ll have to settle with accomplishing one of my goals,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never rule the ocean, just like your sister, you\u2019ll be defeated! Once word gets out that I\u2019m missing, you are in such deep trouble,\u201d Ariel fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you think I\u2019m going to keep you here? Oh no my sweat child,\u201d The witch brushed her hand on the side of Ariel\u2019s torso, causing Ariel to moan a bit, \u201cYou\u2019ll be set free, and you won\u2019t remember this night at all,\u201d The witch pushed Ariel back on to the wall, making the stingrays leave, but tentacles came from the walls and held down the mermaid\u2019s arm and tail back. The girl struggled to get out, groaning in annoyance, trying to use all of her strength to be set free, but it was no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana laughed sinisterly, as she was making a concoction nearby. Her tentacles on the other hand were doing something else, as they all went closer to Ariel, reaching to her torso. A few of them held around the torso, the suction cups sticking onto her and quickly popping off. This made little visible marks show up on her belly, one of them being a big red mark over her belly button. Then a single tentacle decided to have some fun, and it played with Ariel\u2019s belly button. It went directly inside the navel, and tickled it, making the princess laugh and twist even more to try and get off. Then, two other tentacles got in and tickled her sides, and two more tickled the sides of the red head\u2019s navel, all of which made Ariel lose her breath, crying from intense laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all for the witch\u2019s amusement. A non-calm before the storm. The tentacles retreated back away, and Morgana came in to play. She cackled like a maniac, and pulled out a bug. The bug looked dangerous and mean, almost like a monster that was shrunken down. Ariel begged for mercy, trying to catch her breath as best as she can. But the witch didn\u2019t listen, she didn\u2019t want or have to. All she wanted was for her plan to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana gave Ariel\u2019s belly a little kiss, which disgusted the poor trapped mermaid, and then the witch placed the bug over Ariel\u2019s belly button. She let go, and the bug immediately dug itself into her navel. The stinging pain was many times worse than the stingrays, and more uncomfortable than the tentacles combined! It dug and bit and clawed its way into Ariel, as quickly and painfully as it could. The mermaid, sadly, was in agony. She groaned and cried, her belly was hurting bad enough already, but now her tiny little innie was getting ripped open by some dark creature. All she can do was to scream wildly, and as she screamed and cried, the bug only went harder, pushing itself in as best as it could to get inside Ariel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch cackled once more, her companion stingrays laughing alongside her too. While the bug was digging in Ariel, she went up close to the princess and brushed her hand on the girl\u2019s face and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you poor baby, you must be so scared,\u201d Morgana smiled while looking at the mermaid\u2019s distraught face, \u201cNow you must be wondering \u201cWhat is my plan?\u201d and \u201cWhy I put that bug that\u2019s trying to get inside you for?\u201d, all in due time\u2026\u201d  The sea witch condescendingly pinched Ariel\u2019s cheeks and went back to her previous position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creepy crawler was almost fully inside the girl, only a little more time, a little more pain and suffering for the red headed princess. As soon as it was able to create a hole big enough to fit in, the bug slithered quickly inside, with its slimy substance being left on the sides of the open hope in Ariel\u2019s belly button. Miraculously for Ariel, the hole started to close up and heal, all due to the goo produced by the bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bug insider her, she felt the slithering thing move all over insider her tight belly, and she cried once more thinking the worst. That was, until Morgana revealed her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Ariel, I\u2019m not sorry for what I did, and I have my reasons why. You see, what you carry inside you\u2026 is my child,\u201d Morgana got closer, placing her hand over Ariel\u2019s belly, \u201cOur child, and once that child is fully developed and ready to be birthed while you\u2019re a human, he will gain the ability to switch becoming a human and a mermaid at his leisure, and he will have a strong desire to take down your father!\u201d The witch put one of her fingers inside Ariel\u2019s innie and started to play with it, twisting and turning it around for fun, \u201cThrough our baby, I will rule Atlantis, I will rule the sea, I will rule the land above! But you won\u2019t remember this, you won\u2019t remember tonight at all,\u201d The sea witch placed her lips on the mermaid, kissing her softly, putting a spell that knocked her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next very early morning, Ariel woke up in her bed in a dire state. She looked around and saw that she was still in the castle, still next to Eric, and she reached to feel her legs and toes, and yup, she was still fully human. She sighed in relief and dismissed whatever she thought was real last night as to be a dark nightmare, though Ariel doesn\u2019t really remember much of last night, or isn\u2019t even interpreting the incident correctly. Like with all dreams and nightmares, we just forget what we dreamt of by morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel placed a hand on her belly. She breathed in and out, calming herself to truly relax her mind, but she could have sworn, even as her hand was above her night gown, she felt something slither inside her belly\u2026</span></div></div>",
