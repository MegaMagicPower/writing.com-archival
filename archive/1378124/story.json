One of the clowns stood next to the bed that Summer and Raven were bound on, smiling in appreciation as her sister clown went to work on an especially elaborate and cruel way of restraining little Jimmy and Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She practically pranced over to the two shivering children, their little wrists bound so that their arms were high over their heads.  Their toes could only \u00e2\u0080\u0098just\u00e2\u0080\u0099 touch the floor below them, and they wriggled around in place, wobbling frantically, fighting their restraints &amp; crying for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The clown girl looked positively delighted as she observed their struggles, and then acted on a few additions to their discomfiture that had her sister clown clapping and cheering her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Summer meanwhile was trying to whisper to little Raven, bound into a tight ball next to her atop the bed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTry to roll over to my bra!  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nail-file hidden in the hem. Hurry!

With practiced hands, she pants\u00e2\u0080\u0099ed the wailing Mouse and Jimmy and quickly snapped and velcro\u00e2\u0080\u0099ed the diapers into place where their shorts had been. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe not actual babies, but good enough for me.  Hee-Hee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, smiled the mean clown girl, and she mimicked the two, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWaa! Waa! Waa! They certainly sound like babies!  Hee! Hee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cStop it, you big bully!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, yelled Summer from her helpless position spread atop the mattress of the bed.  Raven was doing her fair share of wiggling around, but to little effect, made all the worse by her toes being tickled now and again by their own clown-girl captor out of idleness while they all watched her sister-clown tormenting the standing captives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Next, the clown girl tied rope lines around the waists of Jimmy and Mouse.  She then gently led the rope line down between their legs, pulling the two lines so that they led upwards, wedging tightly up their padded bottoms.  She then tied the lines around the necks of the opposite child! This forced the kids to stand back-to-back, looking away from each other.  Now, every time Jimmy tried to move his neck, Mouse felt the line yanked and draw up between her legs, rubbing her crotch and bottom, and Jimmy felt the same from the line running to Mouse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck!

However, before she could start untying it, the clown girls returned. Each of them was carrying a feather. One walked over to Jimmy who groaned at the thought of being tickle tortured again. The other walked over to Raven and Summer. Summer kept her hand perfectly still and hoped the clown girl wouldn't notice.<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, the clown didn't see where Summer's hand was, but she did notice something else: her bra. With a flick of her wrist, the clown girl knocked the loose bra off Summer's body. Summer's face turned bright red, and Jimmy did a lousy job trying not to stare.<br>\r\nThe clown next to Jimmy winked at him and said, \"What are you looking at, you naughty boy?\" Then she lifted up Jimmy's shirt and stroked the feather around his tummy, spiraling it into his belly button. Jimmy laughed and begged her to stop, but she just said, \"Little boys who disrespect a woman's privacy must be punished.\"<br>\r\nSummer's mind was still sharp, however, as she noticed that the clown girl sitting next to her was busy watching her friend torture Jimmy.

One of them sounded like it was laughing and begging while the rest sounded like there might be a party going on.<br>\r\nWhen she finally reached the top, Summer peaked through the door, and what she saw shocked her. A girl, who was about the same age as the boy she'd just freed, was tied to a round table surrounded by more people wearing clown masks. She was barefoot and there were stiff feathers attached to the edges of the table. The center of the table was able to spin, and whenever the clown-faces spun her, the girl's feet would rub across the feathers making her squeal with laughter.<br>\r\nApparently, the clowns had made a gambling game out of it, placing bets on where they thought her feet would be pointing when she stopped spinning. Whoever won the round would get to tickle the girl's feet for 15 seconds as a bonus before they placed their next bets and spun her again.<br>\r\nThe sight made Summer sick, partly because it was so cruel and partly because she was getting dizzy just watching the poor girl. There were too many of them to deal with, though, so she turned to go get help. However, at that moment, she heard one of the clowns start talking.<br>\r\n\"Yo, Lacy, shouldn't you be taking over guard duty from Frank right about now?\" he asked.<br>\r\nAnother clown-face (apparently Lacy) shrugged. \"He has Jimmy to keep him company, and you know he prefers tickling boys anyway.\"<br>\r\nThe clowns nodded and exchanged, \"True,\" and \"That's Frank alright,\" and \"Can't argue with that.\"<br>\r\nThen another clown said, \"Even so, you should probably go relieve him. Frank ain't exactly the best guard in the world, and you know how annoyed the boss gets when we don't rotate guard duties properly.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you have a point,\" Lacy said standing up. \"And I'm almost out of money anyway.\"<br>\r\nA thought suddenly passes through Summer's head: this could be the perfect time to set a trap for Lacy and get some information out of her. At the same time, though, Summer didn't want to force that poor girl to stay stuck to that table any longer than she had to be. <i>Should I just leave and come back with help, or should I interrogate Lacy first?</i></span></div></div>",

Only upon command from their superiors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went down the staircase again and looked for hints. In a corner she found an intercom access point. She inhaled deeply and made her voice adapt to a deeper female voice, and pressed the green button. \"Intruder alert. All staff assemble at the mausoleum.\" It did not sound terribly credible but for the rather stupid clowns it should help. She pressed herself into the corner when the clowns thundered down the staircase, visibly eager not to be caught by personal entertainment while being on duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective girl went up the staircase again. There the girl was still tied to the round table, visibly groggy from the relentless tickling. The knots proved to be too tied even for her delicate fingers. Frantically looking for any sharp item in the room she found a little, rusty knife. Quickly she cut through the ropes, but could not resist to get the girl fully awake by a quick tickling of her left foot, which made her jerk in alarm. Finally she was freed and hugged Summer so fiercely that they fell against the wall, the little detective banging her head hard. Next...</span></div></div>",

The slack of the rope was taken up, and Summer's arms were pulled together and soon stretched taut. She could hardly move, with her legs secured at the ankles to each of the corners of the rack, and she started to feel nervous. She was wearing a light sweater, dark skirt, and black tights, having been too excited about the mystery to take the time to change. She quickly regretted it as one of the clowns - Summer couldn't help noticing that despite the look they didn't have big floppy gloves but dainty fingers with long nails - insider Summer's thigh just above the knee, and slowly started digging her nails in. Summer sputtered and shook, but it got worse as she slowly continued digging her nails in all up her inner thigh until Summer was laughing her head off. The clown started to tickle the inside of the other thigh as well, while Summer shook her head and laughed at the tickle torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other clown was just letting this warm her up though. Soon she was standing at the end of the rack and carefully began drawing her long nails over Summer's soles. The tights offered a small amount of protection, but the clown's practiced hands were soon doing an even worse job than the one tickling Summer's thighs. She scratched all over as Summer's feet desperately twisted in their effort to escape, but the clown's persistence and Summer's extreme sensitivity on her feet meant she was only delaying the inevitable, and soon Summer was crying she was laughing so hard. Mouse could only watch in silence, sorry for her big sister but terrified that if she was noticed she'd get tickled too, so there was no reprieve for the poor girl detective. For over half an hour the two tickled all over her feet and thighs until it seemed like Summer was going to pass out from laughter, then they gave her a short breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a fun one!\" one of the clown's said gleefully. \"Now let's move to the top!\" Still struggling to get her breathe back, Summer didn't notice what was happening until she couldn't see; the two clowns had pulled her sweater all the way up onto her arms and then onto the ropes, leaving her exposed from the waist up. \"No stupid clothes to get in the way now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer looked on in terror as the clown's horrible grin closed in, as did her wriggling fingers. \"No, no more, please!\" Summer pleaded as they approached her stretched out armpits. \"Please-HAHAHAHA!\"  Her pits were so tight she couldn't move even a little and the nails wriggling over her poor pits tickled terribly. Summer tugged at her bonds for all the good it did, but there wasn't the slightest give. The other clown joined in, spider-crawling her fingers up and down Summer's sides, which was almost as bad, and then soon digging her nails into Summer's ribs, which definitely was as bad. The two girls spent the better part of an hour on her now, tickling her to the point of exhaustion but stopping just long enough for her to catch her breath, and then go back at it, tickling all over her pits, ribs, sides and tummy. They even delicately scratched one nail on her outie, and Summer went insane. By the time that was up Mouse was terrified for what they would do to her.</span></div></div>",

She tried to struggle, but within moments, her shoes, socks and top were removed leaving her even more vulnerable than her sister, who at least was wearing tights to protect her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" one of the clowns said, \"What can we do to make this more interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" the other one said holding up a blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Summer regained enough strength to yell, \"Leave her alone!\" but the clown girls ignored her as they tied the blindfold over Mouse's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one of the clowns moved over to start slowly stroking Mouse's feet while the other started drawing circles on her belly. Mouse moaned pitifully between giggles. \"No, please- hehehe -please don't tickle mehehehe. Pleahehehese.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clowns laughed at her and the one at her belly said, \"Aw, are you scared. That's too bad because the fun hasn't even started yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two clowns began their assault. The one at Mouse's feet began scratching her soles faster with her long nails, while the other began vigorously tickling Mouse's ribs. Mouse shrieked and laughed and begged them to stop, but the clowns just teased her and tickled faster. The clown girl at Mouse's feet noticed Mouse get a lot louder when she tickled her toes, and Mouse wouldn't be able to speak when the other clown tickled her belly button. The torture was even worse than she expected because she couldn't see where they were tickling her, so she couldn't brace herself for their attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the worst was when the clown girl at Mouse's upperbody discovered how ticklish Mouse's armpits were. When a single finger slid down her left armpit, she screamed so loudly that the two clowns looked up in surprise. \"Oho! Sounds like you found the sweet spot,\" The clown at the feet said, moving to join her comrade at Mouse's upperbody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse immediately began begging louder and faster than she ever had in your life. \"Nononopleasenotthere!

There's nothing you can do to stop us, so you might as well sit back and enjoy the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Mouse, the two girls stoked up and down her arms, building up the tension. \"You know,\" one girl said to the other, \"this always was my favorite tickle spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what makes you weird,\" the other one replied. \"But I guess you can't argue with success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they each slid one finger down into one of Mouse's underarms. The result was electrifying. Mouse went into silent laughter for a few seconds and then squealed as loud as she could before laughing uncontrollably. Mouse tried to pull her arms down to protect her armpits, but she was bound too tightly for that. Furthermore, her futile attempts to do so drained her remaining strength. Slumping down in the stocks, Mouse could do nothing but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, look at that, she's giving up with just one finger in each armpit,\" one of the clown girls said, genuinely awed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know; it makes me wonder what would happen if I did this,\" the other agreed as she started wiggling five fingers in Mouse's underarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Mouse drifted back into silent laughter, and when the other clown girl also used five fingers, Mouse found herself transported to a place where nothing existed but the agonizing sensation of tickling. Nothing mattered to her anymore except the sensation. She didn't even want it to leave anymore-- she didn't want anything anymore. In an instant, it was as though nothing existed except the tickling, and that was easy to believe since she was blindfolded and no laughter was coming out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this state of mind, Mouse had no sense of time, but at some point, she felt the torture reach a new height as both clowns started using both hands on each armpit. Mouse's silent laughter gave way to audible laughter for a few seconds as all the air in Mouse's lungs rushed out of her body. Then she was trapped, unable to breath at all. The world seemed to grow darker, even while wearing the blindfold, and in a matter of seconds, which felt like ten eternities, she fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on the nearby rack, tears streamed down Summer's face as she watched her sister fall unconscious.

So the clown girls stopped tickling Summer for a moment as they moved down to take off her tights.<br>\r\nAs soon as Summer realized what they were doing, she immediately began pleading for them to tickle her anywhere but on the feet. She even asked them to tickle Mouse instead, which made her feel really guilty afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown girls would not be deterred, however. They pulled off the tights and grabbed a box full of tickle tools. \"Hmm... what do you think I should use,\" one of them asked summer holding up a paintbrush and a feather. Summer shut her mouth and refused to give her the satisfaction of an answer. That was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, she's not talking to you,\" the other clown girl said, discreetly pulling out a hairbrush. \"Maybe she wants you to use both of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?? No, noahahAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Summer shouted as the second clown started violently rubbing the hairbrush on her left foot, drowning out her complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what a wonderful idea,\" the first girl replied, taking one tool in each hand. Then she set to work rubbing the brush on Summer's right sole while sliding the feather through her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMultitasking with two tools was extremely difficult, but the effects were rewarding. Overwhelmed by the sensation of a hairbrush, paintbrush and feather tickling her feet at the same time, Summer had fallen into silent laughter. For a few second she didn't make a sound while her face grew more and more red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally she let out a long loud scream followed by uncontrollable laughter. Summer tried to struggle, but her strength quickly drained out of her. Summer's entire essence was overwhelmed with sensation until nothing seemed to exist except the horrible tingling torture on her feet and the laughter spilling out of her aching lungs. She couldn't tell how long this lasted- maybe an hour, probably ten minutes -but just when she could take no more...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Summer had started blossoming a year ago, and while she never would have admitted it, part of the reason she wore things like this sweater was to show off. She was still small, like two halves of a grapefruit, but she had a lot of swelling around her nipples, almost like two cones. But she'd never imagined that, as the clown approached one with a feather, how it would feel as the soft quill ran along the swell of her boob. She snickered, then shut her eyes and tried not to look, but it was persistent and soon she was laughing despite herself. When the clown began lightly stroking the feather up and down the area near her nipple she squealed and tried desperately to shake the feather off. It was no good; soon the other clown was using a feather on her other boob, and it tickled just as bad as the first. Sometimes they'd draw the tip all the way up and lightly brush and swirl it on her nipples, and Summer would scream with laughter and buck furiously. She had never thought it possible but it was tickling even worse than anything they'd done before, their evil feathers tickling her sensitive boobs until she was turning red from the laughter. Summer tried begging, knowing it was pointless but desperate to get them to stop. As expected, they just laughed at her and teased how ticklish she was, even lightly scratching her boobs with their long nails to watch her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boobies like hers are too good to waste!\" one said gleefully, and the other quickly agreed. They stopped, but as Summer again tried to recover from the long tickling session she'd just been through she saw they were just running off to fetch something. Soon each was at it again, only this time they were using a paintbrush to apply some kind of runny chemical to her boobs. Unfortunately, that tickled just as badly as the feathers, and the two clown seemed to insist on being thorough, going over her sensitive titties again and again no matter how hard it was getting for Summer to breathe. Finally, when her boobs had been thoroughly stained light purple by whatever they were doing, they stopped, but only long enough to put away the bushes. \"Now it's sleepy time!\" one said, and she ran towards the end of the rack while the other picked up a feather in each hand. Soon Summer was screaming with laughter as the nails again ran over her poor fight while at the same time feathers ran over her somehow even more sensitive boobs. They tickled her more and more while she laugh and cried and fought to breathe until finally she could take no more and she passed out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two clown girls snickered as they took one last glance at Summer passed out before they turned to Mouse and grinned, Mouse cringed knowing that she was about to experience the same thing her big sister just went through. \"Let's make this more exciting\" the two clown girls said, then they placed a blindfold over Mouse's eyes and Mouse knew this was going to be bad, then Mouse felt her shoes and socks tugged off and the clown girls slid their nails up and down her small soles and Mouse erupted with laughter as her poor sensitive feet were tickled. The clown girls giggled as they watched Mouse try as hard as she could to break free with no avail, then the clown girls started rubbing something on her feet and when their nails touched her soles again Mouse knew exactly what it was \"No not Baby Oil\" Mouse cried before screaming out in laughter, she tried pulling her feet back but she knew she couldn't do anything but sit there and take it. Mouse was almost out of breath when the clown girls decided to give her a break before they moved up to her tummy, they pulled her shirt up and began tickling her tummy and ribs and Mouse didn't know how much more she could take, Mouse's face got red again and she started having trouble breathing when they stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the clown girls lifted Mouse's shirt all the way up and Mouse felt her bra taken off, Mouse\u2019s boobs weren't that big but they were big enough to do anything to, then the clown girls spidered their fingers all over Mouse\u2019s small boobs and Mouse screamed in laughter, this was pure torture for her, Summer might have more ticklish feet than Mouse but Mouse had much more ticklish boobs than Summer did. The clown girls continued their ticklish assault on Mouse\u2019s breasts and Mouse\u2019s face was already red and Mouse was breathing heavily and starting to cry from laughing so hard, soon Mouse passed out from the torture. The clown girls snickered again before decided what they should do with the two ticklish sisters, they could take them to the clown prince or leave them tied up for later and go search for their friends Jaime and Chris.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the end, the clown girls realized they could get in trouble if they didn't take the new prisoners to the Clown Prince, so they untied the unconscious Summer and Mouse and placed them on a cart. They rolled the cart through an underground passageway and then carried their victims up the stairs into the mansion. Then, one of the two girls walked over to a nearby wall and knocked on it three times. After a moment, a secret door opened, and the clown girls dragged Summer and Mouse into the secret chamber. <br>\r\nThe door closed mere moments before Jamie and Chris walked into that hall. The junior sleuths were getting very nervous without their fearless leader to guide them. Furthermore, they hadn't seen anything unusual so far, so they were considering going back outside to look for Summer when they heard muffled voices and maniacal laughter coming from somewhere.<br>\r\nOn the other side of the wall, Summer had just woken up. \"You must be the 'Clown Prince' I've heard rumors about.\" She said to the man standing before her. Looking him up and down, she added, \"You're shorter than I imagined.\"<br>\r\nThe Clown Prince cackled and replied, \"Ever the brave on, I see. We'll see if...\" The Prince's rant trailed off and a puzzled look came over him. Turning to his minions, he asked, \"Did you hear something? I thought I heard someone screaming.\"<br>\r\nThe clown girls resisted the urge to laugh, and one of them said, \"Your majesty, children scream all the time here; your servants spend hours tickling them into hysterics. It was probably one of your victims begging for mercy.\"<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" the Clown Prince replied, looking unconvinced.<br>\r\nIn reality, the scream had come from Jamie, who freaked out when she heard the Clown Prince's maniacal laughter. Chris, however, managed to stay calm and realized where the sound came from. Beckoning Jamie over to the wall, Chris motioned for the two of them to eavesdrop on the conversation taking place behind the wall.<br>\r\n\"In any case,\" the Clown Prince continued, returning his attention to Summer, \"I'm most pleased to meet you; you will make a fine addition to our collection.\"<br>\r\nSummer hung her head and pretended to give up. The first rule about bad guys is that they love to monologue when they think you're defeated, so Summer acted the part. She whimpered in a broken voice, \"What are going to do with us?\"<br>\r\nSummer's plan seemed to work as the Clown Prince launched into his speech. \"Well, you don't my employees and I kidnap children and tickle them as a hobby, do you? I'm a black market businessman, so of course money is everything. You see, I plan to sell you as tickle slaves to the highest bidder.\"<br>\r\nSummer's heart froze and she looked at the Clown Prince in genuine shock. \"You can't do that! Slavery is illegal in the U.S.; no one will take the risk of owning a slave.\"<br>\r\nThe Clown Prince laughed and replied, \"You silly girl. I'm a crime lord; illegality is my specialty. Besides, there are still plenty of countries around the globe where slavery is legal. If I can't find an illegal buyer here, I'll find a legal one somewhere else.\"<br>\r\nSummer glared at the Clown Prince, her blood boiling. \"You won't get away with this. Sooner or later you'll be caught.\"<br>\r\n\"By whom?\" The madman questioned. \"The people in this town are extremely superstitious; they are all convinced that a ghost is behind the recent disappearances. No one is going to come looking for you, and if even if someone does, they won't leave here unless their dead or a slave.\"<br>\r\n\"<i>I'll</i> stop you!\" Summer cried out. \"I promise you, I will tell the police, the FBI, EVERYONE about what you're doing, and then you'll be sorry.\"<br>\r\nThe Clown Princes smile slowly faded and he grunted. \"I see. Well, that attitude just won't do in a good slave. Mary, Molly, take these two to the stocks and process them. I want them broken and ready for sale by the end of the month.\"<br>\r\nOutside the room in the hall, Chris and Jamie looked at each other with their mouths open. They had to stop the Clown Prince, but they couldn't leave Summer to be tortured. In the end they decided...</span></div></div>",

She tried to free herself, but she was bound too tightly. Then Summer looked over at her sister and saw that Mouse had also been tickled until she passed out. Summer tried calling her sister's name, but it was no use; Mouse was out cold.<br>\r\nSo Summer lay there alone in the cold uninviting room for what felt like hours. Every so often a breeze would blow through the chamber and she would get goosebumps over her almost completely naked body. At one point, she even thought she could see her breath. <br>\r\nEven worse than the cold, though, was the silence. The room was so quiet that it made Summer want to scream just so she could here something louder than a whisper. She tried talking to Mouse again several times, but she still got no response.<br>\r\nBefore long, Summer actually started wishing the clown freaks would come back and torture her some more. At least then something would be happening, but this silence, helplessness and anticipation was more maddening than the tickling was. And the worst part was, she couldn't ignore the sensation by going to sleep, because every time she closed her eyes, a breeze would blow through the room and wake her up shivering.<br>\r\nJust when she thought she really would scream if something didn't happen, Summer heard muffled voices coming from outside the torture chamber. One of them was too quiet to make out, but she tried hard enough, she make out her captors' voices quite clearly.<br>\r\n\"Please, just give us some more time,\" one of them was saying.<br>\r\n\"They won't get away from us, boss. Please give us another chance,\" the other added.<br>\r\nThe third voice said something that Summer couldn't make out, but it sounded like whoever their boss was, the clown girls had screwed up something and it made him (or her) very mad.<br>\r\nThen Summer heard the clown girls scream, and she heard one of them cry out, \"No, no, please, not that! Please just give us another chance! Just don't put us in the stocks!\"<br>\r\nThe voices fell silent.<br>\r\nFor several moments nothing happened, and this new silence was even more maddening than the old one because Summer was expecting something terrible to happen at any moment.<br>\r\nThen she heard footsteps approaching and the sound of something large being dragged. Finally, a door creaked open, and the evil mastermind entered, dragging his unconscious minions towards the stocks.</span></div></div>",

She saw she was still alive though, but they needed a knife to cut the ropes, in her struggling she'd pulled the knots too tight to undo any more, so Chris volunteered to keep watch over her while Jaime ran off to look for something. He waited, but soon he couldn't help himself. He'd only joined Summer in this junior detective stuff because he was starting to have funny feelings about her, and seeing her passed out and topless was just too great a temptation. He hesitantly reached out a hand and took hold of one of her boobs and slowly began squeezing it, thrilled at the sensation. He began fondling both of them, but drew back in horror as he heard a purr come from Summer's throat. She still didn't respond though, so he went back at it, and soon she did so again and again as he squeezed and stroked her boobs, stopping just as he heard Jaime coming. She had a book of matches and got to work burning through the ropes, and soon Summer came around. \"Are you all right?\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Summer said. \"Mm, I had the weirdest dream that I was a lump of bread dough being kneaded in a baker's shop.\" She looked down in embarrassment as she recalled she was topless and quickly took the sweater Chris sheepishly offered. \"Where's Mouse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't seen her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she was here before I passed out,\" Summer said. \"They must've taken her somewhere else, we should get moving, but be carefully, they're sneaky and will do... unpleasant things.\" She didn't want to admit that she was so ticklish, it seemed childish, especially for a junior detective. She looked at the floor carefully. \"Look at the footprints in the dust near the other door, the one coming into the room is walking funny.\" She took a couple practice steps. \"Yes, the person was walking backwards, I bet the two clowns carried Mouse out of the room... she must've been unconscious because there's no sign that she was struggling.\" The three ran to the door, shocked to find out that there was a red brick wall behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible,\" Summer said while Chris banged on it here and there with his fist. \"The footprints lead through this door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whatever happened, this is solid,\" Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there's some kind of hidden switch that moves the wall?\" Jaime suggested. The trio started looking but could find nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we maybe bash it down?\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Summer said. \"And even if we did we'd destroy any clues on the other side. We have to look for another way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer,\" Jaime said, \"I hate to say it, but maybe we should get some grown-ups? It was fun but if someone's kidnapped Mouse we should really get some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can handle this,\" Summer insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if we get grown-ups we can get like the police and firemen and all that to sort it out. We don't want to take a chance if someone might be doing something really bad to Mouse.\"</span></div></div>",

Some yards before the end of the tunnel a grid of iron bars blocked their way. Meanwhile they could feel a cold breeze from the opening. It must have become much colder outside than they had thought. Chris tried to push it forward by force but could not move it more than half of an inch. There was no way to squeeze past. Going back was not really an option given their liberty within their immediate reach. Summer could hardly focus on this problem with thoughts of the tickle torture Mouse would be subject to just now. They just had to get through and get into the house again to save Mouse. While they pondered, they heard a crushing sound which made them jump. Summer even hit her head at the ceiling from this shock. It had happened behind them. It was too dark to see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer went to analyize the mechanism in detail. There was no lock assigned to it. It was not completely fixed to the ceiling, why Chris was able to push it a bit. The three children were combining their force and pushed against the iron bars. It opened just a bit more. There seemed to be a mechanism allowing it to swing. Summer found a completely rusted structure at the ceiling which should have allowed the iron bars to swing properly. After some minutes of effort from moving the gate back and forth the children were sweating and gasping for breath. Summer decided that they would have to find some oily substance to pour into the mechanism to let it swing again. \"We need some oil or other liquid substance to make it go. Any ideas?\" Jamie shook her head, but Chris blurted out \"The walls in the room. They had a slimy substance.\" He rushed back into the darkness, but returned soon. \"The way back is blocked by a door which must have been hidden in the ceiling. Maybe we have triggered some alarm when we pushed against the bars. They went back deep in their thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris suddenly remembered that his hands were still slippery. He must have touched something before. Then he blushed when it came to his mind. He had wondered back then when he touched Summer's bare blossoming breasts when she was unconscious on the rack why they were so slippery. His thoughts of the wonderful feeling he had when caressing Summer aroused him again. This liquid might help move the mechanism. There was little left on it on the surface of his hands, worn from touching to many things in between. But maybe there was something left on...But how could he propose it without letting Summer know that he groped her in her helpless situation. It would destroy any trust between them. Summer meanwhile became despaired from the thoughts about the horrors Mouse would have to endure. Her skin had sunk to towards her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy knew it had to be said. \"Ahm S...Summer. There is some substance with us that could help.\" The older girl's head shot up \"What is it? Where?\" Chris dragged his words along, still not knowing what to tell. The girl sleuth became impatient. \"Spit it out. Mouse is in serious trouble.\" The boy winced. \"I know. But it is difficult to tell. When you were, hm, tied there at the rack, I checked whether you were still alive. My hands suddenly became very slippery when I touched your body.\" Summer's eyes went wide. Her nipples still tingled from the previous treatment, but there seemed to be another reason now. \"Where did you touch me? Did you - my boobies?\" Chris just nodded. Just an instant later a hand lashed out hitting Chris fully on his left cheek. \"You monster. You freak. How could you...\" Then she broke up, realizing that Mouse was more pressing than her disgust from being fondled. \"So what?\", she demanded, her sleuthing mind being blocked by her anger from coming up with the solution herself. Chris outlined: \"If there is still some substance left there, we could wipe it and try to smear it into the mechanism. There is some on my hands left, but this will not be enough.\" Summer blushed. But her hand went under her sweater top. She winced when her fingers touched her blossoming breasts and flipped over her nipples, her gasp audible for the other two children. Her breasts pleaded for more touching. Reluctantly she glided her fingers repeatedly over her breasts. A fire built up inside her which might from now on always burn. Chris's heart was beating fast when he saw from the corner of his eyes what was happening to Summer. When she removed her hand it felt indeed sticky. She turned around, still blushing, and smeared it into the mechanism. Without looking at Chris, she turned away. Chris followed her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother round of pushing and shoving made the bars move better over time. Finally the mechanism cranked and the door opened wide. They raced forward to the end of the tunnel. To their horror the tunnel ended over the water surface of the river. It would be impossible to climb to the shore. They would have to swim. Meanwhile they started to shiver from the cold air outside. The river must be much colder still. Goosebumps appeared on the children's skins. Jamie, who had been quiet for some time, said: \"If our clothes get wet in this cold we might freeze to death.\" Summer looked around. Jamie was basically right, but more important was the danger of drowning if they tried to swim in their clothes. The currents were visibly quick. Plunging into the river and swimming back to the shore would be a big challenge anyhow. Jamie spotted a plastic bag hanging from a twig. Chris and Summer held Jamie tight while she leaned out from the tunnel and was able to grab it. Summer ordered everyone to strip and just keep their panties on. All other clothes had to go into the bag. Summer, the best swimmer of the lot, would have to swim with the bag. Quickly all children stood there with their panties on. Summer's eyes went wide again when she could clearly see the bulge in Chris' pants. The boy in turn tried not to stare openly at Summer's breasts. Jamie's little buds had hardly started to develop yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey jumped just one after another into the freezing current.

Are you still there, Summer?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm here,\" Summer called back into the darkness.<br>\r\nThen another voiced groaned. \"Yeah, you're here alright. You're sitting on me!\"<br>\r\nSummer almost shrieked as she felt someone moving underneath her.

Me, do something that cruel? Well unfortunately, no. I was trying to do this silly town a favor by trying to catch the Clown Prince, but they cornered me. I pulled that lever hoping an escape route would appear, but... well, take a guess what happened.\"<br>\r\nSummer rolled her eyes, even though she knew her nemesis couldn't see it. \"Yeah, sure, you were just trying to be nice. I'll believe it when 2+2=5!\"<br>\r\nPao-Ting sniffed dismissively. \"Believe what you want, but that won't change the fact that we're trapped down here.

Then Chris and Jamie almost laughed at the idea of a ghost saying \"tickle,\" but Summer put a finger to her lips and motioned for them to follow her lead. Cautiously, Summer peaked outside the mausoleum. A little distance away in the graveyard was a glowing blue woman who's features Summer couldn't quite make out.

Remember all those kids who went missing? This is probably a trap. Maybe we should go back and try looking for Mouse after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer hesitated and looked back at the \"ghost.\" Chris had a point-- this was probably a trap.

It was maddening the way they would switch-up their attacks, changing feet mid-tickling, or changing the pace from slow to fast, or one fast, the other slow.  Summer had long-since stopped even trying to come up with something she could say to make them cease, as even when she managed to catch her breath long enough to protest, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d cut her off by suddenly resuming their attacks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now red-faced, and breathless, legs inadvertently quivering from kicking against the ropes binding her ankles to the footstool during the ordeal, Summer is nearly at her wit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, plea-TeeHee!

Feather taunts Summer by making witchy laughing sounds, pretending to mimic her own tiny laughter.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cEeeHeeHee, Dearie!  HeeHeeHeeHee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her face a rictus of laughter, mouth wide, eyes tightly shut and head furiously nodding side-to-side at each new tickle, Summer tried to reply, stating she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound at all like that when she laughed!  Unfortunately for her, Lickly had taken to switching her position; now sitting on top of Summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extended legs, both her big toes in the Lickly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wide-open mouth!  Meanwhile, Feather had gotten up and moved around to behind the chair, playfully tickling Summer on her neck, cheeks and nose with a feather in each hand, varying her attacks in maddening fashion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This new onslaught had the desperately sensitive detective literally bucking against the restraints, as she was totally flabbergasted to be tickled in two of her worst places (feet/neck) like that!  Such was her vexation; she at one point nearly lifted chair clear off the floor of the dark, scary underground cellar chamber in her screaming fury!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The clown girls seemed to absolutely love the effect they were having on Summer, and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear at all like they had any desire to end their wicked tickling assault that was leading to such a tantrum from Summer.  On the contrary, Feather was murmuring \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see if we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find any other especially delicate places underneath this shirt, shall we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d with an evil grin, while she unbuttoned Summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top from the bottom up, focused her gaze on Summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suddenly exposed belly-button and sleek tummy.  Lickly gave Summer tiny nibbles on the soles of her feet, as if to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make you pay more attention to down here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as she made creepy moaning sounds while driving Summer into a renewed frenzy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAAAAHAHAHA!!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d is all the young sleuth could manage in-between bouts of silent laughter and chortling snorts.  They were really going to work, wearing Summer down with their constantly changing attack.  She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how much more of this she could take!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Summer was trying to yell for help again from anyone within hearing range, but Lickly and Feather would move their ministrations to a new ticklish place, sending her into hysterics again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As if to add insult to tickling, the clowngirls would mimic her laughing, only making it sound alternately like a wicked witch might laugh, or really nasally, like a little brat might sound.  Summer felt that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound like either mocking version, and tried to voice her complaints, only to drown herself out with another bout of furious ticklish laughter.  That they were able to make her own sensitivity her biggest weakness was absolutely infuriating to Summer, who was literally screeching now, thanks to their all-over touching and icky licking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

It was so obvious that they were planning to betray her and Jamie that it was almost funny. \"What makes you think we'd agree to that?\"<br>\r\nThe first clown girl didn't seem to know how to respond to that, but the second one did. \"Because if you don't, we'll scream loud enough to wake up the guard, and then you'll be in as much trouble as us.\" <br>\r\n\"You mean this guard?\" Summer turned around to see that Jamie had tied up the snoring oaf in his sleep. <br>\r\nThis time, Summer <i>did</i> laugh. <br>\r\n\"Hey, Summer, what should we do with these two?\" Jamie asked motioning to the two clown-faces. \"We can't just let them go; if we run into trouble, they'll use us as decoys so they can escape.\"</span></div></div>",

Let's try to look around maybe the key is somewhere in there?\"Said Summer<br>\r\nThey looked around for about ten minutes.

After about 30 minutes Summer doesn't know how much more she can take when the feathers on the floor stop moving and the mechanical hands go back into the ceiling, Summer sighs in relief and looks around trying to figure out what's going to happen next when the door that her friends went through opens and 5 clown girls come out, they giggle as they look at Summer trapped and helpless.

Glaring profusely, Summer simply said, \"I knew it; I knew you had to be behind all this. Who else in the world has a passion for crime, clown makeup and tickling?\"<br>\r\nThe Clown Prince shrugged as his minions struggled to tie Summer onto a rack. \"Well, the Joker comes pretty close, but your right, in the end no one really understands a mad genius like mine.\"<br>\r\nSummer rolled her eyes, but was getting scared as the Clown Princes henchmen started to crank the rack and stretch her body.<br>\r\n\"Be careful not to crank it too far this time,\" the Clown Prince warned. \"I want her at my mercy not in a hospital.\" The clown minions gulped and nodded their heads in assent.<br>\r\nOnce Summer was adequately bound, the Clown Prince ordered his underlings to leave him alone with his victim. The Clown Prince then pulled off her shirt to expose her upper body. \"Are you ready?\" he asked, grinning maliciously. Summer refused to give him the satisfaction of an answer; she knew he was just going to tickle her anyway. Instead, she steeled herself for the coming torment, determined not to let the Clown Prince see her laugh.<br>\r\nAfter a moment of waiting for an answer, the Clown Prince placed one finger on Summer's left armpit and slid it down her side to the top of her legs. Then he dragged the finger back up Summer's side and into her armpit again. Summer squirmed but maintained a straight face as the Clown Prince repeated this process several time. However, she couldn't help grinning for a moment when the Clown Prince lightly spider-tickled two fingers down her side. Even so, Summer regained control of herself and the smile faded. <i>If I can just keep from laughing, maybe he'll get bored and leave me alone,</i> she though. It was a silly hope at best and a foolish one at worst, but it was all she could do at the moment.<br>\r\nBut then the Clown Prince suddenly switched tactics, digging all ten of his fingers into Summer's ribs. The change was so unexpected that Summer couldn't keep her composure, and she shrieked and laughed and bucked on the rack. The Clown Prince laughed and teased her saying, \"Aw, did I surprise you? Yes I did, didn't I? Tickle, tickle, tickle!\" Summer shifted her waist from side to side, futilely trying to shake off the Clown Prince's fingers.<br>\r\nThen the Clown Prince started tickling Summer up and down her sides, taking care to pause on her armpits for a few seconds each time before going back down her sides. Summer tried with all her strength to pull down her arms, but she was stretched so tightly that the Clown Prince could easily tickle every inch of her underarms without any difficulty. In this moment, Summer learned something she wished she'd never needed to know; while her armpits certainly weren't the most ticklish spot, not being able to pull her arms down over them when they were tickled was even more maddening than the Clown Prince's teasing.<br>\r\nJust when Summer thought the situation couldn't get any worse, the Clown Prince started tickling her breasts. Summer screamed and her face turned very red (which could've been because of how much it tickled, but she later insisted it was because she was so embarrassed). \"Nonononotmyhihihihihihiboohoohoohoobs!\"<br>\r\nThe Clown Prince just laughed in her face. \"Whatsa matta?\" he asked. \"Are your boobies ticklish?\" And with that he proceeded to tickle all over Summer's breasts. By the time he finally gave her a break, Summer felt like crawling in a hole and hiding. But the Clown Prince wasn't done yet, and Summer was filled with dread because he'd saved her two most ticklish spots for last.</span></div></div>",

Summer felt the cold baby oil pouring on her feet. It wasn't nice, but she knew the worst had yet to come. At first she felt Pao-Ting's two fingers slowly moving around her sensitive soles.

Toes were her weak spot, with Pao-Ting's skilled fingers between them, she was laughing hysterically. Even thought she was going crazy from the tickling, Summer tried to think of a way to stop Pao-Ting. It wasn't easy with all that tickling, but then she noticed that Pao-Ting's feet were rather close to her. She still had shoes and black kneesocks on. Maybe If Summer managed to take off one of her shoes and tickled Pao-Ting, she would be able to gain upper hand there.

Summer smiled \"This wont do, these socks are getting in the way\" Summer said as she removed Pao-Tings kneesocks then Summer grabbed the baby oil and began rubbing it on Pao-Ting's soles then Summer continued tickling Pao-Tings feet and Pao-Ting laughed louder, pretty soon she was laughing hysterically. Summer then got up and walked over to the suitcase, \"lets see what else we have in here\" Summer reached in and grabbed an electric toothbrush and sat back on Pao-Tings back and turned the toothbrush on and placed it on Pao-Ting's feet and Pao-Ting went nuts, Summer was having the time of her life, she has always wanted to torture her rival, now she understands why Pao-Ting gets enjoyment out of trying to capture her and tickle her like this. After another 30 minutes of tickling Pao-Tings feet  Summer decideds she is done and says \"so long Pao-Ting I have to go find my friends\" then Summer leaves the room.

The clown girls had apparently noticed them and were now scrambling to get to the door.<br>\r\n\"I just made a plan,\" Summer said, eyes-widening. Then, enunciating her words very clearly, she added, \"Run like crazy!\"<br>\r\nNo one argued and the four friends ran through the mansion with the clown freaks yelling at them and chasing them. Suddenly, Chris tripped while they were running down a staircase, and the four friends tumbled to the floor like dominos. Groaning in pain, Summer looked up to see that they were surrounded by the five clown girls and more were coming, having heard all the noise. There was no time for Summer and her friends to disentangle themselves before the clown girls pounced on them and tied them up like a present. Then one by one, the four friends were knocked unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Summer awoke she was chained up in stocks back in Pao-Ting's office. Pao-Ting was there, of course, and she did not look happy at all. It was at that moment that Summer realized she wasn't wearing anything, so not only was she completely vulnerable to tickling, she was also extremely embarrassed.<br>\r\nPao-Ting walked over to Summer and sat in front of her feet. \"So you thought you and your friends could escape, huh? More importantly, you thought I'd let you get away with tickling <i>me</i>, the greatest kid genius of our time?!\"<br>\r\n\"Keep flattering yourself,\" Summer mumbled, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Mock me all you like,\" Pao-Ting growled dangerously, \"but now that you're properly secured and your friends have been captured, you have no hope. I win, and you are doomed.\"<br>\r\nThe Chinese girl's dramatic statement frightened Summer, but she couldn't hold back a snide remark. \"'You are doomed?' What are you, a megalomaniac? You've been hanging out with the Clown Prince too long; next you'll be shooting lightning out of your hands or growing a curly mustache.\"<br>\r\n\"That does it!\" Pao-Ting declared, tickling Summer's feet with reckless abandon. Even though Summer had brought this on herself, the magnitude of the sensation surprised her. She suddenly realized that Pao-Ting must have rubbed baby oil all over her feet while she was unconscious.<br>\r\nSummer laughed and squirmed and shrieked and cried, but nothing would stop Pao-Ting now. In fact the exact opposite happened; the kid-genius picked up a hairbrush in each hand and went to Summer's upper body. Before Summer could beg her to stop, Pao-Ting had started using the brushes on her ribs, belly, sides, underarms and even on her breasts and thighs. The sensation was maddening, but Summer couldn't do anything about it, and to make matters worse, Pao-Ting would switch tickle spots before they could be desensitized.<br>\r\nBut the worst was yet to come. Pao-Ting stopped for a moment to let her victim breath and to taunt her. \"Aw, what's the matter. Can't the great <i>detective</i> handle a couple of hairbrushes? This is nothing; by the time I'm through with you, you'll be begging in your sleep!\"<br>\r\nCoughing and giggling, Summer tried to plead with her captor. \"Please, no more. Can't we just make a deal or something?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Pao-Ting replied moving over to Summer's feet. \"And when I'm done with you, I'll turn you over to the Clown Prince. I understand he specializes in breaking the will of his victims so he can sell them into slavery. If that's true, then I'll finally be able to scheme in peace knowing that you will never get in my way again.\"<br>\r\nBefore Summer could respond to this, Pao-Ting began brushing her still oil-covered feet. Summer drifted into silent laughter for a few moments and then screamed as loud as she could. After that, all she could do was laugh and laugh as the bristles slid over ever inch of her feet, and just to make things even more irritating, Pao-Ting brushed vigorously on one foot and slowly on the other.<br>\r\nSomewhere in the back of her mind, Summer started praying to whatever gods might exist that she would be rescued. However, with Jamie, Chris and Mouse also having been captured and probably being tortured at this very moment, she knew that no help would come anytime soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNot a chance. Girls--!\u201d Before Summer could finish her phrase, Footsie emptied the content of her spray can on the four girls. It was a thick pink cloud that engulfed them completely. The girls began to cough, swatting their arms around in a useless attempt at clearing the air around them. Still, Footsie\u2019s attack had been so quick that it took them off guard, and none of them was able to prevent themselves from breathing in some of the pink mist.<br>\r\nThe first thing they realized was that it smelled strangely sweet. Like cotton candy and lollipops. <br>\r\nThe second thing they realized is that, being completely engufled in the pink gas, they didn\u2019t have a choice but to breath it, a bit more with each breath they gave. <br>\r\nThe third they realized is how badly they began to feel the need to laugh so suddenly. It was\u2026 a really strange feeling. It began as a bubbling, trembling sensation inside their bellies, slightly euphoric at first. In a matter of a few seconds, everything around them began to seem absolutely hilarious, ridiculous, hysterical even! Being trapped in a evil mansion, full of clown girls? People from the town captured to be tickled on the soles of their feet? A tickling ghost that haunted the mansion? Every single thing seemed funnier than the one before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s why they began to laugh. All four of them. It started as a few restrained chuckles, but very soon all of them felt how a powerful urge to laugh louder each time slowly took over them. The chuckled turned into giggles, the giggles turned into laughter, the laughter turned into cackles, the cackles turned into deep belly guffaws and howls of completely hysterical laughter.<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds and with no effort, Footsie had reduced the gang of four smart and spunky girls to laughing fools that guffawed like if there was no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm perhaps the hard way isn\u2019t so hard after all, huh? I mean, look at you, having the time of your life, cutie pie!\u201d Footsie said in front of Summer\u2019s face. The girl detective could only let out her hysterical howls of laughter and merely point with her finger at the clown girl in front of her, slapping her own forehead. <br>\r\n\u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d was all the sound that came out of her, or out of any of the girls, for that matter. Summer knees quickly failed her, and she collapsed onto them.<br>\r\nNext to her, Mouse simply landed flat on her back, her arms and legs sprawled around her, while she laughed as hard as she never laughed before. She couldn\u2019t comprehend why everything was so funny to her now, but she wasn\u2019t going to put any resistance against it. She merely let herself being carried away by waves and waves of loud, neverending hysterics.<br>\r\nA few feet behind her, Chris lied on the floor, curled up into a ball. The possibility of she and her friends being captured by the clown girls and subjected to some extremely effective foot tickling seemed hysterical, exhilarating even! Warm tears of laughter ran down her cheeks while she mused that scenario.<br>\r\nStill standing on her long and slender legs was Jamie, the biggest of the four friends. Everyone, clown girls included, were surprised to see that the highest and most ridiculous laughter, came from the girl with the most \u201cadult\u201d voice, body, and attitude. She was also facepalming herself, taken over by laughter as she pointed to Footsie like if the clown girl was the funniest thing she was ever going to see in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re still on your feet, I see. Do you think we can change that?\u201d Footsie teased the girl, who continued to howl with silly deep belly laughs. <br>\r\n\u201cWOOHOOHOOHOOHOOHOHOHOAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d <br>\r\nFootsie simply shoved her gently on her shoulders, making the poor teen girl land right on her rear end, unable to get up again.<br>\r\n\u201cMan, I love laughing gas. It makes everything so easy.\u201d Footsie said. Her fellow clown girls shared a giggle with her. It was almost inaudible, though. The sound of four sets of hysterical laughter filled the whole room completely.<br>\r\n\u201cAnywho, I think we should show these audacious little girls what happens to those we trap. Specially when they are audacious little girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fellow clown girls helped Footsie to prepare the girls for what was to come. They began to pick up the girls as the helplessly laughing heaps they had turned into under the effects of the pink gas, and putting them inside something that very much resembled a sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t any sleeping bag, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cushioned cocoon of sorts, with enough room to encase the girls up to their necks. With only their heads sticking out, the four girls ended up snuggled and unable to move in any fashion from the neck down.<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t of any concern to them, though. Still under the effects of the gas, the girls continued to find everything about them from funny to absolutely hysterical, during several more minutes. <br>\r\nStill, the gas had effects that lingered for a little bit more. And despite their dire situation, they couldn\u2019t shake off a giddy sense of sillines inherent to the whole situation. They weren\u2019t cracking up, but still sputtered a few girlish giggles and chuckles here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I told you it was the hard way!\u201d Footsie said jokingly. All four girls laughed at the joke, like if they weren\u2019t completely restrained and in the hands of mischievous clown girls at that moment. Said clown girls found that adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd all of it because you tried to run away when I merely offered you to entertain you! Kids these days\u2026\u201d Another silly joke from Footsie. Another good-natured laugh from the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd *teeheeheeheehee* how were you going to do that?\u201d Mouse asked, her usual naivete being amplified by the lingering effects of the laughing gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, I usually like to tell people the origin of my name. You don\u2019t find that many people around called Footsie, after all. She snapped her fingers, and at once many of her fellow clown girls kneeled at the girls\u2019 helpless feet, and began to slowly untie their shoelaces. They all felt it, but instead of a sense of dread and impending doom, they felt the rush of being playing the funnest game of their lives!<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! They\u2019re gohohohohohoing to tickle our feet!\u201d Said Chris, tittering with giggles at the idea.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Tickling? What would make you think of that?\u201d Said Footsie, in a nonchalant tone. \u201cNope, tickling won\u2019t be involved in this at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the girls felt their respective sneakers getting loose on their feet. The feeling of playfulness excitement in their chests only grew. In their giddy state, it was like if it was impossible to feel anything other that playful silliness.<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, the clown girls began to take off the girl\u2019s shoes. They made it at a deliberately slow pace, generating nervous giggles and chuckles in their captives.<br>\r\nThe clown girls were greeted by four pairs of adorable looking girly feet, encased in different kind of socks. Summer had a simple pair of white cotton ankle-high socks; Mouse next to her was sporting a pair of colorful, mismatched socks, with a purple left sock with yellow polka dots, and a right pink one with color stripes across it. Jamie had dark grey socks with cartoony skulls all over them, while Chris had baby blue socks with smiling fat kawaii cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeeheeheeheehee I\u2019m sure pretty sure we\u2019re gohohohing to get tickled anywahahahayheeheeheheheheehee\u201d Summer said, still trying to make sense of the situation, even under the effects of the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssssssh, where would you get that idea? Nonsense.\u201d Said Footsie. \u201cBy the way\u2026 you all have some cute socks!\u201d<br>\r\nOver their own giggles, the girls were able to hear the clown girls comenting on their socks, appreciating their details and such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I was saying, I don\u2019t always get the chance to tell people why I\u2019m called Footsie. And no tickling involved, honest, I swear. It\u2019s not much of a mystery, you see\u2026\u201d With devilish sluggishness, Footsie began to pull from the tip of the toes of Summer\u2019s right sock, making it slide ever soooooo slooooooowly from her dainty little foot, until with a last \u201cpop!\u201d it came off completely.<br>\r\nSummer wiggled her toes out of reflex. A few nervous giggles escaped her lips as she did so. <br>\r\nFootsie sat at the feet of the restrained teen detective and showed her own bare feet to her. <br>\r\n\u201c... it\u2019s because it\u2019s favorite game to play, that\u2019s all. And I\u2019ve heard I\u2019m quite good at it, too. Here, let me show you.\u201d The clown girl finished her sentence, and began to press gently her own bare feet against Summer\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen sleuth flinched, shaked her head from side to side, but it didn\u2019t took her more than two seconds to start ricocheting giggles out of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfffffffehehehehehehehehehehehehe don\u2019t ahahehehehehehehehehehe my feet hahahahahahaha are so tickleeheeheeheesheeheeheeheeheehee!\u201d<br>\r\nWhile she laughed herself silly, Footsie merely looked at her with an innocent smile, pretending not to notice the effect she was having on the girl detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you are that ticklish? Oh, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026 I really didn\u2019t mean to tickle you. I just wanted to show you how I like to play footsie. Like I said, I\u2019m quite confident in my own skills. I\u2019d say it feels quite pleasant, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d Footsie\u2019s voice was simply delightful to hear. Her tone was calm, sweet, and loving, almost motherly. But at the same time it was bubbling with provocation.<br>\r\nAnd worst of all was, as much as Summer hated to admit it, it did feel nice on her feet. Hell, it felt great. Footsie\u2019s feet were warm to the touch, something much welcome on her own tired feet. Not to mention, her touch was merely a few movements away from being a soothing massage. But, being as ticklish as she was, Summer couldn\u2019t resist laughing when the silky surface of Footsie\u2019s bare soles came in contact with her own two feet, the bare one and the socked one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And under the last lingering effects of the gas, she couldn\u2019t help but find it immensely fun and exhilarating! She was almost on the verge of enjoying being tied up and tickled like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! Pffeehehehehehe they\u2019re tickling Summer! Hahahahahaha they\u2019re going to tickle us too hahahahahahaha!\u201d Jamie began to shake around while laughing herself silly, encased inside her own cocoon.<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahaha we\u2019re so ticklish we\u2019ll never be able to stohohohop lauging hahahahahahahaha\u201d Mouse laughed freely at her side.<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahaha Jamie\u2019s arches are her most ticklish spot, girls! Hahahahaha go gehehehet her hahehehehehehehe\u201d Chris, acting a little bit sillier than her teammates, simply splurted out her friend\u2019s weak spot.<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha Chris, shut up! Hahaha hey, listen! Chris likes to play footsieeheeheehee, even more if it ticklesehehehehehe, and so does Mouse! Hahahahaha\u201d Jamie retorted.<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Hahahahaha Summer likes to get tickled too! Hahahaha although she hates to admeeheeheet it heeeheeheehee!\u201d Mouse tittered with girlish giggles, exposing one of her older sister biggest secrets.<br>\r\nThe clown girls reacted letting out a collective \u201cooooooooh!\u201d, teasing the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould that be true, Summer?\u201d Said Footsie.\u201d Could you like being tickled oh so gently like this, on your cute little feet?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahaha I don\u2019t knohohohohow hahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d Summer laughed, under the effects of the gas, and under the effects of Footsie\u2019s toes dragging lazily over her soles.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I think you dooooooo\u2026 Come on, I told you that I got my name after my favorite game. I think you should be nice with me and admit it if you like getting tickled like this\u2026 wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahahahaha!\u201d Summer flushed in a bright pink color. Footsie knew that it wasn\u2019t a sudden reaction to the tickling. She had hit jackpot: Summer enjoyed getting her feet tickled and the embarrassment was killing her!<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, cutie pie\u2026 just tell me\u2026 tell me you like getting tickled\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahaha I do hahahahahahahaha! I love getting tickled on my feet! HAahahahahahahahaha!\u201d At the very second her confession came up, her laughter went up a notch. Footsie smiled with satisfaction.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s so nice to hear\u2026 and you don\u2019t want me to stop, then\u2026 don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahahaha no! Hahahahahahaha please hahahahahahaha tickle my feet hahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYour wish is my command, baby girl\u2026 coochie coochie coo!\u201d Footsie said, putting her expert feet at play. Summer laughed delightfully.<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, girls, I think perhaps you should follow suit. Who knows, perhaps we\u2019ll also find out Summer\u2019s friends also like to get tickled after all!\u201d<br>\r\nWhile giggling, all of the clown girls began to remove their footwear. Shoes, sneakers, boots, socks, and pantyhose fell to the floor, and in seconds, all of the clown girls had their feet bare to display at their captives. Not only that, each of the restrained girls lost one sock as well, just like Summer did a few moments ago.<br>\r\nSummer\u2019s friends and sister giggled nervously at the inherent sillines of the show, but also knowing what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what came was an explosion of laughter. At the very moment the clown girls began to use their own feet to tickle the feet of their captives, the room filled with youthful, raucous, clumsy, carefree laughter.<br>\r\nThe clown girls even giggled themselves, seeing how much of a reaction they could get with just a minimal effort.<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you like it too, don\u2019t you baby girl? You\u2019re just a cute little tickle bug like your big sis!\u201d Said the clown girl playing footsie with Mouse, making her laugh and giggle hysterically. <br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahahaha okay hahahahahaha I confess HAhahaHaahhaha! I like getting tickled toohoohoohoohooahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you like to play footsie too, huh? So then I guess you must be looooooooving this so much!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahaha I ahahahaham hahahahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAtta girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, Chris was shaking around as little as she could, laughing a bit louder than her friends, even blushing a little bit more than Summer as well.<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh girls, this one is blushing a lot! I think some girl here really likes to play footsie\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahahahahaha so mehehehehean hahahahahahahaha! Please don\u2019t teeheeheeheease me like thahahahahahaht ahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTease you like what, cutie pie? Like saying I think you like how my feet feel against your a little more than you\u2019re letting on?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHahahAhaHAHAHAHA shuhuhuhuhut uhuhuhuhuhuhp hahahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d Said the clown girl, nonchalantly. \u201cI mean, it was your friend the one who told us that you liked to play footsie. I think we should both be thanking her, huh?\u201d The clown girl winked at the hysterical Chris, and looked over to where Jamie lied, completely taken over by the tickles on the soles of her slender feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhohohohohohoho! Woohoohoohoohohohohahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d Long, sustained bouts of laughter erupted constantly from Jamie\u2019s mouth. It was a funny spectacle to witness. The tallest, more mature girl of the group, the one with the more adult sounding voice and the one with the bigger feet, cackling hysterically in a way that was almost comical. There was an almost ridiculous quality to her voice, and the way her slender feet reacted to the tickles that made it so.<br>\r\n\u201cI love when the biggest ones are the most ticklish! And also you have such a fun laughter to hear, baby girl!\u201d The clown girl playing with Jamie\u2019s feet teased her.<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahahahaha thahahahahahanks ahahahahaha! HAhahahahaha! Ohohohohohohohohoho!\u201d Jamie simply responded naturally and by continuing to laugh out loud, unable to do anything else, or even to oppose resistance to those sensations coming from her long soles.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re such a cutie patootie. You like an adorable, big, ticklish little baby. Yeah, I think that\u2019s what you are, right? Say it with me, cutie. Say \u2018I am a ticklish little baby\u2019.\u201d The clown girl teased Jamie in a patronizing manner. Still, that didn\u2019t matter to her, and she complied nontheless. <br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahahahaha I am a ticklish little babeheeheeheeheeheehaahahahahahahahohoohoohoohoohohohohahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen sleuth and her friends continued to laugh wantonly as the minutes passed by. More confessions about their hidden love for being tickled were taken from them, as well as personal and other people\u2019s ticklish and weak spots. The clown girls learned about how Summer\u2019s neck was insanely ticklish too, how Jamie was really feather ticklish, or how Mouse couldn\u2019t resist having a raspberry blown against her soles. <br>\r\nThe girls lost their remaining socks as the massive game of footsie went on. Footsie, the clown girl, also took her time to play with each and every girl, although she realized Summer was her favorite. The game of footsie evolved into other forms of tickling, like playing Hangman on the girls\u2019 soles, or silly games of \u201cSpy Interrogation\u201d, countless rounds of \u201cthis little piggy\u201d, and more. <br>\r\nThe girls laughed during hours, leaving the effects of the laughing gas way behind them, and laughing only due to the loving tickles on the soles of their bare and helpless feet. During all that time, they realized something: they were truly enjoying being tickled in such a way. <br>\r\n\u201cHow come I\u2019m liking this? What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Summer though to herself. \u201cI hate to admit it, but\u2026 it feels great! And is so much fun\u2026 have I alway been like this, or did this place did something to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind still pondering possibilities, Footsie approached Summer\u2019s face, to get a good look of her laughing while her fellow clown girls continued to tickle her feet. <br>\r\n\u201cThis was an interesting discovery, wouldn\u2019t you say? Summer Salt, girl detective\u2026 and secret tickling lover! It\u2019s so great to know you\u2019re like the rest of us\u2026\u201d Footsie\u2019s voice oozed with genuine joy.<br>\r\nIn return, Summer could only keep on laughing.<br>\r\n\u201cSince you like this, I guess we could show you where\u2019s the rest of the people that we brought here\u2026 We are playing fun games like this with them too and such. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ll love it!\u201d<br>\r\nSummer couldn\u2019t speak, but her thoughts bounced against each other inside her head, confusing her. \u201cI think\u2026 damn it, I think I\u2019d like that! How can I be thinking this is actually fun? I came here to rescue that people, and now\u2026 I\u2019m going to join them!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact\u2026\u201d Footsie continued. \u201c... I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ll not only love that, but you\u2019ll love it here, as well. We could play like this forever!\u201d<br>\r\nFootsie\u2019s words sinked in into Summer\u2019s mind. She looked at her sides and saw her little sister and her friends, delighted in being so helpless, laughing to their heart's content. She imagined herself and her gang, in a room full of people subjected to the most creative and mischievous forms of tickling. Her own voice and laughter mingled with the rest as the clown girls would render them helpless with tickles, while she felt happily submissive.<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahahahahaha yehehehehehhehes ahahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d She surprised herself saying.<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh, that\u2019s so great!\u201d Footsie cheered. \u201cI know you will love it here\u2026\u201d The clown girl said. \u2018Loving it here\u2019 meant being captive and tickled along with her sister and friends for Summer\u2026 but she knew inside her the clown girl was right. She was going to love that. What was happening to her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome home, Summer!\u201d Footsie said to her laughing face. Somehow, the teen sleuth felt that was right. She felt strangely at home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then Summer's wits returned to her and she turned to run, but before she could get away, one of the clown girls reached over to the wall and tugged on an old painting (ironically of a clown pulling a prank on an unsuspecting gentleman). In that instant, the secret switch behind the painting flicked on, and the ground disappeared under Summer's feet.<br>\r\nSummer plummeted down a dark passage and landed on a soft mattress, whereupon she called out, \"Oh, come on: <i>another</i> trapdoor??\" Summer stood up and looked around.<br>\r\nAnd immediately all her hopes evaporated. She was one of the mansion's living rooms and was surrounded by clown minions. Some were still surprised by the new arrival who'd dropped in on them, while others were too preoccupied with children who were tied up in various styles all over the room.

Apparently they had been caught a while ago and were being tortured. <br>\r\nSummer braced herself for the worst, but most of the clowns weren't really interested in her and moved back to their other victims. A couple of them stayed, however, and started tickling Summer's bare feet. <br>\r\nThey hadn't been at it for long, however, when the three clown girls that Summer had run into before came into the room, dragging a very angry Pao-Ting behind them. \"Hey, move that boy somewhere else,\" one of them said, pointing to the boy tied up next to Summer. The two girls who had been tickling Summer did so, giving her a short break while Pao-Ting was secured next to her.<br>\r\n\"You can't do this to me!\" Pao-Ting was shouting. \"Don't you know who I am?! When my parents hear about this, you'll lose all of their financial support, and then they'll track you down and pay you back for this!\"<br>\r\nThe clowns all over the room laughed while the tying up her wrists said, \"Yeah, sure... not! You know your parents hate you? They think your a spoiled brat and they want the boss to teach you some manners.\"<br>\r\nWhile Pao-Ting sat speechless upon hearing this, one of the other clowns gestured to Summer and said, \"Yo, new girl, thanks for leaving this pig all tied up for us; it made our job a lot easier.\"<br>\r\nFor a moment, Summer felt a bit guilty, but then she remembered how mean Pao-Ting was and how she refused to listen when Summer said the Clown Prince would betray her. The Chinese girl deserved what was about to happen. It was all the other victims Summer should be feeling sorry for. Summer and her friends were the only people in town willing to look into this mystery; now that they'd been captured, no help would come anytime soon.<br>\r\nAs the clowns pulled out feathers and held them towards the two rivals' feet, Pao-Ting turned to Summer and said, \"For the record, I'm blaming you for this.\"<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter who we blame,\" Summer sighed dejectedly. \"We're stuck in this together now.\"<br>\r\nMere seconds later, their laughter mingled as the clowns tickled their feet long into the night.</span></div></div>",

Both of them had been stripped down to their underwear, and there was a table nearby with all sorts of tickle tools on it. This last fact was obviously meant to scare the two rivals, but instead the kid-genius was yelling, \"Show yourself traitor! I'm warning you, when I get out of here I'll-\"<br>\r\nPao-Ting stopped yelling when a door on the other side of the small dark room opened and the Clown Prince himself entered. Smiling almost kindly, he said, \"I knew you must've woken up; I could here you from the far side of the mansion.\"<br>\r\nGrowling at the evil tickler, Pao-Ting said, \"What do you think you're doing? We had a deal!\"<br>\r\nThe Clown Prince nodded sagely and replied with mock seriousness, \"Yes, that's true, but it just broke my heart to see how much you two hate each other. So I've decided that you need some bonding time with rival. Trust me, by the time you leave you'll both be laughing together.\"<br>\r\nSummer rolled her eyes and groaned at the stupid puns while Pao-Ting yelled, \"How dare you! You let me out right now, or my parents will make you sorry!\"<br>\r\nMoving over to the table covered in tickle tools, the Clown Prince replied, \"You're probably right, but I'll have even more regrets if I let you go now, so... yeah, sorry but your not going anywhere.\"<br>\r\nSelecting one of the tools, the Clown Prince grinned maliciously at them and asked, \"Now then, which of you pretty young ladies would like to be first?\"</span></div></div>",

AHAHAHAHAHAHA\"Pao-Ting was interrupted by soft tip of a feather being brushing all around her sole.<br>\r\nJust like Summer, Pao-Ting's most ticklish spot were her feet, the feather quickly made her struggle against bounds and try jerking her feet to the sides, but Clown Prince's masterful tickling techniques weren't giving her even a second of break. Summer felt a little bad for her, she didn't like Pao-Ting, but never wished her to be subjected to tortures of the Clown Prince himself, she also trembled at the thought of being next to receive that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such cute sensitive feet. You laugh is truly a music to my ears.\"Said Clown Prince, now brushing the feather between Pao-Ting's wiggling toes<br>\r\n\"Y-YOU WILL HAHAHAHAHAH REGRET IT!!! HAAHHAHAHHA BASTARD! HAHAHAHA\"Said the chinese girl between her constant laughing<br>\r\nAt this moment Clown Prince used his free hand to start tickling Pao-Ting's other foot with his fingers too.

You didn't think we would leave you there? We found a room with clothes and makeup accessories, so... since I am eldest, and tallest of our group they decided it will be most convincing to dress me up. Now let's get rid of those ropes\"Said Jamie walking towards Summer<br>\r\nShe started by those restraining Summer's feet. While she started cutting ropes with her pocket knife, she couldn't avoid to look at Summer's cute feet. For some reason Jamie always liked seeing her friends' feet, sometimes even tickling them playfully. But she shook her head now, knowing it's bad time to do that.<br>\r\nJamie cut the ropes one after the other. After a while, Summer was free again. She got up from the bed and stretched her limbs. After looking around the room she noticed her clothes(Aside from socks and shoes of course, which were left in room with sticky floor), so she went to wear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now free me!\" Said Pao-Ting seeing Summer freed<br>\r\n\"Should we free her too?\"Asked Jamie<br>\r\n\"What?!

Worse yet, when they struggled to get free, they all fell down into the glue one by one so they were completely stuck.<br>\r\nBut from the time the apparition first entered the room to the point where all her friends were on the floor, Summer didn't move an inch. She just stared at the newcomer.<br>\r\nThe ghost laughed and asked, \"Why do you not flee? Have I so thoroughly frightened you that you cannot even move? I thought you were supposed to be a fearless <i>detective.</i>\"<br>\r\nBut Summer wasn't paralyzed with fear at all. On the contrary, when glowing girl attempted to push Summer onto the sticky floor, Summer easily dodged and tossed the \"ghost\" into the superglue instead.<br>\r\n\"Nice ghost costume <i>Pao-Ting,</i>\" Summer said with a laugh. \"Did you make it yourself or did dear old daddy buy it for you?\"<br>\r\nJamie, Chris and Mouse couldn't believe what they had just heard. Pao-Ting was the Featherton ghost? But how did she fit in with the Clown Prince? But even more surprising was when Pao-Ting laughed back at Summer.<br>\r\n\"Well done, my nemesis, I expected nothing less. But as usual, I remain one step ahead.\" With that, Pao-Ting raised her free arm over her head and smashed a vial of chemicals onto the floor. Immediately the superglue started evaporating in a thick gas that left everyone coughing for a moment. When the gas cleared, Pao-Ting had escaped, but most of the superglue was also gone.<br>\r\n\"Well, that was one way to get unstuck,\" Chris said while stretching.<br>\r\n\"Uh, wait, my hair is still stuck in this sticky stuff.\" Everyone turned to look at Mouse who, unfortunately, was the furthest away from Pao-Ting when she used that chemical to free herself.<br>\r\nSummer groaned inwardly. Leave it to Mouse to cause even more problems. \"Alright, let's go; my guess is that Pao-Ting uses this trap a lot, so she'll have more of that chemical stashed somewhere. We're gonna need it to help Mouse. Either that, or one of us needs to become a chemist.\"<br>\r\n\"That's actually not a bad idea,\" Chris started to say. \"A lot of modern detective work involves using chemicals to...\" Chris' voice trailed off when everyone gave her an irritated look. \"I'll shut up now.\"<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Mouse asked. \"What am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\nSummer sighed. \"I'm sorry Mouse, but you won't be able to do anything until we can get more of that chemical.

She was afraid the clown girl was going to start tickling her feet, but then to her amazement, Summer realized that the clown was actually tied up next to her. <i>That's odd,</i> she thought. <i>If she's in stocks too, then who brought us here?</i><br>\r\nThat was when it came: a ghostly apparition phasing through the wall and into the room. It looked like a woman, but it was slightly transparent. Its most stunning feature, though, were its eyes, which simultaneously had a faraway look while containing a very obvious madness. Summer gawked and thought, <i>this can't be real; this must be... a hologram or something!</i><br>\r\nBut then the thing spoke, its voice echoing through the room and waking up the clown girl who stared at it in wonder and fear. \"Children fighting... fighting is naughty... bad children must be punished... I will punish them daddy...\" it said, as though it was in a trance.<br>\r\nThen the being knelt down next to Summer's and the clown girl's feet. <i>It's just a hologram and a recording. It's just light and sound waves. It can't actually tickle me! ...Can it?</i> Summer got her answer when the apparition daintily lowered its fingers onto her and the clown girl's feet. Instantly Summer felt as though five of the world's coldest feathers were stroking her soles, and it made her laugh and shiver at the same time. Next to her, the clown girl was already in hysterics- struggling and screaming and begging for all she was worth. Apparently her feet were even more ticklish than Summer's!<br>\r\nBut Summer didn't think about that for very long because then this <i>thing</i> did the eeriest thing Summer had ever experienced; it slid its fingers through her feet and them on both the inside and the outside at the same time. The sensation was unlike anything she'd ever felt, and Summer's body didn't seem to know how to cope with it. In between her laughing, she screamed, snorted, sneezed and even had the hiccups! Furthermore, her feet didn't seem to have a clue how to dodge this attack, and the cold was making it harder to move them, so before long Summer's feet didn't even struggle anymore.<br>\r\nBut the worst part was when the ghastly fingers slid up to the toes; even if Summer scrunched up her toes, the feathery fingers were still able to phase through them, tickling under and between them at the same time. Both Summer and the clown girl drifted into silent laughter, but the clown was lucky; she fainted soon after the toe tickling started. <br>\r\nSummer, however, stayed conscious throughout this ordeal, and the whole time, what remained of her logical mind was thinking, <i>This can't be real!</i> Finally, something occurred to her. Sherlock Holmes used to say that once you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. In this case, no mortal being could defy the laws of physics like this creature could. Therefore...<br>\r\nThis must be the <i>real</i> ghost of Ms. Hildegard Featherton!</span></div></div>",

A large, shadowed figure of a man stood erect within, and a pair of baleful red eyes gazed down at the two Salt sisters.  Before she could do anything to protect herself or her sister, Summer everything went black as Summer passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to, Summer couldn't tell how long she had been out.  Groggy and disoriented, the image of those red eyes was etched into her mind, and she shivered, wondering what had happened.  She tried to  move, but found that she couldn't.  The grogginess faded away rapidly as she began struggling against whatever was holding her.  She couldn't see anything, even though her eyes were open.  She was about to scream in fear and frustration when a voice came from her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer?\"  Mouse sounded scared.  \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer calmed down at hearing her sister's voice.  \"Yeah, it's me.  Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I can't see, and I can't move, and I'm scared.\"  Mouse sounded like she was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...I'm in the same position.\"  Now that she was calm, Summer more closely examined her predicament.  She seemed to be sitting in a rather large chair, with soft cushions on the seat and back.  She could feel a soft fabric wrapped around her head.  A blindfold, which prevented her from seeing anything.  Her wrists were tied together in front of her, and a rope was holding her elbows against the back of the chair.  The same rope seemed to be wrapped across her elbows and just below her ribs, tightly securing them to the back of the chair.  Another rope held her waist secured to the chair's back as well.  Her knees and ankles had been tied together, and she could feel her legs stretched out before her.  Her calves rested on what felt like a large padded footrest, and were secured to it with more rope, leaving her feet hanging slightly over the far edge.  She could only assume Mouse was in a similar situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouse, do you remember what happened after we opened the coffin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I just remember seeing these mean-looking red eyes, and then I woke up here just a few minutes before you did.\"  Mouse whimpered.  \"I'm glad you are here, Summer.  I thought I was going to be alone, and I was really scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer was about to say that she would do her best to protect her little sister, when they heard the eerie creaking of a door opening up nearby.  Heavy footsteps entered the room, and then the door creaked closed with a soft click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad to see you young ladies are awake.\"  The voice was masculine but soft, and held a tone of self-confidence and charm.  \"Did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls answered with questions of their own, shouting at their captor in unison, but asking different questions.  Summer shouted \"Who are you?\" while Mouse yelled \"Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, children.  There is no need for yelling.  As for your questions, you are on the top floor of the Manor, in one of the master bedrooms.  I am Count Featherton, owner of this Mansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count Featherton?\"  Summer asked, perplexed.  \"But this Mansion has been abandoned for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, I have been out of commission for some time, but being a vampire does have its advantages...such as immortality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vampire?!\"  Mouse squeaked.  Summer could suddenly hear her younger sister struggling to free herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't seriously expect us to believe that.\"  Summer said, trying to sound brave.  \"Everyone knows vampires don't exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe what you will.\"  Featherton said.  \"I assure you, I am quite real.  Which brings us to a question of my own:  there was a pendent locked in the lid of my coffin.  The coffin you girls opened up.  It acted as a lock, preventing the coffin from opening unless the pendent was removed.  Seeing as the coffin was opened and I was released, you must have removed the pendent.  I want to know where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence fell.  Neither of the girls had any idea what pendent the man was talking about.  There hadn't been anything of the sort on the outside of the coffin that they had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know anything about any pendent.\"  Summer stated.  \"Now can you let us go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not.\"  The man replied, his voice thick with mock-disappointment.  \"Don't take it too personally if I don't believe you, but I will have to take steps to get the truth out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to eat us?\"  Mouse squeaked in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heavens no, child!\"  The man laughed.  \"At least, not in the way you probably fear I will.  You see, I am a special breed of vampire.  While others of my kind delight in the taste of blood, I feed on something far less substantial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is that?\"  Summer asked, growing more nervous as the situation played out.  She could almost hear the smile on the man's lips when he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that would be telling...and I've always found it more fun for my victims to find out on their own.\"  The sisters swallowed in fear.  \"Now, I must ask again, and if you refuse, then I shall begin my methods of extracting the information from you.  Where did you hide the pendent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know what pendent you're talking about!\"  Mouse shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right,\" Summer nodded.  \"There wasn't any pendent in the coffin when we opened it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I see I shall have to do this the hard way.\"  The man faked a sigh of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer heard the man walk over to her left, near Mouse.  There was silence for a moment, except for some faint shuffling noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"  Mouse asked, half confused half scared.  \"Don't take off my shoes...leave those on...why--wait, no, leave my socks on!  Why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer's mind was racing.  What could this man possibly do to them that required they lose their shoes and socks?  It didn't make any sense.  Then her heart sank into her stomach as she listened to Mouse's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEP!  Oh no!  Nononono!  Not that!  I can't stand that!  AAH!  No, please, don't ti--hihihhihihihihihihahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\"  Mouse's plea dissolved into frantic giggles, which turned into frenzied laughter.  But she didn't need to finish the word for Summer to figure out what was happening.  The man intended to tickle torture them.  Her feet twitched nervously at the thought.  Both girls were insanely ticklish, especially on their feet, which both girls regarded as their worst tickle-spot.  They avoided any situation that had the potential for tickling like it was the plague.  Summer wanted to scream; she knew that her own feet were at least twice as ticklish as Mouse's were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!  Ohohohohohohoh plehehehehehehease!  Hahahahahahahahahaha--stop!  Stohahahahahahahap tiheheheheheheheheckling mehehehehehehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you tell me where you hid the pendent.\"  The man told her firmly, talking over Mouse's laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahaha--I--hahahahahahahahahahaha--I don't--hahahahahahahahahahaha--I dohohohohohon't know whehehehehehere it is!  Hahahahahahahaha--GYAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"  Summer shuddered as she heard her little sister scream in hysterical laughter.  \"NOHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAT THERE!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA--NO!  PLEASE!  STAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer could only listen as her sister was tickled mercilessly for the next several minutes.  Sometimes she only giggled without end, other times she screamed in hysteria.  But always she begged the man to stop tickling her.  Summer was reaching a breaking point.  She couldn't stand to hear her sister tickled much longer, and wanted to say something to end her torture.  But she knew in doing so, she'd be putting her own super-ticklish feet up on the tickling block.</span></div></div>",

(It was probably the latter considering how old these dungeons were.)<br>\r\nRegardless of how it happened, Mouse's upper body was suddenly free, and for a few moments while she tried to free her legs from the footrest, Count Featherton just watched her with a somewhat dazed look.

Mouse squealed and laughed, but she was determined to make this monster pay for what he'd done to her sister. Mouse launched herself forward, knocking over the footstool her ankles were tied to and slamming into Count Featherton with surprising force.<br>\r\nOf course the vampire wasn't hurt by this- he was immortal after all -but it did knock him to the ground and gave Mouse the time she needed to untie the knot on her ankles.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mouse's tiny feet hurried over the cool floor tiles of the mausoleum. Not having her shoes did not bother her yet, she'd have time to worry about catching a cold later since right now she was so focused on getting away. In fact the cold sensation on her bare soles and toes felt kind of good, taking away some of the nervous tingling caused by the foot tickling she had received earlier. She stopped halfway through the exit and spun around on her tiptoes to see what was happening behind her, and let out a sigh of relief when she saw that there wasn't a vampire behind her. Just then though, as she was backing out, somebody whispered into her ear:<br>\r\n\"Where are you going little girl? I'm gonna getchuu~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed,  dropped on her knees, turned her head around, saw Count Featherton, then she half ran half crawled away from him and sprinted into the forest. Out of breath as soon as she felt she was out of sight she crawled under a bush as fast as she could manage. Peeking out from her hiding place, she could see the figure of the old vampire sweep past murmuring things like:<br>\r\n\"Where are you hiding, little one? You know you can't hide yourself from me, I'm gonna find you and get you...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lied there with her hands on her mouth trying to keep quiet, it suddenly occured to her what this situation reminded her of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt resembled a game she used to play it with their mom.<br>\r\nWhenever Mouse was bored and had nothing to do, she'd find her mother who'd usually be working on something around the house, and bother her to get her attention or intentionally do something that'd tick her off. It was Mouse's way of signalling she wanted to play their chase &amp; punishment game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne time she walked around the house with a pair of cymbals, another time she stole her pencil while she was out for a minute, another time she would crawl under her chair and poke her foot with her finger until she lost focus. (Mouse and Summer's mother had just as frightfully ticklish feet as her daughters). She'd usually try to ignore her first, then, when she had had enough, she sprung up and chased her all over the house with Mouse running away from her screaming and laughing. Mouse'd then often hide under a bed or a pile of clothes or sheets and waited in excitement for her mother to find her. When she did, she'd usually tickle her all over until they were both exhilarated and exhausted. It was a really fun mother-daughter pastime for rainy days and weekends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes while she was hiding (especially if her mother was slow to find her), she'd let her foot stick out from her hiding place on purpose and waited excitedly for those unseen fingers to start teasing them. Her mother would always sneak up on her without making a noise if she spotted her, and the anticipation and thrill that came with waiting for her and not seeing her was some of the best feelings she ever knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rare for Summer to participate in her games (she'd usually sigh and shake her head in disapproval if she saw her causing trouble), but there was one memorable occasion: their mother was called away halfway without Mouse knowing while she was hiding in Summer's room and she did not hear Summer arrive home. All she noticed was that as she was lying under her sister's bed, she suddenly felt two hands around her ankles trying to pull her out. All that achieved though that she became lodged under the mattress - she could've told Summer that she did not get in that way. When she realized this, Summer sighed, then she tickled her feet for the rest of the afternoon until she promised not to go into her room again a dozen times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Summer considered tickling to be torturous unlike her younger sis, Mouse always treasured the memory of that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was waiting there all crouched up, her two feet tucked under her, she realized (with some disgust) that although the situation was more serious it gave her a similar kind of thrill too. While Summer was no doubt annoyed whenever she wasn't in control and would have preferred for things to go smoothly for her apart from the occassional puzzle-solving challenge, for Mouse it was different: being chased around by dark figures, her imagination running wild with what was going to happen to her if she was found, this was closer to Mouse's idea for adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that she must've been lying there for ten full minutes and remembered that she was a helpful younger sister too whose duty was to rescue her older sister. But how'd she know that Count Featherton wasn't only hiding himself, waiting for her nearby to reveal herself?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The vampire turned to look in surprise at the newcomers. It was just starting to believe that the Salt sisters really <i>didn't</i> know where the pendant was, and if that was true, then maybe these two girls had stolen it. Even if they hadn't, the count was eager to get more victims into his stocks.<br>\r\nBut what the vampire didn't expect was for Jamie to pull out silver spoon and start waving it at him. \"Back, you monster! Get away from our friends!\" Despite how silly it looked, it was working. Although Count Featherton was virtually immortal, the mere sight of silver caused him to scream in pain and cover his eyes. For a couple moments, the vampire's will was strong enough to try and attack Jamie and Chris, but when Jamie wacked the spoon on Count Featherton's face, he let out an unearthly squeal and ran from the room as fast as he could.<br>\r\nJamie breathed a sigh of relief and turned to Chris. \"See, I told you this thing would be useful.\"<br>\r\n\"You were right,\" Chris conceded, starting to undo Mouse's bonds. \"Now stop gloating and get Summer out of that thing.\"<br>\r\nAfter Mouse and Summer were released, Mouse, Jamie and Chris waited for Summer to regain consciousness and then explained what happened. Summer was confused by one thing, though, \"Wait, how did you know about the vampire, Jamie? I mean, he's not mentioned in the town legends; they say the ghost of Hildegard Featherton haunts the mansion.\"<br>\r\n\"True, but how many of them have actually been in the mansion?\" Jamie pointed out. \"When we were wandering around that place, I saw a painting of Count Featherton and there was an inscription under it that said, 'When night falls, he who feeds on the living will rise from his tomb,' and that didn't match up with the local myths. So when we stopped by the kitchen and saw the rare silverware, I thought I'd be prepared for <i>other</i> kinds of undead.\"<br>\r\n\"I told her she was acting more like one of the Ghost Busters than a Junior Sleuth,\" Chris added, \"but it looks like I eat my words on this one.\"<br>\r\nSummer laughed and reassured him saying, \"Don't worry about it; I would've said the same thing before meeting that creep. Still, this mystery isn't solved yet. We... kinda accidently released Count Featherton ourselves, and that means he couldn't have been the one kidnapping people. Did you find any clues suggesting who else might be here?\"<br>\r\nChris and Jamie shook their heads. Summer puzzled over this for a few moments; someone's been kidnapping children and that someone was probably the same person who stole the pendant that locked Count Featherton in his coffin. But who was it and what was their goal?<br>\r\nEventually Summer said, \"We're not going to learn anything by sitting around here, and as long as you have that spoon, we should be safe from Count Featherton. I think we should go back to the mansion and keep looking for clues.\"<br>\r\nNone of the others wanted to stay while there was a vampire lurking about, but Summer's logic was sound. And so, the group traversed up the stairs from Count Featherton's secret dungeon into the mansion and started searching through the various rooms. <br>\r\nAfter about thirty minutes had passed, Summer thought she heard someone talking. She motioned for her friends to stop and listen, and sure enough they heard a muffled female. Cautiously, Summer followed the sound into a bedroom. Upon opening the door, she could hear the unseen girl moaning and mumbling, \"Daddy won't find me here... not this time... I won't go back... Why did he have to wake up?... Not now... I'm not ready... It's okay... I'll be safe here... he won't take me back this time... he can't...\"<br>\r\nSomething about these words seemed very eerie, but Summer's curiosity urged her to keep following the sound. She walked into the room and when she passed by the bed, the voice said, \"Shh... he's here... be very quiet... maybe he'll won't look under here...\" <br>\r\n<i>\"Look under here?\"</i> Summer thought, glancing at the bed. Then, she slowly bent down and peaked underneath. Curled up in a fetal position and clutching a teddy bear was a glowing white, semi-transparent girl staring right at Summer. The fear in the ghost girl's eyes was quickly replaced with confusion when she saw Summer. \"That's not Daddy,\" she mumbled to herself. \"Who is that?... Daddy always tells me when we have guests... but I'm hiding from him, so maybe he couldn't tell me... but before Daddy woke up, only naughty people came here... Daddy will be mad if I let thieves go... but he'll also be mad if I punish his guests... I'd better find out who she is...\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ghost transformed, rising up through the bed and turning into beautiful lady. \"Who are you?\" she asked, her voice becoming commanding and stern. \"My father didn't tell me we would be having guests. If you aren't my father's friends he will be most displeased.\"<br>\r\nThis situation had become very delicate. This ghost seemed to have multiple personalities, so telling it that they weren't guests could be dangerous. On the other hand, the ghost seemed to be extremely afraid of its father, and Summer had good reason to believe this was Ms. Hildegard Featherton and her father was the vampire Count Featherton. Maybe the ghost would help them if they told it the truth-- that she and her friends were detectives and they wanted to stop Count Featherton. But she didn't have much time to think, so on a split-second decision, Summer decided...</span></div></div>",

You saw how she could change - she must be an amalgam of two, no more different ghosts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr!

But her annoyance quickly turned to fear as she felt several cold, boney fingers removing her shirt. There was something about those fingers, even before they'd started tickling her, that felt powerful as though they could reach into her soul if they wanted to. <br>\r\nFor a moment, this gave Summer a bizarre curiosity to know if souls were ticklish.<br>\r\nBut Summer was quickly reminded of the fact that she had other things to worry about when she felt a long fingernail sliding over her belly. Summer shrieked and squirmed as the cold nail drew circles around her belly button, slowly spiraling nearer to it. \"W-wait, wait!\" she yelled, and to her surprise the tickling stopped. \"Oh, thank you,\" she said, believing Count Featherton was having mercy on her, but then she felt another sensation; a feather twirling around in her navel. Summer screamed for a moment and then started laughing as wiggled from side to side trying to get the fluffy menace out of her second-most-ticklish spot.<br>\r\n\"Now apologize for your lack of respect and tell me where the pendant is,\" Count Featherton demanded, a slight growl seeping into his otherwise eerily melodious voice.<br>\r\n\"W-wehehedohohohn'tknohohohohwhahahaha!\" Summer insisted, though she was beginning to think she should just try to bluff her way out of this.<br>\r\nSummer heard the vampire groan before replying, \"Have it your way; I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to this, but I need my pendant.\" The vampire placed five fingers over Summer's heart, and for a split second, she felt like her skin was burning. The sensation passed before she could scream in pain, though, and suddenly, Summer felt like she was falling into a void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer didn't know how long she felt like she was falling-- maybe a few seconds, maybe a year --but when she opened her eyes, she knew she was not in Virginia anymore. There was no ground beneath her feet, and no sky above her head. All around her was nothing but chaos and memories. <br>\r\nThen it came, slowly at first but getting faster: the sensation that she was being tickled. It started in her underarms and rippled down her sides causing her to yank her arms down and giggle like a little girl. It seeped over her breasts and belly and dipped into her belly button making her blush and swat at the invisible hands and feathers tormenting her. And then it spread down her legs... and onto her feet.<br>\r\nSummer laughed helplessly, clutching her body and futilely trying to scratch away the sensations or spin away from her attackers. But nothing worked, and the tickling got worse and worse. Summer then discovered that she couldn't drift into silent laughter, and that proved maddening in and of itself, because that meant she had to listen to herself laugh at this horrible torture. Summer spun, ran and flipped in this crazy place-- anything to try and escape --but the tickling just got worse, and worse, and worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse couldn't hear her sister anymore, and it scared her. \"S-Summer? A-are you still there.\"<br>\r\n\"Now there's a simple question with a very complex answer,\" came the voice of Count Featherton. \"I suppose you could say she's currently lost in thought.<br>\r\nBefore she could ask what he meant, Mouse felt the blindfold being removed from her face. Once it was off, her eyes widened as she got her first good look at the wicked vampire. He was a tall, wrinkly creature with pale skin and bright red eyes. He was wearing a very beautiful grey suit and white tie that both contrasted with and enhanced his hideous features.<br>\r\nBut a moment later, Mouse noticed her sister, who was slumped over in her chair, the color drained from her face. \"Summer! NO!\" Mouse screamed on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" the vampire said in a tired voice, \"she's not dead; I'd never do anything to actually harm you two.\"<br>\r\n\"Then what did you do to her?!\" Mouse yelled back, still afraid for her sister's wellbeing.<br>\r\nCount Featherton smiled wickedly and said, \"Weeelll... I guess you could say I trapped her within her worst nightmare.\" Then, reaching a pale hand toward Mouse, he added, \"And I'll do the same thing to do unless you tell me where you hid my pendant.\"</span></div></div>",

All she could do was brace for impact and try to bear with it.<br>\r\nThen the toothbrush grazed her extra sensitive foot, and Summer laughed like crazy. She twisted and turned and bounced, but she couldn't escape the high speed bristles moving over her soles and in between her toes. The only bright side was that Summer realized she was laughing so hard she couldn't have pleaded with the vampire no matter how much she was tempted to. In some ways, though, that just made the torture even worse. Because she couldn't beg, all she could do was struggle, and as she slowly lost her strength, she couldn't even do that anymore. Once that happened, the world seemed to disappear; the only things that felt real were the terrible tickling on her feet and the sound of her own laughter.<br>\r\nFrom that moment on, Summer lost all track of time. Every second felt like a lifetime and every minute like an eternity. But finally, when the hour ended, Count Featherton put down the toothbrush. \"I'll ask you one more time. Where is the pendant?\"<br>\r\nAs Summer's wits returned, she remembered the promise the vampire had made, and insisted again, \"We told you we don't have it.\" It didn't occur to Summer until after she said this that her hour might not be over yet, and Count Featherton might just be taking a break to see if she'd beg him.<br>\r\nBut the count didn't resume tickling her.

That was all your fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Mouse, if they see me, they are going to know we have found them out, plus, I haven't got my running shoes on, and...Oh damn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently one of the clown girls had heard the sisters arguing, because she was approaching the door curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.

You might as well give up now!\"<br>\r\nShe looked at their frozen faces and open mouths. The object they've been passing around dropped on the floor and rolled to her feet. It was some sort of buzzing rubber toy, not the pendant at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumme's mind raced. Has she made an error? If they didn't take the pendant then who -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer got betrayed by her sleuth instincts, because she let her mind wander off for a second and that was all the clown girls needed. They all jumped on top of Summer in a great dog pile, which then untangled itself into four clowns holding the arms and legs of a screaming girl.<br>\r\nThey wasted no time carrying her off into the back of the room and threw her into a large cushioned armchair with leather straps on the armrests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth clown girl was teasing Summer's neck while the others secured her arms and tied a rope around her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mou-se!\" Ahahaha!

It's too late, Summer insisted to herself, Mouse already got a headstart, she'd only have to stand whatever they could dish out for a short while until help arrived...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hopes were crushed in a moment. Mouse backed into the room, followed by a familiar figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going somewhere?\" asked the Clown Prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached for Mouse, who ducked. She dropped onto the floor and rolled between his legs, then stumbled onto her feet on the other side. <br>\r\n\"Go Mouse!\" Summer yelled. <br>\r\nThe Prince turned around.

After five minutes of gentle teasing, Summer seemed to have recomposed herself. It was time to surprise her again.

She ripped two holes in Summer's stockings letting her wiggly fingers come out and feel some fresh air. <br>\r\nGleeing inside at her pouty face, she pulled out two long peacock feathers and tried drawing them back and forth in between each and every pair of toes, one after the other.<br>\r\nSummer burst out laughing again, her toes wiggling and stretching uncontrollably, not even able resisting giving this perv what he wanted anymore. Five minutes have passed.<br>\r\nIt was over.

There are others like us, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you telling me I got tickled by my own school friends?!??\"<br>\r\nThe clown girls fidgeted and were at least decent enough to look embarassed.<br>\r\n\"But...that's impossible.\" Summer said. \"The clown prince's helpers have always been hired lackeys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, yes, but your friend has given him some sort of mind control device that she created...Only, it still doesn't work perfectly, so they still need to do things to \"convince\" us first, which is where the whole, uh, tickling bit comes in...Or maybe they just like to humiliate their victims, I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend...Wait, you can't mean...PAO-TING???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"This is her mansion. I heard she and the Prince strike up some sort of deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, if you are mind-controlled, how come you're not attacking me anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...That vampire used some sort of hypnosis on us back there. Maybe his vampire power can counter the device's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded logical to Summer.<br>\r\n\"OK. What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\" the former clowns glanced at each other. \"Well, we thought you always come up with such clever plans, Summer, we thought we would ask you to come up with one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer covered her eyes. \"Alright. Who is everyone here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have Jane, Stacy, Lacy, the twins, my sister Wendy...and a couple of others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What??\"<br>\r\nSummer winced. She felt really guilty about saying that, and she knew that Mouse had every right to mad at her. Even so, Summer couldn't stand being tickled anymore. Besides, Mouse wasn't as ticklish as her older sibling, so it wouldn't be as bad for her as it would be for Summer, right?<br>\r\nThe vampire, true to his word, turned his attention to Mouse, but before he started tickling her, he stopped and slowly turned back to Summer. \"I have a better idea. If <i>you</i> tickle your sister for a while, I might believe you're telling the truth.\"<br>\r\nSummer's mouth dropped. \"W-what? N-no! I can't do that!\"<br>\r\n\"Why not? You're already willing to let her take your punishment,\" Count Featherton countered. \"If you really don't have the pendant, prove your sincerity by following my commands.\"<br>\r\n<i>Willing to let her take my punishment?</i> Those words stung, but now was not a time for feeling guilty, now was a time for tact. Carefully weighing her options, Summer realized that if she pretended to obey the count's order, the vampire would have to untie her. On the other hand, when she and Mouse first released Count Featherton from his prison, he'd knocked them out just by looking at them, so Summer didn't think she'd be able to escape and get help even if she wasn't tied up. Summer also resolved that she couldn't take anymore tickling herself. That left two options: either Summer had to tickle Mouse or Count Featherton would. And of course, the count wouldn't go easy on her.<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Summer finally said, realizing that if she tickled Mouse, it wouldn't be as bad for her as it would be if Count Featherton were doing it.<br>\r\nOf course, Mouse wasn't thinking of that, and as the vampire released Summer from her bonds and she walked over to Mouse, she couldn't make eye contact with her younger sibling. She knew Mouse must be feeling betrayed, but Summer hoped that Mouse would eventually understand her motives for doing this.<br>\r\nIn the next instant, Summer was next to Mouse's feet. Summer had tickled Mouse before, of course, in silly sibling tickle fights and such, but this time, Summer really didn't know what she should be doing. The situation was so awkward and upsetting that she didn't know where to start. However, she had to do something before Count Featherton changed his mind, so she reluctantly started stroking her fingers over her sister's soles. Mouse giggled a bit, but it sounded to Summer that she was crying more than she was laughing.<br>\r\nThat's when it finally hit her; this was another method of Count Featherton's torture-- a psychological test of her and Mouse's strength of will. Perhaps... perhaps if Summer could keep this up long enough even though it was obvious that neither she nor Mouse wanted to do this, maybe then Count Featherton would believe they were telling the truth.<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Summer increased her tickling speed, causing Mouse to shriek and laugh and start squirming. Summer had to make sure she didn't go too easy on her sister, otherwise Count Featherton might decide that this wasn't interesting enough for him and torture Mouse himself. So Summer put some effort into her tickling, switching styles and even tickling Mouse's toes a bit.<br>\r\nThat was when Mouse started begging.<br>\r\n\"Summerherherherpleahehehehehesestohohohohophahahahahanohohohomohohohoho horehehehehehe!\" So it began, and Mouse continued to plead with her reluctant tormentor for several minutes. And the longer Mouse begged, the guiltier Summer felt.<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Summer said, stepping away from Mouse with tears in her eyes. \"I don't care if you torture me for hours, but I will not lay another finger on my own sister. Whether you believe us or not, you're just wasting your time; we don't know anything. Period.\"<br>\r\nThe vampire stroked his chin for a moment after examining all this and then said...</span></div></div>",

This is a good sign that he's just a lying thief. Either that, or he's not right in the head.\"<br>\r\n\"(Ow, Ow) So what do we do about it? (Ow, Ow)\" Chris asked, still trying to pull his ear out of Jamie's grasp.<br>\r\nSummer stopped and thought for a moment before saying, \"We need to get some proof before we go tell the cops what's going on. Plus we still don't know where those other kids who were kidnapped are, so we need to find them too. Let's go back to the mansion and start looking around.\"<br>\r\nThe four of them leave the room with Chris saying, \"(Ow) Can you let go (Ow) of me now? (Ow)\"</span></div></div>",

Much to her relief she found a small, mechanical device of some sort embedded in the same location the red light had come from. \"See?\" she said, showing the device to Mouse. \"There must be another sensor in the door. If anyone escapes from the rope, they get trapped by a freaky light show, but it's not real magic. That guy's just a fraud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't help Mouse calm down.

A beautiful, ridiculously gorgeous woman.<br>\r\nSummer looked at her intently. The woman's face and features were simply stunning. She seemed young, not a day over 23 years old. She had long hair that cascaded down her shoulders in graceful locks. Here eyes were big, round, and full of innocence. The was a pink hue on her youthful cheeks that matched her luscious lips perfectly. Her skin seemed pale and fair, without a single blemish of any kind.<br>\r\nSummer felt confused as she blushed. She never witnessed such a beauty before, was it normal to react like this in its presence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't all that called Summer's attention, though.<br>\r\nThe woman's clothing seemed\u2026 oddly anachronistic.<br>\r\n\u201cShe looks like an aristocrat from mid 19th century\u2026 could she be\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer's inner ponderings got interrupted by the mysterious woman, answering back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello there.

Her voice was warm, friendly, and inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven while being stunned by the woman's beauty, and still confused about her current possible location, Summer's logical wheels and cogs were turning inside her mind. Was this really the ghost of Mrs. Featherton? Could that even be possible?

The possibility of being in front of an actual ghost\u2026 it challenged all that she knew, her whole world vision. Not to mention, it sent chills down her spine.<br>\r\nBut on the other hand\u2026 she was so gorgeous!

They were simply\u2026 mesmerizing! Like two deep wells of calm and well-being. There was something so alluring about them\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she looked at them, the more she heard Mrs. Featherton's voice, the more she wanted to walk up to her and never leave, and to do everything she wanted. There was something that creating inside Summer a powerful need to keep that mysterious woman content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the deductive region or her mind kicked off the alarm. That can't be right, it must be a trap of some kind! Turn around and run now, Summer, before you're not able to do it anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer's feet stopped on its tracks. This huge feeling of doubt and hesitation took over her. Do I keep going forward, closer to the embrace of this woman that I crave? Or do I listen to my detective gut, and turn around and leave while I still can? If I can....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Mrs.Featherton spoke, with a mixture of shyness and sadness. \u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019d like to be with someone.

But that part of her mind was getting quieter and quieter by the second. <br>\r\nStill, with a new found of joy inside her chest, the girl sleuth walked forward towards the ghost of Mrs. Hildegard Featherton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s splendid!\u201d She replied, also with a big, genuine smile on her fair complexion. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t mind spare a few moments to keep me company\u2026 It\u2019s not easy for me, you know\u2026 Not many people take my, let\u2019s say \u201ccondition\u201d lightly.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind, really.\u201d Summer said.

I\u2019m happy to see that my preceding reputation hasn\u2019t scared you off, either\u2026\u201d Mrs. Featherton chuckled friendly at her own comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReputation? What reputation?\u201d Summer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, you know\u2026 that I like to tickle people.\u201d Mrs. Featherton placed her hand at the side of her mouth, like if she was telling the girl a secret. \u201cSome people can feel a little bit scared about that too.\u201d She even shrugged while talking with such a sincere tone. <br>\r\n\u2018What other proof can one ask about this being\u2019s good nature?\u2019 The girl detective thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat? Oh, I don\u2019t mind it\u2026 I\u2019ve already gotten tickled quite a few times since I stepped into this house so far.\u201d Summer said and wiggled her toes, looking down as she did so. Mrs. Featherton giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? And how did that happen?\u201d The ghost lady asked, seemingly amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2026 I don\u2019t know, exactly\u2026 There does seem to be a lot of people in this manor that\u2019s really interested in tickling everybody else. I don\u2019t know why, but it does seem to be a mystery, and I really like to solve mysteries. I guess that helped a little bit to get me tickled so often.\u201d Summer said and giggled at her own conclusion. Lady Featherton giggled along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does sound like it.\u201d Mrs. Featherton said in her warm and motherly voice. Her eyes went from Summer\u2019s bright and youthful smile, to her dainty and small bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do look like you\u2019d be a delight to tickle, Summer.\u201d The ghost said. Summer blushed and smiled at the compliment. \u201cDid you enjoy getting tickled?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Featherton\u2019s words made the girl blush so much that she even let out an spontaneous girlish giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Summer said smiling like a dork, looking down to her own curling toes, as this strangely pleasurable wave of embarrassment washed over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to admit it. I used to like it a lot when I was alive. It\u2019s just a good, harmless, innocent, fun game. The funnest of all, in my opinion.\u201d Lady Featherton said with a sincere and yet teasy tone.<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact, I also used to enjoy dishing out quite a bit. Even more to girls who liked to be tickled\u2026 that way we both really enjoyed it more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer felt herself being practically pierced by Mrs. Featherton\u2019s blue eyes, looking right into her own, while sporting that provocative smirk. She had to hold in a gasp.<br>\r\nHer knees twitched a little bit. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2026 why do I feel this need to be tickled?\u201d She began to wonder. The feeling worried her a little bit, but\u2026 the need to be tickled was beginning to grow, overshadowing the feeling of concern, slowly but surely.<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be right\u2026 I must be influenced by some kind of\u2026 spell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething tells me that you want to play with me and have some fun with some tickles, but you\u2019re just a little bit shy to admit it, aren\u2019t you, Summer?\u201d Lady Featherton\u2019s words interrupted Summer\u2019s train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You can tell me if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d The friendly and inviting smile returned to the ghost of Mrs. Featherton\u2019s face returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer hesitated. Inside her, her will was being disputed in a tug-o-war between her keen detective sense that was almost yelling her to get out of there, and this powerful and new found desire to do as Lady Featherton said and stay with her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It almost felt like if she was seeing someone else taking control of her and making her say things she\u2019d never speak out loud. <br>\r\nStill, that concern seemed so minor right now.

Lady Featherton was offering ways to get tickled into submission\u2026 and she felt herself smiling. <br>\r\nThe doubts and concerns from earlier had been washed away by thoughts of her, in the arms of Mrs. Featherton, happily laughing her head off while being relentlessly and playfully tickled all over her body. The very idea of it filled her with happiness. There was no place in those merry thoughts for the possibility of finding the kidnapped people in the manor, or her friends, or even Mouse. All of that could wait. First she was going to have fun. She needed to have fun, she felt\u2026 and that meant to giving herself to Lady Featherton as a willing ticklee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 what is it going to be, my cute little Summer?\u201d The ghost woman asked her, smirking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was feeling a sense of youthful excitement that she hadn\u2019t felt in ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suspected that was the option that a polite and well educated girl like you, would choose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, unlike before, it was Lady Featherton who approached Summer.

It was like if she was actually floating softly above the stone floor, merely gliding up to where the girl detective stood.<br>\r\nShe stood in front of the girl, with her hand on her own hips, and raised an eyebrow as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m all ears, Summer. Tell me, where are you most ticklish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2026\u201d Summer looked down. Her toes curled, like if they knew she was going to talk about them. \u201c... it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s my feet. They\u2019re just\u2026 so ticklish, it\u2019s crazy. Toes, arches, sole, it\u2019s all so incredibly sensitive. Whenever anyone gets their hands on my feet, I know I\u2019m done for. It\u2019s really easy to make me laugh out loud but just touching my feet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nSummer looked up. She saw Lady Featherton looking at her with a bemused expression on her face. She then looked down again. She found really hard to say those things out loud with Lady Featherton\u2019s big round blue eyes looking right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd also\u2026 my neck, could be my second worst spot. But not many people know that. Most people focus on the armpits or ribs and sides to tickle, and don\u2019t focus on the neck. I mean, my armpits are madly ticklish, and also my ribs and sides, but\u2026 the neck is special. It almost makes me surrender in just a few seconds when I get tickled there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer looked up again. Lady Featherton now had a mischievous smile on her face, and she was beginning to tap her fingers on her own waist, a clear sign of an anxious tickler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was really ilustrative, Summer. Thank you for being so detailed. Now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost woman descended a little bit, until her eyes were at Summer\u2019s level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere would you want me to tickle you? Would you like me to tickle your neck, and make you flinch while you laugh? Would you rather have me tickle your sides and armpits, and make you fall to the floor, curled like a little ball? Or you\u2019d rather have me play with your feet, while you lie on your back and just laugh away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer shivered at the thought and let out a clumsy nervous laugh that Lady Featherton found adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be shy, my polite little girl.

She was worrying the blushing on her face would be accumulative, she felt she was blushing so much she would turn into a supernova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, I think I know that hesitation. You know where I\u2019ve seen it? In people that feel to shy to ask me to tickle their worst spot possible.\u201d Lady Featherton said with a warm but teasy voice. \u201cHow did she managed to sound like that?\u201d Summer asked herself internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 well\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d Was all the girl detective managed to say. She looked up to Lady Featherton\u2019s eyes, and couldn\u2019t help but to crack a big goofy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to tickle your feet, don\u2019t you, Summer?\u201d Mrs. Featherton said, smirking. Her gesture was irresistible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s not so terrible, is it? In fact\u2026 I think you should say it. Out loud.\u201d Mrs. Featherton raised an eyebrow. Summer blushed even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should ask you\u2026 for that?\u201d The teen sleuth stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I think you should ask me out loud to tickle your feet. It will help you overcome your shyness. I mean, you\u2019ll still overcome it, when I make you roll around on the floor, helpless with laughter while I play non-stop with the soles of your feet and your toes, tickling you like you\u2019ve never felt before.... But saying it out loud would be a good starting point for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer felt speechless for one second. She pictured herself, the serious and determined girl detective, the sharp oldest daughter of the intelectual Salt family, simply laughing away like a silly little girl. All thanks to such a child-like weakness, to such a silly game! How could she be ever respected as a real detective if anyone was able to see her like that?<br>\r\nNone of those things mattered right now for her, she realized. She wanted to simply let all of her worries and concerns melt away in a cascade of wanton, gleeful, uncontrolled laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you want me to say\u2026 it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Summer. I would very much like to hear you say it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer took air and paused. She was feeling flustered and bursting with some many conflicting sensations\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I would like you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer paused again. She looked down, smiling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, look at you, so adorably nervous. I think you can say it, Summer. After all, it\u2019s what you want. Come on\u2026\u201d Lady Featherton took her index finger and used it to gently lift Summer\u2019s chin up. Their eyes met.<br>\r\n\u201cSay it, Summer. \u2018Tickle my feet\u2019. It\u2019s quite easy to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer felt her cheeks on fire once again. A bit of her shyness melted away, as she found in Lady Featherton\u2019s eyes the courage to ask for what she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 could you\u2026 tickle\u2026 my feet\u2026 Mrs. Featherton?\u201d Summer struggled her way to end of the sentence. By the time she finished it, she felt her face catching on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmmm\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel so convinced now.\u201d The ghost lady said, looking up, pondering what to do. \u201cSomehow I\u2019m not so sure you really want me to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Yes, I want that, Mrs. Featherton.\u201d Summer said hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want what, my dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTickle me! Tickle my feet!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Now, since we\u2019ve established that you are a polite and well manered girl, what would be the full sentence, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Mrs. Featherton, please tickle my feet! I want you to tickle the soles of my feet and make me laugh, please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, who could say no to such a request?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a dozen of ghostly hands roze form nowhere and lifted Summer off the ground. With a firm grip, they held her in place, while Mrs. Featherton worked her nimble ghostly fingers on the girl\u2019s tiny bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAHahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!! Yes! hAHahahahhahahaahahhaa tickle my feet whahahahahahahahahahahaa make me laugh hahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer\u2019s youthful laughter filled the whole cavernous, empty chamber in the blink of an eye. <br>\r\nLady Featherton closed her eyes and sighed with satisfaction.<br>\r\n\u201cYou have such a musical laughter, Summer! It\u2019s a delight to hear! I see no reason to stop making you laugh, to be honest\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Summer would never admit this to anyone but she secretly liked being tickled. Of course if any of her enemies, especially Pao-Ting found out, she'd never live it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ghost let her feet go and attacked her ribs and belly.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost woman looked on with a warm smile. \"Such an adorable kid. She almost reminds me of me when i was her age\" Ms Featherton thought. The young detective was having the time of her life. A part of her knew something was wrong and she needed to find the others, the ghost's influence seemed to be stronger. Summer's laughter never stopped, echoing throughout the cave. She actually felt like a kid laughing her heart out this much. It was intense, it was nuts,, it tickled like mad. She didn't want it to end. A whole part of her just wanted to let loose and laugh. Surprising the ghost, summer put her arms up.

She was on good terms with the ghost of this manor and in return she gave the detective the best laugh of her life. She felt lighter then air.

Her friendly smile was now an evil grin and she was no longer listening to summer. Summer knew she should've ran away but now she couldn't stop laughing long enough to beg for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, little one.\" She began in a nearly demonic voice. \"I've been so lonely for so long and to finally be a cute ticklish little girl like you can finally satisfy that. Don't worry, we'll have a lot of laughs together.\" She finished. Summer couldn't even say anything to save her life, all she could do was laugh. More hands appeared out of thin air and attacked her belly and neck. The young detective was crying in silent laughter ad she could no longer find the strength to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tortures, it was insane, it tickled more than anything. And yet, due to the ghost influence, she wanted more. \"Welcome to your new home, Summer\" Ms feathorton giggling evilly.

Nothing happened. The sister exchanged confused looks as they realized that the key could just be a part of a broken mechanism, or perhaps activate something on other room or floor. After all, the only different thing they could perceive was an almost imperceptible hissing sound, reverberating in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse looked at her big sister, and just shrugged.<br>\r\nSummer shrugged back.<br>\r\nAnd Mouse let out a little snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Summer said, with a little smirk. \"Do I even look THAT funny to you? I can't even shrug without having you laughing at my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I... I don't know... teeheeheeheehee!\" Mouse covered her mouth as a few silly giggles came out clumsily out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse looked back at her big sis. She made eye contact with her, and everything in her  body language suggested that she was about to say \"I'm sorry\" to her, but instead... another silly girlish giggle sputtered its way of Mouse's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouse, what the hell? Come on, everything tries to makes us laugh our brains out in this house. The last thing we need is you getting a bad case of the giggles when we need to find a way out. Well, let's think if the key didn't do anything, we could probably try with that lever on that wall... what do you think, sis?\" Summer turned to Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little sister took a short deep breath, cleared her lungs, and replied:<br>\r\n\"Well, perhaps we could-- pffffffahahahahahaha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer seemed perplex. What was Mouse laughing about? Even the idea of that was so silly that it made a slight smile appear on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Mouse. What could be so funny right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... perhaps- ahahahahahahaha! Oh I'm sorry, but ahahahahahahahahahaha\" Mouse begin to giggle a bit louder now, and each giggle was a bit longer than the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouse! Keep it together! Teeheeheehee! Come on, you are going to make ME laugh! Hahahaha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer realized something was wrong. Her little sis was giggling non-stop now, and for no apparent reason. But... she couldn't help but find that just a wee bit funny! Funny enough at least to let out a few snickers at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mouse, what's so funny? Hahahahaha!\" Was that a laugh? Summer didn't know why, but a laugh that was as short as it was clearly a laugh, managed to escape her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahaha I don't know! Hahahahahahahahahahaha but you just seem so funny! Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\" Mouse begin to full-on laugh. She begun to point at Summer as if she was the funniest sight ever saw.<br>\r\nSummer thought that was a clear reason for concern, but instead... she laughed! <br>\r\nHer little sister Mouse, cracking up at nothing! It seemed <i>hilarious</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouse! Put it togehehehehehehehehether! We need to-- pfffffffffhaaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahaha! Mouse, stahahahap it! You're mahahahahaking me laugh now hahahahahahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahaha don't blame me for that! Teeheeheeheeheehee! You're the one hahahahahaha who's making me crack up bwaaaaaahahahahahahahahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse's laughter was out of control now. Her knees begun to shake as her whole stand seemed to get a bit wobbly. She was facepalming her own forehead, like she wasn't able to believed how ridiculously funny everything around her was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was contemplating the sight of her younger sister in stitches, Summer fell to her own knees, laughing at bit harder with each passing second. She tried to walk with her knees up to where Mouse was.<br>\r\nAnd, as she did just that, she could see a clear pink mist, entering the room from all of the baseboards in the room. As they were giggling merrily like the schoolgirls they were, the cloud had them between its reach already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahaha! We're being bwahahahahahahahaha flooded with laughing gas! BwwwwwwahahahahahHAhAhAHHAhAHAHHAaHAhAHHAHAHaAhA!\"<br>\r\nSummer begin to laugh, completely helpless, completely out of control. A far, small part of her consciousness, realized that this, being this defenseless in this house, should be a great motive of concern. But... it was just so insanely funny! She tried to reach Mouse, but... she was laughing her head off as well! And to think her name was <i>Mouse</i>?! Could she be any more silly than that? The sole thought of her name along was enough to send it in unending laughing fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PFfffffaaaaHAhAHHAhAhHAhahHAhAHAHaHAHAHA laughing gas ahahahahahahahahahaha!! That's so funny!! FfffffbwwwwwaaaaahHAhahAHhHAHaHHaHAHahHAhAHahaHAHa!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sisters reached each other. Both of them were laughing hysterically. Still completely clothed except for their bare feet, they hug each other. They collapsed onto the floor. The laughter took the form guffaws, deep hard belly laughs, cackling and howling, ridiculous giggles, and other variations. Their cheeks felt warm, even more as tears of laughter begun to fall in a steady pace over them.<br>\r\nThere was nothing more to them other than an endless hilarity that filled their whole minds. If they could think clearly at that point, they could realize that the little face laughing hysterically on the key that sprung the trap, was more a warning sign than what it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey couldn't tell how much time passed by while they're laughed without another concern on their minds. Both of them entangled in a hysterical hug, the only other thing they were able to perceive was the soft skin of their bare feet and soles some time grazing against each other.<br>\r\nThat was until a shadow projected itself over them, and they realized they weren't alone in the room anymore.<br>\r\nStill, all they could do was just point at their new company... and laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did that shadow belonged to?</span></div></div>",

Although, not that much, considering your intellect is vastly overrated. It isn\u2019t that big of a shock to see you springing a trap, Summer. And judging by the fact that both you and your minion/sister are barefoot, I\u2019d say this isn\u2019t the first one that you encounter.\u201d<br>\r\nPao-Ting said as she towered over both sisters. She was wearing a bandana tied tightly around her face, covering her nose and mouth and protecting it from the lingering wisps of laughing gas that remained on the air of the room. <br>\r\nIt had been quite a few minutes since the Salt sister had indeed activated the trap. There was no more laughing gas pumping into the room, but both girls had inhaled enough of it to be helpless with laughter for quite some more minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer saw and recognized her biggest rival, but all she could do was continue to cackle helplessly and point at her, as if the asian girl was the funniest thing she had ever seen. Mouse couldn\u2019t do even that, she was too busy pounding on the floor with her fists, slightly more overtaken by the gas than her big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot in condition of bantering with me, I see. Too bad, I must confess I slightly enjoy some witty comeback from time to time with my lesser rival. Still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nPao-Ting crouched, looking at Summer directly at her face. A huge mischievous smile manifested on her lips, covered by the bandana.<br>\r\n\u201c... I\u2019d say this opportunity is too good to waste, wouldn\u2019t you agree with me, Summer? What would you do with me if you\u2019d find me in such a predicament?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny, far region of Summer\u2019s mind recognized the danger she was in, and how truly she and Mouse were in the clutches of her rival.

Their hysterical laughter had turned into quieter giggles and occasional guffaws, but they were still laughing non-stop.<br>\r\nStill, Pao-Ting thought that she could really have used whatever information the sisters had to share. They were already gassed and in this giddy and helpless state when Pao-Ting got into the room, and they were all by themselves. The asian genius girl quite easily arrived to the pretty much only logical conclusion for that: the whole room was a trap, and if she wasn\u2019t careful, she would activate it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the idea of being rendered helpless with laughing gas like Summer and Mouse were sent chills down her spine, she pondered her options. <br>\r\nShe saw the peculiar key with the smiley face that Summer had used before, still in the keyhole. <br>\r\n\u201cTurning this key is probably what activated the gas\u201d, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other windows on the room, Pao-Ting\u2019s only other option was to try the door that Summer and Mouse had used to enter the room\u2026 but they were closed too. And no matter what she tried, the smiley key simply didn\u2019t fit in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one way out, it seems\u201d. Pao-Ting thought, cursing her own luck.

Yeah, I'm fine, it's just\u2026 I landed flat on my bare feet... ouchie\u2026\" Mouse whispered. She sat on the ground rubbing gently the soles of her feet, their skin slightly pink due to the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Summer had to ask how everyone wasn't only due to the fall. <br>\r\nThere was no way to see where the walls or ceiling were. The floor beneath her bare feet felt cold as it was clearly made out of big slabs of flat stone, just barely irregular. They were cool as the air around her was too.<br>\r\nThe place they were now was very dimly lit, and their eyes were still trying to adjust to the surrounding darkness. Coming from the ceiling above, wherever that was, there was a faint, pale blue light that poured down into a few feet of the giant empty room (if a room is what that place was).<br>\r\nBeing the only source of light, the girls found quite difficult to get a clear view of their immediate surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine too, thanks for asking.\" The groaning voice of Pao-Ting replied, as she got up after landing on her rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know.\" Summer replied honestly. \"Well\u2026 since there doesn't seem to be any impending traps to fall into, I'd say we could focus our efforts in trying to figure out where we are, wouldn't you say?\" Summer said as she looked around, trying to find anything that could help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's if Mrs. Girl Genius here doesn't activate another trap for us\u2026\" said Mouse looking directly at Pao-Ting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, excuse me, little one. I seem to remember you were quite able to activate one of those on your own. Or did you turn on the laughing gas just to kick back and have a few giggles?\" Pao-Ting said in a condescending manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something that you were going to take advantage of!\" Mouse replied, her tone clearly showing more anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, girls!\" Summer interrupted. \"We all know we are not the best of friends here. But still, we are trapped even deeper into this insane mansion, and I think we all need to put those things aside and work together to get out here. Deal?\" She said, looking a Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... deal.\" The youngest of the three said almost pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Pao-Ting nodded. She quickly began to look around, analyzing the place as much as was possible with so little light.<br>\r\n\"So... What do you think this place is?\" She asked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could quite easily ask that about the whole manor. As for this room we're standing in\u2026 it'd seem to be\u2026 and underground of sorts. Doesn't seem to have an obvious purpose\u2026 although there's a source of light over there\" Summer said, pointing in the right direction. \"Could be a good starting point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls exchanged looks with each other, trying to figure out what their next move should be.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A beautiful, ridiculously gorgeous woman.<br>\r\nSummer looked at her intently. The woman's face and features were simply stunning. She seemed young, around 33 years old. She had long hair that cascaded down her shoulders in graceful locks. Here eyes were big, round, and full of innocence. There was a pink hue on her youthful cheeks that matched her luscious lips perfectly. Her skin seemed pale and fair, without a single blemish of any kind.<br>\r\nSummer felt confused as she blushed. She never witnessed such a beauty before, was it normal to react like this in its presence? A quick look at her sides assured her that notion, as both Mouse and Pao-Ting seemed to be experiencing some blushing and a quicker breathing of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't all that called Summer's attention, though.<br>\r\nThe woman's clothing seemed\u2026 oddly anachronistic.<br>\r\n\u201cShe looks like an aristocrat from mid 19th century\u2026 could she be\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer's inner ponderings got interrupted by the mysterious woman, answering back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello there. It's nice to see new people down here. Come on closer, girls, don't be afraid.\u201d She said. Her voice was warm, friendly, and inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven while being stunned by the woman's beauty, and still confused about her current possible location, Summer's logical wheels and cogs were turning inside her mind. Could this really be the ghost of Mrs. Featherton? Could that even be possible? Her deductive mind needed to explore further that mystery, it needed to know. <br>\r\nSummer walked closer until she was a mere three feet away from the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her mind, Pao-Ting was wrestling with the exact same questions that Summer was. But seeing her rival stepping closer to the mysterious figure was enough to push the Asian girl forward as well, not wanting to be a few steps behind of what could be entangling a mystery and proving her superior intellect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse, on the other hand, was feeling slightly more intimidated by the situation. She wrestled with two opposing feelings inside her. A part of her was suspicious of this whole affair\u2026 why would be a woman simply waiting for people down here, while dressed up like that? But another part of her wanted to push those worries away and come closer to this woman and to the inviting, warm, and slightly melancholic aura that surrounded her. <br>\r\nHer bare feet shuffled and her toes wiggled against each other and against the cool stone floor while she tried to make up her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Summer and Pao-Ting were close to the figure, they could see she was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon closer inspection, Summer noticed something else about this woman: her body, her whole image\u2026 it bordered on being translucent. She could almost see through it, even under this dim bluish light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany feelings began to clash and conflict inside the girl detective\u2019s mind. The possibility of being in front of an actual ghost\u2026 it challenged all that she knew, her whole world vision. Not to mention, it sent chills down her spine.<br>\r\nBut on the other hand\u2026 The woman was so gorgeous! She had this strangely calm aura surrounding her, almost inviting her to get even closer.<br>\r\n\u201cHer eyes\u2026 so captivating\u2026\u201d thought Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting next to her was feeling a more intense version of those same emotions. The idea of finding herself against something actually and truly supernatural sent chills down her spine as well, the sudden desire of turning on her heels and running away as fast as possible was growing inside of her.<br>\r\nBut also\u2026 this woman was so alluring! She simply seemed so\u2026 warm, and kind. Pao-Ting felt a calm and comfortable feeling wash over her, making her realize that in her constant day-by-day struggle to overcome her intellectual rival, it had been quite sometime since she had experienced any form of true warmth and affection. Not to mention, the possibility of coming into contact with the supernatural and figuring out its nature before Summer could do it was quite an attractive notion as well.<br>\r\nShe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse also took a few steps forward. Seeing that her older companions weren\u2019t running away for their lives and/or sanity eased her concerns and allowed her to get closer to the figure, even if she still was slightly covering herself behind her big sister. <br>\r\nThere was something about the figure that reminded her of her own mom, even when intellectually Mouse knew that didn\u2019t make any sense. She felt this inexplicable need to run up to her, and hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for getting closer, girls, it is really kind of you.\u201d The woman said with a genuine smile of gratitude. \u201cI'd like to see more people like you more often. I feel lonely down here sometimes\u2026 what's your name, young lady?\u201d The mysterious woman asked Summer, since she was the one closest to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-S-Summer. Summer Salt.\u201d The teen sleuth found herself stuttering. \u201cAre\u2026 are you--\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 my name is Pao-Ting.\u201d The asian girl genius interrupted. She had felt a very instinctive urge to not be left behind and to be noticed by this woman as well, and she merely didn\u2019t bother to repress it. <br>\r\n\u201c... uh... my name is\u2026 Susan. But\u2026 everyone\u2026 calls me Mouse.\u201d The youngest of the three added. She felt like if she was introducing herself in the first day of kindergarten. Why was she feeling like that?, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch pretty names for such pretty girls.\u201d The woman said with a warm smile as she bowed her head slightly, as a gesture of salutation to the girls. They all smiled back.<br>\r\nBut, after a few seconds, Summer\u2019s inquisitive nature got the better of her and she resumed her previously interrupted question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026 Mrs. Hildegard Featherton?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, I am.\u201d Said the spectral woman after a heartfelt sigh. \u201cI think\u2026 my current nature, quite understandably, scares some people away from me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer began to notice how powerfully attracted she felt by Mrs. Featherton's eyes. They were simply\u2026 mesmerizing! Like two deep wells of calm and well-being. There was something so alluring about them\u2026 <br>\r\nThe more she looked at them, the more she heard Mrs. Featherton's voice, the more she wanted to walk up to her and never leave, and to do everything this woman needed to feel better. There was something that was creating inside Summer a powerful need to keep that mysterious woman content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the sadness in the woman\u2019s voice got to Mouse most of all. While listening the confirmation of being in the presence of an actual ghost send icy chills down her spine, seeing such a kind woman feeling so blue\u2026 Mouse felt it was irresistible to try to make her feel better. The two older girls listened the sound of Mouse\u2019s tiny bare feet walking towards the figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting felt her own mind was on fire with questions. How could this be a real ghost, standing there and talking to them? How could Summer Salt, her intellectual rival, not be posing the same question? Was that the proof that this woman was not a ghost? Or was this intense feeling that Pao-Ting was experiencing, this powerful tug inside of her that made her want to run and hug this sad woman until she felt better, the actual evidence that she was a ghost and that she was tainting their minds with her supernatural abilities? <br>\r\nAgainst her better reasoning, Pao-Ting began to walk towards the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer saw her stubborn rival walking towards this being who claimed to be the long gone Mrs. Hildegard Featherton. Judging by her expression, Pao-Ting seemed almost in a trance of sorts\u2026 why wasn\u2019t she questioning any of this? <br>\r\nThat's when the deductive region or Summer\u2019s mind kicked off the alarm. That can't be right, it must be a trap of some kind! Turn around and run now, Summer, before you're not able to do it anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer's feet stopped right where they were standing. This huge feeling of doubt and hesitation took over her. Do I keep going forward, closer to the embrace of this woman that I crave? Or do I listen to my detective gut, and turn around and leave while I still can? If I can\u2026<br>\r\nShe looked at her sides. Nor Mouse or Pao-Ting seemed to be experiencing the same doubt, or if they were, there surely weren\u2019t expressing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Mrs.Featherton spoke, with a mixture of shyness and sadness. \u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019d like to be with someone. Just some company, for a little while. I just feel\u2026 alone.\u201d She looked up to Summer\u2019s eyes, with big, round, sad eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer felt her eyes lock with Mrs. Featherton\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you stay with me? Just to pass a little bit of time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen detective hesitated. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were now infatuated beyond the point of no return, and were at the mercy of spectral being. They would happily fulfill her every whim, no matter how strange, in order to satisfy her. <br>\r\nLittle did the girls know that, according to the history of this house and particularly of Hildegard Featherton, said whims were probably only going to revolve around one activity that always was of the highest interest for her back when she was alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls walked up to were Mrs. Featherton was. She greeted them with a warm smile and round happy eyes that made them feel wonderful.<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, it\u2019s so kind of you girls to keep me some company! It\u2019s been so long since anyone has been this considerate with me\u2026\u201d She sighed, feeling content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls smiled happily in return. The influx of Mrs. Featherton on them was strong enough at this point that they were far past beyond the point of questioning their own actions. <br>\r\nA part of them, in the back of their minds, knew this, and even tried to warn them\u2026 but that didn\u2019t matter anymore, to any of them. Making Mrs. Featherton feel better was all that mattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease girls, sit.\u201d Lady Featherton said. The girls did as they were asked to. Summer and Pao-Ting sat on the floor with their legs crossed, while Mouse sat with her feet facing forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you feel better now.\u201d Summer said with complete honesty. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to be alone like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. We\u2019ll keep you company if you want.\u201d Pao-Ting added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so lucky to have found such sweet girls\u2026\u201d Mrs. Featherton said as she sat on the floor as well. \u201cAnd not only one, but also three of you as well! That way we can have lots of fun, and you\u2019d enjoy spending your time with me as well!\u201d She said in an almost chirpy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Said Mouse spontaneously. \u201cWhat kind of fun do you have in mind? I love to play games! I\u2019m gonna win at everything!\u201d  The older girls giggled with good nature at the youngest girl\u2019s comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 there\u2019s some sort of game I used to love to play around, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you girls will like it\u2026\u201d She said with a teasy shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Lady Featherton?\u201d Asked Pao-Ting with genuine curiosity. Her current (and magic-induced) child-like excitement had completely overrun her analytical capabilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she sighed. \u201c... I\u2019m not going to bore you with sad memories from my life before. But, there was a time, long, long ago, when I wasn\u2019t a ghost, as you surely can imagine. And back then, I had my girls to play with. My beautiful daughters that would also bring their friends and their cousins to play to our huge house upstairs.\u201d She said pointing to the ceiling. \u201cWe always had the time of our lives, and we were always running around, chasing each other, and playing and laughing. Our house was so full of life back then\u2026\u201d She looked up, with a nostalgic smile, reminiscing.<br>\r\n\u201cI think what I miss the most about those days is how eager my beautiful girls were to have fun with me... but also how eager they were to come up with game after game around a certain...activity\u2026 that they loved. But, I must confess, that it is an activity that perhaps I always loved even a little bit more than them.\u201d<br>\r\nMrs. Featherton made a dramatic pause in her tale, as she looked right at the girls and lifted an eyebrow while she smirked. Her voice took a tone of childish mysteriousness \u201c ...Can you guess what that is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were deeply enthralled in Mrs. Featherton\u2019s words, so much so that they didn\u2019t guess the most obvious answer when presented with that question. They simply barely shook their heads no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so you can\u2019t guess? Fine, let me tell you then\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 tickling!\u201d She said in a playfully and almost silly sinister whisper. She spidered her fingers quickly over Mouse\u2019s exposed soles, and both Summer and Pao-Ting could swear they felt wispy and light fingers caressing their sides from behind. All three of them shivered and giggled at the sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026\u201d Lady Featherton\u2019s voice regained a bit of her previous sadness. \u201c... it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been with my girls\u2026 and since I\u2019ve had the chance to play with them\u2026 I just\u2026 miss them so much\u2026\u201d She sighed as she looked down. <br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026 that all I really want is to spend a little bit of time in the company of someone who\u2019d play with me, and let me experience again how those good moments were like\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trance that the girls were in was complete now. There was no chance that they weren\u2019t going to feel truly and deeply moved by Mrs. Featherton\u2019s story. And of course, there was no chance for them to try anything else but to attempt to make her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we\u2019ll play with you!\u201d Mouse said without a second thought.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course, Mrs. Featherton! Anything to make you feel better.\u201d Added Pao-Ting.<br>\r\nThe woman looked up with a warm and grateful smile. Her eyes met Summer\u2019s and the teen detective simply grabbed her hand with affection as she smiled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what you are saying\u2026 is that you would like to play with me, and get tickled, and have a few laughs?\u201d The woman asked with almost genuine innocence in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you promise not tickle just me for being the smallest one, and make this two laugh their asses off as well!\u201d Mouse said in her usual perky demeanor. <br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Summer said as she chuckled.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m with Mouse in this one.\u201d Added Pao-Ting. \u201cI\u2019m in only if I also see the famous Salt sisters here end up like two laughing heaps.\u201d Her voice was laced with a bit of her usual arrogance, in a clear attempt to provoke her rival.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you two are so gonna get it\u2026\u201d Summer said while a feeling of fun and friendly competency filled her chest. \u201cOf course I\u2019m in, Mrs. Featherton.\u201d She stretched her legs and crossed one foot above the other. Her bare soles now her facing directly to Mrs. Featherton, as in a way to show the other two girls that she wasn\u2019t backing down from the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls simply flowed along with the scenario presented in front of them. Under the magic influence of the ghost of Mrs. Hildegard Featherton, the chances they had of questioning this development of events at this point was virtually non existent. All they knew now was that Lady Featherton wanted to tickle them, and that was going to make her feel better, so that\u2019s what they happily were going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Featherton, on the other hand, had almost to suppress the bursting joy she felt at the moment. <br>\r\nAs a suffering soul since her tragic passing, all that had tied her to this earthly plane of existence was this feeling of void, this intense yearning of re-encountering anyone and anything that would allow her to experience, to feel, something that was like the happiness she had felt when she and her family were alive. She didn\u2019t exactly know if alleviating that feeling would grant some rest to her immortal soul, but all she knew was that she felt that was the path she needed to go through.<br>\r\nIt had proven to be a quite difficult task over the years, even with the mansion above the underground filled with people and tickling activities.<br>\r\nBut now, here she was. All alone with three beautiful young ladies that had already fell prey to her suggestive powers. And they all could be happy playing, having fun, and laughing. <br>\r\nFinally she would be able to fulfill her heart\u2019s desire. She felt grateful. <br>\r\nAnd also, eager to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh girls, you are so kind with an lonely old lady like me\u2026\u201d Mrs. Featherton said.<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 you don\u2019t look old, really.\u201d Summer pointed out. It was true. Despite being a ghost, Lady Featherton\u2019s features still looked as those of someone in her early thirties. <br>\r\n\u201cExcept for that dress.\u201d Pao-Ting added. All four of them laughed at the joke, even Lady Featherton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you found that funny, Pao-Ting. I\u2019m sure I can find some other ways to make you laugh too\u2026\u201d Mrs. Feahterton said in a teasy and mischievous voice as she raised an eyebrow. Pao-Ting flinched playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, girls\u2026\u201d Lady Feahterton said. \u201c... in my experience tickling girls, it\u2019s always better for the tickler, which would be me in this case, to know with precision which are the ticklees\u2019 worst spots. It really helps to make this kind of games substantially more fun. Now, you can provide me that information willingly, and then the games can begin\u2026 Or\u2026 you can refuse to tell me, and of course, I\u2019ll lovingly convince you to tell me.\u201d Her voice sounded in a tone that was at the same time warm and provocative. It made the three girls snicker and giggle with childish excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 how is it going to be?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Contrary to what she\u2019d normally feel in this situation, the usual dread of knowing that she\u2019s in an inescapable situation of impending foot tickling torture had been replaced by a gleeful childish giddiness. Like the excitement she used to find in playing and running and having fun, back when she was little girl with not a single worry in the whole wide world.<br>\r\nAnd, thanks to the influence of Mrs. Featherton magic, she was well past the point of questioning the nature of that feeling. All she wanted was to make this kind and lonely woman feel better, and to have at least some fun while doing it. Even her rivalry with Summer Salt had melted away from her mind at the moment.<br>\r\nThe hands gently pulled off Pao-Ting\u2019s shoes, revealing a couple of thin white ankle socks that were quickly discarded as well. Her dainty and delicate feet were now as as bare and as exposed as those of the Salt sisters next to her. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, boy....\u201d she whispered to herself as she felt the cool air of the room caress the skin of her bare feet. Her toes wiggled slightly as a reflex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m quite confident that you will indeed talk, Pao-Ting. You all will. You all will talk and reveal to me your most ticklish spots\u2026\u201d Lady Featherton said with her usual well-educated manners.<br>\r\nBut, as she did so, more and more hands began to gather around the girls as the three of them simply kept floating in the air.<br>\r\nThe free hands began to add up to the ones already occupied in holding the girls. So much so , that before they could realize, there were enough ghostly hands around each of them that they felt as if they were sitting in floating recliners, comfortable and ample cushioned chairs that held every inch of their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what worried the girls the most were the hands that grabbed their ankles, making their soles face forward.<br>\r\nAfter that, more hands floated up to the girls\u2019 vulnerable bare feet, grabbing both big toes of each one of them, in a gentle but unavoidably firm grip. The hands calmly pulled the toes slightly back, leaving the soles taut and and looking directly at Mrs. Featherton's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Featherton floated up to were the girls\u2019 bare soles were. They were tittering with giggles and anticipation. The ghost woman bit her lower lip as she looked intently at each exquisite bare sole, absorbing each and every detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... because, my sweet little girls, believe me when I tell you\u2026\u201d she said as she continued her previous sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the ghostly hands floating around produced feathers out of thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... I have ways of making you talk\u2026\u201d Lady Featherton smiled with glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floating hands began to wave the feathers around in the air and slowly approached the exposed soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls looked at each other and exchanged smiles of excitement and a playful concern for what was about to happen to their ticklish feet. <br>\r\nTheir toes wiggled, their feet twitched, and their soles tried to curl and scrunch without success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feathers finally made contact against the three pairs of ticklish bare soles. They began to slide lazily, slowly, and gently, up, and down. Up, and down. Up, and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, all three of the girls would have naturally fought against the instant urge to laugh that appeared and grew inside their chests. But with their usual resolve now turned, via the magic abilities fo Mrs, Feahterton, into childish playfulness and excitement, they predisposition towards being tickled like this wasn\u2019t exactly the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did the girls reacted to the feathers finally tickling the soles of their feet?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes fixated, at least for a few seconds that surely felt really long, on the movements of those hands wielding those tickly instruments. <br>\r\nIt had always been so strange to her to witness such a sensitive body part tickled and toyed like that, and not being able to control her own reactions at all after that fact. It was like suddenly sitting on the passenger seat of her own body, while the driver laughed helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked at her left. Her baby sister had puffed her cheeks and was clamping shut her mouth and eyes really hard in an attempt to keep her laughs in. It didn\u2019t seem to work, judging by the huge silly smile that was still plastered on her lips. <br>\r\nSummer then looked at her right, and saw her rival, Pao-Ting. The asian girl was looking back at her, with her big black eyes open wide, her mouth agape, and an expression of naive helplessness on her face. Then, a huge goofy smile draw itself on Pao-Ting\u2019s lips as she made eye contact with Summer. <br>\r\nAnd it was like if both knew that resistance was futile, like if both had decided via telepathy to just give in to those amazingly funny sensations crawling at the soles of their insanely sensitive bare feet. <br>\r\nThey simply looked at each other, and exploded into delicious, wanton, raucous girlish laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooohhhhhwaaaaaaaaaahahAHahHAhahahHAHAhahahahahahahahahHAHAhaHAha!\u201d Pao-Ting laughed without control.<br>\r\n\u201cPffffffffffwaaaaaaHAHahAHahahHAhaHAhahAHahahahahAhaahaha!\u201d Summer followed suit, only a fraction of a second later.<br>\r\n\u201cNgggwaaaHAHAHAHAHAHahahahHAha! HAhahahahA! AHAHAHAhA! HAHAHA! AHAhahhahahahahahaha!\u201d Mouse gave up quickly after listening to the older girls surrender to the gentle tickles on their feet, and quickly followed them by laughing herself to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previously empty and lonely underground of the manor was now filled to the brim with the sound of youthful, unrestrained laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Featherton smiled widely and sighed with joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a wonderful sight! I can\u2019t remember when was the last time that I was so lucky to find no less than three pairs of gorgeous, adorable, and insanely ticklish bare feet! You are indeed making me so happy, my girls!\u201d She clapped her hands.<br>\r\nThe girls could only laugh helplessly in response, but they felt a warm happiness washing over their hearts as they noticed how happy Mrs. Featherton was with this scenario. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, *ahem*, onto the task at hand. You see, my girls, that such are the methods I must employ in order to find out what your most ticklish spots are, since you refuse to tell me. I\u2019ll work over your whole bodies, top to bottom, or bottom to top, in this case, since we are starting with the feet.\u201d Lady Feahterton explained in her calm and warm voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh GAhAHhaHAhAHAHHAAD why The FEHEHEhehehahahat HAhAHHahHAAhAHAhA!\u201d Mouse let out, scrambled among her loud and clumsy laughter as she shook her head from side to side. She loved to the play the reluctant ticklee whenever she had the chance, and her newfound love for Mrs. Featherton still didn\u2019t change the fact that she still thought that was the funnest way of playing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the feet, you ask, dear Susan? Well, I must confess\u2026 it\u2019s a body part I\u2019m, *ahem*, really fond of. Mostly when they look like yours\u2026 so tiny, and delicate, and silky smooth\u2026 Not to mention, a more than fine choice when you are looking for ticklish spots, wouldn\u2019t you agree, my little girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYEehehahahAHHAEHHeaHAhAHAhHAHAS!\u201d Mouse almost screamed wildly.<br>\r\n\u201cWAHAhAHhahHahHhA sohohOHOhoho teeheheheheeckleeheehehesshsshhhhahaHAhahAHHAahAhAHAHAHA!\u201d Summer replied, taken over by the laughter. <br>\r\nPao-Ting, next to her, couldn\u2019t do more than to nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say, my girls. while I can tell you are all very ticklish, judging by your reactions, I have the feeling that I would have not to look to other place than your feet to find your most ticklish spots. Am I correct?\u201d The ghost woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What to do?\u2019 The girls asked themselves while lost in laughter. On one hand, they could confess their most ticklish spots to Lady Featherton and see what kind of amazing games she had planned for them after that. Or, on the other hand, they could keep playing hard to get, and seeing just how far would the ghost woman go in order to find that out, and have the time of their lives while doing so.<br>\r\nIn both cases, they felt like they were fulfilling Mrs. Featherton\u2019s wishes, and that was all that the girls\u2019 hearts desired at the moment. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, she preferred that to whatever this room would do to her.<br>\r\nShe ran up to the other set of doors to try the same strategy, but only got the same results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to look around, trying to find anything that could help her escape! She didn\u2019t know to pick locks, but she was willing to try if any tools would happen to be around.

Everything was quiet except for the giggles of the Salt sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she noticed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distinctive, flowing, steady hissing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... oh, no.\u201d She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSummer, Summer!\u201d She ran to her rival, once again grabbing her by the shoulders. \u201cI\u2026 what\u2026 wh\u2026 what can I do?\u201d The despair in Pao-Ting\u2019s face was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahaha I dohohon\u2019t knohohohow\u2026 but this gahahahahas is so much fuhuhuhuhuhun ahahahahahaha\u2026\u201d Summer said, as she was still in some kind of inebriated state due to her previous gassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, Summer! You\u2019re useless!\u201d Pao-Ting said, her words burning with rage.<br>\r\nBut she then felt something else along that rage.<br>\r\nShe felt a sense of lightness growing inside of her. The sudden notion that perhaps this wasn\u2019t so terrible, was it? After all, nothing bad had happened to the Salt sisters. They were merely laughing to their heart\u2019s content, lying on the floor without a care in the world.<br>\r\nNot only that, she was able to perceive something else. An almost faint, but noticeable sweet fragrance in the air, like the distant memory of cotton candy. <br>\r\nAll of that couldn\u2019t be that bad, could it? She felt her sense of urgency beginning to strangely melt away, much to her surprise. And in an even stranger manner, she could notice that a few, shy giggles were starting to bubble up inside her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSummer! Could you\u2026 mpppheeheehelp me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh, some giggles took over!\u2019 Pao-Ting thought. She found that quite amusing. Not to mention the fact of having to ask for help to her lifelong rival!<br>\r\n\u2018No, that can\u2019t be! I\u2019m Pao-Ting, the smartest teen in the world! I will not be reduced to a laughing child along Summer Salt!\u2019 Her usual tenacity spoke up inside her, as a part of her mind was trying her very best to fight the giggles back, resisting against what she knew very well to be the effects of the gas taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahaha yeah shuhuhuhure hahahahahahaha\u201d Summer replied. <br>\r\nAnd then, with a extremely clumsy but quick and effective swipe, Summer pulled off Pao-Ting\u2019s bandana covering her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSummer! You\u2019re so dumb! Hahaha I don\u2019t wanna breathe this!\u201d Pao-Ting said with indignation mixed with giddiness. \u201cYou cahahahan\u2019t do anything rahahahahaight! Hmppppphheeheeheeheehee!\u201d<br>\r\nThe giddiness was gaining ground and reducing the feeling of indignation. What Summer just did wasn\u2019t that terrible, was it? Or was it? Pao-Ting felt confused. Instead of obtaining help from her rival, she exposed her even more to the gas! But\u2026 it was just laughing gas\u2026 which couldn\u2019t be that bad, could it? In fact, it was beginning to feel funnier with each second! She realized that the need to laugh out loud was now front and center, and she couldn\u2019t avoid it anymore. Instead of her usual burning rage, Pao-Ting felt more like if she was being gently poked in the ribs unceasingly. <br>\r\nThe asian girl covered her mouth with her dainty hand in a silly attempt to withhold her giggles in, but they only came out stronger, sputtering out her cute lips which were curling up into an adorably silly smile.<br>\r\n\u2018How can this be that bad when all it\u2019s doing is just to make want to laugh so much?\u2019 She finally thought to herself. <br>\r\nAnd with that, the dam cracked, and her adorable musical laughter came out unrestrained.<br>\r\n\u201cNgggggggmmpppppheeheeheeheeheehee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahahaaha this agahahahahahahain? Why ahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d Next to Summer, Mouse began to laugh louder as the gas closed in on her. She couldn\u2019t quite articulate why or how, but she recognized what was happening now as an experience identical to what she just very recently went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBecahahahahause Pao-TingAHahAHAHa! She ahahahahahactivated the trap agahahahahahahahain! AHAhahahAhahahahahaha thahaahahahat\u2019s so fuhuhuhuhunneeheeheeheeheehe eahAHahHAhahhahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\nAffected by a new dose of the laughing gas, Summer began to find that fact increasingly funnier. <br>\r\nIn all truth, it was. Three brillant girl geniuses, all of them turned into helpless laughing fools for falling into the same trap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSummer! Shuhuhut up! I\u2026 ngggggggghh\u2026 I cahahahan\u2019t hhhhholdddd\u2026 back\u2026 theheehee\u2026 laughhhhffffffffterrrrrrrrrngehehehehehahahahHAHAHAhahahaha! Hahahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\nUnable to do anything else, Pao-Ting landed on her rear end and too fell under the effects of the gas, her laughter now flowing freely and mingling with those of her rivals. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll gehehehet you for this! Bwahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer usual rancour against Summer got mixed with her gas-induced silliness, which was slowly but surely taking over her consciousness, and that combination could lead to only one possible result: With a considerable effort, Pao-Ting reached over to where Summer\u2019s left ankle was and seized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNAhahahAHHAHAHAhA not tickling HAhAHhHAhAHAhAHA it\u2019s nAnAHaHAhAT FaHAhAHahAhAHAair waHAHhAhHAAHAhhahaaHa!\u201d Summer begged playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhohoHOhoho you\u2019re gonnahahAHHAahAHahaha geehehehehet it nahahahahow!\u201d While still helpless with laughter, Pao-Ting managed to spider her fingernails all over Summer\u2019s adorable bare sole, sending her rival in a state of deep-belly silent laughter.<br>\r\nSummer merely rolled on the floor uselessly, unable to even muster enough strenght to protect her tiny bare foot from Pao-Ting\u2019s tickling hands. Mouse looked at the whole scene and just pointed at it, while she kept on laughing wantonly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaHAHahHahahAHAHa ok AHAHAhAHAHAHAHA this haahahahactually is VEhehEHEHEry fuhuhuhun! HahaAHahAHAHAhaHAHAHAHAhahahAhahaha!\u201d<br>\r\nPao-Ting finally admitted as she completely succumbed to the effects of the laughing gas, just like her rivals before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls were simply and happily overtaken by the laughter, and so they lied on the floor of that room, laughing their heads off without a care in the world, until\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls had lost any possibility of control themselves. They were rolling around in the floor, completely lost in laughter. <br>\r\nSummer Salt, usually the smart and collected girl detective, was now turned into a laughing fool, as she banged her fists on the floor, since that was all she could do. That, and let out one deep belly guffaws after the other as she did so. A now constant stream of laughing gas had been entering her lungs freely for quite some time, intoxicating her senses, forcing her to laugh and laugh non stop. To make matters worse, her usual rival, self proclaimed girl genius Pao-Ting, had been tickling the sole of her bare foot while she also laughed herself senseless.<br>\r\nSpeaking of Pao-Ting, she wasn\u2019t doing any better than her rival or her little sister. She had lost the ability to coordinate her movements well enough to tickle Summer\u2019s foot, and instead was just holding the girl\u2019s leg like a drunk person would do, which unfortunately for her only resulted on Summer\u2019s other wiggling sole rubbing occasionally on her face. It didn\u2019t matter to her, though. She just kept on laughing like if there was no tomorrow. Laughing herself stupid too almost, since she had fallen prey to the need to let out raucous and loud cackles that from time to time bordered on gut wrenching laughter. She felt her face warm, as tears of laughter fell profusely down her reddened cheeks.<br>\r\nMouse was able to look at the whole spectacle from not too far away. She was finding the whole thing irresistibly hilarious, but of course, the laughing gas did help a bit with that. Mouse\u2019s laughter was a steady and loud stream of neverending joyful youthful cackles. From time to time she pointed in her sister\u2019s direction and kicked and stomped her feet on the ground, overtaken by the whole silliness of the situation, as she saw Summer continuing to make a fool of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls laughed themselves crazy as the gas continued to flow into the room. They had lost track of time, but it wasn\u2019t too many minutes that they had to endure in that situation.<br>\r\nIt was more than enough time for a certain group of people to attend at the alarm that had went off on other side of the manor when they sprang the laughing gas trap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough teary and fuzzy eyes, the girls saw a group of people enter the very room they were in, as they rolled on the floor in laughter. They didn\u2019t see exactly who, and in all honesty they didn\u2019t completely care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh, look at that. I love when this trap works. Look at them, they can\u2019t do anything right now.\u201d One of the mysterious people said.<br>\r\n\u201cI love it too. Such smart girls, so helpless\u2026 unable to do anything but laugh. To think that the boss is afraid of what they could do to the operation\u2026\u201d Another one replied.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, which makes it even more satisfying to see them defeated like this. Want to humiliate them a bit more?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in their laughing haze, the girls weren\u2019t able to distinguish the figures that dragged them through the floor, gathering them on a same spot as a literal pile of ticklish girls as they were helpless with laughter.<br>\r\nWithout saying anything, a flurry of hands descended on the girls. Armpits, ribs, legs, sides, hips, nothing was spared. The previously hysterical girls now fell on a state of defeated silent laughter. One of these people quickly discarded Pao-Ting\u2019s footwear, leaving both of her tiny and soft feet bare at once, and going to town on them in the blink of an eye. Summer and Mouse didn\u2019t escape this maneuver either, as from time to time their ankles were grabbed to have another hand scribbling and digging on their bare soles.<br>\r\nThe girls were far beyond the point of offering any resistance. And at their current state, they didn\u2019t want to, either. As the feelings on their most ticklish spots mingled with the already laughing gas induced silliness they were experiencing, they exploded into a supernova of ridiculous, raucous, stupid, girlish, helpless, youthful laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I think that\u2019s enough. Come on, let\u2019s take them over to the other place.\u201d One of the voices said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a round of considerable ticklish humiliation, the girls were carried out of the room and deposited into a sort of big shopping cart of sorts. <br>\r\nThey weren\u2019t being tickled, by the amount of laughing gas they had inhaled was more than enough to keep them laughing steadily and loudly as they were carried away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm. Who knew? Summer Salt, utterly defeated. I mean, look at her.\u201d One of the people said as the brilliant young detective kept on laughing non stop.<br>\r\n\u201cI think what happened to the asian girl is a bit more ironic. All of that hubris, and here you have her. Laughing herself silly like a little baby.\u201d The captors chuckled as the girls rolled around in laughter inside the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the world began to make sense for the girls once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don\u2019t quite know if they laughed so much they fainted. They don\u2019t know if they simply went back to normal after a little bit of time, or hours and hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer rubbed her head. She began to look around.<br>\r\nShe was in a room with a mostly sterile look. The walls seemed to be covered in aluminium tiles. The floor was felt warm under her feet, which reminded her she was barefoot still. <br>\r\nThere was no much else in the room, other than a big metallic looking chest on one side, and a door on the other end of the room.<br>\r\nNext to her Mouse was breathing at a slow and steady pace, like the one proper of a person who is sleeping soundly. She didn\u2019t chose to bother her yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwwww... \u201c Pao-Ting moaned as she slowly sat. The asian genius girl looked at her bare feet as she wiggled her delicate toes. \u201c... I\u2019m quite sure I was wearing shoes before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nShe and Summer made eye contact.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so humiliating.\u201d Pao-Ting said, stating out loud what both girls were thinking.<br>\r\n\u201cVery. I never had felt so utterly defeated.\u201d Summer said with a grumpy face.<br>\r\n\u201cThe worst part is to be forced to laugh so much while you\u2019re getting so utterly defeated.\u201d The asian girl added.<br>\r\nIt was a strange moment, but both girls seemed to have found a common ground to empathize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 we should find a way to get out of here, I assume.\u201d Pao-Ting said as she got on her feet.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd find the kidnapped people.\u201d Summer added. Pao-Ting simply agreed with a nod. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They went from cackling like hyenas, to deep and hard belly laughs, to dumb and silly guffaws. They just rolled on the floor, still barefoot, still helpless under the effects of the laughing gas, wreaking havoc on them. The pink mist still surrounded them, keeping its effects very much alive.<br>\r\n\"Thank god for nasal filters.\" Said one of the figures, next to the one that spoke before her. They both shared a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween their eyes filled with tears of laughter, both Summer and Mouse were able to see a group of about 8 clown girls looking down at them. They were all dressed in similar outfits: brightly colored dresses with relatively short skirts, with somewhat revealing cleavages that exposed their generous bosoms. All of them sported some sort of at least modest clown make up, in most cases crowned with some interesting and extravagant looking hair style. They all seemed remarkably pretty.<br>\r\nThey tried to react at the sight, but they couldn't: Summer and her little sister just kept on laughing out of control, finding the image of the looming clown girls as funny as everything else seemed to be around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we hit the jackpot here, girls.\"  Said one of the clown girls. She sported her blond hair tied up in two pigtails, adorned with colorful feathers coming out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Little Feather.\" Answered a brunette next to her. Her hair reached her shoulder blades and she sported bangs, crowned with a cute set of cat ears on her head. \"Who'd guess that'd we find the famous girl detective, Summer Sault, laughing her ass off on the floor just before we get here? She looks like she's having the time of her life, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget her little sister. She's a cutie!\" Said a redhead, crouching on the floor and pinching Mouse's cheeks. \"'Mouse'. Even her name is cute!\" The little Sault sister kept on rolling with laughter. Then the clown girl took Mouse by her left ankle, and lifted the girl's sole right up to her face. She placed her nose under the girl's small toes and closed her eyes. \"Hmmmmmm... they smell clean and sugary. Still, I could play with them for a while and show her why you gals call me Brushy.\" The clown girls giggled. Brushy planted a big wet kiss on Mouse's sole. The little girl's foot twitched at the contact with the clown girl's red lips, her laughter remaining as intense as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then I guess I'd have to show them why I'm called Kitty.\" Said the brunette with the cat ears, wiggling a surprisingly long and sharp-looking set of nails on each hand, all of them colorfully painted in different colors. \"And that it's not just because of the ears.\" With a smug smile of satisfaction, she kneeled next to Summer and grabbed her by right calf. At that particular moment, Summer was lying on her belly, so with Kitty's action the girl's sole ended up facing up to the ceiling. The clown girl swept her nails in short, quick scratches over the girl detective's sole. Summer's already mad laughter went up a notch, but she didn't do any kind of effort to move herself or her vulnerable bare sole from the source of those new found tickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we take them with us to play. They seem to be having quite some fun, we could play with them and join in to that fun too!\" Said Little Feather in an enthusiastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmm yep yep yep, I agree. We found ourselves some new playmates!\" Said Brushy with her eyes closed. She was now rubbing her cheek affectionately over Mouse's bare sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was about time we got to play with the Sault sisters!\" Kitty said, her nails grazing Summer's sole now and then. \"I've heard so much about them... we could be playing with them for days on end and not get bored.\" Beneath her fingers, Summer's toes barely wiggled. Most of her energy was concentrated on laughing as hard as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the clown girls nodded and shared a look of complicity. With at least 4 clown girls per girl detective, they easily picked them up and carried them along with them. All the while the Summer sisters never stopped laughing. Of course, the fact that the clown girls poked them here and there, or played with their bare feet along the way, didn't help much on that matter. <br>\r\nBut that was the beauty of the effects of the laughing gas, Summer thought, much to her chagrin, if she would have been able to experiment something even resembling chagrin on that moment. Everything around her seemed as funny and as fun as nothing ever before. What a joyful state of helplessness that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving behind the cloud of pink gas that engulfed them, the Sault sisters were taken to a different location.</span></div></div>",

The group of cute clown girls carried them around like if they were mere luggage, not very interested in telling the girls what their destination was or which path they were taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, it was currently quite difficult for both young detectives to figure out where they were in the mansion. Still under the effects of that sweet smelling laughing gas that flooded the room earlier, both girls continued to laugh their heads off. All they could remember of their journey within the mansion was the arms and hands of the clown girls holding them, and the sounds of their own hysterical cackles, loud guffaws, and ridiculous howls of laughter. <br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what would anyone think of me if they\u2019d see me in this state\u201d, echoed a small thought in the far back of Summer\u2019s mind, that wasn\u2019t still taken over by her hysterical and giddy state. Indeed, what would people see if they\u2019d encounter the smart and sharp teen sleuth, howling with laughter like a person gone mad? Still\u2026 she couldn\u2019t help but find that very same idea incredibly funny, forcing her to laugh loudly once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls could see was the ceiling of the many halls they were carried, taking twists and turns over and over again. <br>\r\nThat was, until they finally reached a pair of large wooden doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, here we are!\u201d said one of the clown girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors were made of a sturdy and thick oak wood, and reinforced with heavy iron bolts. It resembled what could have quite easily passed as the entrance to a dungeon taken right from the medieval times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty then! On your feet, girls! We\u2019re entering the Play Room!\u201d Kitty, one of the clown girls, said leaving one of the girls gently on the floor, standing on her bare feet. The other clown girls followed suit, leaving both Salt sisters standing in the hall. <br>\r\nBut, with effects of the laughing gas still far from diluting away, both girl detectives landed quickly on their rear ends, laughing themselves silly as they did. <br>\r\nThe clown girls couldn\u2019t help but chuckle and giggle at the sight of it. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, look at you, laughing your cutie pretty head off! You\u2019re just soooooo cute!\u201d said one of the clown girls, with bright short pink hair. In a flash, she kneeled down and began to unleash a blitzkrieg tickle attack on both sisters. <br>\r\nBeing unable to coordinate their own movements, they could only limit themselves to roll around uselessly, as the expert fingers of the clown girl tickled them in a most effective manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd there we go.\u201d Said Kitty, after unlocking the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the room could not differ more of a medieval dungeon\u2026 in a certain way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was brightly lit and colorful, like the inside of a luxurious circus tent. Only that, in a closer inspection, many of the contraptions inside the room weren\u2019t exactly something you\u2019d find in a circus: X-frames decorated its walls, and shackles (presumably to restrain wrists) dangled from both walls and columns. <br>\r\nHere and there, there were also some definitely medieval looking sets of racks, with the capacity to adjust themselves so they could hold someone as short as Mouse, or someone twice her size.<br>\r\nThere were also many sets of stocks scattered around the room, but there were 4 sets of stocks that clearly were the main attraction of the place. Those stocks were the result of some really fine craftsmanship, not only adorned with some artistic carvings of feathers, but also seemed to be made from some really sturdy and firm material. Only by looking at them one could imagine that no one restrained in such a device could leave by their own means. Still, they seemed to have some room for comfort, too: behind the stocks rested what seemed to be a plush couch made for one person, with a firm backrest for its occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot made from a similarly fine craftsmanship, but equally sturdy looking, there were a few vaults and wooden boxes here and there around the room, surely containing some interesting sets of tools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salt sisters, still giggling uncontrollably, were carried inside the room by the clown girls, were\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tehehehe we were invited to a party but the party people are gone.\" Summer giggled, hanging over Kitty's shoulder upside down. \"Stoppid sis my stomach aches\" Mouse winced and howled when the clown girl blew a loud raspberry on her belly while she was carrying her cradled in her arms. Only mild protests came when the clown girls stripped both girls to their panties and donned each girl a T-shirt that was generously cut just below the breasts. Also the sides of the T-shirts were cut away almost fully leaving only a narrow piece of cotton holding front and back together, providing unlimited access to bare skin under the arms and all below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutnumbering the girls by four the clown girls easily managed to put both girls into position and to close the locks. Meanwhile the other clown girls were also laughing from the silly jokes the laughing gas was invoking from Summer and Mouse. Unfortunately there was nobody around to see or listen. But slowly the gas was wearing off and the victims were calming down. The gorgous clown girls stood in two groups of four where Kitty and Little Feather seemed to have the major say. Although Summer tried to listen when she had come to her senses she could not make out what they were talking about. But certain looks and wide grinning gave her some unpleasant hints. Then she raised her head and looked over her belly to Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer's little sister was facing her from a few yards away, kneeling on all fours on a padded table with her feet behing her in the crafted stocks. \"Hey, are you ok?\" Summer asked with a low voice. \"Currently yes, but I think that will change soon.\" Mouse was looking at Summer's toe tied soles. Summer was resting on a flat padded bench with her feet locked in crafted stocks raised up in the air. Her knees were not tied but she had to bend them ninety degrees. Summer looked around aimlessly as there was no hope for rescue or escape expected. But her sharp eyes identified a pile of socks below one of the chairs next to the wall. Would they belong, or have belonged, to the missing school children that were the reason why Summer had entered this dreadful building?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Her little sister heard her and followed the direction that Summer was pointing towards with her index finger, despite having her hand tied down.<br>\r\nThe Mouse saw it: Socks! A whole pile of them! And a pile of discarded socks surely meant that there was a whole bunch of people barefoot somewhere inside this mansion. Despite not being as bright as her older sister, Mouse was quickly able to put the pieces together: they had found a clue that could lead them to the kidnapped kids!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMouse\u2026\u201d Summer began to whisper again \u201c... those must belong to the missing people! They must be nearby, inside this mansion! We have to aaaaaaaaaaaahaaaaaaahahahahahaha! What the hell?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer saw herself interrupted when one warm and soft hand grabbed her left big toe and gently pulled it backwards, making her cute little sole taut. Then, a hot and moist tongue slided with the grace of an olympic ice skater, from the heel, to the base of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry to interrupt.\u201d Said Little Feather. \u201cIt seemed like you were figuring out that all of those socks belong to the kidnapped children, and you know, we can\u2019t have you thinking so much and being all smart and such!\u201d The clown girl said in her characteristic up-beat tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you know what keeps you from thinking to much? Laughing! Yep, thinking straight is difficult when you\u2019re laughing.\u201d Said Kitty, crouching down so she was looking at Mouse directly in the eyes, with a big gleeful smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, we have the chance to have some fun with the great Sault sisters, teen detectives! It\u2019s so exciting! So as you can imagine, we won\u2019t just let go the chance of staying here with you for a while and have a few laughs.\u201d Little Feather winked at Summer, her voice taking a more provocative tone at the end of her phrase.<br>\r\nSummer\u2019s eyes went from Little Feather\u2019s to her sister\u2019s. They both exchanged a look of concern, knowing what was unavoidably coming to them. The clown girls noticed that, and couldn\u2019t help but find it both adorable and enticing at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing is, you have a choice in all of this. Sort of.\u201d Said Kitty,<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Kitty! You can choose the tickling style of your preference. You can either enjoy the tender ministrations of Kitty and her sharp, playful fingernails\u2026\u201d Little Finger extended her hand, pointing at fellow clown girl. Kitty displayed her nails so both sisters could see them clearly. They were long, not too much, but just enough\u2026 and seemed really sharp, like a set of really effective tickling instruments. They were coated in what seemed to be a fancy deep blue nail polish that gave them a glassy look.<br>\r\n\u201cI tend to bite a little bit too, just so you know.\u201d Kitty added with a small giggle, and showed her white sharp little fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta love her. Oooooooor, you can enjoy the mischievous and fun feather play that can be provided by yours truly!\u201d Said Little Feather, waving two of her weapons of choice in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one small piece of advice: I\u2019d choose the one that would make you laugh the most, if I were you.\u201d The clown girls giggled at Kitty\u2019s remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer and Mouse looked at each other and winced. They were trapped between a rock and a hard place. How could they make such a choice?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Summer saw the face of ticklish concern on her little sister, following around Little Feather\u2019s feathers with her eyes. Knowing that feather tickling was the ultimate weakness of the Sault family (even more when it was practiced on helpless bare soles), she couldn\u2019t help but jump into action to protect her baby sis. <br>\r\nShe sighed, and stepped up\u2026 metaphorically, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. I\u2019lll take the feathers.\u201d She said, trying to mask the concern in her own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Feather and Kitty looked at each other with surprise and excitement. A provocative \u201cooooooh!\u201d came from all of the clown girls in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at that! The big sis trying to protect her baby sis! Can you two girls be any cuter?\u201d Said Kitty with a sweet and teasy tone, as she walked over to where Mouse was and pinched her cheeks affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr perhaps our girl sleuth here really likes to play with feathers and have a few laughs and likes what I have to offer, didn\u2019t that occurred to you?\u201d Little Feather pretended playfuly to be offended as she walked over to Summer.<br>\r\nShe crouched down, looking at her right in the eye, with a huge, gleeful, mischievous, and at the same time adorable smile.<br>\r\n\u201cYou and I are going to have so much fun!\u201d She said to Summer, showing her one of her long, stiff feathers.<br>\r\n\u201cI really doubt that.\u201d Summer said, her sarcastic tone getting the better of her.<br>\r\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m feeling quite confident about that. Let\u2019s start by turning that frown upside down!\u201d In a flash, Little Feather disappeared from Summer\u2019s vision field, and as quickly as she disappeared, something new appeared: the feeling of a gentle caress, sliding lazily over the soft bare sole of her tiny right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmmmmpppfff\u2026!\u201d <br>\r\nThe reaction was instantaneous. Summer\u2019s cheeks puffed in a silly and childish attempt of holding in the laughs that were pushing to pour out. <br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, so sensitive! It must be sooooooo hard to keep all of those giggles in! Eeeeeevery stoke of the feather, soooooooooo slooooooooow over your tiny bare foot\u2026 soooooooooooo ticklish! I don\u2019t know how you do it, really. If I were you, I couldn\u2019t help it, even for one second, and I\u2019d feel the need\u2026 the urge\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, a second feather appeared, this one sliding in between Summer\u2019s left toes. The surprise of it was all that it took to break the dam and let the laughter flow free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... to laugh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPffffffffaaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheeeeeere we go! It feels so much better when you let it out, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Little Feather teased her ticklee at the same that she enjoyed her reactions enormously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahahahahahaha dahahahahahamn it hahahahhahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, cutie pie? Heard something funny? I heard a good joke today, it was about a group of cute little girls that were playing pretending to be detectives, but ended up trapped in the very same place they were going to investigate! That sounds embarrasing, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Each word that came out of Little Feather\u2019s mouth dripped with provocation and glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAhahahahahahahahahahaha shut up! HAhhahaahahahahahahahaha when I gejehehehehet out of heeheheeheheherAHAHahahAHahahHAHaha not the arches ahahahHAHHAhahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what even more embarrassing is that those girls ended up suffering the very same fate of the people they were going to rescue\u2026 they ended up being tickle tortured! Imagine, being forced to laugh like a little girl, helplessly, all with a simple and soft tickles on the soles of the feet! Now THAT would be embarrassing, wouldn\u2019t it? Really childish, it seems. Not a grown up thing at all that is, nope nope nope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hahHAahahhAhahahahahaha I\u2019m gonna aHAHAHAHahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach phrase that Summer tried to put together, ended up broken and in shambles, scrambled by the laughter that poured non-stop from her lungs. <br>\r\nLittle Feather looked at her captive with an almost motherly look, drinking in each and every single reaction that her feathers provoked in Summer. <br>\r\nTwo feathers, one for each foot, dragged lazily and lovingly over the bare soles of the teen sleuth, forcing her to laugh beyond her control. The skin of her feet was nothing short of perfect, smooth as silk, and ticklish like few others were, according to the clown girl\u2019s experience. Not to mention, her laughter was a delight to hear. It was sweet, musical, adorable, and it flowed wantonly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toes were a clear weak spot, but Little Feather didn\u2019t want to overdo it and tire her new plaything right away. She was generally really fond of toying with cute ticklish arches, and Summer had that in spades, so that\u2019s where she settled for most of the time, occasionally wondering over to the middle of the sole, the heel, or the area underneath her cute button toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna do something, baby girl? You mean besides laughing?\u201d Little Feather\u2019s voice had an interesting effect in Summer, that worried her quite a bit. The girl detective noticed how much more ticklish she felt at the very second that Little Feather\u2019s sweet voice and teasy words entered her ears. It was like a magical spell, using only words to increase her sensitivity considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhohoAHAhaHahHAhahahaHAhahahAHAhahahahhahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse looked at her big sister, taken over by laughter and tickles in a matter of seconds, and knowing that she would be suffering the same ticklish fate in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Kitty approached her, getting close to her face and teasing the girl behind her ear with that long sharp nail of hers. \u201c... what do you say if we have some fun too, like your sis is having?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse winced. The nail behind the ear made an involuntary smile appear on her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the other hand, that same clothing made her feel as vulnerable as if she were naked, with so many openings that surely were inviting any set of playful nails to explore inside. <br>\r\nNot to mention, a front seat view of her older sister going nuts with tickling induced laughter, surely wasn\u2019t helping Mouse feel more confident about what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty\u2019s nail became Kitty\u2019s nails dragging over her skin. Mouse was pretty sure that it was at least three sharp points what she felt traveling down the back of her leg, up to her right ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c \u2018Oh no\u2019? What do you mean \u2018oh no\u2019, cutie pie? \u2018Oh no\u2019 you don\u2019t want to play with me? \u2018Oh no\u2019 you don\u2019t want to have any fuuuuuun?\u201d Kitty said. While stretching the word \u201cfun\u201d, her nails barely grazed Mouse\u2019s upturned right sole, which was facing the ceiling. She reacted by stifling up the giggles that began to bubble up inside her.<br>\r\nIt was hard even to hold back one giggle. Kitty\u2019s voice, Mouse realized, was going to make an impossible task out of that. While Little Feather was chirpy and upbeat, Kitty was\u2026 sweeter. Gentler. In a way, that made resisting much more difficult for Mouse. Each word coming out of her soon-to-be tickler had more weight for the helpless girl detective than all of the cutesy teasy words that Little Feather was throwing at her big sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, look at how much fun she\u2019s having!\u201d Unable to avoid the effect of Kitty\u2019s hypnotic words, Mouse looked up and got a full view of Summer\u2019s ordeal. Her legs bent in a 90\u00b0 angle, her bare soles facing the ceiling, wiggling around helplessly. Feathers lovingly tickling her bare soles and her tiny button toes. Summer was laughing up a storm, not bearing one single trait of the stern, sharp and determined older sister that Mouse admired so much. Instead, she saw a little girl in the hands of someone that could toy with her as much as that someone wanted, laughing like crazy. <br>\r\nBeing older, even Summer\u2019s tiny feet were slightly bigger than Mouse\u2019s. Everything about her was bigger, more capable. And there she was, being forced to laugh like a little ticklish baby.<br>\r\nThe thought of \u201cI don\u2019t stand a chance!\u201d crossed Mouse\u2019s head. That was the last though she had before a new one began to take over her: laughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty began to let her nails drag in a desperately lazy manner over both of Mouse silky soft soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you wanna have some fun with me too? Come on, cutie pie, let\u2019s have some fun together. Just\u2026 laugh for me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmmmpfffffffaaaaahaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter began to pour out of Mouse\u2019s mouth wantonly and non-stop. <br>\r\nKitty smiled and exchanged a look of satisfaction with Little Feather. By only repeating the same simple motion, she was being able to make Mouse laugh slightly louder each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVeeeeeery good! That\u2019s it, let it aaaaaaaaall out, baby girl.\u201d Kitty\u2019s voice felt like honey when entering Mouse\u2019s ears. The girl detective even shaked her head in a cute and silly manner, as if she could be able to swat those words away before reaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahahahahhahahahaha stahahahahahahap heeheeheeheet! Hahahahahaha don\u2019t talk like that HAhahHAhahahahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk how, cutie pie? I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just\u2026 you\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re laughing like that, it could be distracting me! All I can think of is these tiny little feet I have to play with. And how I\u2019m going to tika-tika-tika-tika tickle them all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBWahahahahahhahaha shuhuhuhuhuhuht uhuhuhuhup hahahahaha! Don\u2019tahahahahahahahahaha!

Both Sault sisters, reduced to two laughing little girls, unable to escape. <br>\r\nThe rest of the clown girls in the room looked at the whole show, enjoying it greatly, and feeling an itch on their fingers, eager and ready to tickle the teen sleuth as well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were in the heart of the mansion, where the clown girls kept their victims and torment them for their own amusement!<br>\r\nThe vision chilled sent goosebumps through both of their bodies, despite the fact that they were still giddy and giggly under the lingering effects of the laughing gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLots of other people, mostly around their age and a little bit more, were being subjected to the most varied, creative, and effective forms of tickling they had ever seen before.<br>\r\nSoles were written on, nibbled, and thoroughly licked. Toes were explored by objects sharp and soft, that insisted on getting in every nook and cranny that formed in between them. Armpits were gently caressed by tools, some feathery and fluffy, and some sharp and pointy, gliding effortlessly over the skin. Sides were goosed, ribs were counted and used as pianos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here we go!\u201d Said cheerfully one of the clown girls, placing the Sault sisters in the stocks at the center of the room.<br>\r\nBefore they could blink, Summer and Mouse noticed their ankles being trapped in cushioned but firm stocks, leaving the bare soles of their feet facing forward, and leaving them not one single thing to do about it.<br>\r\nTheir big toes were tied up to the stocks, leaving their soles nice and taut.<br>\r\nTheir wrists were quickly tied above their heads, exposing their sides and their armpits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were unable to offer resistance. With the last remaining moments of the laughing gas affecting them, they not only were giggling helplessly and non-stop, but they could also feel some slight fatigue of the intense deep-belly guffaws that the gas forced out of them during so many minutes. <br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the Sault sisters regained their composure, still unable to completely wipe those silly smiles off their faces. They looked at each other with a clear look of concern, until a melodic voice interrupted them.<br>\r\n\u201cAhem! Could I have your attention now, please?\u201d Said one of the clown girls. The girls recognized her as Little Feather, a gorgeous but mischievous looking clown girl that was one of the first ones to pick them up when they fell under the effects of the laughing gas. <br>\r\nThe girls looked at her with a hint of fear.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, goodie! Now, I want you to know, it\u2019s an honor of sorts for me to be the first one to play with you in our Play Room!\u201d Little Feater said in a tone that oozed glee. \u201cWe hear sooooooo much about you in this house! Summer and Mouse\u2026 teen detectives! So exciting!\u201d She clapped her hands together.<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, I also do believe in sportsmanship. And I\u2019m sure you gave your very best, but alas, you lost fair and square. What can you do?\u201d Little feather shrugged for a second\u2026 and then smiled, pulling out two long, stiff looking feathers.<br>\r\n\u201cYou have been some really entertaining rivals, let me tell you. But to the victor go the spoils!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Please wait! No-AaaaaaaaaaaahHAhahahahahahAhHAhahaahhahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHAhahahahahahahahaha! Don\u2019t tickle our feeheeheheeheeheheet wahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown girl began to apply both feathers to soft and sensitive sole of both Sault sisters, one feather for each girl. Its touch was maddening, and it tickled like crazy! Not to mention, Little Feather sure had good reason to be called that: the way she wielded those instruments was nothing short of impressive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls realized they were in serious trouble\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a strange sensation for both Sault sisters. They had little time to adjust themselves after the effects of the laughing gas wore off, before being forced again to laugh out loud that musical laughter each of them had. <br>\r\nIn particular, Summer realized how clouded her mind was under the effects of the gas. And, sure, being tickled on her bare feet with a feather was not a scenario that she would consider to be optimal for some analytical thinking, but still she could think clearer being tickled than under the influence of that insidious laughing gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd being unable to stop her own deductive mind, Summer quickly realized that all of the people in that room with her, all of those unwilling ticklees, laughing hysterically, were quite likely the reason she came to this very manor: the missing school children! The kids that had been abducted so far were in this very room, being tickled out of their minds!<br>\r\nWhat was the purpose of this place? What was these people trying to achieve by abducting these kids and tickling them like this? Hell, who even were these people? Was she and her sister going to suffer that very same fate? How could they be able to escape when they were being subjected to foot tickling, their ultimate weakness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer to that came in the very curious form of the Sault sister\u2019s dear friends and partners in sleuthing and crime-solving: Jamie and Chris. <br>\r\nAlthough\u2026 they weren\u2019t in a state that would lead anyone to believe that they could rescue Summer and Mouse with ease at the moment. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Little Feather stopped tickling the sister\u2019s feet, giving them an accidental break for them to catch their breaths. She turned around to see what one of her partners was bringing over to them.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well, look at what we have here!\u201d She said in an amused tone as she chuckled. \u201cThese two cuties seem to be having a lot of fun, don\u2019t they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat amused Little Feather created a considerable sense of dread inside Summer and Mouse\u2019s chest. Jamie and Chris, their friends, were stumbling over to the stocks that held the Sault sisters, laughing themselves silly all the way. They were gently shoved from behind by the clown girl that brought them into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat damn laughing gas! They used it on Chris and Jamie too!\u201d Thought Summer. Not only that, she saw how silly and out of control her friends seemed right now, falling onto their butts on the floor, unable to remain standing, laughing like fools, and being so easily handled by their captors. She realized that\u2019s surely how she looked just a few moments ago also under the influence of the gas, and her cheeks blushed with an intense feeling of embarrassment. Summer Sault, teen sleuth, laughing herself silly in the hands of her enemies! In a way, it was worst that being forced to laugh via tickling. That insidious laughing gas robbed you even of the possibility of resisting and fighting back the urge to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, they sure are!\u201d Answered the clown girl that brought the girls to Little Feather. \u201cThey can\u2019t help but have lots of fun after I used my giggle gas on them, don\u2019t they?\u201d <br>\r\nAs Chris and Jamie fell down to their knees, still shaking with laughter, the clown girl took advantage of the situation to tease them and coo at them with a voice that was as embarrassing as it was patronizing, tickling their sides and ribs, sending their laughters into pure hysteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done to our friends?\u201d Said Mouse, with a clear concern on her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be worried, cutie pie! We just gave them something to laugh about so they wouldn\u2019t be worried and they agreed to play with us! Just like we did to you and your sis earlier, remember? Here, it was something like this.\u201d Before Mouse could react, Little Feather produced a small can, and sprayed a tiny amount of its content directly on Mouse\u2019s face. The pinkish cloud was small, but more than enough to be unavoidable by the girl.<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Don\u2019t! That\u2019sssss\u2026. pffffffheeheeheeheehahahahahahahaahaha!\u201d <br>\r\nNot having any choice but to inhale it, the small amount of gas entered Mouse\u2019s lungs, making her giggle silly once again. Although, luckily for her, it was in a considerable lesser amount than what she and Summer had been exposed to earlier, making her only laughing and giggle instead of howling with cackles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you planning to do with our friends, you fiends?\u201d Said Summer, over the sound of Mouse\u2019s giggles next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you see, this is called the Play Room for a reason. So we brought your friends here to play with you and with us!\u201d Little Feather explained in a chirpy tone. \u201cTrue, we usually test if the people we bring here is \u2018clown girl material\u2019, but mostly we bring them here to have loads of laughs! So that\u2019s what your friends are here for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Feather crouched and looked directly at Chris and Jamie\u2019s faces. The effects of the gas were fading away, and they were merely giggling nervously, flinching and chuckling even more when they saw Little Feather\u2019s adorable but (right now) intimidating features looming over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour friends here can play nice and help us tickle you\u2026 or\u2026\u201d The clown girl pulled out a stiff, long feather. <br>\r\n\u201c... they can refuse. And then, next to a cute pair of barefoot Sault sisters, we will also have a nice pair of barefoot friends tied up next to them. And I can use my feathers aaaaaaaall over those eight feetsies I will have to play!\u201d Little Feather looked at Summer and winked at her. Right now, the teen sleuth had no way out, and they both knew it. One way or another, Summer was going to get tickled again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Little Feather turned over to Chris and Jamie. \u201c... what is it gonna be?\u201d <br>\r\nShe waved her feather at them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The amusingly menacing tone of Little Feather waving her weapon of choice caused even more nervous giggles in the two girls who were still shaking off their bodies the last chuckles caused by the laughing gas they had been exposed to earlier.<br>\r\nAfter the few seconds that took them to calm down, Jamie stood up, her legs and her chest still shaking a little bit due to how much she had been laughing in the last minutes, and still making quite an effort to completely wipe a big silly smile off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-n-no\u2026\u201d She said, keeping a few chuckles in. \u201cSummer and Mouse\u2026 are our f-f-friends\u2026 We w-won\u2019t turn against them. No matter what you do to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite interesting the sensations that run over all of the people who heard Jamie said that. <br>\r\nFor one, Jamie herself felt her skin tingle. A mixture of bravery with helplessness washed over her, as a result of being bold enough to stand up for her friends, but also knowing that there was pretty much no chance for all of them to end up captured and tortured with tickling.<br>\r\nChris was in a similar position. Inspired by her friend\u2019s courage to refuse to turn against Mouse and Summer, she felt at the same time the urge to do the same thing, also knowing there was not much they could do to help their current predicament, let alone escape from it.<br>\r\nSummer felt an immense pride in seeing that attitude in her friends. She never felt such a strong support, and even more in the face of danger! But the detective inside her couldn\u2019t help but think that perhaps Jamie has just turned down their only chance to escape: pretending to side with their captors, only to try some unlikely attempt at releasing her and Mouse.<br>\r\nAnd Mouse\u2026 well, still under the effects of the gas, she only continued to laugh merrily. The situation seemed hysterical to her. Her sweet girlish laughter simply mingled with the sound of youthful hysterics that filled the whole room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the one who felt the biggest rush was Little Feather. The clown girl realized that, with that decision, the great Summer Sault and all of her friends had just given up to her, pretty much agreeing to be taken as prisoners. <br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t contain her gleeful smile. A whole group of spunky girls for her to tickle, to play, and to toy with! Her fingers began to itch, her mind began to race with the possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so much fun we are going to have together, then!\u201d Little Feather bit her lower lip and clapped with excitement. <br>\r\n\u201cGirls!\u201d She snapped her fingers. Her fellow clown girls appeared in a flash, surrounding Jamie and Chris, holding them gently but firmly by their shoulders and arms. \u201cIt seems like these two brave little girls want to spend sometime laughing along  her friends. Why don\u2019t we give them a hand with that?\u201d <br>\r\nSome of the clown girls giggled mischievously and quickly put Jamie and Chris in two empty set of stocks that were next to ones that held Summer and Mouse, and were identical in structure. The girls tried to offer some resistance, but just like it has happened to the Sault sisters, their bodies felt slightly light and with not enough strength to do anything of significance that could help them escape the grasp of the clown girls.<br>\r\nQuickly their ankles were trapped in cushioned and firm stocks, leaving their feet facing forward. At least the girls were thankful that, unlike the Sault sisters, they were still wearing their shoes and socks. <br>\r\nTheir wrists were quickly tied above their heads, exposing their sides and their armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Feather stood triumphant in front of the group of captured girls. Chris, Summer, Mouse, and Jaime, in that order from left to right, looked at her with eyes that showed defiance at the same time that they showed dread, knowing how helpless they were to prevent what was surely to come to them in any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get too attached to this.\u201d The clown girl said with a wink as she wiggled the top of Chris\u2019 left sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026\u201d she took a couple of long, stiff feathers once again. Each of them seemed like an extension of her body. \u201c... as I was saying to this cute little pair of sisters earlier, this is kind of an honor! It\u2019s not everyday that you get to triumph over your rival in your own terms, and even get rewarded by being able to play with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that was your big plan all along? Trap us so you could tickle us? That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been abducting all of these innocent people?\u201d Summer said with a stern voice.<br>\r\nNext to her, Mouse\u2019s giggles were slowing down to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s just a part of it. But yeah! When it comes to the four of you, our main goal was to prevent you from ruining our plans, and also, well... \u201c The clown girl waves her feather at Summer \u201c... who says we can\u2019t have a few laughs in the process?\u201d Summer was unable to hold back a small grimace showing concern, when she thought of the effect feathers had on her exposed and helpless tiny bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut to show I\u2019m also a good sport, like I said earlier, I can at least give you a choice before we start, so you don\u2019t complain later that I\u2019m the one having all the fun.\u201d Little Feather giggled.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what is it going to be\u2026\u201d <br>\r\nShe took a step forward. Her hands rested on the edge of the stocks. She raised her eyebrows as she looked at the girls right in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... feet, or upperbody?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls remained in a nervous silence amongst the laughter that came from the other unwilling ticklees, filling up the whole room.<br>\r\nTheir eyes wondered about, trying to avoid any possibility that could trigger their unavoidable torture. <br>\r\nAll of this applied to all of the girls, except for Mouse. In a moment of weakness, her eyes locked with those of Little Feather. The clown girl looked at her directly with a mischievous smirk, the girl detective couldn\u2019t look away and began to feel a nervous smile fight its way to her lips. It was the most intense staring contest she had ever been in. Until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... oh please, not the feet!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Mouse finally said, looking down, wincing and curling up her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe feet? Why that\u2019s a fantastic idea, you cute little Mouse!\u201d Little Feather clapped. Her eyes went directly to the adorable bare soles of the Sault sisters, and then to the still protected feet of Chris and Jamie, that hadn\u2019t lost their shoes yet. <br>\r\nShe looked back at them with a mischievous grin while she bit her lower lip.<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it. Mouse, why did you have to say anything\u2026?\u201d Summer thought to herself. Her feet were her most ticklish spot, and all of the people in that sitution knew it. She knew it, her sister knew it, her friends knew it\u2026 and she had the bad feeling that Little Feathers and the other clown girls knew it too.<br>\r\n\u201cI love foot tickling games. They\u2019re the most fun of all! Everybody ends up laughing their asses off and having a blast. But\u2026\u201d Little Feather frowned and grabbed playfully at one of Chris\u2019 shoes once again. <br>\r\n\u201c... you party poopers still have shoes on! How can you miss the chance of being more comfy, kick your shoes off, let your feet breath and relax a little\u2026 don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t like to walk barefoot! Besides\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nLittle Feather reached Mouse\u2019s right bare sole with her finger, and begin to lovingly caress it, slowly, going uuuuup and dooooown.<br>\r\n\u201c... you\u2019re making me miss the chance of seeing your pretty bare feet, not to mention the chance to play with them a little bit, huh?\u201d She winked at Mouse. But the girl detective was unable to blink back at her: her cheeks puffed, almost as quickly as she looked down and as a big silly grin appeared on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cPffffffffffffffhehehehehehehehehe\u2026\u201d Mouse couldn\u2019t help but begin to giggle as quietly as she was able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Jamie interrupted. \u201cYou\u2019re going to drive us crazy by tickling us anyway, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d Her tone sounded almost nonchalant, but the girls knew as much as their captors that it was a bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it does matter, cutie pie. Because I could simply tickle you crazy, until you agree to tickle each other crazy only to avoid it yourselves.\u201d Little Feather giggled. The girls wondered to themselves how possible could that be, and shared a moment of silent concern.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that would be fun. But there are other options that could be even more fun! So instead of looking at these choices, or the fact that you still have shoes, as a problem\u2026 we can see them as an opportunity!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn opportunity for what?\u201d Said Chris, slightly disconcerted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor turning it into a fun game for all of us!\u201d Little Feather replied. Chris gulped, and immediately regretted asking, knowing what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe difference would be\u2026\u201d Little Feather tapped her finger against her chin, while looking up to the ceiling. <br>\r\n\u201c... if you want to start our games like you are right now. Or\u2026\u201d she tapped her fingernails against the sole of Jamie\u2019s sneaker \u201c... if you want to start in equal footing.\u201d <br>\r\nLittle Feather chuckled at her own bad pun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a moment of pondering her options, Summer\u2019s moral compass kicked in. Her friends wouldn\u2019t be trapped like this if they weren\u2019t here to help her. She owed them at least the courtesy of trying to help them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Let\u2019s play then.\u201d Summer said. \u201cYou can start by having some fun with us. After all, we are barefoot already.\u201d She spread her toes as much as she could, with her big toes tied down. Her trick worked though: Little Feather\u2019s eyes went up to her bare soles wiggling like a moth to the flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, goodie! I don\u2019t know what do I enjoy the most! Either Summer Sault, offering me her bare feet to play with willingly, or this lovely act of selflessness and friendship that I\u2019ve just witnessed!\u201d Little Feather said as she cradled her own cheeks with her hands. Still, there was a strange\u2026 honesty in her words, as far as the four friends were concerned. How odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should thank your friend here, girls! Not only it\u2019s clear that she really cares about you, but also she just gave me an awesome idea for a fun game for all of us to play!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a stool nearby and placed herself in front of Summer and Mouse\u2019s bare feet. The older sister remained calm and collected, while the younger sister\u2019s feet were beginning to twitch nervously.<br>\r\nShe snapped her fingers, and a couple of clown girls approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, we\u2019re going to play a fun little game called \u2018Don\u2019t Laugh\u2019. The game\u2019s objective is pretty simple: you must not laugh, no matter what. If you do, there\u2019s a penalty.\u201d She took out two of her long and slender feathers, one in each hand.<br>\r\n\u201cIf Summer laughs\u2026\u201d she said, waving the feather on her left hand. \u201c... Chris\u2019 shoes will begin to slowly and gently be removed until she is completely barefoot.\u201d<br>\r\nSummer and Chris looked at each other with a look of concern. <br>\r\n\u201cIf Mouse laughs\u2026\u201d Little Feather waved the object on her right hand. \u201c... then Jamie will lose her shoes and socks until she is completely barefoot as well.\u201d<br>\r\nThe clown girls that had approached looked at each other and giggled, one taking position next to Jamie and Chris.<br>\r\nMouse looked at Jamie like someone who had already screwed up, confirming what they both knew: there was no way Jamie was going to keep her shoes on.<br>\r\n\u201c... crap.\u201d Whispered Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, the process of removing your friend\u2019s shoes and socks stops at the moment you stop laughing. But if they get barefoot aaaaaaaaall the way\u2026 then they join the game too, and we will see if they\u2019re able to win a few rounds of \u2018Don\u2019t Laugh\u2019!\u201d Little Feather said in her characteristic up-beat tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d She asked before any of the girls had any chance to react.<br>\r\n\u201cSet\u2026 go!\u201d<br>\r\nWith both Summer\u2019s and Mouse\u2019s big toes tied up, the girls feet were practically a canvas, for her to paint and draw on with her two trusted feathers.<br>\r\nShe began to slide them gently, taking all of the time in the world. The feathers began their trips on the plump heels, slowly dragging themselves over the middle of the soles, sliding under the toes, and returning to the heel by caressing the tender arches.<br>\r\nLittle Feather seemed to be ambidextrous. She found no problem whatsoever in wielding two feathers at the same time like if it was only one. Each hand mirrored the movement of the other seamlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Summer and Mouse felt the loving and almost electrical tingling of the feathers toying with their sensitive bare feet, sending shocks up their bodies, that their brains translated as a strong and eager need to laugh.<br>\r\nBut, knowing that with each second of resistance, they were buying time for their friends and spearing them from being tickled, they did their best to hold their laughs in. <br>\r\nTheir bodies began to shake, twist and writhe in their bindings. Their faces began to contort into goofy and silly expressions. They were doing their best, but everyone around them could see that wasn\u2019t going to be enough for more than a few minutes, at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVeeeeeeeery good, little girls! This is how you\u2019re supposed to play a good and challenging game of \u2018Don\u2019t Laugh\u2019!\u201d Little Feather said in a sweet and teasy voice. \u201cAt least from your end. From my end\u2026 well, I do like to win, and if I want to win, I better step up my game, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sault sisters wince at listening to those words...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite Summer seeming more determined to hold on than her little sister, her insanely ticklish feet were giving her a run for her money. <br>\r\nBoth Sault sisters seemed to be on the breaking of cracking up with silly, clumsy, girlish laughter. Their chests were shaking and quaking, and the smiles on their faces were uncontainable. Their eyes were shut down hard, with their heads trying to shake off the urge of bursting with laughter in any minute now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh, you don\u2019t seem to be having such a good time, cutie pies! Perhaps you should just laugh! Don\u2019t keep it all bottled up inside, It\u2019ll make you feel better to just let it aaaaall out! Of course that means I win the game, but still.\u201d Little Feather teased them in a strangely friendly manner,<br>\r\n\u201cOr, don\u2019t mind me. I\u2019ll just keep playing with some of the prettiest I\u2019ve ever seen. Oooooh yes, such cute cute cute cute little feet, for my feather to play with\u2026 uuuuuuuup\u2026 and doooooooooown\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThe clown girl\u2019s voice acted like an amplifier of the sensations the girls felt roaming over the sensitive skin of their soles. Each word made every stroke of the feather increase its ticklishness tenfold.<br>\r\n\u201cSuch pretty little feet. Coochie coochie, little feet. Coochie coochie coochie\u2026 Do you like my feathers? Oh, I think you doooooo...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnnnnnngggggghhhheeeeeeeeeaahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!

There was nothing they could do except laugh and laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWahahahahahahahahahaha! Please mercy! Merceeheehehehehehahahahaha ohohohohahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d Summer laughed, out of control, broken by the tickling.<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! I\u2019ll do anything hAhahahaHAhahahahahahahahaha!\u201d Mouse begged, even a bit more desperate than her big sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the mercy didn\u2019t came. Instead, other clown girls joined Little Feather in tickling the helpless girls. Armpits, sides, ribs, bellies, and thighs, joined the feet in the collective experience of having each possible ticklish spot on them exploited.<br>\r\nThe clown girls had a soft, tender, almost loving touch, that made the girls laugh the loudest and hardest they ever had. The women were really experts in the art of extracting as much laughter from anyone as possible.<br>\r\nBut the taunting\u2026 my god, the taunting! The sweetest, most embarrassing, most patronizing phrases were constantly used against the girls. Sweet sugary voices that spoke right next to their ears cooed with an estrategic expertise, making the Sault sisters feel that their ticklishness increased tenfold. <br>\r\n\u201cCoochie coo!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh-kitchy-kitchy-kitchy!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTika-tika-tika, baby girl!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh, such a nice laughter! Let\u2019s hear more of it!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happens if I slide this quill over your cute little footsie, I wonder?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let it bottle up inside you! Just laugh! You\u2019ll feel great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that. Even under such an onslaught of tickling, Summer and Mouse couldn\u2019t avoid noticing the fact that they were not alone.<br>\r\nThe hysterical laughter of many other victims, just like they were right now, filled the whole room. Looking around, the girls could see lots of people enduring many variations of the ticklish torment they were enduring. <br>\r\nOne girl was on her fourth game of Tic-Tac-Toe, with her own soles used as the board. Another one was having her supple armpits used as a canvas, with soft paintbrushes creating colorful images on her skin, next to a girl that was quite probably her own sister, that had her own tummy being painted on as well.<br>\r\nNear one of the walls, one of the clown girls managed to trap at least 5 pairs of helpless bare feet in stocks, with the owners of those feet wrapped in blankets like human burritos. The feet varied in shapes and sizes, and the clown girl seemed to be submerged in a state of deep artistic inspiration, as she played those feet, producing all kinds of musical laughter, like if she was indeed playing an instrument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, much to Summer\u2019s surprise, she saw two familiar figures approaching her and Mouse: her friends, Jamie and Chris!<br>\r\nBoth girls\u2019 feet approached in a clumsy manner up to the stocks that held Summer and Mouse. They were already barefoot, with their cheeks showing a bright pink blush, and the overall demeanor of someone who is simply exhausted.<br>\r\nNot only that, they were not offering any kind of resistance. They simply walked up to where the Sault sisters were, merely carried by their hand of the clown girl that Summer identified earlier as Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere they are.\u201d Said Kitty. Letting go of Jamie\u2019s and Chris\u2019 hands, the girls simply sat on the floor, almost collapsing on it, breathing deeply. They had a direct view of their Summer and Mouse\u2019s soles being tickled, but they didn\u2019t seem to have the energy or the spunk in them to do anything to stop them. Both Sault sisters realized that their friends surely came right from enduring some very intense tickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were playing for quite some time with the Clown Prince.\u201d Said Kitty to Little Feather, smiling. Both of them chuckled.<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you poor things... \u201c Little Feather caressed Jamie\u2019s cheek. \u201cBut don\u2019t you worry\u2026 the fun part is about to begin!\u201d She said in chirpy and upbeat manner. <br>\r\nThen, she handled one of her feathers to Jamie and one to Chris. <br>\r\nThe tickling of the Sault sisters stopped. The girls looked at each other with concern as they tried to get their breath back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see\u2026\u201d Little Feather stood up, talking to all four friends. \u201c... this is part of an initiation of sorts. Your friends, Jamie and Chris, simply started it a little bit earlier than you, but still you all get to play together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking down in doubt, Jamie and Chris stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe idea is that you can also join or Merry Group of Clown Girls, making our party bigger and helping us recruit more people!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never join you! You better let us go before the police come looking for us!\u201d Said Summer, with stern and determination.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you silly cutie patootie you! Who do you think pays the police enough so they don\u2019t come looking for people in such a huge manor? Or do you think that they were merely letting some cases open for some daring teen girl detective and her friends to solve it?\u201d Little Feather said with a natural and carefree tone, that still didn\u2019t stop Summer\u2019s heart from sinking inside her chest. She was beginning to realize that how much sense the clown girl\u2019s words had, putting the pieces together inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, thing is, Chris and Jamie already agreed to join us! They will be our next, newest members!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! No! That can\u2019t be true! Come on, guys, we\u2019re your friends!\u201d Said Mouse, almost bursting with helplessness.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I\u2019m sorry... \u201c stuttered Jamie \u201c... but, we didn\u2019t know what else to do. There wasn\u2019t any other way out, and we thought we were going to be tickled out of our minds\u2026\u201d She looked down again.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. But\u2026 I mean\u2026 perhaps if you don\u2019t act so stubborn and give up quickly\u2026 we can go\u2026 easy\u2026 on you\u2026\u201d Chris added with a very noticeable shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah-ah-ah! No going easy here, you cute little softies. Or did the Clown Prince went easy on you?\u201d Little Feather nudged Chris on her side with her elbow.<br>\r\nBoth friends looked at each other realizing what they had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will get out of this, and save all of my friends too.\u201d Summer said. Her voice was as strong as iron\u2026 but deep inside her, she knew how defenseless and helpless she really felt. She hoped no one else could see through her heroic facade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so much determination! You will be the most fun!\u201d Little Feather said. \u201cAh, I almost forgot! In case I didn\u2019t mention it, the initiation consists into tickling you until you accept to join us, and be ready and willing to do the same to someone else.\u201d The clown girl winked at the Sault sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse whimpered and tried uselessly to curl her tied up toes.<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of silence, Summer finally said. \u201cGo ahead. Do your worst.\u201d As she braced herself for what\u2019s to come.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t you worry, little girl\u2026\u201d Little Feather walked up to Summer, putting her face right in front of her, looking her directly into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Chris, Jamie\u2026 why don\u2019t you begin?\u201d the clown girl suggested.<br>\r\nWith a sigh, both girls began to apply the feathers to their friends tied up feet.<br>\r\nTheir reactions were instantaneous. Both Summer and Mouse exploded with laughter while Chris and Jamie caressed gently their bare soles, making them laugh in complete hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, all of the clown girls that were tickling the Sault sisters resumed their task, taking all of the free spots in their legs and upper bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry\u2026\u201d Little Feather whispered in Summer\u2019s ear. \u201c... after you accept to join us, you will have your chance to tickle your friends back. I\u2019ve heard that their feet are just as ticklish as yours!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe planted a big, wet, warm kiss, on Summer\u2019s cheek, as the poor girl continued to laugh wantonly and non-stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long that will take\u2026 is up to you!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whatever spell the Count had used before on the girls he did again as Jamie made eye contact, causing her to become knocked out as well. The Count began to chuckle. \"That foolish boy escaped my grasp for now, but when I felt another presence in this room I had to come back quickly to make sure my captured little princesses stayed captured. And would you look at this, another princess to question on the wherebouts of my pendent!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few more minutes, the Count had gathered a new chair and more coils of rope, and had Jamie bound in the same way as the Salt sisters.

While she was still in shock, the man grabbed her wrists, wrenched them behind her back, and quickly tied them together with rope that he was holding.

Summer then got a scared look on her face as she looked up at Mouse \"Don't you dare Mouse\" Summer said trying to act authoritative. \"This is going to be so much fun\" then Mouse proceeded to go over to the bottom end of the coffin and pulled her big sisters feet out from inside the coffin and took her shoes and socks off, Summer tried clenching her feet to keep her socks on but Mouse pulled and tugged them off despite her effort. \"Mouse you better let me out right now and you better not touch my feet, or I will make you regret it\" Mouse then proceeded to stick her tongue out at her big sister and said \"I think I will take my chances\". Mouse looked around and saw a feather lying on a shelf, she went over and grabbed it then came back over to Summers feet, \"hmm what game should we play first, This Little Piggie, or Feather Dash\"?

Normally this wouldn't tickle someone that much but Mouse knew how insanely hypersensitive her big sisters toes were. Summer moved her feet free of Mouse's fingers but then Mouse grabbed two of Summers toes and spread them apart and began sliding her tongue in between them. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAWWWHHHAAATTTTAARRREEEEYYYYOOOUUUDOOIINNNGGGTT THHHAAATTTTTIIIIICCCCKKKKKLLLLEEESSSSSOOOOBBAAAAADDDDDHAHAHAHAHA\" Summer laughed hysterically as her little sister continued to move down to each individual toe sliding her tongue on the sensitive skin between each toe. Once she finished with one foot Mouse repeated the process on Summer's other foot, Summers face was red and tears were streaming down her face by the time her little sister had finished licking her feet. Summer was breathing in and out trying to catch her breath \"Now wasn't that fun sis\" Mouse said as she looked at Summers tomato face, Summer glared at her sister as she continued breathing heavily \"You are so dead when I get out of this Mouse, I will make you wish you had stayed home and not followed me here\" Mouse grinned \"You say that like you are going to get out sometime soon, I'm not done with you yet big sis, we still have plenty of time to spend together\" Mouse went back down to Summers feet and said \"If you thought my tongue was bad wait until your ticklish toes get some nibbles from my teeth\" Mouse then began to go along each of Summers toes again this time grazing her teeth together on each one. The next thing Mouse heard was Summer's laughter get really loud then by the time she reached the end of one foot, Summers laughter had gone silent, but Mouse just continued on to her sisters other foot gnawing on each toe. When Mouse had finished she got up and looked at her big sister laying in the coffin, she had passed out from laughing so hard. Mouse smiled and said \"Well that was fun, I think I will untie her and let her sleep for a bit before we look for Jaime and Chris\". A couple hours later Summer woke up and sat up noticing her bonds were untied, Summer looked around the mausoleum for her pain in the neck sister as serious revenge filled her mind. Then she noticed the doors to the mausoleum she was in were shut so she walked over to them and reached for the handle when she heard snoring coming from the other side, she placed her ear against the door and was able to hear it much more clear, it was Mouse's snoring. \"I got her now, she is going to wish she untied me right when she found me by the time I am done with her\". As Summer reached for the handle to open the door and grab her little sister she heard a noise from behind her, she turned her head around saw a shadow dart behind a room down a small hallway deeper in the mausoleum. \"Uh Oh, I don't think we are alone anymore\" Summer said with fear in her voice, she decided now was not the best time for payback, she had to get her and Mouse out of this graveyard before whatever is there with them decides to reveal itself. Summer opened the door and closed it behind her placing her back against the wall, \"Mouse wake up\" Summer said trying to wake up her little sister. Mouse's eyes opened slowly as Mouse let out a groggy \"Hey Sis, how was your nap\" Mouse yawned then she saw the worried look on Summers face. \"What's wrong sis\" Mouse asked anxiously, \"There is someone behind these doors, I saw a shadow before I opened these doors, someone is here with us Mouse, we have to get out of this graveyard fast before whatever it is catches us\". Mouse jumped up and her and Summer proceeded through the graveyard, after running for a few seconds they heard the mausoleum doors swing open and bang against the buildings outer walls.

Tombstone encircled her, scared her, but she didn't break. Nope she broke few moments later when she saw spiders. After few moments  she left every fear and worry behind her, confident in her skills and attributes that would prove to Summer that she was a vital part of this mission.<br>\r\nAs she stepped deeper into the graveyard she heard a sound, a muffled sound, a sound that she knew well... someone was gagged. She rushed toward the source of the sound to finally find a person wrapped from head to toes, like a mummy, in bandages. Only his or her bare feet were sticking out from his/hers bindings. Mouse slowly approached the figure only to figure out it was...</span></div></div>",

After few steps she remembered Smiley's words, something about 'clown prince using children for his machine in most horrible way'. It made her shiver to no apparent notice from her captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went down the stairs, through few rooms, down the elevator, even through a circus. In circus there were few lion, elephants, some magicians, but most important to Mouse, candy. She loved candy more than anything, so she begged Smiley to buy her few and untie her hand just for that occasion. So the two of them, Smiley, a cheerful clown girl recruited by Clown prince, and Mouse, a semi-captive girl who wasted all her despair on candy and was in ecstasy now, were leaving small circus behind and walked over to dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dungeon, place of many tortures and pain inflicting techniques. Mouse always imagined it less funny that this. All there was there was line of clown looking stocks with center holes for feet apparently. Mouse was quickly strapped in one of stock, her hands tied to comfy cushion chair. Smiley smiled at her piece of art. A cute little girl, who actually didn't put much of an effort to struggle was tied in stocks. It almost made her too happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what should we do Mousy?\" Smiley asked putting her finger on her chin \" I know! Let us play a game until little boss or big chief arrive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlow as a snail, she started to untie Mouse's shoes. One after the other they fell to the floor leaving her in her black socks. Released of her shoes, Mouse freely wiggling her toes playfully. It was only then she finally got it in her head what will happen to her, and she was happy about it. Her black socks flew over the room and Smiley was now watching at two cute little feet, all hers to play. Slowly she dragged a fingertip all over Mouses sole, making it twitch and making Mouse release the cute little giggles. After first two or three waves of long journey over her soles Smiley stopped, only to be surprised by little girls reaction. She wiggled her toes again, having a playful smile on her face. Smiley didn't need much more to understand that she liked it. She...</span></div></div>",

Smiley could tell she was really enjoying watching this kid release another peal of laughter and wiggle her cute little trapped toes, especially when her toes were the subject of tickling. Which Smiley found even cuter was how Mouse seemed to be enjoying herself almost as much as she was, Smiley never stopped smiling as she played with Mouse's little feet occasionally stopping so she could catch her breathe or stopping to pull back her toes so she could tickle the exposed undersides of her little toes and watch as she burst into more ticklish laughter. Mouse was almost crying with laughter when playing \"This Little Piggy\" with her toes when Mouse swore she saw Smiley's grin widen as she dragged out the time of \"This little Piggy\" and decided to spend extra long tormenting her final and smallest toe, tickling all over the base, scrabbling over the tip, no ticklish spot went untouched but thankfully Smiley stopped tickling her after this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiley grinned \"now wasn't that fun?\". <br>\r\nBut before mouse could respond the Door burst open and standing there was...</span></div></div>",

At both ends of the table there was a pair of fluffy handcuffs. Smiley moved to lift up her top but mouse intervened. \"I'll do it myself\" she blushed as she lifted up her t-shirt to reveal a bright yellow bra and then lowered her skirt to reveal a pair of matching underwear. She threw the clothes over to where Smiley had put her shoes. The hard stone floor was cold to her already sensitive feet which she feared - and hoped -  would make her even more sensitive to the clown princes hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-d-do I really have to do this?\" she asked feigning a tremor of fear in her voice, without any answer Smiley picked her up and placed her on her back. Smiley straddled her to ensure she couldn't escape as she stretched Mouse's right arm up to the handcuffs and slowly closed them on her wrist, signalling her loss of freedom and the clown princes control of her. Smiley repeated this with her left arm, Smiley then moved down to Mouse's feet. She grabbed her right ankle and moved it to the corner of the table and closed the handcuff. She repeated this with her left leg leaving Mouse tied spread-eagle to the table. Her body was stretched to its limit and Mouse had never felt more vulnerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think I should gauge your ticklishness first\" the clown prince mused \"but where shall I begin?\"</span></div></div>",

An index finger pointed to a chair next to the wall made Smiley rush over, falling over her own feet over the bear-skin of an ice bear in her effort to act as quickly as she could. Mouse could not help but laugh at this piece of slapstick. The Clown Prince smiled approvingly. He sat down when the chair was finally brought over. Now he had Mouse's feet at his mercy while resting comfortably. He first took in a close up of the beautiful little feet of the tied young girl. But when he approached them he would have wrinkled his nose, which he could not because a red nose made of plastic sat in this place. \"Mouse, your little feet stink. They need some cleanup.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiley's eyes brightened with excitement. She rushed to the door of the room, stumbled in full flight over the same bear-skin before she left the room. Mouse laughed again. It remembered her of something she had seen on tv before, but she could not identify it. Smiley came back rushing through the door with a red bucket which happily spilled water over the edge, and a bag, aiming for the same bear-skin again. Mouse flinched when the clumsy clown girl reached the rug, expecting the whole freight to distribute through the room. But Smiley hopped over the rug, causing the cuffed little girl to scream with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slightly wet clown girl abruptly stopped next to the rack. The bucket was dropped to the floor below the rack. Four hand rummaged through the bag until two brushes emerged. Mouse raised her head as much as she could but she could not see what was happening. She just heard something being dropped into water and pulled out again, with many water drops falling back into the bucket. Her feet would be treated with something. A sudden shout of \"no\" made Smiley freeze. Confused she looked at the Clown Prince, who shook his head. \"Wrong order.\" His fingers again dived into the bag and produced a sponge. The clown girl's eyes went big in understanding. She also took a sponge from the bag. Again the water dribbling into the bucket could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds after Mouse shrieked from the first contact of two soft and wet items with her feet, but relaxed immediately after when the soft sponges glided over her feet. This felt really good for the tied girl. Over and over the sponges soaked the girl's feet. Dragging them over her arches and her insteps made her purr with pleasure. Her body started to grind into the rack. Realizing this the Clown Prince decided that</span></div></div>",

From below the Clown Prince and Smiley raised their arms with washclothes in the look of Kermit and Miss Piggy. \"Hey look at those feet\" \"Yeah what\" it started. Mouse squealed in delight when they spoke about her feet, took soap into their \"mouth\" and teasingly played with the little girl feet. She screeched when they \"bit\" into her foot. Suddenly Kermit called Miss Piggy over and whispered. \"I have to tell you a secret.\" \"Wow a secret\" The Clown Prince chuckled when he watched Mouse eagerly raise her head and try to learn the secret as well. \"You have ten little sisters\" An outraged Miss Piggy claimed that she was unique and surely did not have ten sisters. But Kermit showed her the sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little piggy went to market\" he began, tracing his finger around the wet big toe, making Mouse laugh crazily. \"This little piggy stayed home\" made her shake her head wildly. \"And this little piggy went crying all the way to town\" was accompanied by a hard scribbling of the bare fingers of the clown prince. Poor Mouse screamed \"noooooooaaaaahhh\" and pushed her butt upwards to somehow escape the tickling. Miss Piggy was delighted and asked that her sisters are shown to her again. After a few repetitions she asked where the other five sisters would be. Mouse pleaded for mercy, but Kermit did not refrain from presenting the other five piggies over and over again. The duet performed by all ten sisters made her laugh so hard that her stomach began to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the short break Mouse was given<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wiggled a finger as she moved her hand slowly to Mouse's right armpit. Mouse closed her eyes and tensed as she waited for the clown prince to make contact. The clown prince slowly dragged her finger down Mouse's armpit causing her to flinch and giggle. The clown prince repeated the stroke again causing Mouse to giggle. <br>\r\n\"Your armpits are definitely sensitive\" the clown prince observed, without warning she sent all of her fingers into Mouse's armpits causing Mouse to scream from the shock. The clown prince continued to scribble her fingers in Mouse's hollows. All Mouse could do was clench her fingers and laugh. \"Ha-ha-ha - please - Ha-ha-hah no!\" she screamed. The clown prince complied with her request. \"Very well, I'll move onto the next area\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown prince got up onto the table and sat on Mouse legs. As before she took one of her fingers and slowly moved it towards Mouse's ribs. She placed her finger at the top of Mouses ribs and dragged it down, counting each rib aloud as she went. This knocked the wind out of Mouse and sent her into hysterics. \"You certainly are ticklish here\" She teased and immediately sent all her fingers into Mouses ribs, scribbling up and town alternating between random fast-paced strokes and slow movements. The unpredictable nature of the princes assault drove Mouse mad. One minute she was screaming her head of as the prices fingers probed and prodded every area of her ribs, the next she was giggling as the prince methodically stroked up and down. As Mouse struggled to keep up she was objected to a new feeling. One of the princes fingers had found its way into her bellybutton, the prince wiggled it around. Coupled with the assault on her ribs Mouse was being pushed to her limits. \"P-P-Ple - Hahahaha\" \"Aw whats wrong Mousey, does that tickle?\" the clown prince teased \"I've had enough here. I don't want to completely wear you out before we begin the experiments\" Mouse gulped, she liked to be tickled but she wasn't sure whether she could take more of this. She was going to find out though as the prince stepped of the table and knelt down so she was facing Mouse's soles. She examined the the creamy soles, in anticipation Mouse had scrunched her toes, causing her soles to wrinkle. \"I'm going to enjoy this\" the clown prince declared, secretly Mouse hoped she would as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse was expecting the prince to start of with just a single finger but instead the prince grabbed the toes on Mouses right foot and pulled them back leaving her right foot completely exposed. Then the clown prince drove her remaining hand into the space that had just been exposed. It was at this moment that Mouse longed for the slow playful tickling she had received from Smiley. The clown prince knew exactly where to tickle and how to do it, Mouse was rapidly approaching her limit. The clown prince let go of Mouse's toes and began a two handed assault on her soles. Mouse didn't have time to brace herself and let out a scream followed by a crescendo of laughs. \"Hahahahaha, p-p-p-ple-please slow down\" Mouse gasped \"Ok, I'll give you a break from my fingers\" the clown prince replied. Then she ducked down from out of Mouse's view leaving Mouse completely unprepared for the princes next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt a warm wet object climb from her heal to her toes, opening her to a world of tickling she had never even dreamed of. \"Whats that she?\" she exclaimed. She didn't need to prince to answer as she came back into Mouse's view. The prince stretched her tongue slowly to Mouse's big toe, planting it on the underside of her toe and dragged it across, making sure to get every toe. It looked like the prince enjoyed it, but for Mouse it was excruciating. \"I haven't had the chance to do that for a while\" the prince beamed. \"Now Smiley would you...\"</span></div></div>",

Smiley grinned and nodded before she turned around and started to spider her fingers all over Mouse's little feet, Mouse burst out laughing and said between laughs \"Hahaheeelllpppmmeeesssuuummmeeerrrrhahahahaha\". Summer looked over to her sister then to the Clown Prince who was advancing toward her as she tried to think of a plan, Summer started to step back as the Clown Prince continued to step forward toward her then when the Clown Prince got impatient of this he started running toward Summer. Summer took this sudden change of speed to her advantage, when the Clown Prince got close to her she ducked and swung her foot around underneath the Clown Prince's feet tripping him. Summer ran around the Clown Prince and towards Smiley who was still torturing Mouse, Summer decided the best way to get Smiley away from her sister was to tickle her to. Summer came up behind Smiley and started tickling her sides, Smiley stopped tickling Mouse and started laughing herself then Summer ran Smiley into the Clown Prince who had just gotten up and knocked him down again with Smiley. Summer quickly untied her sister, took off the blindfold and took Mouse in her arms and Summer began running deeper into the mansion since the Clown Prince and Smiley were blocking the front door. Summer ran down some long corridors with the Clown Prince and Smiley following suite until she reached a new room with some stairs leading higher up into the mansion, she quickly closed the door behind her and started running up the stairs unsure of where it would lead them. At the top of the stairs Summer found a dark room with no light switch and quickly ran inside, she used her phone as a light and she found a closet, \"Mouse get inside this closet\" Summer said quietly to her little sister, \"what about you?\" Mouse asked. Summer smiled and said \"don't worry about me, I'm going to draw them away from you and try to lose them farther in the mansion then when I have lost them I will come back and get you.\" Before Mouse could say anything else Summer closed the closet doors and turned off her light as she peeked out the doorway to the hall, she didn't see any sign of the Clown Prince or Smiley, \"Where did they go\" Summer wondered. As Summer stepped out of the room she heard a voice coming from a room farther down the hall, it sounded like Smiley's voice so Summer tiptoed down the hallway until she came to the door the sound was coming from then she peered through the keyhole and saw Smiley.</span></div></div>",

It was only then that Mouse saw that she wasn't much taller than herself and she was Summers age. That was probably reason why other kids teased her. \"So how can I help you? You want someone kidnapped, tortured, killed? You want a giant mech?

It was Pao-Ting Underarm tickle torture device #15, one of her favorite due to its slow motion and pure 'fluffiness'. Two red feathers emerged from the suitcase, driven on two tiny hovercraft that resembled hands holding the feather. They approached, slowly, teasingly, torturous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse couldn't bare the suspense. If they were going to tickle her let them do it, but at least do it how it should be. She wasn't so confident about herself when first feather touched her underarm and started to twirl around. At that moment Susan Salt A.k.a. Mouse stopped existing in her mind and concentrated on the torture that was applied on her. Slowly the feather dragged its silky construction over her armpit, going up and down, making her giggle in cute girlish way, grinning each time even wider, until she couldn't withstand it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Please hahaha I am begging you hahaha Ping-Ting stop! No haha no more!\" she begged as the feather pace started to increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name is Pao-Ting!

The padded bench she was lying on extended from her head down to her rear end.

A few seconds later, Pao-Ting entered Mouse\u2019s field of view. She looked Mouse up and down, slowly making her way to a chest sitting a few feet away from Mouse\u2019s trapped feet. Pao-Ting sported a look of curious interest as she sat down on the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Mouse,\u201d Pao-Ting began with a slight smirk on her face. \u201cI know that wherever that brat Summer goes, you are sure to follow.

Her skinny body was only clad in a skimpy training bra and yellow Spongebob panties. Then she felt a further strap securing her body around the hipbones, pinning it to the bench. Her legs were in the air with her feet resting in stocks, but she could not even wiggle them any more. \"Please let me go. I will be got. I will call my sister. Really I willl...AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGHHH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH GOOOOOOOOOOOODSTOP OH NO OH NO TAHAHAHAHA BOOOOOOOHOOOOOO AHAHAHA they tickle like helll MERCY!\" She only felt a few hairy items gently get in contact with her shin just below the knee. Mouse tried to kick her leg to make the animal fall but could not move it. Too many legs they were, slowly testing the new underground and steadying. The moved slowly but the may hairs and the tiny feet of the animal which gently pinched the poor girl's skin to hold tight drove her nuts.

She couldn\u2019t help but smile as she closed the lid to the chest and walked around to Mouse\u2019s prone form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re as gifted as I am, having advanced knowledge in several fields is child\u2019s play. Some of my more useful skills include engineering, electronics and\u2026\u201d Pao-Ting opened up her makeup kit, grinning wickedly. \u201cChemistry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the makeup brush and started swirling it about in the special substance. Once completed, she brought the brush up to the light, revealing it to be covered in a fine red powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis particular substance has proven to be quiet useful, especially on unmotivated underlings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao kneeled down in front of Mouse\u2019s right foot. Putting down the makeup kit, she held her foot steady while softly brushing the powder on her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse started giggling and pulling at her bonds. She tried closing her eyes, burying her face in her arm, and thinking of something else, anything, but the tickling sensation dominated her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao started in on Mouse\u2019s toes. As the soft brush flurried up and down and in-between, full blown laughter began to intersperse with Mouse\u2019s giggles.  Although the tickling was considerable, it actually wasn\u2019t as bad as Mouse had expected. Mouse\u2019s laugher slowly died down after Pao had stopped tickling her and put down her makeup brush. Mouse\u2019s right foot was a bright shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mouse had caught her breath, she looked at Pao-Ting. She had expected her to start questioning her again. Instead, with a sly grin on her face, she bent down and slowly blew on her newly powdered foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was devastating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse threw her head back and laughed at the top of her lungs. It felt like a million microscopic feathers were washing over her foot. She could not have conceived of anyone being this ticklish, even herself. As she was fighting to pull in another breath, Pao had finished her demonstration. Pao straitened up and waited for Mouse\u2019s laughter to die down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you have felt the effect of my substance, is there anything you have to tell me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse burst out with desperate pleading. \u201cPlease! I swear I don\u2019t know anything! I have no idea where Summer is! You have to believe me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting developed a look of detached indifference and made her way back to the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. If you continue to show me resistance and non-cooperation, you shall suffer the consequences.\u201d Pao bent down into the chest and retrieved a special item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe item in question was a small fan. It was about four inches in diameter and was battery operated. The base could be extended to raise the fan up to five feet off the ground. And it was just one of a dozen similar fans nestled within the confines of the chest. She walked back over to Mouse\u2019s newly sensitized right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is how it\u2019s going to work\u201d Pao explained. \u201cFor the next indeterminate period of time, I am going to increase the amount of ticklish torture your sweet little body will experience. Now, at <b>any</b> time, you can end it all and tell me where your sister is. Let\u2019s begin\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse\u2019s pleas fell on deaf ears as Pao set up the fan six inches away from her right foot. Once Pao turned the fan to the low setting, Mouse\u2019s pleas turned to girlish screams of laughter. As Mouse pulled futilely on her restraints, Pao-Ting picked up her makeup kit and brush. She let the torturously forced laughter drown out into the background as she thought of where to apply her special makeup next.</span></div></div>",

Her voice hard turned hoarse some time ago, and she was silently laughing and shaking while the tears which had been running down in small rivers had already dried up. Whether she had actually known where Summer was, or had been maybe just before, she had actually forgotten. The ordeal she had gone through caused her to hyperventilate, pass out, and finally to invent possible place of Summer's location just to stop the unbearable tickling. But Pao-Ting had not stopped, only sending some underlings to check the locations and increasing the torment once the negative results came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting had spent quite a lot of the makeup powder, which she found astonishing as the result of just a little of this substance along with a slight breeze brought a hellish tickling to the skin. Meanwhile, most sensitive parts of her body were covered by the red substance. It was applied to both feet, her inner thighs much to Mouse's dismay, her hips, sides, belly and bellybutton, ribcage, armpits and underarms. Pao-Ting had most fans now applied around the little girl, turning them on and off one by one or in groups, creating various scenarios of pleading, squirming and rattling of the bonds. She had poured the girl repeatedly water to keep her hydrated. This was thankfully received by Mouse, but the girl meanwhile had a growing urge to go to the loo, but this was obviously not possible. This added torture to the tickling, as she kept tightening her lower belly muscles. She had pleaded to be allowed to go around the corner, even volunteered to return and get tickled further, but Pao-Ting had insisted that she first had to provide enough information to get Summer arrested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the brush circled dangerously just above Mouse's nose. Pao-Ting smiled from just behind the brush, and teased Mouse \"Oh oh. Now your mousey nosey will itch sooo bad. That is from sticking it always in affairs that are not your business, while failing to sniff where Summer is\". The little girl threw her head from right to left and back and begged \"Noooooooo not there. I cannot touch it. And if I inhale the powder, it will tickle from the inside oooooooh\". Pao-Ting took the ridiculous idea idea further and whispered \"Yes, that it will do, and you will never be able to remove it. So keep your head level and do not move a bit, only then you will be safe.\" Mouse put her head straight and said \"Please be careful\". Again she felt the horrible brush spreading the powder over her, this time her tiny nose. It started to itch terribly after Pao-Ting blew some air, and she tried to scream but little was heared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After using all her charm she convinced them to give her a lift there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus the young Mouse arrived at back door of Featherton House in all her glory, backed by police sirens. Summer and Jamie were holding their foreheads when they saw her arrival. She should have just told Clown Prince that we were coming, thought Summer as she boiled with rage. She and Jamie were waiting for Chris in bushes for about an hour without revealing themselves and now Mouse arrives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HI SUMMER!\" Mouse yelled across the backyard. If Clown prince didn't hear the sirens, he most certainly heard that. At this point Summer was looking at her feet with most depressing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should just go inside and let him capture and tickle me now.\" she said to herself, letting Jamie hear her faintly. She tried the deep breath relaxing technique she learned, but unfortunately when she was inhaling Mouse pounced on her, taking all air out of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took few moments for Summer to recover, but when she did come back from slumber land she was more determined than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... considering that Mouse announced our arrival here we should carefully sneak in.

Before she could even comprehend what happened she found herself in white smoke, oblivious of what will happen next. First she felt a faint tickling on her bare skin, then a medium itch that grew and grew. By the end of first minute she was on the ground scratching and howling with both laughter and discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It itches so much!\" She yelled toward Summers direction just to see that both her and Jamie were in same position. The three of them were howling with laughter, scratching furiously, ignoring their surrounding. If they had anymore concentration they would notice three clown girls standing beside them, enjoying the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we take them into custody girls?\" one of girls asked, while others nodded. In a instance Mouse found herself in a big bag, only her feet sticking outside. She didn't know how much time has passed, nor when the itching stopped, but she was glad she had some time to digest her first part of dinner. Her belly still had room for more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she was thrown out of the bag and quickly tied to a whirl o' car beside Summer. Jamie was on Summers other side, looking with a killer look at clown teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do now girls?\" one of clown girls, with a extra wide smile asked.</span></div></div>",

He remembered the first time they tickled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe had just ended one of their cases and they were relaxing in Summer's room, they were all sitting around when Mouse had asked, \"What do you think the Clown Prince does to people.  There is no way he could make them laugh with his creepy face.\"  \"Ya he probably tickles them.\" said Chris.  At that Summer realizes that they had never tickled Jamie.\"You know Jamie you did enter this group last right, well there's something we never found out about you.\" she said when suddenly all of the girls faces lit up and they all stared at him with a sinister look.  \"Oh ya what would that be?\" asked Jamie.  Summer slowly moved closer to him eying which spot she should tickle first she saw that his feet were bare but decided to leave those since Chris usually likes to go for the feet and she knew that Mouse thinks that everyones tickle spots were under the arms, but Summer knew better, she also knew that different people feel the tickling effects more when you tickle them slow and lazily than fast and hard.  When she finally got to him the young blond said,\" We never found out how ticklish you are.\" and with that tickled his stomach with really fast light tickling motions.  \"Whahahathahahahahasthahahasthahahaophahahapleahahahasehahahah.\"  giggled Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh you are ticklish, lets find out how ticklish you are.\" said the blond sleuth, Jamie didn't really mind being tickled by Summer since he liked her but when Chris and Mouse joined he started to get scared.  Before Summer could start on him again she let Chris start him out with a nice tease while Mouse and Summer held him down.  \"This little piggy went to the market, this little piggy stayed home, this little piggy had roast beef, and this little piggy...\" said Chris looking in Jamie's eyes to see the fear and it slowly turn into a smile just from the anticipation. \"went weeweewee all the way home.\" when she said that she sent all of her fingers down his foot and Jamie burst into laughter unable to control himself.  Then Mouse rushed in and tickled under his arms, he was held down by both of these girls and tickled him at the same time.  Then Summer started to pull up his shirt to his neck and started to slowly tickle his belly with her finger nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NohahahahahahahittiheheheeheheheehckleshahahahahahahahehehIhehehehecaha ha<br>\r\nhacahahahahan'thahahatahehehehehekeheheheanyhehehehehmorehahahaha.\"  screamed Jamie, with all three girls tickling him at three different spots and at three different speeds he didn't know how much he could take, luckily for him that hadn't got his worst spot.  \"Wow, you're really ticklish, we've all been tickled by 5 people, it's a long story, but anyways you're more ticklish than we are and I bet we haven't even found your weak spot yet.  Cootchie Cootchie coo, I'll bet if I start looking around I'll find it, isn't that right.\" Summer teased.  Later on Jamie realized that no one was better at teasing than Summer, also no one was better at tickling than her, or even finding where he was ticklish, she found it in her first try.  She quickly tickled under his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaheheheheeheheheheheheheheheeheheheheheehhehehehehehehehehehehehe&lt; br /&gt;\r\nheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheehehehehehe.\" ;<br>\r\nIt tickled him so much that he couldn't speak.  \"I had a feeling that this was your spot, I bet it tickles more than if you had 15 people tickling every other spot.  Come on keep that cute giggle up.\" Summer said.  For some reason Jamie was more attracted to her then than he was before, then they found out that they had made him wet his pants and stopped tickling him.  he didn't realize what happened to him until he saw all three of the girls giggling at him and looking at his wet spot on his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point on the girls tickled any part of his body they could and would send him into ticklish agony.</span></div></div>",

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s night-time, and thanks to her dark shades (worn mostly for effect), she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make much more than that.  She has no idea how long she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been in this predicament, but she awakens to the fact that her cries are silenced by something cottony wedged into her mouth, and several strips of tape keep it tightly in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heart pounding, Jamie takes stock of her situation.   She is still in her sleuthing coat and gloves (though her fedora has gone missing) dark glasses (part of the reason she walked right into the Clown Prince in the woods), and she still has her sock and shoe on her left foot, though her right foot is bare (and chilly).   She is tied from her ankles to her shoulders with rope that winds tightly around her body.  Her arms are trapped at her sides, and wiggling only causes her to sway the line.  She can feel some of her equipment still in her coat, though.  Her flashlight digs into her right ribs (thanks to the rope bindings), her magnifying glass is somehow still in the pocket of the matching tan top she wears with her Nancy Drew-like dress.  With any luck, her scissors might still be in the buttoned left-side pocket of her overcoat!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as she desperately begins fighting her bindings in earnest, in an attempt to reach the pocket that might still hold the scissors she brought, Jamie suddenly feels the slightest of fingernail tracings around the outer edges of the sole of her right foot!  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMrgmph!  Grrmph!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, she replies as her body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involuntary quivering in response to the tickling has her spinning and joggling around in place.  Looking up at her bound ankles, she is alarmed to see the same frightening-looking character she ran into in the woods, leering down at her menacingly while his long black polished fingernail ever-so-slowly works it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way down around her heel, does a quick little curly-cue, and then slowly winds up along the inner edge of her sole, which sends Jamie into a total spastic conniption, wobbling around above the pool like some fish caught on a line by it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail.  She is now screeching behind the gag, but it is mostly muffled by the wadded something in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, she sees several of her sleuthing friends, down below, looking and pointing in amazement, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere she is!  Up there!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, she hears Mouse yelp in her tiny voice.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShhh!  Quiet everybody!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, warns Summer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt could be a trap!\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop Chris, the lone boy in their secret club, from shouting up at the glowering clown, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey!  You!  Let her GO!\u00e2\u0080\u009d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jamie feels the rope suddenly drop her several inches down, jarring her and paralyzing her with fear.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean like this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, laughs the hideously grinning clown, which causes all the kids below to scream in unison.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow that I have your attention children\u00e2\u0080\u009d, says the Clown Prince, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour little friend shall remain here, dangling from this balcony, while you make your way through the winding passages and corridors of Featherton Manor.  I will leave you little clues as to the right path, so that you can come upstairs and perhaps save her from a headfirst dunk into the drink, so to speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he scowls down at the dumbfounded kids below, the fiend begins untying Jamie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remaining shoe, causing her to wiggle and squeal anew in anticipation of his devious machinations.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to hurry, kiddies.  Jamie here is the catch of the day - or night in this case - and just the sort of tickly lil\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fish I love to have wiggling on the line!  But beware!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve placed tricks and traps galore to keep you occupied while I have my fun with these ticklish tootsies!  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be waiting for you.  Right Jamie\u00e2\u0080\u0099wamie? Hahahaha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and the horrid clown returns to his tactical ministrations, which again sends Jamie into hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After yelling and screaming at the evil clown from below only seems to make him tickle chortling Jamie more, Summer is then heard to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf only we could pick the lock on that back door with the tool-set we brought!  Oh, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll we <i>do</i> to save Jamie from that terrible man?  Think, everybody!\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, wails Chris, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe already tried the windows and the cellar door!  I don't know what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the cruel clown reaches a sort of tickling crescendo on the out-of-breath Jamie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet, he then says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere you go, kiddies, a present from me to you.  Is it only a shoe, or perhaps another clue?  Hahahaha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and the Clown Prince takes a moment from tickling Jamie to toss her left shoe down to Chris, who catches it with ease.  Then the madman holds her sock up to his face and inhale deeply into it, as if it were some perfumed handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kids inspect the shoe, they find an ornate skeleton key! <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Usually she's just CIRCLING around one room in the mansion, like here...or sometimes heere...<br>\r\n\"Hey stop, that's tickling.\"<br>\r\nHe suddenly realized that he had cuffs around his ankles and wrists. When did THOSE get there?<br>\r\n\"Occassionally some enters through the front door, and he chases them like this...\"<br>\r\n\"PFFFehheehee.\"<br>\r\n\"Or they try to run up the stairs like this..\"<br>\r\nShe walked her index-and middle finger over Chris' sole who was yipping like  a hyena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now THESE here...are your friends. They entered the mansion through the front door...\"<br>\r\n\"Please! Not all three, I can't take it-<br>\r\nOh fmmmphffehihee\"<br>\r\n\"So they are walking around, looking in HERE, and HERE...And then HERE...\"<br>\r\nChris banged one fist on the table and was struggling to keep the other hand on his mouth.<br>\r\n\"But then Ms Featherton appears...\" she extended her index finger<br>\r\n\"and she comes at them like thiiiis...\" WEE tee hee!\"<br>\r\nand so when she's chasing them, and they're running in all directions..\"<br>\r\n\"Noplease!\"<br>\r\n\"and when the girls see that she's coming at them,<br>\r\nshe's coming here, they try to hide HEERE...\"<br>\r\nEvery time she said \"hiding HERE\" now, instead of just sliding her fingers all over Chris' skin, she was scratching the skin rapidly, probably to demonstrate how each kid (or finger) would be trying to dig themselves into a hiding place.<br>\r\n\"But when she's coming back, then they ran over here and try to hide like THIIIS...\"<br>\r\nAll three fingers were scratching Chris' sole in one place and he was going crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then Summer - that's your friend who's <i>this</i> finger- has the great idea that they should all go hide in the mausoleum...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh hell no!\" Chris didn't even need telling to know what was coming. As soon as he had heard the word \"mausoleum\", he instantly (and correctly) guessed that the target they were talking about was the underside of his toes.<br>\r\nShe could do nothing to stop the thorough demonstration of just how each girl was running over the mausoleum though..<br>\r\n\"But then something unexpected happens. Count Featherton...\"<br>\r\nShe took a fingerpick out of her pocket.<br>\r\n\"...who's a vampire...\"<br>\r\n\"This is #&amp;@ torture! I don't care what happens anymore, just let me go!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh sheesh, you're going to abandon your friends? We're almost done.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay...Okay...\" He tried to hold back his mirthful tears.<br>\r\nHe nearly had a heart attack when he felt just how much the pick on his sole tickled though - and Count Featherton had a looong story to tell.<br>\r\n\"And then is when WE arrive, the clown girls. There's a lot of them and all of them are very sweet but very effective...<br>\r\nThey are like little---soft...bristles...\" Chris meowed like a cat (\"Nnnyeh! Nyuuh! Mmmmeeeyihee!\") when he realized a new tool was used, feathers between the toes on both feet.<br>\r\n\"And they search the mausoleum, like they search it <i>very</i> thoroughly...\"<br>\r\n\"Nou-nouooohohohohohOwwuuhooo!\"<br>\r\n\"Like: have you seen them here? Noo...And here? Noo...And then they go back to search the <i>mansion</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris felt like he was dying. Please, ahaha, please, haha, don't go back on the sole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where - tee hee - well, we capture them and tickle them to death. You know? Like I'm doing to you? Right? Right? Hehehee.

That second front is all kinds of fun''<br>\r\nButter flips the giggling Chris over with ease while lifting him up to make room for herself. The clown girl then slips her voluptuous rear onto the bench so that poor Chris's hands were trapped under it and between the latter. Looking at his T-shirt she frowns before rubbing the boys stomach causing him to squirm in her grasp.<br>\r\n'' Let's see a little more skin for the next lesson my precious little victim.''<br>\r\nButter reached down for Chris's shirt.The poor giggly little boy to squirm with the last of his strength though trying to stop the bad time he sensed coming.

''Got you girl'' responded the smaller of the fiendish duo.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream ran her index finger up Chris's left foot causing the boy to stiffen up and gasp.<br>\r\n'' Sir Featherton kept his steady while they made some moves behind the scenes.''<br>\r\nCream grasped her poor little students left baby toe between her index finger and thumb using her long red nails to dig in slightly to his poor unfortunate flesh.<br>\r\n'' His troops were a little unruly but they were kept in check by threats pretty easily. Learning the lessons of history here.''<br>\r\nChris gulped and nodded his which caused Butter to giggle and pet his head.<br>\r\n'' Poor baby your friends are around somewhere right? Don't worry maybe while your laughing at all this totally real history they'll hear you! Then they come try to help and they can learn some fun new things with you! Than we'll take you all to the clown prince who'll just thrilled to bits.''<br>\r\nShe tapped Chris on the nose causing him to flinch and giggle a bit.<br>\r\n''OHHH YOU ARE JUST TOO CUTE! Hopefully he'll let us keep you. Maybe one or two of the others in here too. Then we can just a find a place where you can put your feet up together and laugh...I mean learn.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'' So with that in mind you gonna keep being like a little worm or are you gonna be good for Butter and Cream?''<br>\r\nTo punctuate her partners threat Butter wiggled Chris's poor captive toe.

He really wished he wasn't such a trusting person.<br>\r\n'' Good boy.''<br>\r\nCream reached down and pulled her new amusements shirt up to his ribs.<br>\r\n''So Sir Featherton knew what he wanted. However he knew to look around before moving.''<br>\r\nShe circled her finger around his belly button before dipping it in giving a twist <br>\r\n'' Pleahahahase nohohohho mohohore.''<br>\r\n'' Those that don't remember history are doomed to repeat it cutie. So they set up two little advance bases.Of course they scouted before taking those peaks. Right by the way they were mountains.''<br>\r\nShe pulled her new maps shirt up further to reveal yet more territory Chris feared he'd picked up on where the base were and with his face reddening and the tears tarting to stream. He was really afraid that he knew where they were setting up shop. As he felt the scouts circling around his left nipple his fears were proven right.''<br>\r\n'' IHAHA DOHOHN'T REMEMBER THIS FROM HISTORY AT AHAHALLHAH.''<br>\r\n'' Sweetie I said spies. They were good at there job then. So just try to breath in some air and information.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little pinch at each peak Chris felt that they were approaching the point of no return. He had a sinking feeling that this break he was being offered was his last chance so he breathed in deep and tried the last thing he had in his arsenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'' <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">HHHAAAAAALLLLLPPPPPP PLEAHASSEE SOMEONE HELP ME! ANYONE!!</font>''<br>\r\n'' That was a bad choice honey. Nobodies coming who would want to help you. That break of yours is over and the time for visual aids is over. Butter? The troops are restless.''<br>\r\nAs the one fiend at our young friends feet flicked on the sole torturing device at his right. Chris's explosive laughter was slightly as his new teacher pulled his shirt up over his head and pushed forward with her scouts exploration of his previously unexplored armpit hollows.<br>\r\n'' So we're done then? I'll just have some fun. We'll add a lesson later when you wake up baby''<br>\r\nOnce more returning to his poor previously unexplored left Cream held her favorite former captive baby toe still before landing a quick peck on it leaving a red lipstick mark before starting a full assault on Chris's poor tootsies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'' NOHOHOHOHOHOH PPLEAHAHASESESE.''<br>\r\n''Shhhh''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris felt something shoved in his mouth through his shirt as the parts around his vision started to go black he thought he heard footsteps.</span></div></div>",

Judging by the way that Butter left him to Cream's ministrations they did too. It was too late though for him though as he passed out beneath his tormentors toe tweaking torturous tenacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''He's waking up!. Summer he's waking up!'' ''Thank goodness I don't know how much longer we could have dragged him along behind us like that. For such a little guy he weighs a ton.'' <br>\r\nChris opened his eyes to the welcome sight of Jamie and Summer his friend and crush respectively. The also way more welcome sensation of his not getting his brains tickled out.<br>\r\n''Muh..hah..where?'' <br>\r\n''Man I don't know how long they had you there Chris but we're gonna need you to wake up in a hurry there little guy. We didn't really get to put a lot of distance between us and your new girlfriends.''<br>\r\nChris's eyes widened and he started to squirm before he broke back down into a fit of coughing and giggling.<br>\r\n''Leave him be Jamie he went through alot.'' <br>\r\nThe somewhat taller boy scoffed but lightened a little. Despite his so-called rivalry with Chris the two of them were friends before they met Summer and had more or less continued on with that after meeting the Salt's. He ran his fingers through his dark black hair and looked at Chris the boy's face still quite pink despite his nap. He felt pity but also fear as he had no idea what he'd do if the Clown Prince or any of his tickle crazed gang of loonies got their hands on his unbearably ticklish pale skin. The bright red status of his small freinds feet had caused him quite a start after their plan had lured his <br>\r\n''Ohh..that was the worst...thank you...so much.'' the former victim said slowly regaining his breath.<br>\r\nWe're not out of the woods yet Chris. We've still gotta find Mouse before we've got even a chance at starting to figure out a way to deal with the Crown prince.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris slowly and shakily made his way to his feet while his blond haired crush and best friend argued unfortunately neglecting to pass info to the damsel they'd rescued. Chris tried to take a step forward, quickly found he couldn't then gravity took over dropping him once more back to the ground on his face.<br>\r\n'' Ahhhh! Chris take it easy! We did our best and managed to smash you out of the hand cuffs your ankle-cuffs though seem to be some tougher stuff.''<br>\r\nJamie bent over to help Chris up with an offered shoulder to grab onto but also gesturing at the freedom blockers locked on his formerly and fiendishly played with feets.<br>\r\n''We spent a good bit looking for you but after seeing a few of those clown's stalking about and having their way with a few unlucky girls who clearly worked for Pao-Ting'.' <br>\r\nAt this Chris swallowed hard and paled drawing notice from the girl detective who stepped in.<br>\r\n''We realized we should keep it down. The whole place was quiet till we started to hear you screaming. How'd they get you?''<br>\r\n''Uhhh I asked them for directions. They said they'd draw me a map on my feet since I didn't have any paper.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl detective looked hard at the sweet summer child whose face was now rapidly reddening almost back to the shade it was when he was under the clown girl's ministration's.<br>\r\n''...It's probably for the best we found you first Chris. It could've gotten really bad for you if we hadn't''<br>\r\n''Thanks Summer you saved me from a fate worse than death. They just wouldn't stop. What happened to Mouse though?''<br>\r\n''She made a ruckus and ran off to get them chasing her so we could get to you.'' said Jaime. '' We were supposed to be meet up by the door but it was crawling with Pao-Ting's girl's. Plus we couldn't really go that fast with you weighing us down.''<br>\r\n''JAMIE he's been through enough from them. We don't need to start picking on him too.''<br>\r\n''Summer I didn't mean-''<br>\r\n''Just stop it. We need to find Mouse! I bet she's gone and gotten herself by now. The Clown Prince would tickle her way too much but Pao-Ting and her always did get along so she's probably either found her by now or is still trying too.

It'll be a million times faster if I handle this because no offense Chris you'd slow us down way too much.''<br>\r\nChris started to argue but knew deep down she was right and stopped himself.<br>\r\n'' Sorry Chris but you know it's true. If we get spotted there's no way you can go fast enough to get away and it wouldn't be right for us to leave you alone. Do you want to have them play with you again?''<br>\r\nOnce Chris went silent the girl detective having defeated him with things he didn't want to say.

We're friends and we need to look out for each other.''<br>\r\nAs Summer turned and left a sputtering Jamie in her wake something caught Chris's eye. A strange painting in the room seemingly a reproduction of the Mona Lisa but with a pair goosing her sides and her face twisted in accordance. However the eyes bothered Chris the most rather than being closed like was his natural reaction to such torment they open and despite the tears drawn coming down her face they seemed almost observant. The hands also seemed almost as if they were pushing through the canvas, He almost swore he could see the canvas stretching forward.</span></div></div>",

As a well manicured and unfortunately to the boy well known pair of hands dove in to his sides through the light cotton of his t-shirt.<br>\r\n''AHH JAHAHAHAMMIIIIEHEHEHEHEH HAHAHALLLPPP PLEA-''  the boy started to yell as he was once more plunged into a sea of tickles.<br>\r\n''Ohhh baby boy yes again. C'mon and give Sister a big ol' tickly hug. You can try to say your not loving these little pokes but I can feel you smiling through this GRRRMPH rather annoying painting. This is a bit harder without my nails CREAM, CHEESE HELP ME OUT HERE!<br>\r\nAs his former and now current tormentor resumed mining his tickly little sides for precious giggles, Jamie finally came running to try and pull his friend from his re-capture almost seconds after Summer turned her back on the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''CHRIS I'VE GOT YOU C'MON. JUST LEAN BACK!''<br>\r\nThrough bleary eyes Chris started to see Ten NO TWENTY brightly pointed-no painted nails(All though the former wasn't wrong) starting to poke their way through this portal to a horrific and ha-ha filled pokes, kisses and licks he had only narrowly escaped before. Jamie saw it though and with a twisting shove he freed his friend.''<br>\r\n'''Ahaha-hah-ohh thankthankthankthankyouuuu''<br>\r\nHowever much to Jamie's dismays his choice in a baggy shirt was a terrible choice. The newly freed and fiendish fingers had tangled themselves in his shirt and used it to pull him back just as the other hands up top tore away the painting and re-introduced the devilish Cream as well the new arrival the surprisingly large and disheveled looking clown girl Cheese who helped there sister Butter in reeling in the hapless Jamie and pulling him halfway through the painting as well as trap their prays arms in a rather familiar stratagem of pulling his shirt over his head as their digits danced down over ribs, belly, hollows and even in the newest girl Cheese's case an index and thumb slipped onto the peak of hipbones and sliding down the hero-quickly turned victims jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NAHAHAHSTAHAHAHAHPPPLEEEEHEHEHEHEAHAHAHAAAA'''<br>\r\nAs Jamie looked back breathing hard on the split second heroism turned feeding frenzy he immediately moved to try help his friend and rival. However a fiendish glance from Cream who who locked eyes with him stopped him in his tracks. She was amazing at this not even looking up from her one hand stroking with little scratches in Jamies armpit she wrapped her other hand to beak at his weakest point. The outie  belly button that had plagued Jamie so much in their childhood tickle fights before his growth spurt had tipped the scales towards Chris's poor tootsies always ending up soles at the skies with Jamie doing math problems on them with a marker. (He always showed his work by the way. The boy was deceptively smart. If not particularly clever.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''C'mon honey cut out some running so that the mani-pedi we're planning for you two little sleuths won't be too bad. Just wait right there and we'll be there to collect cutie. Just let us pull our boy here through and we'll be right on over.''<br>\r\nShe was right...she was ready and waiting for him. The second he put a hand towards Chris she'd grabs his hand and show him a whole new world...of Brushes, Feathers and Raspberries. Even if he did give in and run Chris's cuffed ankles would prevent him from getting too far from his surprisingly determined torturers.before they picked him like a sack of potatoes and brought him back....for some kind of potato based tickling metaphor (Instead of peeling he'd be feeling! Ha?!)<br>\r\n''Uhhh I-I-but Jamie-but-but..''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it him. Maybe it was all the time with Summer trying to show off how he was just as good a detective as her. Or at least enough of one to not be a burden. He realized as a flash of discomfort broke on Creams face disrupting her sinister glare that neither of the Clown Girls was coming any further out of the painting. They were all trying to pull Jamie through and to his credit despite his agony he'd planted his on the other side of the wall and was keeping his legs straight so as to keep himself from being consumed by clowns. They were stuck! Butter,Cream and the new entrant Cheese had all tried to pile through on top of Jamie and had wedged themselves into the frame. Cheese's large frame was taking up more than enough of the size, Enough Chris hypothesized that if he'd manage to pull his hero free he'd continue on saving him and carry him to safety while the painting punishers panicked, hopefully enough to put some good distance between the duo and this trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe though if he'd started now the quagmire that had formed there plus the longing gazes Butter was still giving towards Jamies skechers clad feet would hold them long enough for him to make enough of a distance between them for him to hide at least. It wasn't a proud thing for him to do. And it filled his stomach with disgust. He was his freind~! He'd saved him before and to pay him back by leaving him as a distraction....He'd do exactly what Jamie had done to Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForget it! He was gonna save Jamie regardless of what happened! He'd been at the fingertips of two clown girls he wouldn't wish it on anyone. He was gonna save Jamie! As he jumped forward and wrapped his hands around Jamie's waist he saw Cream's hand reach forward at him...</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds they realized what it was in horror as Cheese slowly looked up at them groggily at first but soon a look that shot fear through both boys causing them to attempt to scrabble away on their hands and knees for safety. These boys last gasps at freedom were snuffed though as Butter reeled both boys in with grasping hands wrapped around fleeing ankles pulling them back to her. Chris tried to curl up out of fear of what was to come, Jamie though brought handfuls of carpet with him as they'd failed as handholds for the youngster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''AHAHHAHAHAHA JAAHAHAHAMEHEEE HAALLLP'' said Chris as Cheese pulled both boys up into sitting position on her lap once more. <br>\r\n''AHAHAH WHHAHAHAHATTTHA AHHMM SPOHHOOHSED TAA DOHOHHO''<br>\r\nCheese pulled both boys up with her still tweaking their sides as she walked towards a conveniently placed couch.

The two unfortunates were too busy giggling in their double dates grasp though to really voice their complaints the larger girls fingers digging into their sides.The boys continued to try and wiggle out of their tickly tormentors grasp but only succeeded in frustrating her to the point where she was having to focus more on holding the boys than tickling them...alot. Cheese was still sneaking in the occasional pinch or scratch on one boy but then the other would get a little further away from momma bear. Jamie was a strong boy who was decently in shape but the air was still out of him from the games that had been played with his mid-section on the way through the painting. Chris though small was putting up a good fight as well despite clearly getting the lions share of Cheese's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys were making progress at escaping her clutches though. Jamie took advantage of a particularly distracting rib count Cheese was giving Chris to try and make a break for it. Only to let out a pretty embarassing sound when Cheese switched it up to both hands and pulled him backwards across her lap. Than used one hand to hold his wrists above his head. He started in with some giggly begging when she lifted his shirt as he felt he had a pretty good idea of what was coming.<br>\r\n''Ehehehe nohoho pleeheehesehe.''<br>\r\n''Baby what're you saying please to big Cheese for? Is it this?''<br>\r\nCheese reached down Chris's cute little outie between her index and thumb then wiggled it abit.<br>\r\n''Was that the what you wanted? Your little switch their played with? Did it want attention?''<br>\r\n''Nohohohhoho dohohohnnn't.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris tried to use his friends guessing game to sneak some precious inches between him and his tormentors free hand. However Cheese grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and pulled him back close to give him a long lick up his little neck the weird sensations the older girl had given him causing to fall forward back into a giggling mess and allowing her to turn her attention back to poor Chris.<br>\r\n''Still didn't get it sweetie? Well then we'll try again my little handsome man. Maybe down here? Are your hips itchy? Lemme fish a little down there and see what we can catch?''<br>\r\nCheese slipped her fat index and middle finger under Jamie's waistband and started to feel around until she found her target. A pair of cute little hip bones.<br>\r\n''There they are. Found the buried treasure sweet child. Was that what you were asking me for? A little air down there? <br>\r\n''Nahahahahah pleahahah nahahaha mahahoooore.''<br>\r\n''More?! Baby you're a gluttuon for giggles. What is it you want then. Ooooh where's that cute little pair  trying to go?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris on his stomach at this point was trying to crawl away. Oa least abit further down the couch. That latest bid at freedom was ended thoughwhen Cheese grabbed his ankle cuffs and used them to pull the fleeing feets fondly toward flailing fiendish fingers.<br>\r\n''You trying to to get away? Oh honey these itty bitty toes of yours aren't going anywhere but a one trip to the cave of kitchies!''<br>\r\n''Wha-AHAHAHAHHANOHOHO GROHOHOSS STAHAHAPP SOHOHOH GROHOHHOSSS''<br>\r\nCheese had popped the poor boys little foot into her mouth and was giving each and every little toes and quicks little chew and slipping her tongue at the little stems while they were held there.<br>\r\n''NAHAHAHA THAHAHATT'S WROHOHOHNGNGNGN STHAHAHAP'' <br>\r\n After she went through each one forward and back she doubled back for some backwards to forwards. Once she'd finished her snack she dropped her spoils and didn't even notice as wracked with laughter, sputtering and crying Chris had rolled off the sofa to the ground however he quickly returned to once more trying to crawl away slowly. Though the one wet foot made sure he was trying much harder now to stay unnoticed. Cheese turned her attention to the meal on her lap, the Jiggly Jamie who was now turning quite pink in the face. <br>\r\n''I'VE GOT IT! Honey you're hungry? Is Cheesy's little man hungry? Mama Cheese knows just what you want.''<br>\r\n''Pl-pleahahse wh-whaha-whatever yo-yooho-ur gonna dohoh please do-''<br>\r\n''SOME RASPBERRY PIE!''<br>\r\nJamie's giggly pleas for mercy went on deaf ears but people in space might've heard the boisterous belly laugh that erupted out of the poor boy when wrapped her lips around his cute little and blew.<br>\r\n''PBBBBTBTBTBTBTBTBTBTBT''<br>\r\n'<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">GAHAHAGAHAHAHAHAHAHA</font>hehheahehaheh<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">GHAHAHAHHAHAH AGHA</font>nohohoh mohohre ple<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">EHEHAHAHAHAHAH</font><br>\r\nIn between horrific raspberries Jamie's begging was all Chris could hear in the room. He persevered and continued to try to sneak away inch by inch while Cheese was distracted. He hated looking back because more than big Cheese noticing his not-so-daring escape he feared Jamie would lock eyes with him. He'd have to ignore his friends begging eyes and continue on without him. Even the idea of it caused the small boy to add a few little tears to the corners of his eyes though they were on top of those that Cheese had already wrung out of him. After seeing her try to sneak her fingers down Jamie's jeans the escape was cemented in Chris's mind he couldn't risk her getting creative with his jeans. Especially after the hunger that seemed to have been added by her guessing game with Jamie. He was gonna make it. No mistake he'd come back for his friend but better he was in the wind planning than by Jamie's side in her grasp laughing. The small boy would get away and save them both... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought until he felt a flat on his back that made his heart sink into his stomach.<br>\r\nCream and Butter shook out the cobwebs they became less concerned with the quality of air and more with the hungry looks the two ticklers gave them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Butter?''<br>\r\n''Yes Cream?''<br>\r\n'' Remember those handcuffs we had for the little pet last time?''<br>\r\n'''The ones that were so rudely left behind?''<br>\r\n''Yes those cute little accessories that went so well with his eyes when they were filled with tears.''<br>\r\n''Don't you think they'd look great with our new cuties hair?''<br>\r\n''Your right Cream he'd be adorable with them. Good enough to eat...or maybe to savor a taste at least.''<br>\r\n''So I assume you want the young man? I'll be fine teaching the boy then.''<br>\r\n''Why yes Butter I'll be showing how life is hard but you can find laughs.''<br>\r\n''So my little runaway. We can do this easy or hard.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris froze up. He'd tried so hard to get away...<br>\r\n''Let's give him a hand Cream''<br>\r\nButter bent down and flipped over the poor boy before picking him up under his arms the boy honestly just too demoralized to resist at this point when Cream grabbed him by his shackled ankles and lifted along with Butter they carried their cute little sack of surrender over to Cheese who eventually had to stop to catch her breath after her marathon game of smooches with Chris's poor stomach. The older boy was bright red in the face at this point despite the obvious effort for the boy to even take in breaths at this point the first he noticed was how pale his little childhood friend was as the two clown girls handed him to Cheese who pulled him in hungrily and reassured her sisters that she'd more careful with her toy's.<br>\r\n''Uh-uh-uh sis they're OUR toy's you guilty girl. We'll all be playing with them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter in her wayward teddy bear Chris then forcing the poor, abused and bright red Jamie complete with a pronounced lipstick mark on his navel up so both boys were now back to back on her lap Cheese made a game out tweaking both boys ribs whenever they resisted and instructed them to do whatever her sisters wanted. Our victims tried to resist but after a few to rib tickles Jamie hung his head head and accepted his fate like Chris had seemed to be shocked into  Both clown girls settled themselves into the couch. Locking eyes with their intended victims they upped the humiliation with just a few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Gimme those pretty feets big boy. We'll get those pesky socks and shoes off then see what kind of fertile lands are ready for plundering.''<br>\r\n''Put your feet up here little boy they had a nice break and you had a nice run but now your back with Cream and those tootsies are my toys.''<br>\r\nStill panting and at this point still pretty pink in the face Jamie looked back to his friend looking for anything in his face, Trying to let him know that they'd be okay but the sheer lack of reaction from the boys face shook him. His face had still yet to change after the clowns had caught him crawling away. It'd broken the poor boy. He'd tried so hard to get away only to just be carried back like a toy for his ticklings and torment. Jamie didn't know what another round would do to the poor boy. Let alone what Butter would do to him at this point! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he heard something that made his skin crawl.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe it's time for that pedicure I heard you promise the little one. I think that'll help them relax. Hmm? How's that sound honey?''<br>\r\nBefore Jamie could properly voice his objections to this though he put into laughing wreck mode once more by Cheese who decided that after seeing how effective Raspberries were before why not stick with them and delivered one into the crook of Jamie's poor neck.<br>\r\n''WHAHAHAHA NAHAHAHA DOHOHOHN'T''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''See Butter I consider myself fluent in giggly and that was a firm go ahead. Heck he said those socks of his were abit itchy.''<br>\r\n''They are? Well baby if Butter can do anything for it's all you have to is ask. Bring those itchy gitchy feets on over and I'll help with the scritches. Cheese you mind getting us the tools? We'll take our turns to keep the boys entertained until then.''<br>\r\nCheese nodded while giving both a goodbye belly button goosing leaving both giggling quickly becoming a staple of her act. For Chris at least the tickles finally snapped the boy out of his fugue and back into this world of tickles he had tried to escape. Jamie would've been happy in any other case to see a smile return to his friends face even had applied by tickles as he had done it himself a few times. Right now the long scratches from Butter's painted nails going from heel to to ball and easily penetrating this boys thin cotton socks that was what was monopolizing his attention at this moment. Cream not wanting to be outdone had taken to picking at each of Chris's toes and pretending to inspect them before licking her thumb as if she was turning a page before dragging her up the poor boys sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were laughing their heads off almost in unison at this point. Butter was being rather aggressive with Jamie's feet snugly in her grasp however one thing was bothering the girl. These pesky little socks keeping her from new beau's bare tootsies which were just begging for torment. Those poor soles were begging her for torment just like how Jamie was begging her for to stop.<br>\r\n'''STAHAHAPP  NOHOHOHOHO MOHOHOHRHEHEHEHE''<br>\r\nHowever despite her best efforts each time she tried to remove them her prey blocked them with either a strategic toe crunch or one foot taking for team and blocking her tugs at his white little cotton shields. The annoyance was starting to build for her and Cream was starting to notice and she was the kind of girl who could never resist a chance to needle anyone.<br>\r\n''Oh Butter my girl date night not going to plans over there? Looks like you man there won't give up his socks.''<br>\r\n''Don't worry Cream'' Butter replied as she slipped her finger under the sock of her beau.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''HAHAHAHAHA''<br>\r\n''See? He's so happy you could see that smile from space and what's that handsome? You've got a gift for me? Why yesI'd love to take it my happy boy!''<br>\r\nWith that Butter hooked the sock on Jamie's left sole and using the finger that'd already invaded the sanctum of his soles tore it off off the boy's foot leaving the tender flesh beneath without even a thread of protection she held her prize in front of her than waved it at her rival Cream who pouted for a minute than decided that this game of one upsmanship would not go ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''GIRLS IT'S SPA DAY!''<br>\r\nCheese had a bucket of steamy water in one hand and a backpack in the other and as she placed both down the boys feared that everything that had bee done to them till now had been fun and that now these hungry predators were really going to do this. A pedicure?! The boys had always assumed those were for girls, prissy girls at that. Before Chris could think any further on this he found shoved rather hard off the couch and on the ground. He tried to take the chance and scrabble away however Cream stopped the boy by sitting upon his back. A pair of cuffs were locked around the boys wrists as Butter looked at Jamie and made the boy feel amazingly small.<br>\r\n''So you can either let me put some cuffs on you or we make you put your jewelry on. Fight if you want but this is happening.''<br>\r\nJamie considered his options carefully than shoved Butter off the couch and tried to make a break for it. He was quickly grabbed by Cheese though and as she lifted the boy off his feet by his oh so tickly armpits.Butter removed his remaining sock then slipped a pair of cuffs round the boys wrists. Cheese then picked up Chris and deposited both boys back on the couch now with their hands securely cuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sweeties it's time for this footie fun to start. However we are short on cuffs so rust is a thing we need to avoid.''<br>\r\nCream surprised the smaller boy by inserting a key into the cuffs around his ankles then removing them. Chris was so happy with his newly regained mobility that he barely noticed the smiles on all the girls faces grinning.<br>\r\n''Okay now boys this is a perfectly normal bucket of soapy water. It is just bubbles and soap so please stick your feet in...C'mon put them in,,,boooys please it's just water.''<br>\r\nBoth boys clearly saw a number of tiny things moving in the water in between the bubbles. The strange movements in their proposed footbath aside they had no intention of helping Cream, Cheese or Butter in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Tell you what'' Cream interjected ''If the the two of you can keep your cute feet in their for three minutes without laughing we'll take the cuffs off. See I like gambling and I also like tickling you two. Why not combine them? We're going to have to leave you boys in hear for a good bit of time so why not gamble on how you'll spend those last precious hours of non giggly freedom! Sooo! Let the first of our games begin!''<br>\r\nCheese grabbed an ankle from both boys and submerged both pretty little playthings into the water. Chris noticed her very carefully keeping her hand out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie noticed all the shapes in the water moving fast toward their feet! Neither noticed anything else anymore though as they suddenly felt dozens of little mouths nibbling all over their feet. <br>\r\n''Wh-wheheheat are tho-those?!''<br>\r\n''Glad you asked Jamie! Two minutes twenty seconds! See these are what're called Doctor Fish! They're used in spas to eat away at dead skin. When the Clown Prince heard got some he was thrilled. Such a creative and fun way to tickle just handed to us by nature.''<br>\r\n''Th-that ca-can't be reheheeal''<br>\r\n''It's rude to interrupt Jamie baby.Two minutes left! Your friend is turning the cutest little shade of pink. Butter look at that!''<br>\r\n''Adorable! C'mere sweetie your little cheeks are like baloons filled with giggles. Sure hope they don't pop!''<br>\r\nButter grabbed little Chris by his shoulders and pulled the boys now reddening face to her chest at this point he was having to completely hold his breath to hold back the laughter.''<br>\r\n''One minute thirty!''<br>\r\n''N-N-Not ahat all''<br>\r\n''Cutie your willingness to keep trying to push your advantage is the cutest thing. Gonna love tickling you to the point of no return. 50  seconds. Do you think we'd tickle them to the point where they join up with the Clown Prince? Cheese what do you think? Thirty three seconds my little pets.''<br>\r\n''It's worked before! They've already got friends on our side already.''<br>\r\n'W-Whaat did you sa-sahay?''<br>\r\n''Sooo closssssee. 20 seconds!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n19<br>\r\nButter had been doting on the poor boy in a not at all conductive matter to this challenge.<br>\r\n18<br>\r\n17<br>\r\nAnd she was drilling his cheeks with her finger trying to push out the giggles being held between in rosy red cheeks which were chipmunk like at this point with effort.<br>\r\n16<br>\r\nCheese who had grown bored at this was a bit upset that she couldn't help her sisters due to her job of holding both of the boys feet in the water.<br>\r\n15<br>\r\n14<br>\r\nShe grasped the cuff of Jamie's jeans on the leg which was tested and after a bit of effort she rolled them up to the boys knees!<br>\r\n13<br>\r\nShe wasn't done there however as she continued to keep past the boys knees so that he was almost to the thigh now.<br>\r\n12<br>\r\n11<br>\r\nShe turned her and placed both her lips behind Jamie's knee in that area that is sometimes referred to the pit.<br>\r\n10<br>\r\nJamie was trying so hard that he barely noticed but after she blew yet another big sloppy raspberry his eyes shot open and his hand covered his mouth.<br>\r\n9<br>\r\nCream laughed at the boys desperate attempts to cover his mouth but nothing could cover the giant smile which was threatening to split the boys head.<br>\r\n8<br>\r\n7<br>\r\nBetween the repeated raspberries and poking fingers the boys were definitely close to a loss<br>\r\n6<br>\r\nHowever they were determined. They would win.<br>\r\n5<br>\r\nCream sat down between both her struggling prisoners and signaled to the girls to up their games.<br>\r\n4<br>\r\nCheese took a break from her raspberries to slip her tongue to instead do a quick bite at some of Jamie's sensitive skin and run her tongue over the trapped skin.<br>\r\n3<br>\r\nChris was in no better condition as Butter was now holding the boys nose depriving of air and also using her free hand to scracth it gingerly stimulating a sneeze.<br>\r\n2<br>\r\nThe boy's eye's were clearly streaming tears at this point and down bright red balloon cheeks he was looking every bit as Clownish as the hoped he ended up under their ministrations.<br>\r\n1<br>\r\nThere were plenty of sisters in the Clown Prince's fold but only one or two brothers. One of whom was much older than the three. Having a cute little brother or a handsome young teen sibling would open up a number of fun things at the clown home and definitely make the tips in the car more fun at least.<br>\r\n0<br>\r\nSuddenly it happened a piercing noise broke through the room!~</span></div></div>",

You sure showed us how tough you are. We'll get those cuffs off right away. Feel free to laugh now.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese released both boys ankles after the announcement and could barely stifle her smile at their bright red grins erupting into laughter. <br>\r\n''AHHAHAHAHA GEHEHEHET THEHEHEMM AAWHAHAFFFF''<br>\r\n''HAHHAHAHAHhahahahaha heheheheh ihihihittt's okahahay Chrihihis.

We've still got some time before we gotta go...''<br>\r\n''Cheese! Nobody said we're done here at all! We'vestill got one or two more steps to spa day here. First clean that fishy slime off the boys and add some warm oil we don't want them catching cold.''<br>\r\n''Wh-whahat? Yohohouu promiseheehed you'd just take the cuffs off..'' <br>\r\nJamie's begging to the girls was cut off by a single finger placed on his lips by Cheese. Between the shock of this and a gentle shove he found himself on his back with the larger woman holding him down by his shoulders.<br>\r\n''Tough boy don't worry. We will but first we're gonna make sure your cute little feet are sparkly clean!''<br>\r\nJamie's world was swallowed as he felt a set of manicured hands grab him by his dripping ankle and pull it into a lap hold that he couldn't escape if he tried. Butter smirked and admired the returning trophy with one or two of Cheese's specially bred ''Clown'' fish still wriggling attached to the boys soft skin accounting for the boy's persistant giggling. She smiled as she picked the stragglers from between her prizes toes and tossed them back into the bucket.A quick hand motion saw Cheese release her prey and scooch over to help her smaller sister with the other boy.<br>\r\nShe then reached into the bucket and pulled a large handbrush from the depths of the bath. The soapy water on the bristles dripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie tried to save his fish slime soaked foot with some final struggles and pleas.<br>\r\n''Wahai-Wahait you prohohmised. Tahahake the cuhuhffs off pleheeheease...''<br>\r\n''Silly slimy little feetsies are more pressing right now.''<br>\r\nWhen the soapy bristles made contact with his captive foot Jamie sat bolt upright giving Butter a good look at his laughing face and him a view of his ''rescued'' friend held between two Clown's who were playing with the poor boys neck,cheeks and ears like there was no tomorrow. He wanted to help but the seconds between scrubbing passed and he sank back in<br>\r\n''Sweetie it's so you don't get a chill running through these silly, soft soles. ''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Butter hurry up! You're taking your time over there and we've still got a wet little feetie over here in this freezing room.'' <br>\r\nCream and Cheese had Chris snugly held between the two of them making sure that the boy was watching Jamie's predicament. When he tried to look away she started to lightly scratch at the boy's nose until she got the desired reaction of a light sneeze from the boy breaking through the giggles wracking his small frame.<br>\r\n''See Butter? He's catching cold! Don't worry honey me and Cheese will keep you nice and roasty,toasy with these ticklish toesies while silly Butter takes her time.''<br>\r\nShe pulled the boy close and smirked as Jamie's hysterical scrubbing continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Rubby dubby for the hubby!''<br>\r\n''WAHAHAHA NAHAHAHA STAHAHAHAP''<br>\r\n''We're just getting all the fish bits out from between your toes here.''<br>\r\n''THEHEHEREHEES NAHAHATHHEH''<br>\r\n''Big boy's don't fight bath time Jamie. Set a better example for your friend Chris.''<br>\r\nIn between taunting comments Butter was putting a special attention on making sure that there were bristles going into the tender flesh between the toes of Jamie's supposedly dirty foot causing the boy to laugh past the stage of begging and into hysterical gibberish.<br>\r\n''NAHAHAHAHHAHAHAGGHAHGA''<br>\r\n''Those toes are just so cute. Think there's a few drops still left in there though. Everyone always says make sure to wash between your pinky toe!''<br>\r\n''AHAGH AAGHAaahaaaaa<br>\r\nJamie was past the point of speaking and now was just lying back with his eyes screwed shut and the tears streaming down what could very well be a permanent smile painted on his face. When Butter slipped the around his pinky toe and started pulling it back and forth he arched his back and quivered abit before finally slumping on the couch and going silent with a whimpering giggle..''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Butter hurry up!''<br>\r\n''Cheese it's rude to rush a lady. Boy's can get so dirty.''<br>\r\n''He's barely awake at this point.''<br>\r\nCheese wasn't one to be upstaged and started applying a series of light tickles to Chris's neck to keep the scared boy nice and pliant. Not that he could move anyway at this point. Trapped between two clown girls one of whom was playing the small boy rather close to the chest to mix metaphors.                    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Creeeam'' said Butter with a pleading whine ''Let me heeelpp''<br>\r\n''Oh no Butter you drew it out and now you deal with it. Now put the oil on and stop wasting time. We'll show our little man here a good time.''<br>\r\nWith a pout from Butter and a whimper from Chris, Cream took the brush from Butter who went into the bag of tricks for a new torment. As she emerged with a plastic bottle Chris feared for his friends feets but his attention was snapped back to his own as his senses were assaulted by a soapy brush getting familiar with his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese pulled the boy onto her lap and held him in a straitjacket of her own flabby arms with her chin on his head and looking down as Cream cleaned his foot. <br>\r\n''Cleaning my cuuutie. Waaatchinng hiiim squuuiirrmm.''<br>\r\n''He's just so cute when he's like this Cream. Look he's trying to hold it  in and he's just getting so pink I wanna die. Oooh these little cheeks are gonna match his nails once we paint them!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had so many problems with that sentence but at this point he'd hold that back along with his laughs. See he knew at this point after all his ticklish trials and giggly games he knew what they wanted. Despite what they said now it was his laughing they wanted. Cream had no bigger on her smile then when she had been watching the boy's laugh themselves hoarse before her and her sister's. He'd been tricked and tickled, Then tricked again followed by more tickling. Then....He'd been tricked once more...which led to more tickling. Honestly being too trusting was probably something the boy really needed to work on as his innate ticklishness was something that all the people around Summer shared... <br>\r\nDENYING THE CLOWNS HIS LAUGHS WAS REALLY IMPORTANT!<br>\r\nHe was gonna do that as long as he could tho. Cheese was fine with petting her little prisoner but Cream was starting to get bothered by the silence as she wanted her victim to be simpering and sniveling through the tears of joy she would coax out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle of will was raging on one side of the couch but on the other side Big Butter was finishing up the latest stage of what she'd been doing to the poor conquered soles of Jamie. She'd finished rubbing the baby oil into his formerly fish fooded foot and she was finishing up the other virgin foot making sure that arches, ball instep were slathered up. The final touches were being applied to the undersides of her boys toes as even the crevices between them were already slippery with oil. She was quite upset that her lovely lad was away in lala land depriving hr of his laughs but as she washed her hands in their impromptu fish pond( Cleanliness is important!) she knew there was only one more step for her sleepy little suitor. After she finished her painting of these young nails her sisters would need her help. <br>\r\nThey'd also hopefully be more hands-on with keeping her going abit too far as she had been looking forward to seeing the handsome ones pedicure face. She'd settle for the cute one's reaction though. She laid back and withdrew the brush out of the bottle of pink nail polish and hoped she'd still catch some fun when she was done with the hair-dryer that was part of the next step for her boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ohh cutie you're such a little tough guy. Those laughs are gonna come out though! You can try but we're gonna get 'em out!''<br>\r\nCheese cupped her little boy by the chin and forced him to look up and meet her eyes. The tears once more welling in the corners of the boys eyes made her smile even wider than the one creeping over the cuties face.<br>\r\nOn the flip side Cream was getting mad that her goal of brushing down the boys foot had still yet to illicit her a nice little gut laugh from little Mr. Clove. She was done and on the clock here so as she moved on to toweling the foot she had in her clutches she thought she'd see if she could up the game.<br>\r\nCheese was enjoying holding her precious's gaze but the wavering little eyes of Chris screwed shut he felt a nail polish brush go up his captive sole. He tried so hard to keep his mouth shut but quickly found his little tonsils bared by the open faced laughs that ripped through him.<br>\r\n''HAHAHA WHAHAHATTTAH''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Just leaving a little message for my little mister here. The oil is next up of course Christopher but we'll have some fun when you wake up at the next step. It's nothing special just instructions for whoever get's you next. The oil's gonna make these little feet pretty slick, soft and sultry but adding in the blow-dryer THAT I HOPE BUTTER'S DONE WITH BY NOW! They'll be hot, sensitive and ready for whatever questing grabs we have in the cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slow strokes of the tiny brush were insane to Chris. That he'd resisted the larger brush seemed so small as the much smaller brush seemed like a focused streak of ultimate giggly agony for the boy. As the corners of his vision once more darkened he was trying sooo hard to figure out what Cream was writing.<br>\r\nT-I-C-K-L-E-M-E-!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy slipped into hysterical sleep once more.</span></div></div>",

What happened?! Where are our pants?!''<br>\r\n''Huh!?'<br>\r\nChris finally noticed the chill he felt wasn't just do to the fear. His pants were gone! The Clowns must've taken them in transit. Jamie's were gone too he realized.<br>\r\n''They kept tickling me! They wouldn't stop then they started using some kind of brush to wri-''<br>\r\n''Tickle me?''<br>\r\n''NO MORE TICKLING! I DON'T WANT ANY MORE!''<br>\r\n''Chris calm down! I was just...''<br>\r\n''What? ''<br>\r\n''I was just reading Chris. It's on your feet.''<br>\r\n''What?!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small boy pulled his legs up onto the couch on which they'd both awakened and examined his soles for the first time since Cream's art show. He saw the little message that'd been left in hot pink on his alarmingly red sole. <br>\r\n''T-T-TIC-TICKLE ME!?!''<br>\r\n''Chris it's oka-''<br>\r\nJamie was suddenly cut off by Chris's own curious finger touching the message on his foot. The unexpected sensitiveness of his poor tickle abused sole caused the boy to immediately throw his back in and laughter, kicking his legs feebly at his imagined attacker. To his credit Jamie only spent about half a minute staring at the boy incredulously before trying to calm the boy down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ch-Chris calm down!''<br>\r\n''IHIHITIT TIIHIHIHICKKLELEHES SOHOHOHO BAHAHAHADD''<br>\r\n''Wha-''<br>\r\nJamie tried to set his feet down in the oddly thick carpet but quickly regretted it as it felt like a million tiny feathers assaulted his now incredibly sensitive oil soaked soles causing him to fall back clutching at his ankles and laughing his head off.<br>\r\n''AHAHAHGHHAHAHA!! MMMMPPGGHGH!!'<br>\r\nHe finally silenced himself by clamping his hands over his mouth and screaming into them. This action led to a piece of paper fluttering down from the back of the couch to land between both hysterical hostages. After a solid few miutes of laughing and just generally embarrassing themselves they finally got enough air back in them to regain control of their senses and take account of their situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris started with reading the note aloud.<br>\r\n''Hey boys! Love from your future sisters Cream,Butter and Cheese. Don't worry we'll be back to get you in about an hour until then don't worry. To keep you nice and relaxed while you wait we rubbed oil good and deep into your feet and so it wouldn't get icky when you walked we used blowdrier's to dry them fast. The fact that it made your soles so sensitive and red is just a bonus!<br>\r\nAnyway while your waiting feel free to absorb some history my little students. This was a room favored by the late Mrs Featherton frequently used when she ''entertained'' guests or merely for her own use. It's got a twist on the idea of shag carpeting but instead modeled on a bed of grass. The lady of the house the tickle fiend she was. She wanted a carpet of tickly feathers for her personal enjoyment of others enjoyment. The Count of course provided her with whatever she wanted once more. He did that alot and some say when she didn't want death even that ended up handled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpooky huh? Aren't you glad your feet are so warm now? I'd be cold in there even if we hadn't taken your pants! To get off track for a second I never would've figured you were a undies boy. They looked so cute on you! Like a baby in diapers!''<br>\r\nChris blushed furiously as he saw Jamie try to hide a giggle. He'd just pretend it was left over from the carpet for the sake of his pride and their friendship.<br>\r\n''However those little dollar signs on Jamie's boxers?! Those were even cuter hence why Cheese HAD to take them. She gave him a nice little pair of replacements though. She wants me to add that they're the same color as her favorite shade of lipstick so that it'll be easier for Jamie when we come back.''<br>\r\nThe smile vanished from Jamie's face as he seemingly finally noticed the difference in his boxers. He also started fingering the fabric and searching for stains.<br>\r\n''Don't worry boys we looked and didn't touch. Why bother to pick unripe fruit? Anyway sit tight and we'll be right back for you soon. Or try to make a break for it. We'd love to pick our giggly little grooms out of the feathers so that you'll still be giggling when we bring you to the Clown Prince. You will either way boys. Just saving some time would be nice. Signed Butter.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''How long have we been in here asleep do you think Chris?''<br>\r\n''WHY WOULD THAT MATTER?!''<br>\r\n''BECAUSE Chris! How much time do we have left? No chance I'm waiting for them to come back. How long do we have to get out of here?!''<br>\r\n''HOW would we get out of here?! We can't walk in that!''<br>\r\n''What do you want?! To wait for them to come back!? WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!''<br>\r\nWhat're we gonna do? Crawl?''<br>\r\n''Why not? Will that be any worse than what they're gonna do?! We have no idea how long we have! Look Chris!''<br>\r\nJamie pointed at the wall where over what seemed to sea of feathers was a few loose board. In stark contrast to the rest of the room which looked immaculately maintained and even recently cleaned. One board seemed to be hanging on by one side and even swinging slightly. The others around it also looked odd. Maybe they could be moved? A good a chance as any for the ticklish boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris bit his lip. Jamie was right. It was either take some extra tickles now and try to escape or wait here for the guaranteed ticklish times the Clowns had in store.<br>\r\n''You-Your right.b-but what if we can't get through!?''<br>\r\n''Cross that bridge when it comes. It'll tickle but just try to keep feet up as there's no way it can tickle worse than that did.''<br>\r\n''Why'd they have to take our pants?!''<br>\r\n''Probably why they did it. For the best as we should probably keep our legs up as we go. Despite everything tonight I've never felt a worse tickle then when we touched that carpet. We gotta go Chris not leaving you but have got to go.''<br>\r\n''Bu-bu-BAHAHAWHEEWHEEWHY?!''<br>\r\nChris was cut off by Jamie shoving him down off the couch so that he belly flopped on feathers. True friend he was though he kept the boys feet up and out of the jungle of feathers they were about to crawl through.<br>\r\n''Sorry man but we need to double time it. Just keep your feet up and we should make it.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris started to crawl towards their hopeful escape laughing the whole way though but managing to choke the worst of it back. As Jamie started to climb in right behind him he paused to grab him by the wrist and yank him down in as revenge.<br>\r\n'Yo-YOHOHOHEHE JEHEHEHERK''<br>\r\n''Doehheuble time ihiht buhuhddy.''<br>\r\n''Yohohou cahahan't wihin in a fair fihihght.''<br>\r\nThe boys crawled forward awkwardly. Hands and knees going to work hindered as they wee by the need to keep their ravaged but now pink soles to the sky. They moved forward giggling and squeaking as they advanced. Through the feather filled haze Chris noticed unreasonably cool the room was. Despite how hot he felt through their crawl from a combination of the effort and the feathery assault. His legs felt like they were almost freezing. He hadn't noticed any vents in the room. He swore he could feel air beating down on him. It almost felt like there were tendrils of icy air running up his calves at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''HEEEEHEEEK''<br>\r\n''Yohohouu okahay mahahan?''<br>\r\n''I cohohuld sweheeheear I fehelt a fihihnger.''<br>\r\n''Whahat?''<br>\r\n''N-Nehehever mihind.''<br>\r\nChris stopped worrying about the phantom finger at reaching the wall. He easily swung the board away and after Jamie arrived to help they'd moved a few boards and had climbed into their new tunnel. They pulled the boards back behind them and started towards the light they could see at the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''See Chris?! We're fine. just keep going t-towards th-the light.''<br>\r\n''Wh-why's it s-s-so cold in he-here. It's fr-freezing.''<br>\r\n''Ju-just come on Ch-Chris.''<br>\r\nBoth boys went quiet as they heard they door open back in the room they'd just escaped from they heard movement and laughter.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''C'mon just keep going . We're almost there.''<br>\r\n''Stay quiet Jamie!''<br>\r\n''Take your own advice!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the boys argued they paid less attention to where they were going in their high speed awkward crawl trying to keep their oil ravaged soles away from any hazards. So when Chris accidentally elbowed the wall abit too hard he jostled the old foundations he thought nothing of it. Despite the strange level of cleanliness in the last room Featherton manor was am old building that hadn't seen regular use by a living soul in a while. As such a number of pests had inhabited it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne little millipede was knocked from his home by the careless boy's fumbling. As it fell the pest braced itself but found itself spared the hard landing by an unexpected soft,warm and somewhat squirmy bed catching it. This was a new experience for the millions of legs that strode across the soft surface. As it wound itself around the strange little stems the creature had it been capable of such thoughts would have thanked it's lucky stars for having been saved and to have found such a wonderful new resting spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who had saved it however was wondering at first why it like a million tickly fingers had suddenly started drawing a line down his most sensitive feet and when they started to wrap themselves around the stems of his poor little toes the boy couldn't hold it any more. He couldn't focus on progress, stealth even the world anymore. <br>\r\n''MMPPGGAAUUUUGHAHAHAHA NAHAHA JAHAHAMMEEHEEHEE''<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Chris shut up! They're gonna hear us!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So that's where you are!'' <br>\r\nJamie looked back he saw the boards start being pulled off and Chris helpless. He didn't have time to think!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>''CHRIS COME HERE!''<br>\r\nWith a burst of unexpected strength Jamie grabbed his friend by the shoulders and pulled him to him. He got the boys poor insect ravaged ankle just out of the reach of the grasping hand at the last second. The hand closed around air and he heard the kind of language that would've got him in a trouble if he'd said it around his parents (He still did)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulled his friend he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up and a whoosh of air as if the shaft they were in became a wind tunnel of freezing air. The walls shook and sever more insects rained on on the boys however they were blown along withe the boys out the end of the shaft that lacked Clown's. Even though he was being blown through this like dust Jamie still admitted internally how wonderful the cool air felt on his heated feet increasing the healing process that had been helped along by the cold air in the previous room. It almost felt like a cool massage was rubbing down the boy's feet as he flew. Chris however was still laughing his head off the whole time as his hitchhiker dug it's in into the stems of his poor little hot toes to hang on for dear life. As they popped out of the shaft like a cork from a bottle Jamie held Chris tight out of instinct. And as they dropped hard onto a cool stone floor and the back of his caught the floor knocking him out he shielded his friend from the brunt of the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris still laughing couldn't even appreciate it though. The panicking pest was fleeing from any attempt he could muster at trying to get rid of it.<br>\r\n''GEHEHEHETT AWAHAFF!!''<br>\r\nJamie was holding the shoulders unconsciously preventing him from simply plucking it off with his hands. Chris kicked his legs wildly on top of his friend.<br>\r\n''PLEAHAHAHSHEEESSSS TAAAHHAHAP''<br>\r\nTo anyone watching the boy between his high pitched pleading, tear streaked face and jerking motions he would've looked as if he was just pitching a tantrum. The boy tried to scrape his tormentor off using his other foot but that just made it worse as his new admirer simply saw this as a bridge crossed from one to the other!! <br>\r\n''CAHAHAHAAMM ONNAHAHHA''<br>\r\nAfter the small boy had been so heroically saved not once,twice or even just three times tonight by his friend here he was literally begging an insect to stop bullying his poor sensitive feet. To the aforementioned observer there could be nothing more pathetic. <br>\r\nShe smiled as this was a flavor she hadn't enjoyed in many years.<br>\r\nChris's kicking legs eventually slowed before finally going limp. He just didn't have the the strength to move them anymore. All he could do was scream at the insignificant creature that had brought him so low and after the little devil had the bright idea to try using it's little mandibles to pinch at the fleshy underside of the boy's pinky toe (It's rescuer had supplied it with warmth and a change of scenery after all. Food was surely not out of the reach of it's new protector.) he was coaxed into a high pitched squeal that soon robbed him of even that kind of protest.<br>\r\n''EEEEEEEEAAHGHAAaaaahah<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"></font>}hahaghaa<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">ple eheeesee</font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">nohohohoh</font>''<br>\r\nHis eyes burned with stingy tears and after closing them Chris felt that even that opening them was beyond him. Once more the boy felt a tickly blackout coming on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drifted off he felt the already cold room grow frigid. His skin pricked as he felt his insectoid instigator finally be cease it's toe torture and be lifted from him his foot. An almost sub-zero wind seemed to caress the boys sole into an icy massage. Soothing the flaming nerve endings for the first time night the boys foot felt...good.<br>\r\nHe drifted off to sleep with a smile on his face not for the first time tonight but for a different reason.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>''Nnnnggghhh Jaaammiee? Uggghh Jaamie wake up.''<br>\r\n''Oww what happened? Chr-Chris you okay?''<br>\r\n''We were in the wall and then..I got tickled...Then I don't know really.''<br>\r\n''Where are we?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris tried to distract himself with some exploring of his own. Their new location was a stark contrast to their previous enclosure. The ridiculous feather carpet was gone replaced with a cold stone floor which on his ravaged feet felt wonderful. The room was so dark they could only see a few feet from them but they could easily see that the walls were stone and the chains hanging from them did not help them feel safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jamie?''<br>\r\n''What?!'' the boy snapped back frustrated.<br>\r\n''D-Do your f-feet feel better?''<br>\r\n''...Now that you mention it yeah  They feel way better now. They still feel kinda sensitive but this floor is really helping.''<br>\r\nChris pondered back to his last moments of consciousness and the almost phantom hands he'd felt. He wondered if they'd helped with the boy's miraculous recovery from there unwanted pedicures. Did they help Jamie too? Chris's thoughts were interrupted as he heard a groan and the shock of turning and seeing another boy chained to the wall caused him to give out a surprised squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Chris! What is it?!''<br>\r\n''Th-There's a guy over here!!''<br>\r\nChained to the wall by a set of shackles holding his wrists above his head an Asian boy hung unconscious. He was older than Chris and Jamie by a few years from the looks of him almost a young adult. From the way he sagged on the chains and the bare feet that even asleep were still trying to cover each other up the young sleuths could guess that he'd not been exempted from the ticklish torments of the night.<br>\r\nAs the short haired teen groaned once more and shifted in his chains Jamie grabbed Chris by the shoulder before he could get any closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Chris don't touch him. He's with Pao-Ting.''<br>\r\n''What? Are you sure Jamie?''<br>\r\n''Positive I've seen him around her a few times.''<br>\r\n''So what should we do?'' <br>\r\n''Leave him for a bit. We'll keep looking around in here maybe once we're done he'll be awake or I'll have an idea.''<br>\r\n''Gnnnn nooo moore'' the sleeping teen groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the last room was cold this one was just a step above frozen. As the boy's looked around they quickly realized that the stone floor was part of a theme with this room. It was a tickly torture chamber. Large counters were piled with stocks with incredibly soft cushioned restraints. Books which seemed innocent enough were filled with feathers as well as detailed instructions on how to use them upon defenseless bodies. Brushes of various shapes and sizes adorned the wall. The only door was large and covered in carvings. Comedy masks surrounded by what looked to be feathers. <br>\r\n''Nnnna Wh-wha lemme gooo''<br>\r\nThe captive was waking up according to his moans with a loud bang however the door flew open giving both boys a start. They both ducked behind the same counter and took cover peering around the corner at the going's on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two watched as a rather short woman in a quite old looking gown entered the dungeon. When the door opened the room was filled with an ankle high fog that was absolutely freezing. Chris had to consciously keep his teeth from chattering due to the cold. The woman was rather short but not only was it hard for the boys to judge her height due to her bonnet and general large hair but Chris could swear the speed she was moving was almost like she was floating. There was also one other thing...<br>\r\n''<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Chr-Chris man I c-can see through her!</font>''<br>\r\nWell that was also a reason. If Chris focused on staring at the woman's sheer white gown he could definitely see some of the wall through her. This woman wasn't all here and he recognized her from a good few of the in bad repair portraits around the manor. That was Mrs. Featherton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''W-wait please let me go'' the chained boy begged. ''I-I can get w-whatever you wa-want my sister has connections!''<br>\r\n''Sugar just breathe'' Mrs. Featherton said revealing a long southern drawl as she pinched the boy's cheek and held it following him when he tried to pull away. The sickeningly sweet smile suggested that she was relishing the feeling of his skin. ''Everything Ah want at the moment's right in this room. My toy..My tools..My trap..'' She glanced back almost directly at Jamie and Chris causing them both to pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You see my pretty young thing. This is my home and you've all been having your fun here tonight. It's been allowed because the Clown Prince,your sister and my own tendencies toward fun are the same.'' She let go of his cheek and traced her finger down his neck and into the boy's defenseless armpit where she traced lazy circles as she talked.<br>\r\n''Heehehe lemme gooo pleheeeheease I'll leave and never come back, I'll tell Ting to leeeeeHEEEEve, We'll goooooOHOHOO and never come bACKAAHHAAAHA.''<br>\r\nAt random intervals in the boy's groveling she would suddenly poke deep into the sensitive hollows before resuming her tracing.<br>\r\n''Delicious little meal o' mine. You think Ah want you to leave my house and never come back? How long have you all been having your ticklish little games here? Have you noticed that door? You've already left that house 'sug. Where you are is someplace that noone'll ever find ya if I don't want them too. We're going to play a game though sug' to find out if your going to stay here and be the latest flavor of eternity ah tickle the breath out of. Ah've lost count of how many little boys an' girls ah've brought here.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe edged closer to the wall as she moved her hands down to the boys waist making him dance in her arms for her as fled from claw only for the other to sink in. ''We're going to see what'll happen when someone gets ah choice sug'. The two little troopers ah saved from the clown are gonna get a choice. Ta see if they'll save you. Not just one of Pao-Ting's team of tickly troublemakers but her one an' only brother! Everything Pao-Ting's done to you boys and yer friends just think about how sad she'd be if she never saw her precious big brother Pao-Yu again!''<br>\r\n''FEHEHAHEHE PLEEASE! I-I never dihihid anything to YEWEW guys! I just gave Ting and her gihihihls RIHIHIHIDES STAHAHAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie and Chris looked at each other missing as her hand whipped something over there heads to the other side of the room in their distraction they missed where it landed.<br>\r\n''Eye's up front boys!''<br>\r\nShe sank down so that she now had one of poor Pao-Yu's legs and kept playing a game of wiggling her fingers under the boys knee while lowering the boy towards them devilish digits. <br>\r\n''H-h-HEHE-Hehelllpp MEHEHEHHE I didn't do anything to you GAHAHAAH no no no please don't leave me HEEEREHAHAHA''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''Chris he doesn't deserve this.''</font><br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''We're not gonna leave him.''</font> <br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">''DISTRACTED AGAIN HUN!''</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whipped another object over the boys this time low enough to ruffle Chris's hair as it went over. They turned and watched as now next to the hysterical sibling to Summer's greatest enemy the door was now wide open. They're eyes were pinned to the sight until Mrs. Featherton went even lower and sat herself in her ghostly fog while pulling her prey's foot to herself.<br>\r\n''Pleasepleasepleaseplease not my feet! Please we already played this game before and you know how ticklish they are! You don't need to tEHEHEHEst!''<br>\r\nShe interrupted the boy by dragging her index nail from his heel to the very tip of his big toe he thrashed and sunk into gibberish showing he wasn't a liar. <br>\r\n''Those things ah threw were keys. One to my pet's shackles and the other to that there door. If you play this game and get both you all win! Just gotta use 'em and leave into a happy new world where not only will ah leave you alone ah'll help you out abit. See there's a few ways this could go an now we'll illustrate them with me an' my sweetie here's favorite game!''<br>\r\n''NO PLEASE NOT THE LITTLE PIGGIES!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys winced in ticklish sympathy as she started by plucking at the boys big toe making sure to dig her nails into the sensitive digit.<br>\r\n''This little piggy means the boy's leave you and your ticklish twinkletoes to me for a good few years. Until you give your last sweet giggle.''<br>\r\n''GAHAHAHAHAHA''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie looked from Chris's pleadng eyes as she continued on with her game, Yu trying to into the shoulder of his tattered shirt as she pulled his index toe back and gave a horrifically long scratch going from the ball of the boys foot, up the stem and circling the nail.<br>\r\n''MMMPPHHGHHHMMPPGGHH!!''<br>\r\n''This little piggy is our little sleuths get the keys and unlock you without getting caught!

Jamie looked on for a minute before taking off after him.<br>\r\n''Perfect hon! The game's a-foot that's waiting to be tickled! Watch out boys there are all kinds of little monsters waiting for you!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''As Chris plunged further into the dark dungeon before him he felt a slight bump from his foot and heard a metallic clang off one of the counters. Could he really have found one of the keys so easily? He stumbled toward where he thought the sound had come from before a new sound caused him to stop. A soft laughing accompanied by a skittering as if little appendages were running on the cold floor and clacking as they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''J-Jamie?!'' the boy called out hopefully ''P-please let that be you?'' the skittering noise he'd heard before was pushed to the back of his mind as he noticed a glint in what little light the boys had reflecting off a key! As he went to grab it he was surprised a bare foot stepping down on it and kicking it back into the darkness.<br>\r\n''JAMIE WHAT YO-MMPPGGH!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris cries at who he assumed was his friend were muted as the very same foot that had just kicked his goal away stuffed its big and index toes into the boys mouth! As he fell back with the digits depressing his tongue he felt another foot pin his left arm to the ground. As he clawed at the one who he thought was his friend at first he realized that not only was this definitely not Jamie but also this person wasn't a person Chris was right now being forced to choke on the toes of nothing more than a pair of legs! After the hips his attacker just trailed off into nothing as the boy flailed with his free arm at the surprisingly strong set of feminine legs that was holding him down one of his wild strike led the boys nails to the back of her or it's knee which caused it to withdraw so fast that the chipped a tooth on it's nail as it pulled it's still wet foot out and off of the young man leaving him gagging and spitting at the incredibly gross, ghostly gag that he'd just escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''W-wha-Oooohh OF COURSE! WHY WOULDN'T IT! YOUR TICKLISH! EVERYTHING HERE APPARENTLY IS!''<br>\r\nChris tackled the legs down looking forward to finally after this long night of being poked, tickled, pinched and just humiliated in general that now he was going to pay it forward and even if was nothing but pair of legs tickle the bejeezus out of something!<br>\r\nThe boy dug in deep behind those ticklish little ghosty knees and smiled wide at the wild way his captive kicked under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sugar that is delicious!'' the echoing voice of Mrs. Featherton rang through the room. Chris ignored it and buried himself in how good it felt to make someone else laugh even if they didn't have a mouth.<br>\r\n''Who knew that my cute little junebug had such a vengeful streak. Does it feel good hon? To make them squirm and dance at their lack of control as you play them like a keyboard? It's what Ah'[m addicted too so ah won't judge but sweet pea you'd better hurry! Jamie's already caught and you only win if you get out here! Stay in too long and your mine! For ever and ever my cute little crusader!...Or do you want that? Ooooh..that'd be a new flavor.''<br>\r\n''WHAT ARE YOU DOING! GIVE ME BACK MY PANTS!''<br>\r\n''Sweetie you are in position to tell me to do anything. You've such nice legs we're just gonna put you in something them off! If your gonna talk you'd probably better try to keep my adorable little entree there to focus up or it's Featherton forever for all three of you!''<br>\r\n''PLEASE FIND THE KEYS MAN! FOR AHAHAHALLOFFUUUSSS!!''<br>\r\n''Do these tickle? Wow your legs are sensitive and sensuous! We are gonna have a fun eternity!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris shook himself out of his tickle rage and slackened his grip on the legs which repaid his kindness by kicking the boys legs out from under hims leaving to rattle his jaw on the hard stone floor. As he tried to move past the pain in his chin the boy opened his eyes long enough to see his former victim wind up and kick something shiny at him. He squinted to try to make out the object but when the bounced off the boy's face he figured it out. Yeah that was the key and yeah that hurt. He picked it up and went to put it in his pocket but after it fell on the ground he remembered his pantsless situation. A laugh boomed from the darkness that got Chris to focus up and jam it into the waistband of his tighty whiteys then charge into the darkness to help his friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''GYAHALEMME GO! NONONON-GMMPGGH!''<br>\r\nChris the screams and winced as he knew that Jamie just got the hot-foot sundae and regretted letting those legs go as they apparently just went straight to stuffing those dirty toes in Jamie's mouth. Well he was gonna teach them this time. He was gonna tickle those knees till they were weak in the knees! He jumped onto the counter and slowly approached the last place he'd heard his friends voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he peeked over he reconsidered. Apparently those legs had friends. A whole lot of friends, Jamie was locked in a Figure-4 leglock by a rather meaty looking pair of legs that were holding tight enough that his back was almost arched into a U. Another pair had the boy's arms pinned back in what looked almost like a Full Nelson! That pair was more toned and had knotted itself behind the  young mans back to the point where those long toes were twirling the short hairs growing out of Jamie's armpit's and using them to pull the sensitive hollows in whenever the boy tried to flex out. Jamie was in a new level of smothered ticklishness as not only was the familiar pair of legs toe knuckle deep in the boys mouth but another TWO SETS of ghostly gams had a foot each on the handsome lads face and were rubbing all over his grinning young face. To make matters worse one more rather short pair of legs was attacking his exposed foot by running it's big toes all along the edges of his sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris winced at what was happening to his friend and thought about what he could do the legs hadn't diverted at from there working over of Jamie so he assumed they hadn't noticed him but the second they did that many of them would easily entrap him considering just one of their number had done it earlier. A glint in one of Jamie's hand caught his eye and Chris realized it, Despite the flurry of feet attacking him Jamie was clasping the other key! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed a plan as time was running out but what to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>''JAMIE! I'M COMING HANG ON!'' Chris yelled startling not only his friend but the shades tormenting him. The boy dove off the counter onto the set of legs stuffing the boys mouth with it's toes, knocking it and the rest of it's facially assigned comrades in lack of arms off their feet. He goosed it behind the knee good causing it to shiver in his gasp before he turned and wrapped himself around the set pinning Jamie's arms and scritching the boys lightly furred hollows. Chris dug his short nails into the thighs of his chums torturer and raked them up as far he could go on the spook in an attempt to free it's captive. The spook did loosen it's grip and stiffen up enough to stop mining the young man for giggly gold, however it didn't let the poor boy go instead just giving him time to breath finally which he did with relish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was afraid for how long Jamie lay gasping as he still scratched at the thighs. If his friend didn't help out soon here than the young hero all alone in a pile of ghoulish gams might not be able to hold out and he'd have to run again. Chris was sure he wouldn't be able to duplicate this attack he honestly wasn't sure if he could even get away at this point as several of the legs were trying to hook his legs and arms to trap them. He kicked or wriggled out of their attempts but if they all got him at the right moment together he'd be stretched helpless just like his Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''JAMIE C'MON I NEED SOME HELP HERE!'' Chris begged as one the sets wrapped itself around one of his own bare legs before falling back holding him steady. Jamie finally got enough air to power his way out of the hold on his arms and allow his buddy to shove it off him and into one of the solid stone counters. Chris thanked his lucky stars that he'd finally gotten reinforcements but had to think now as he had one leg caught and his friend's legs still tied up tight despite his attack. To make matters worse Chris's captor was now scooching back to drag the boy onto the top of his friend preventing Jamie from being able to sit up and get at the leglocker who had him and as if things weren't already bad the determined spirit was clearly trying to get enough purchase on Chris's warm leg so that it could dig it's ice-cold tickly toes into the exposed hollow behind his ticklish little knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''CHRIS GET OFF! I CAHAHAN'T GEHEHET AT THEHEEHEM!'' his friend yelled as now two spectres were dragging their nails along his exposed weakness, that one vulnerable foot that might as well read ''TICKLE ME!'' in bright red letters for how these two were using their limited dexterity to distract him with their fiendish game of footsies. <br>\r\n'' JAMIE I CAN'T MOOHOVE THEY KEEP COHAAHAHAANOOOOO...'' the boy screamed than trailed into a squeal as another pair dug it's toenails into young boy's embarrassingly hairless armpits seating itself comfortably on the boys undies which were the only thing separating the boy's cute little bottom from the icy skin of his tormentor who forced his arms up as he tried to flee from the tickly tootsies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Boy's ah think you are losing!'' the voice of Mrs. Featherton boomed over there laughs. ''Don't worry ah'm not the sharing type so once you lose don't worry you'll only get tickled by ONE full bodied...person? That's not right but yah get where Ah'm goin'. Oopsie poopsie mah little junebugs. Mah accent tends to slip when ah get a bit too excited. What'd you think mah obviously future ticklish husband? Your future ticklish little brother seem to have botched it and left you here in mah hands! TICKLETICKLETICKLE!''<br>\r\n''NYAHAAGGGHHHAAHEEEEEHAAHAPLEEHEEHEGEEHEGEEE'' the voice of Pao-Yu was added to this soundtrack of the boys defeat.<br>\r\n''Sweet little one these nylons really make your deee-lish little feeties THAT ticklish? Two fingers is all it took to make these little piggies squeal in their sexy new little sausage casings!'' Hoooo we're gonna have a fun few years here before you laugh yourself away! Anyway boy's it's gonna take a miracle ta save you here.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's last gasp at freedom was stuffed down his throat as an to familiar foot jammed itself into the boys mouth.<br>\r\n''MMMPGGHHH'' the doomed sleuth tried to choke out as he looked up and recognized the legs as the pair he'd chased off himself earlier. The boy tried to grab at the ankle to push it out but didn't pay close enough attention to his surroundings and as a result found one of his arms getting hooked by another specter which wrapped itself around it before kneeling on the boy's elbow and slowly..slowly..slowly walking those devilish toes down his trapped forearm towards those poor pits. As they dug in and broke the boy into choking hysterics on the ghostly gag the spook scooched down to bring that other ghosts probing digits to dig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was trapped and gagged on those toes he'd just managed to escape a few minutes ago and as Chris's poor little tongue was grasped inside the grip of a pair of those toes that had invaded his mouth his vision started to tear up the boy begged for it to stop. He'd do anything for it to stop. <br>\r\n<i>Anything sugar?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked up and saw Mrs. Featherton standing over the ticklish pile he had become and she smiled down. <br>\r\n''Looks like you lose. No way I can see out of this for you ''</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been 13 long years. 13 Years ago tonight Summer Salt along with her sister Mouse had entered Featherton Manor to confront the Clown Prince and gang of clowns. After a torturously long night of being tickled, tickling and fighting to stop tickling Summer had tricked the Clown Prince into a trap where he stayed until the police arrived to find the villain in tears and begging for jail to save him from the super sleuth who had tickled him furiously for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer had made the Prince confess to every single one of his crimes. All of his clowns had been rounded up due to his confessions and the victims he had trapped in the mansion were freed even Pao-Ting, Summer's rival was freed from the tickly grasp of a particularly evil trio of clowns named Butter,Cream and Cheese who she'd tried to confront but instead been captured by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever not everything turned out great. As tonight also marked 13 years since Summer last saw her childhood friends Chris and Jamie. The two boys had come with the Salt sisters to help them solve the mystery but the last Summer had ever seen of the boys was when she'd made the decision for them to split up in the manor. After the Clown Prince was arrested Summer followed along with the case waiting for the villain to give up the location of the boys. Eventually despite the Clown Prince's insistence that he'd not had the boys the police ruled it as the case taking a more sinister turn and locking the man up for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13 years and despite help from Pao-Ting who had bonded with Summer over her own older brother going missing that same night the girl detective had not a single clue in the disappearance of her fellow Mystery Solvers. She'd been back to the manor hundreds of times looking for any kind of clues. Something that would help her find the boys that every night when she closed her eyes she saw asking her if splitting up was the best idea. That she'd left to whatever had happened to them that was most definitely her fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been in this room which was the backdrop for that scene hundreds of times as well. She'd searched all over this room looking for anything. She'd found the hidden room behind the painting and the feather carpeted chamber but she still had no idea. Interrogations of Butter had revealed that the last place they'd seen Jamie and Chris to be the feather chamber....Wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad that painting always looked like that? Summer didn't remember such a dark scene as that being in this room. She could of sworn it had been some kind of tickling based Mona Lisa thing...not this. The painting of three young adult males stretched out and in chains and padded stocks was a new feature to her. As she drew closer she saw that the painting may have changed but the theme of it had stayed. These boys were being tickled and terribly so Summer could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange hands and feathers assaulted the males from all angles. Feathers dipped into ears, neckbones were pinched and bellybuttons were literally stuffed with feathers and probing fingers. The mens faces were partially hidden by lacy blindfolds but judging by the redness and streaked tears that could be seen the artist was trying to convey that this had been going for a while. As a receiver of tickles that went over the edge Summer could tell that these guys were at the level of laughter where they were just choking out soundless laughs and attempting to breath as that was all they could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Summer looked over the painting she stopped cold as the spark of recognition lit up her mind. The boy in the middle...that brown hair and smaller form...No...that couldn't be him. As she looked over the middle victim she felt the room grow colder as she mentally aged her childhood friend in her head thinking of how the boy would have looked after thirteen years of growth. There was no doubt<br>\r\nthat this was her friend Chris Sullivan. This was her childhood friend who she'd been searching for for thirteen years and that was definitely Jamie Cross beside him which meant that eldest looking tickle victim must be Pao-Ting's missing older brother Pao-Yu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer's eye welled up with tears. After searching for them for so long to find something like this mocking her, showing her the fate that had befallen the boys that she had left to their fate. They were extremely pale like they hadn't seen the sun in the entire time that they'd been missing. Their hair was long and dirty looking and their ribs were poking out which the ghostly hands took advantage of as each one of the little ribs poking forwards was either being pinched, stroked or scratched. Their arms were stretched above their heads but summer couldn't even see the hollows due to the feeding frenzy of hands and feathers blocking any sight of the sensitive skin from Summer's view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hadn't been here before. Summer had been over this manor a million times in this room in particular. This building was roped off to the general public, nobody should have been here, Who could have put have this here!? Where did they have them all this time and where were they now! How could she help her friends and punish this person! This level of torture for people who only wanted to help!<br>\r\n''WHERE ARE THEY!?!'' Summer screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reacting to Summer's screams the painting reacted. To Summer's everlasting horror the boys on the canvas started to squirm and writhe in accordance to the endless ticklish torments that they took. She watched and wanted to scream as the little movement the boys were afforded they tried to use only to be chased down by the ghostly tickle tools and hands so that they'd resume their soundless and sightless screams. Now brushes, forks and pens joined the feathers and hands in tormenting the young adults. Summer watched as forks stuck themselves between the ribs of Jamie, Brushes circled and scrubbed the neck of Pao-Yu while pens wrote a missive upon Chris's heaving chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''WHY DID YOU LEAVE US SUMMER?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I-I DIDN'T! THE-THERE WAS NO WAY FOR ME TO KNOW!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chains binding Pao-Yu's hands above his head raised o there own stretching him out and exposing more canvas for the pens to express themselves on. They responded to Summer's denial as the poor former henchman seemed to wheeze and gasp for air through his hysteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''WE'VE BEEN HERE SO LONG BECAUSE OF YOU SUMMER. SO LONG SINCE YOU LEFT US.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I-I-I LOOKED EVER-EVERYWHERE FOR YOU! I THOUGHT THE CL-CLOWN PRINCE HAD YOU!''<br>\r\nDespite how loudly she screamed and the hot tears now streaming down her cheeks the room seemed freezing to Summer her own breath becoming visible as the forks started raking Jamie's captive soles and the pens wrote another ghostly letter to the ''Hero of Featherton''.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''PLEASE. WE'RE SO TIRED OF LAUGHING SUMMER. MAKE HER STOP!'' read the now still lightly muscled chest of Pao-Ting's missing older brother. He was slumped in his bonds despite the stretched out poition he had been forced into. His lips still blubbered occasionally giving the detective a clue that he was still alive but his limit was coming up fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer reached towards the painting only to recoil when the canvas bulged towards her hand like a wild animal snapping at food. She looked up and saw the adorning her friends had changed. Now Chris read ''TOUCH THE PAINTING SUMMER. COME IN HERE AND HELP US PLEASE! WE CAN'T LAST MUCH LONGER.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer reached out once more but this time the painting lashed out even further causing the girl to take steps back as warning bells in her head sounded. None of this seemed right to her and as much as she wanted to help her childhood friends she'd learned about traps very early in her life and the disappearence of Pao-Ting had her even more on edge...but they were right there! Sweet Chris and Strong Jamie who she hadn't seen for thirteen years They were right there and they were begging for help. BEGGING FOR HER TO HELP! As her eyes roamed across the painting she saw a letter written on Jamie's soles addressing her reluctance. Made clearer for her to read by a spectral glove holding each and every one of his toes bent back so that his skin was both taut and legible. The occasional poke by a fork scratching at the helpless toe stems punctuated each word almost supernaturally for Summer's reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''SHE SAYS SHE'LL STOP IF YOU JOIN US IN HERE SUMMER! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT FOR SO LONG BUT SHE SAYS SHE'LL STOP IF YOU COME IN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was she? There were too many questions and literally no answers. Summer's mind screamed at her but once more she reached out to the canvas which drew back clearly preparing to strike at her. The girl had always been logical, clearheaded and calculating but whoever was doing these things to her friends was preying on the biggest mistake of her sleuthing record and so far it was working. Her instincts still kept her as she pulled her hand back as the painting snapped out and distended itself almost a foot now trying to snag her hand. She recoiled her eyes stinging from the tears trying to figure out if she should leave and come back. Get the police, a priest anybody to help her here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked at Chris's face an icy spike of clarity silenced her doubts as she saw the boy's mouthing only word. Over and over and through the smile that had consumed his face and being his mouth simply kept saying.<br>\r\nplease. Please. PLEASE. PLEASE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer threw caution to the wind and ran face first into the canvas. Jamming her hand through and reaching towards Chris trying to grab at the boy. She felt nothing but empty air on the other side though,<br>\r\nWhen she tried to pull her hand back she found it instead being pulled in deeper. The painting acting as quicksand pulling the girl through into some place that she only had one word to describe according to what she could feel on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes looked and saw a new message. Now each of the boys soles had a letter drawn upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT.H.E. E.N.D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Ah said ah'd stop Sug.

He needed a plan for this and he needed one fast. They were just legs, They couldn't be that smart could they? Maybe he could trick them? All they seemed to want was to tickle maybe he could use that? Chris slowly lowered one foot to the floor in front of them and noticed how most of the one smothering Jamie's face came running. They seemed to prefer feet over face. He swung his dangling tootsies and they followed. Time to go fishing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved his foot closer to the one holding Jamie in the leg lock but it ignored him, However a good few of the spooks tripped over it and screwed up it's hold with the impact. Chris prodded it in the butt with his toe and that got it chasing his tasty little foot with all the others. Making sure to get all the spooks to chase him using the same method Chris swung his foot along the edge of the counter to get them to chase around for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were around the bend Chris reeled in his bait and hopped down to help Jamie. After a pair of quick tickles to get the arm-locking ghost off Jamie he helped his friend to his feet as fast as he could.<br>\r\n''C'mon Jamie quick!

Jamie reached down and paid his friend back by pulling him up by his shirt. As their victim was pulled up and out of their grasp the legs started to stomp in frustration. Once safely up on the counter Chris immediately hugged his friend close who flushed red in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!'' Chris exclaimed in joy.<br>\r\n''We've got to get moving Chris besides I was just paying you back.''<br>\r\n''Ohh Sug you two are doing so good! Time for me to play some mahself!

The voice of Mrs. Featherton boomed through the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the legs fled into the darkness which started to grow towards the boys! As the wall of darkness started to chase them Chris and Jamie hopped down and started to run full bore towards both the exit and Pao-Yu.</span></div></div>",

Pao-Yu shrilled as the boys arrived to see him now suspended in the chains forcing into a frog like crouch with his head between his knees four or five feet above the ground.<br>\r\n''Are those stockings?'' Jamie stopped to question noticing the change in wardrobe there damsel in distress had gone through.<br>\r\n''NOW?! THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON RIGHT NOW?! '' Pao-Yu screamed back as the boys put the keys and turned them in their locks freeing the Asian boy who hit ground running straight towards and out the door with Chris and Jamie in tow. Upon exit the two detectives stopped to catch their breath as well as make sure that the door was closed behind them and in Jamie's firmly place a chair under the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Yu meanwhile wanted to place even more distance between himself and the door took off down the hallway only to run directly into the grasp of the spectral and seemingly vindictive Mrs. Featherton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good job boys! Ya'll done gone and won it!'' she said as she pulled the struggling Pao-Yu into her arms as she floated into the air with her victim in her arms. She dug her spectral digits into the poor youngster sensitive armpits and smiled at the uproarious laughter that rewarded her.<br>\r\n''GYAHAHAHA NAHAHAHA YOHOHOUU GUHUHUUHYSS HAAHALLPP''<br>\r\n''Y'all young-ins always in such a hurry these days. Enjoy life while you got it with a big smile on yer face!''<br>\r\n''BAAAHAAHAHA STAAHAHAHAP''<br>\r\n''Just like that honey! See? Don't the day seem brighter?!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the red faced Asian boy around in her grasp so that they were face to face she began to rub her nose against his with a smile almost equal to the she was forcing onto Pao-Yu. Jamie ran forward and grabbed her captives ankles trying to pull him down from her grasp. After all the effort the two had gone through to save him there was no way he was just gonna let her just tickle him to the death in front of them. He tugged on the laughing boy's stocking clad leg but got no give as Mrs. Featherton continued her assault on the poor boy's pits as well as the unsolicited eskimo kisses despite the resue attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You brought me such treasures but honestly sug y'all were my personal favorite. Ah was not looking forward to once you lost that cute laugh of yours from the years of tickling ah had planned and was looking forward to working the sass outta you.''<br>\r\n''LET HIM GO! WE WON AND YOU PROMISED!'' Jamie yelled at the phantom.<br>\r\n''Oh? Yeah y'all did. Don't worry sweeties. Y'all are home free but let a girl have a bit of fun 'tween centuries. You want him so much CATCH!~''<br>\r\n''WHA-''<br>\r\n''HAHAAAAAHHH''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather unceremoniously she dumped Pao-Ting's ticklish older brother right on Jamie who ever the hero caught the older boy but got drilled to the ground by the weight of his catch. Before either boy could so much as move Mrs. Featherton was on him swooping down on Jamie and his defenseless belly while he was held down by the very boy he had tried to save. As she blew a big wet raspberry on Jamie's tummy she enjoyed both his peals of laughter and the manic flailing of Pao-Yu trying to stop her but swinging at empty air as the ethereal tickler enjoyed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">''PPPBBBBBBTTTTTTT!!!!''</font><br>\r\n''GAAAAHHAAAAHAAHAHHAHYYYYYEEEEHEHHHHEE''<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">''PPPPPPBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBTTTTTTTT!''</font><br>\r\n''PAAHAAHAAAHAOOOHOHOHHOO HAAHAALLPP HAHAHA''<br>\r\n''I'M TRYING BUT I CAN'T GRAB HER!!'' Pao-Yu yelled back at the hysterically helpless youth.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">''PPBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBTTT!'</font><br>\r\n''TTTRREHEEYYEE HAHAHARRRGDDEEHEERRR!! HAHAHAAA'' was all that Jamie could choke out as Mrs. Featherton once more enjoyed another big wet body blow on the defenseless dude driving him into crazed laughs and pleas for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile during this whole comedy of spectral assault on both Chris and their new friend(!?) Pao-Yu, Chris had been standing frozen in shock at the attack and the smaller boy literally let out a scream at Mrs. Featherton turning to look at him and signifying his turn. He took off in the opposite direction in a futile attempt to escape the ghost again. One foot in front of the other though was interrupted as he felt an ice cold vice snap on his left ankle than tear it out from under our little hero slamming his jaw into the ground and distracting the boy with stars instead filling his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur dazed and confused friend was quickly pulled into an impromptu ankle lock leaving him face down on the ground and stunned, He was snapped back to reality when Mrs. Featherton stuck five to clawing at the ball of her captive's foot. As she got to poking and prodding at the third, Jamie and Pao-Yu gasped for breath before trying themselves to help Chris by attempting to grab at the phantom. It didn't work but it was the thought that counts. Chris wasn't thinking that though as he was too busy banging his fists on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''PLEEHEHEEHEEE NNOHOHOHOHHO''<br>\r\n''My biggest regret is that ah din't get to spend more time with these darling little feet of yours. They're so small and soft for a boy but at'n that same time they're just so gosh-darned perfect! The teeny little bubbly toes', the creamy and pale soles, even these soft little heels would've made any kinda modeling job a hit fer you. When ah first found you they were so red and hurt it broke my heart. What kinda person could use an' abuse these little treasures like that. Ah nursed ya back to health and got you ready to fight for your freedom!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her monologue on her treasure went on she idly stroked one sub-zero digit up and down Chris's sole doing lazy figure eights and occasionally singling the boys index toe for some bullying of it's sensitive underside. She stared into Chris's sole and just let his hysterical peals of laughter wash over her. Just like how the hands of the frantic Jamie and Pao-Yu as well as the wild kicking of Chris's free leg kept passing THROUGH her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Stahahap pleeeheeease noohohoo moohore''<br>\r\n''Let Chris go! We beat your game and you've had your fun!'' Jamie demanded.<br>\r\n''Weeheheggh wohohon''<br>\r\nThe spectral scrabbling at his soles finally started to slow as Mrs. Featherton gazed wistfully at the foot she'd been tweaking and tickling. The eights became fives then sevens before becoming slooow and lazy ones going from pinky toe to heel. With a long and defeated sounding sigh she started to just pet the foot while tuning to address the other two as well as the recovering Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Y'all're right. Ah've had mah fun with you boys. Y'all strapping young gents sure know how to an older lady ah real fun time..''<br>\r\nDespite the words to the contrary the translucent fiend didn't look a day over thirty despite being possibly thousands of years older than that.<br>\r\n''Y'all won and ah made a promise of what to give y'all for it. Since ah had a bit of extra fun too ah'll do you one better too. Not only do y'all gett'n to go free ah'll put you wherever you want. How's that?''<br>\r\nJamie and Pao-Yu exchanged quizzical looks. <br>\r\n''What exactly do you mean? Anywhere in the mansion?'' Jamie asked?<br>\r\n''Anywhere is anywhere hon. Upstairs, Your houses heck boys if'n you want a tan why not go to the beach and get that cute little tummy of yours a nice browning my little Asian sensation there.''<br>\r\nPao-Yu blushed and turned away from Mrs. Featherton to look at Jamie and pull his shirt lower.<br>\r\n''S-so we could go home then? Get out of here and f-forget all this all of us? stammered the embarrassed young adult.<br>\r\n''If'n you mean by all of y'all the three of you then yeah. Any of the rest of y'all's friends are on there own. Wanna leave them behind then fine but your some kinda heroes then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well of course we're not gonna leave Summer and Mouse behind! We're getting them outta-HYEnyeeehe.''<br>\r\nChris's heroics were interrupted by a hard poke into his soft sole that the ghost turned into a figure six causing the boy to let out an embarrassing squeak before his covering his mouth to hide his distinctly feminine giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's the kinda big talk that made me choose y'all. Don't be disappointing me here at the end of the road. If'n y'all want this to be the end of it so be it. What're you scared of though? Worst that could happen is some more tickling ain't that bad. Course don't know if that's something you'd say to Summer or your Sister.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What happened to Summer?!''<br>\r\n''What happened to Pao-Ting?!''<br>\r\n''What happened to you not tihihickling meeeheee sneehuurghh!''<br>\r\nFigure three's now were making little Chris snort into his hands.<br>\r\n''One of those girls is doing fine. One of them not so much. Those maaay not be related but what do you boys care? You get to go home!''<br>\r\n''We can't leave Summer! Miss?''<br>\r\n''Yes hon? It's Mrs by the way.''<br>\r\n''Tickle Jamie now please.''<br>\r\n''Got it sug.''<br>\r\n''Wha-GAAH!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResuming where she was before with a deceptively strong tackle knocking Jamie to the ground she reduced Jamie to a mess by playing with his poor little outie and flipping the switch from ''on'' to ''giggly mess'' in seconds.<br>\r\n''GAAGGHNAAchrrihihss youu jeerk make her staahap.''<br>\r\n''Sorry man. We can't leave Summer and Mouse in here with the Clown Prince! Taking us to them is the only choice right Jamie?<br>\r\n''Hang on it could be my sister Ting that's in trouble!''<br>\r\n''She said that ones responsible for the other! No way Summer's got Ting.''<br>\r\n''Ahh'm kinda unreliable boys. Ah did say maybe though.''<br>\r\n''No shit you're unreliable! You said you'd stop tickling meehe!''<br>\r\n''Language Jamiekins! Click the switch time!''<br>\r\n''Nahaha leheggo the swihitch.''<br>\r\n''We need to save my sister! She's a genius and her crew would help us too!''<br>\r\n''We <i>need</i> to save Summer! <i>She's</i> a detective!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jamie's head was killing him, His throat was hoarse and his back was sore. Wherever Mrs. Featherton had put him couldn't the tickle hungry old hag have put him there gently? His head really hurt did he say that yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing he remembered was Featherton giving them a choice... wait...Who's pick did she go with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sister please! Take them off of me please if you love as a brother at all take these off my legs right now!''<br>\r\n''Yu I can't help it you just look so fantastic in them! Those legs of yours are something the world needs to see!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was definitely Pao-Yu and his evil sister the girl genius Pao-Ting. Jamie was behind...something a couch maybe? So they couldn't see him. However as he looked around the corner he could definitely see them and as he watched the unfortunate Pao-Yu had gone through another wardrobe change. Now the older sibling had had his pants removed and been changed into a pair shorts showing off the nylons that Mrs. Featherton had left him as a memento. The boy had at least found some shoes but the the hightops he wore were still probably not his first choice. Pao-Ting wasn't wrong about the legs though Featherton did have a point with those nylons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Please sister this is humiliating.''<br>\r\n''Some big brother BEGGING his little sister to help him with his pretty nylons!''<br>\r\n''THESE AREN'T MY PRETTY NYLONS! A GHOST PUT THEM ON ME!''<br>\r\n''How dare you raise your voice to me! AFTER I GAVE YOU A JOB! MARUKO! MICHIKO!''<br>\r\n''NONONONO SISTER I'M SORRY! Pleeease d-d-d-don't call them in here! T-t-there r-really busy! I'm so-SORRY naaahaha.''<br>\r\n''mY CUTE <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting struck and started wiggling her fingers on her older brothers hips. Jamie kinda felt bad as he watched a young adult man in admittedly pretty nylons beg and plead for his littler sister to stop tickling him and not tell on him. Where was Chris though? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Tihihihnnngh pleehahase don't call them in here''<br>\r\n''My dear weak,stupid and sensitive older brother why would you be so scared of your own fiance or the other one who just likes to tickle you?!''<br>\r\n''Yoohohhuu made that choice fohohr me! Ahaha still dohohon't know which is which plehehehease!''<br>\r\n''So what's the right way to ask me the owner of the company and the one ho not only got you a job and a cute fiance who likes ticklish weaklings? Do you want to lose those? You brought me Chris now all I need to do is catch the Clown Prince and rub Summer's face in it! I'm gonna solve the mystery and get the boy NO MATTER WHAT! I WIN THIS TIME YU! NOW WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO ADDRESS YOUR DEAR LITTLE SISTER?!''<br>\r\n''Deeheeaaharr sister!''<br>\r\n''Good job!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie ducked back behind the couch and thought. Well he was stronger than Pao-Ting. However he wasn't sure if the two that Ting had mentioned might chase him or maybe even Pao-Yu. He needed to get out of here though so he was gonna go for it NO REGRETS! He braced himself in a three-point stance than took off running at the door! He saw both Pao's turn and look at him as made his mad dash but he refused to even look back as he ran straight at the door! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was locked though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''YOU!!''<br>\r\n''Jamie is his name sister.''<br>\r\n''Do I need to get your bride to be in here Yu?''<br>\r\n''<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Dear sister please...I'll be better just leave the others out of this.</font>''<br>\r\n''You two stay back! Unlock this door right now and let me out of here!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting smiled at the scared boy.<br>\r\n''What are you talking about Jamie? You're free to leave whenever all I want is answers to a few questions to help me save that foor Summer.''<br>\r\n''Wh-what'do you mean?''<br>\r\n''I'm a genius Jamie so I'm used to having to repeat myself for those who less so.''<br>\r\n''Hey wai-''<br>\r\n''One how many clowns have you run into in here in the last few days? Describe them for me.''<br>\r\n''About four so far three girls for sure and at least one more that we didn't see. Wait days?-''<br>\r\n''Calm down now Jamie and focus. What were the girls like? Distinguishing characteristics? My valet and her sister have captured one female clown. Are there more? What did those three look like!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going a bit fast for Jamie who's head was still quite sore and as he staggered abit the lead Pao's expression softened.<br>\r\n''Ahh yes you've had a busy night it slipped my mind. Whatever was done to you before we found you two was most likely horrid. Sit down please and catch your breath,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured to the couch which had previously been his hiding place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yu fetch us some drinks and Michiko as well. Sit now sit Jamie please.breath deeply and clear your <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">empty</font>head.''<br>\r\n''Alright.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie sat down against his better judgement but much to the relief of his aching muscles. Had he been this tired the whole time. He struggled just to keep his open in the velvety softness of the couch. Mrs. Featherton may be an insane, undead tickle-maniac but she had amazing taste in upholstery. As he sagged into what he thought was velour but very well could be velvet. Jamie quickly gave up even trying to sit-up and sagged into the softness of the love seat. Pao-Ting noticed the athletic and larger boy fighting to stay conscious and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sleep if you must Jamie. When you wake we will resume the discussions. Be reassured that you are safe and can sleep soundly knowing that you are under my and my servants protection.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jamie's fidgeting grew less frequent Pao-Ting placed a hand upon the the stomach that the slumping boy was practically offering to the girl genius. A wry smile passed her lips at the tired boys attempt to push her hand off. She removed it out of respect for her guest but still the tired amateur detective made note of the girls probe at his sensitive stomach. His eyes seemed determined for this to be his last observation as they finally proved to be heavy even for the strongest one of Summer's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jamie succumbed to sleep an adult Asian woman in a flame-red pantsuit entered and observed the look her young employer was giving the exposed portion of Jamie's stomach that peeked at her tantalizingly from under the loose t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA-HEM<br>\r\n''Ma'am you called for me? Or my sister your brother was unclear.''<br>\r\n''Hmmm? My brother did a less than satisfactory job conveying my orders? While not unsurprising it is still deserving of punishment. How was he unclear exactly?''<br>\r\n''It was....hard to understand him through his laughter.''<br>\r\n''Ahh I wouldn't dare to deny abit of fun between a bride-to-be and her betrothed as well her sister.''<br>\r\n''For that I thank you. Truly I and my sister are blessed to work for such a generous debutante detective.''<br>\r\n''You make me blush Ma-''<br>\r\n'We work not for thanks my lady Ting. Between the employment and the hand of such a dashing young  man I and my sister owe more than enough to you. Please refrain from adding to the debt without thinking Miss Ting.''<br>\r\n''Clearly I'm blessed to have you two working for me. To get such loyalty in exchange for such a disappointing brother. I'm the one taking advantage of you two clearly.''<br>\r\n''Mmm My lady the preparations are ready in the other room. We can proceed with your plan at your signal. Ms. Susan is secure as well. Your sister is searching now for Ms. Summer and to pin down the uncaptured clowns. The prince we believe has left the building.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frustrated Pao-Ting stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well this can be handled. I know what I want and we'll move forward with...''</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>''Yes we'll move forward with getting Chris to give me his hand.''<br>\r\n''In marriage?''<br>\r\n''In time. For now dating will suffice. I am a patient girl with realistic expectations of what is to be between two of our age. He will of course be moving into the Pao household as a live-in boyfriend.''<br>\r\n''Of course''<br>\r\n''To keep him safe from my vengeful enemies and of course Summer's lies about me.''<br>\r\n''Truly you are as gracious a girlfriend as an employer,''<br>\r\n''Thank you. Now is all prepared with Chris?''<br>\r\n''Yes. I and my sister personally and respectfully changed his attire according to your instructions personally. He has yet to awaken and is bound and awaiting you his future bride.''<br>\r\n''Excellent. You and your sister understand the ruse? We will deceive him into my debt at first and love will surely come from their once he's away from Summer and other distractions. He'll of course realize my many charming, adorable and wonderful features than realize that love for me is the logical choice for any young male.<br>\r\n''Eventually he'll realize the luck he has for a girl genius like you to even be interested in him. He'll have no choice but to marry you out of sheer gratitude. However what of him my lady?''<br>\r\n''Hmm? Oh Jamie you mean? At the moment he only carries a a minor use. Find out what you can about the Prince's forces from him than he can be used by you and your sister and you as you see fit. Simply find out if the clown we captured is one of those he ran into the release him, use him, it does not concern me. Chris is what occupies my mind now and he will be mine.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Featherton laughing was the last thing that Chris remembered, She'd asked where the boys wanted to go and they'd all yelled different things then he ended up... Behind a couch? His head hurt so bad that just ended up closing his eyes and now he was here?!<br>\r\nWhat had happened in the mean time? His wrists and ankles being bound was new, At least his hands were bound in front of him so he could admire the manicure that had he'd seemingly had. Being gagged was a new touch but at least whatever it was tasteless in the young boy's mouth, Humiliating as he felt the drool slip down his chin but the tastelessness was a plus. Who had ever kidnapped him this time was considerate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecapping in his head the things usually helped him calm down in situations like this. Number one he was gagged and bound, Number two he was no longer behind a couch and was now lying on a very plush and ornate king size bed. He would be very happy if he was here of his own free will. Number three he knew for a fact that the socks he had on were not his. Considering how many things in this house had tickled his feet even the relatively thin feeling socks were a welcome comfort.Granted while they felt odd they were better than nothing. D or whatever number he was on and far and away the most important one. His undies were gone. Whatever kept his nethers from the cold air was not the tighties he wore and instead felt almost,..satin-y? While his new attire did feel somewhat nice the small bits of lace he could feel rub on his skin made him think it wasn't something he would've picked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris's mental inventory was disrupted by the sound of a door opening. He could barely see in the dimly lit room there were a few candles to give Chris a dim look at a small female silhouette sneaking into the room. She seemed frightened fat least from what little Chris could tell. He wished he could call out to her but the gag stopped him. A bang at the door made both of them jump in the dark. The small silhouette started frantically feeling around in the dark looking for a hiding place. Chris decided that the scared shadow was better than the angry one outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started raising and thumping his bound ankles as hard as he could. Hoping he could use what little sound he could make on the thick and rather comfy comforter to signal her. Thankfully it seemed like she heard his efforts as she moved towards the bed. Upon finding it she felt around the edges before seemingly discovering the sheets. She then worked them up with some seeming difficulty before crawling under them to hide. She moved deeper them before bumping into him. He groaned desperately for her to help him, Begging for her to help him. Instead she felt around him, Probing and poking at the bound boy before finding her way to the head of the bed and peeking herself out from between the pillows that Chris's aching head was resting between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">''Hello?''<br>\r\n''Mmmmphh''<br>\r\n''What?!''<br>\r\n''Mmurgh''<br>\r\n''I don't understand.''</font><br>\r\nChris knew that voice. It was Pao-Ting! She'd menaced Summer, Jamie and Mouse but been weird around him, enough for him to recognize it. Please, Please, Please let her help him here.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">''MMUUMMA''<br>\r\n''Wait are you gagged <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">baby</font>?<br>\r\n'''Mmmmp?''<br>\r\n''Hold on<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">cutie</font>.''</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands felt around in the dark over his face. She was seemingly looking for his gag but spent an inordinate amount of time on his cheeks as if it would be there! After what could easily be miscontrued as a tickle of a his nose leading to an embarrassingly cute sneeze(Which seemed to make her hold him tighter?) she found it. She slowly removed it to save her beloved any pain and finally allowing him to swallow some air that wasn't tinged with rubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">''GUUUGGHA! T-Thank you soo-oo''<br>\r\n''Shhhh be quiet Chris<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">baby</font>. She was right behind me! Quick get under the sheets with me. We can hide here in the dark. QUICK!''<br>\r\n''What?! No! Besides I can barely move they tied me up!.<br>\r\n''What? Did she? Than if I mess with you she'll know someone was in here... Then she'll get us both and I can't stand to be tickled anymore.''<br>\r\n''Please Pao-Ting! I don't know who put me here but when I ended up here I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.''</font><br>\r\n''W-w-what?! Wh-why wou-would you look for m-m-me?!''<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">''Your brother chose where we should go.  We ended up here and I passed out. Whatever happened between then and now I don't know! I wouldn't lie about this just help me!''<br>\r\n''You could be-''</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were silenced as the door opened an inhumanly long set of arms began feeling their way along the frame in shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">''Please help me! I'm begging you here. EVERYTHING HERE TICKLES!''<br>\r\n''Keep it down, I know.''<br>\r\n''Pleaaase untie me.''</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms were attached to what seemed to be a large mass of twitching rags. As the strange creature entered the room. The very room seemed to rattle with the guttural moan. As almost comically long arms started fumbling along the wall Chris's pleas grew more desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">She is really playing that part well. This is working almost too well.</font><br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">''Untie me!''<br>\r\n''There's no time! She's looking for lights! I'll just hide you under the sheets with me! Lie flat and be still!'' <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Where did she get that costume?!

Which picked up a candle and started towards the bed.Ting pulled the boy under the sheets and comforters with her causing his breath to hitch in his throat and for second the boy almost forgot the situation he was in.<br>\r\nAnother strange moan rattling off snapped him back to all his too terrifying and potentially ticklish predicament with Pao-Ting. Chris held his breath and tried to lie as flat as possible in his bound state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''We'll do this every night soon. Once I deal with Summer and the Clowns.''</font><br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">''What was that?''<br>\r\n''Keep quiet! Do you want her to find us?''!<br>\r\n''You talked first though!?<br>\r\n''Shut up or I'll make you Chris!''</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange long arms thudded down hard on the bed cutting the little lovers quarrel short. The hunter snaked it's impossibly long limbs across the top of the sheets looking for the source of the noise. They slithered along before finding the first bump they could and feeling around the strange lump. Unfortunately it was Chris's left foot and his brand new nylon socks honestly seemed to make his feet even more ticklish. He thanked whoever was listening for the thick comforter otherwise he knew there'd be no way he'd be able to keep quiet. He squirmed and quivered under the sheets despite Pao-Ting doing her best to hold her prize still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''What is she doing?

She quieted the tickly damsel with her own lips and pulled Chris's head in for a deep kiss. While Chris's face now reddened for a different reason and his own laughs were quieted by Pao's kiss which totally had no ulterior motives at all the strange hands discovered Chris's toes and pulled them apart. Chris threw his head back and laughed unfortunately this led to him involuntarily adding some tongue into the situation with Pao-Ting. While she was understandably shocked she also wasn't exactly unhappy with the situation and made a rare (Or so she thinks) mistake and reciprocated. Now wrapping both hands around the back of Chris's head and even wrapping her legs around the boy. Suddenly the young lovers(?!) were interrupted by.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After almost ten minutes of keeping Chris trapped in the lip lock. The girl genius finally had to break the hold. She couldn't contain herself though. She'd kissed the boy she'd wanted since she'd first laid eyes on and he was now completely helpless under him bright red and defenseless before her. The sheer joy at her own victory and just her imagining of him as her's, HER'S AND NOT SUMMER'S! It was too much for the normally composed and calculating girl and she was overcome with emotion. From atop her perch on the bound boy, she arched her back and threw her head back then screamed with joy at her own success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">''YEEEESSSS'''</font><br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">wh-wha-huh?</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''MISS TING! WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS INAPPROPRIATE TO SOMEONE OF YOUR AGE! THE TWO OF YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME FOR <i>THAT</i> LATER IN YOUR LIVES! ''<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">''hu-who-who?''</font><br>\r\n''NOO! YOUR RUINING MY PLAN MINION! BE SILENT!''<br>\r\n''<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">wha-</font>Huh!?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward second passed where both the girl genius and her retainer in costume waited and realized their mistakes. Slowly Pao-Ting looked down at an angry Chris below her. Her plan shattered, She stammered and tried her best to pick up the pieces and recoup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wh-what? Ho-how does that ti-tickle monster k-know my na-name?! K-k-keep it do-down Chris yo-you'll get-get us caught.''<br>\r\n''Th-this is all some kind of trick! You were playing with me the whole time on purpose!''<br>\r\n''N-no your par-paranoid Chris.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stammering genius was interrupted by the pathetic apologies of her bumbling servant making things worse.<br>\r\n''My lady Pao-Ting, I am so so sorry. I thought, You know that, So young!''<br>\r\n''Sh-shut up mo-monster. Chr-chris you shut up too or it-it'll fi-find us.''<br>\r\n''YOU DID THIS TO ME! YOU TIED ME UP! WHERE'S JAMIE!? WHERE'S <i>SUMMER</i>!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as before the room went silent. However this time it was Pao-Ting making Chris uncomfortable. She sat up with the sheets still atop her and her still atop Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Say that again.''<br>\r\n''Say wh-what?''<br>\r\n''What you just said. Say.it. again.''<br>\r\n''Wh-where's Summer?''<br>\r\n''So be it, A genius with a company is not enough for you but a pre-teen do-gooder is what you 've got at the front of your mind! Whichever one of you is in that ridiculous costume. Bring me all of the tools you usually saved for ''punishing'' brother. Send the lotion tray as well and be quick about it. Tell your sister to prepare for a stage three massage that will require the stocks. Chris has chosen the hard way for him discover his love for me.''<br>\r\n''Yes my la-''<br>\r\n''NOW!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhichever sister it was left the room as fast as she could still wearing her honestly very convincing costume. All Chris could hear though was the loud thumping footsteps before the slamming of the door left Chris once more alone, In a dark room, bound and trussed beneath the sheets except now he had a very mad Pao-Ting on top of him. As the girl genius fumed she pulled out a small light and shined it in the boy's face to disorient him before pulling back with it to look him over. She admired the improvements she'd made to him during his nap after the ghost of the Madam Featherton had so graciously delivered him and his friend's to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lacey panties were definitely his color and highlighted the paleness of his thighs, or at least what could be seen above the nylon which was a little touch but based on Chris's reaction's earlier a very successful one. Due to the tight bindings that had been bound around his wrists as well as ankles, the newly applied manicure that Mariko and Machiko had given the boy was unharmed.<br>\r\nHis cuticles had been nicely rounded and even painted Pao-Ting's very favorite color, cyber pink. Had the boy not seemed to be awakening the two sisters would have continued on with the pedicure as per her instructions. Most likely the two had distracted themselves once more with Pao-Yu and shirked their duties. She would handle this later as well as the finishing of Chris's makeover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he promised himself to her, He would still have to brought before her mother and father and it wouldn't due for him to look scruffy in the least. A little blush, some nice cyber pink lipstick and a good washing of his hair in some strawberry scented shampoo  would do. She would do the last part personally of course. She looked forward to running her fingers through his hair. How would he look with some highlights? Perhaps cyber pink?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Pa-Pao-Ting can-can we talk?! What is that you want? Ple-Please let me go and I'll get it for you.''<br>\r\n''What do I want? Sweet Chris I want you. I want you and me to be a thing.''<br>\r\n''W-Wh-What? That's why you did this!?''<br>\r\n''Yes Chris, That is why.''<br>\r\n''Well I wouldn't mind one or two dates. We could have that. Just help me find Summe-''<br>\r\n''YOU! ARE! NOT! LISTENING! You will not be seeing Summer as you are mine.''<br>\r\n''Wai-''<br>\r\n''No. What I want is your hand. You will move into the Pao household and live with me.''<br>\r\n''Uh.''<br>\r\n''You will wear what I choose. You will eat with me only and will train to be my future bride.''<br>\r\n''You mean groom?''<br>\r\n''No I look very good in a suit. Meanwhile you have arms MADE for a bridal dress and feet that belong in heels.''<br>\r\n''Wait I-''<br>\r\n''We will not rush my sweet baby. We will prepare you to be a proper husband for me and a proper son-in-law to my parents.''<br>\r\n''Ok now that's too much!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting relaxed abit letting the sheets fall atop the pair. She pulled Chris over and into her arms and snuggled her face into his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ahh-''<br>\r\n''Shh my love.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hot breath upon his flesh caused the boy to break down into a stammering mess who could barely sputter out a denial of her ridiculous request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''N--n-n-n-n-noo Th-thaaaaaahhaat's too muuuuhhhh'''<br>\r\n''What was that my love? I'm afraid I could not understand you.''<br>\r\n''Aaaaahhhh Ppppaaoooww pppllee-AHHAAA Wwahhat's thahat noho''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris's mewling went up an octave as an unexpected invader dug itself into his hip. At some point while she had been experimenting with boiling Chris's neck with her breath she'd wriggled her petit size 7's and dug it into his hip bone. Despite her reserved exterior somehow she was amazingly dexterous with her toes and was wiggling his hip bone between her big and index one causing the sleuth to go wild. He tried to edge away from it on instinct and ended only wrapped tighter into Pao-Ting's arms. The sheets lied heavily across his face and every breath he took led to him choking on top of his sputtering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''See Chris? you can't keep yourself ut of my arms. You love it there and know that's where you belong. You love it there just imagine it every day in the Pao household.''<br>\r\n''Thahat sohounds bahahad, I dohon't want this every dahahay, I can nyoohot take it.''<br>\r\n''Oh? So you wish to keep playing hard to get my sweet bride?''<br>\r\n''I wahahana play stohop this''<br>\r\n''Then say I love you Pao-Ting. I pledge myself whole and bodily to you as both a bride and property.''<br>\r\n''Thahahat's a really bad deal.''<br>\r\n''Just wait Chris. It'll get worse then.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a quick nip to Chris's abused neck before crawling down. As Chris desperately gasped for air he didn't even think about where the mischievous genius had crawled off to. He just swallowed as much air as he could and savored the respite from Pao-Ting's ''courting'' attempts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Please no more! Pao-Ting please noo more have mercy!''<br>\r\n''Mercy? Chris I have nothing but mercy. You are my husband after all. I will admit I do looooove tickling you though. How Summer kept someone with such a cute laugh around and never just tickled your brains out was always the thing I hated most about her.''<br>\r\n''We're not marrieDIHI!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe protests of the future Mr. Pao were quickly turned into another in a series of unmanly squeaks that he'd made on this adventure as one sole little finger found her way to very center of one of his poor little soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yet my darling. Yet is the word you were looking for before I so rudely interrupted you. I don't really think I can be blamed though. I wish you could see it Chris, I was just crawling through and look what I found all wrapped up like a cute little present JUST FOR ME!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grasped his index toe and wiggled she let out an almost imperceptible squeal herself. Chris as a trained detective would have observed under normal circumstances. However at the moment he was far too busy choking on the sheets he'd stuffed into his mouth to keep from laughing, When that same adventurous finger resumed it's wandering but now on the underside of his trapped toe causing those weird feeling nylons to rub along his sensitive flesh it caused Chris to gasp and draw those sheets down into his mouth and begin choking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh? Here let me help my love.'' <br>\r\n''Gahghkk''<br>\r\n''Let me just slip off the other shoe...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her once again shockingly educated feet she undid her other ballet shoe with her toes than used both sets of her fiendish cuticles to pull the sheets out. As Chris once more went back to gasping for air they stroked his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Th-thank you''<br>\r\n''You are my betrothed. Granted I would like more of a treat. Marry me then?''<br>\r\n''St-st-still no, sor-sorry.''<br>\r\n''Then how bout this? Give your savior a kiss?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offending foot placed itself right in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I-I-I do-don't-''<br>\r\n''My sweet how about this? Sample my sole or I'll unwrap these tasty treats before me.''<br>\r\n''Wait nw Pao-Ting please!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punctuated her threat/promise/proposal with a snakish almost forked tongue poked him right in the ball of his foot. Even these weirdly made nylons couldn't stop him from feeling either the heat, wetness or lust that was barely being kept from his defenseless toesies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well Chris? Kiss or bite? it's your choice.<br>\r\n''HEEELLLP! JAAAMIE, SUMMMMER ANNYONE! PLLEASE!! I'm too young for matrimony!''</span></div></div>",

I'll date you sure but let's be reasonahahble staAHAP''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting was savoring the squirming nylon-clad toes she had in her hands. The materials weren't just regular nylons like her stupid brother was parading around in against his will. This material was specially created by herself and stitched together by the nimble fingers of Mariko. The fibers were specially treated to increase the sensitivity of the skin it would rub against an effect which Chris was definitely feeling. Just holding the feet still was causing him to squirm under her like a worm and stammer his pleas for mercy, freedom and bachelordom. As she pushed her nail through the fabric she herself even gave a little giggle she was a bit giddy herself at the idea of peeling them off the feet like a pretty little candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fantasizing was interrupted by a hot and wet feeling quickly pecking her sole causing her to sit up suddenly. A smile crept over face as she realized she'd just won this little battle and was well on her way to winning the war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''See Chris? Was that so bad?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly Chris thought to himself it really wasn't. Pao-Ting was not an unattractive girl. She'd always been a bit shy around him in Summer and his previous encounters although he really wished this wasn't how she'd chosen to get her confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now do it again.''<br>\r\n''What?! No you got what you wanted.''<br>\r\n''What I want is you Chris but this is just buying you some time. Yes you gave a little chaste grandma kiss but that's not what I wanted my love. What I want is you to passionately kiss to save your  twins that I've got down here. I'd love nothing than to tickle the bejeezus out of them as I simply love your cute little feet but they're begging for you to save them Chris.<br>\r\n''Oh Chris please save us! Pao-Ting's deft fingers are torturing us with the kind of a precision and preparedness only a genius could achieve. Please we just can't take anymore and you already did it once so just do it again but better.<br>\r\nNo Chris y'know I kinda like getting tickled by Pao-Ting since she's your future wife and our future owner and all. Kinda can't wait for all the games of footsies her amazing adorable feet are gonna play with us and really look forward to be being stroked, petted and kissed by her every night and tickled every day. But uhh yeah I'm your other foot and you should kiss her's cause this is kinda inevitable bud.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe switched to a rather high-pitched and insulting tone while doing that bit, Chris would like to think his feet had abit of a more manly tone. At least he would have if he wasn't so busy currently kissing Pao-Ting's left foot like it was the love of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh Chris see?'' Was that so wrong? Can you not see that we're meant to live together as a happy couple, I mean when was the last time you spent this much time with Summer?''<br>\r\n''The lahast time she didn't tihihckle me into mahaharrihiage''<br>\r\n''My lady Pao-Ting? I have returned with the tools and tray''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris's heart caught in his throat at the return of a familiar voice. That was Mariko or either Maruko, Whichever one it was had brought along a plethora of toys,tools and whatever was on the tray. Chris tried one more time to scream for Jamie,Mouse or Summer to save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''PLLLEEHEE-''<br>\r\n''Do shut up my love. Jamie is in the care of my retainers and Mouse was captured by the Clown Prince. You can hear her laugh throughout the top floor.<br>\r\n''Thehehen Suhuhghmmeher'' <br>\r\n''I've no idea where my rival hides in this place my darling.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of crawling around under the sheets outside of Chris's vision she appeared once more and pulled him into her arms she hugged the boy's head close into her own chest. Before Chris could even attempt to push her back he felt the sheets lifted and his ankles roughly grasped and pulled. His poor boys were dragged out of the warm cocoon which he'd een tortured in for so long and exposed to the cold air. A tight cord was bound around both the boy and the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, hey wait what!?''<br>\r\n''My baby take a breath. Do not worry it is simply the girls preparing you for a pedicure. As a future member of the Pao household you must be presentable from head to each adorable little toe.''<br>\r\n''Wait but I kissed your foot! You promised that you'd leave my feet alone in exchange!''<br>\r\n''I did darling. I said that if your lips did not greet my feet that yours would suffer at my hands and teeth,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris felt a finger sneak under each sock and his sense of betrayal grew along with urgency (Another thing grew which he prayed Pao-ting wouldn't notice.) He scrunched his toes desperately to try to keep the tickle worsening fabric as protection. It was yanked away leaving his piggies to curl up in the withering cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Thehen what's up heeheere?!''<br>\r\n''You'll notice my hands are holding you steady Chris. Showing the compassion of a lover to you for going through this ordeal. Honestly I think your acting like a child but like an understanding wife I am comforting my husband and peppering his delightful face with kisses to calm you. My mouth you also might notice is nowhere near those soon to be pedi'ed piggies. What my employees do is of their own accord.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was about to argue on the unfairness of the deal when the aforementioned peppering caused him to feel salty at Pao-Ting's clever wordplay. He tried to push her off and end the shower of cyber pink kisses but when he felt an unexpected shower of warm soapy water on his bare feet he instead ended up jumping and squealing like a small animal even deeper into Pao-Ting's grasp figuratively and literally.When the brush covered in the same soapy, warm water was added well Chris lost all shame and ended up burying his face into her chest and forgoing all of his reservations in his desperation to hide his laughter from his captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh-oh Chris yes.See baby is that so bad? All that fuss for nothing and don't you feel silly for putting on such a show.''<br>\r\n''Nooho teell them to stop yoou prohahamased. Nahahat faiir.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chris instinctively snuggled deeper into her chest he tried to weakly voice more protest but was silenced by yet another storm of kisses upon his upturned face. While trying to struggle though that he suddenly felt a warm towel envelop his poor little exposed feetsies once more he buried his face in the lady Pao-Ting to his own chagrin and burning displeasure. She responded by proceeding to pet the quivering boy she pinned to her while her minions outside the silk cocoon fluff dried her future fiance's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">'No-no-no-no''</font>''<br>\r\n''Chris it's only a pumice stone. The skin it removes is long dead and only served to make those model's feet of yours worse in almost every way. Without it they'd be rougher, scalier and less sensitive.''<br>\r\n''A whatHAAGHH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris felt an unforgivingly strong yet unforgettably soft hand wrap itself around the short little toes of his left foot and bend them back gently but still very firmly pulling his sole tight. He tried desperately to shield or free it with the other but was just batted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''My lady Pao-Ting it would be better if he could be face up.''<br>\r\n''Understood. Upsy-daisy with the baby.''<br>\r\n''Wait no please I'm not a baby. LET ME GOHOHO!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl genius lifted Chris up almost effortlessly and flipped him over so that he was now lying on his back on her stomach atop. Once more she showed her own flexibility by entwining her own legs into his and digging her toes into the sensitive backs of his knees. The girl genius stroked his hair as he squirmed atop her and whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Shhshh Chris the best part is to come. They are quite savvy.''<br>\r\n''Wha-OHOooh''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris felt a a rear seat itself across his ankles and his squirming ceased. His toes were bent back once more and as he felt them be individually singled out and something light and fluffy placed in between each of them. Whatever the offending cottony material was it didn't feel terrible to the boy and the other hands skilled fingers beginning to rub and pamper the boy's soles further soothed his protests. As he felt the lightest of brushes begin to paint his toenails he wondered if it would truly be so bad with her? Pao-Ting's breath wasn't unpleasant in his ear and she was clearly a lady of means. That she was so mean as to do this to him and call it courtship was the only real sticking point here. There was also her toes dug into the backs of his knees on the con side as well. Still what choice did he have at this point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Just give up Chris. I've put up with your adorably pouty fits despite only trying to make you more presentable. I've saved you from ghosts, clowns and unappreciative detectives sheltering you from all of their tickly advances here in my arms. I've even magnanimously forgiven you for ruining my genius plan to convince you to marry me. Just give in Chris!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crash in the distance made Pao-Ting jump abit but at this point Chris was so out of it that he wasn't concerned. Pao-Ting however was always wary even in her moments of triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''See what that is at once!''<br>\r\n''My lady is it wise to leave you-''<br>\r\n''NOW!''<br>\r\n''At once.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris's feet were finally left alone as the henchman went to discover the source of the commotion. His socks had been cut off, his nails had been painted and cotton balls had been stuffed in between the boys cute little toes He was basically a bound present wrapped up tight in Pao-Ting's lap and there was nothing he could do about it. How bad could being married really be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud crash was heard again but Chris didn't pay attention when the door slammed open loudly though this time both of the bed buddies jumped in there hidey hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''WHO'S THERE!? IDENTIFY YOURSELF!''</span></div></div>",

The normally dangerous and dextrous girl genius was thrown unceremoniously in a bundle of silk sheets on the floor.

Th-th-thank you!''<br>\r\n''No time move now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe malevolent pile of rags flailed and screeched for her guards and her brother's punishment as he unbound her bride to be and hustled him off the bed and towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''MARIKO!

We need to move now they'll be here to help her soon!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys ran down the hallway and into a large drawing room. While Pao-Yu checked each door and found them locked Chris looked desperately for a hiding place. He spotted a large cabinet, a rug and a sofa all of which seemed far to obvious as the harried older brother now held the door shut against the banging fists of his fiendish family. He needed to hide and as he looked around desperately any place would do. <br>\r\nEven that air vent! He dove and ripped it off before crawling in backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''YU!'' <br>\r\nHe called to his companion who turned to run toward him before the door broke open behind him and Mariko,Machiko and the girl genius Pao-Ting came running in and pounced upon the boy. <br>\r\nChris frantically replaced the vent to cloak his hiding place<br>\r\nMeanwhile the trio carried the struggling boy to the couch. He briefly caught the the boys eye before Machiko placed the boys head in her lap and wrenched so that their eyes locked as her sister straddled the boy's chest while Ting pulled his stocking claden feet into her own lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yu,Yu,Yu now why would a boy as smart as you do something so dumb. My dear brother after I went to the trouble of finding such a darling bride to be-''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachiko proceeded to lightly tickle the boy's nose until...<br>\r\n''SSCHnneew!''<br>\r\nHe pathetically wiggled and sneezed in the iron clad grasp of the three harpies as both of the twins giggled until a stern look from Pao-Ting silenced them.<br>\r\n''That you'd lead my husband away after all I've done to help such a useless thug as yourself. You are truly the worst big brother in history.''<br>\r\n''Unnggh I've told you I d-don't want thahhaghaha''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dissolved into chuckles as his younger sibling spidered her fingers up one of his arches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Blah-blah-blah You'll do what I say. I stepped in to take you as a minion after you got arrested and if it wasn't for me mother and father would've seen you off to jail for embarrassing them. You're under my control and no longer a member of this family as far as they see it. Would you rather be Ling's toy? He always used to love playing with his big brother whenever you were silly enough to forget to lock your door.''<br>\r\n''NO! PLEASE!''<br>\r\n''That Mariko even wants to give you a chance back into the family is something that you should have to beg her for.''<br>\r\n''I'm begging you not too! Please Ting have a heart I'm your big brotherrhehe''<br>\r\nTing plucked one of her brothers prettily nylon clad toes and wiggled it around between her fingers to remind him of his situation.''<br>\r\n''That didn't matter to me when I set you up dear brother and it still doesn't bother me now.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mariko lightly scratched her manicured nails along the tight skin of the captured Pao brother she softly laughed at her her own husband to apparently be's predicament giving Chris a new look at how his own situation didn't seem to be a new thing with this family. The idea that this was how such a wealthy family did things was oddly terrifying actually no it was full on terrifying as it means that Pao-ting might have someone to share tips and trick with on how to get her own man namely himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''My lady Pao-Ting do not worry yourself over the mewling of my husband to be.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was once again watching a friend of his captured for trying to help him. <br>\r\n(They were friends by now right? Friends save friends from ghosts and geniuses.)<br>\r\n''That he wails and resists so is honestly rather endearing to one such as I. His wiggling and squirming at my hands will lead to his will broken and my own skills further sharpened.''<br>\r\nShe rolled Pao-Yu's shirt up and circled a finger randomly around his chest as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''My dear betrothed your darling little sister's point is plain. You may have noticed that at the moment we are merely playing. You know where your future brother in-law is hiding and your sister is graciously offering you the chance to tell us where he is. Refuse my dear and well my own protests will not be too loud.''<br>\r\n''They will most likely be unheard over you begging us to stop my to-be brother in-law. My younger sister forgets her place as you do yours. Tell us where the young boy hides or you will be disciplined.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachiko twirled a finger around Pao-Yu's causing both her captive and the cowering Chris to cringe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Machiko his last name will soon be Pao so that is how you should be referring to him. Young master Pao-Chris has such a delightful ring to it that I cannot wait. However Yu punishment can be avoided tonight. Tell me where Chris is and things will go easier. You will be forgiven for your betrayal. You will be allowed to return to the ranks of my followers under the watchful eyes of Mariko.''<br>\r\n''My lady may I interject?''<br>\r\n''Why to make it wo-''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariko went down on her future husband cutting him off with a wet sloppy raspberry..<br>\r\n''MMHHMPPBBTT''<br>\r\n''HAHAHAHANOOOHO PLLAHAAASSS''<br>\r\nAs she went for a second blast into her hopeful hubby's belly her sister continued.<br>\r\n''AHHHAAEEEHHWWHH''<br>\r\n''To propose a change in your offer my lady, Yu tell us where Chris is hiding and you will be free to go. While my sister and lady are busy you are free to try to escape this mansion.''<br>\r\nMariko looked up from her meal pausing to roll his outie between her teeth.<br>\r\n''What?''<br>\r\n''Precious younger sister our ladies goals are ours and our own are secondary to those.''<br>\r\n''Than you let your toy go! Why do I have to give up mine?''<br>\r\n''What I do with the young Jamie is my own buisness and has no bearing on this. Pao-Yu wants to leave the family? Let him, His loss is his own and he is welcome to try to escape.''<br>\r\n''OHH BIG LOHOHOHOSSS GAAHHAHA *wheeze*''<br>\r\n''MMMPPPBBBTTTAAFF''<br>\r\n''As resourceful as you are dear sister it will be no trouble I'm sure to find him on your own.''<br>\r\n''I do like a hunt.''<br>\r\n''My lovely twin retainers you do me proud.''<br>\r\n''Or twist in our hands. I won't complain. You will but you'll stop using words quickly.''<br>\r\n''Why don't you have to give up Jamie but I've got to let my ticklish little slut go?''<br>\r\n''Machiko your plan is almost genius. If I had come up with it would have been genius but that's as good as you'll get. Where is Chris Yu? Tell us and we'll let you go. ''<br>\r\n''Awwww''<br>\r\n''Disappoint my little sister Yu and you'll make mine so very happy.''<br>\r\n''PPBBBTTTPP!''<br>\r\n''GAAAAHHAAHA MAHAREEHEEKOHO NOOOHOHO!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pao-Yu flailed his eyes momentarily lit upon Chris and the young truth seeker knew. Pao-Yu knew exactly where he was. He'd known this whole time and hadn't said anything though to rat out out his friend. They were friends right!? He tried to start quietly moving himself backwards in the duct and away from the vent but an accidental impact with his elbow into the unforgiving steel let slip an involuntary hiss of pain and caught Pao-Ting's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''There's my dear boy. He's in here somewhere and YOUR! GOING! TO! SAY! WHERE!''<br>\r\nShe viciously punctuated each word by dragging all five of her strategically manicured nails up her brothers stockinged,still and sensitive soles. He jumped at the end of each word while Mariko and Machiko cooed sadistically at his interrogation. Machiko bent over and rubbed her nose against the hysterical young adult in this situation due to his own little sister who evidence pointed further to being the devil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Aww. I've ripped the lovely nylons I gave to you my brother. You know the ones that I designed to make skin twice as sensitive? See what love does to your dear little sister? It causes me to lose control and damage the lovely gift I got you. Tell me where he's hiding and I'll take these off you Yu. I planned on leaving these on you until your birthday next year when we rolled out the new model but this is the deal I'm giving you Yu!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris felt something behind him and his breath caught in his throat at the feeling of another vent. As he pushed against it the lack of any give at all told him that he wasn't that getting that off through force. His inability to turn around in the vent also ruled out any chance of finessing it off. He was trapped like a rat well within arm's length of the vent he entered through. If Pao-Yu gave him up there was nowhere for him to go when they came for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was totally and completely trapped. Jamie was apparently being groomed to also join the family. Summer was laughing her head off for the Clown Prince's band and who knows where Mouse was at this point. If his assumed friend gave him up he would be back in Pao-Ting's hands with nobody left to save him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Yu was finnaly allowed to draw breath and give an answer and it was!</span></div></div>",

The scared Chris tried to get further back into the dead end he was trapped in but quickly found himself pulled out of the vent kicking and screaming.<br>\r\n''AHHNOO!! LET ME GO! NONONO!''<br>\r\n''Oh Chris my darling why would you hide in such a dusty and dirty place?! Look at you your filthy! Well it doesn't matter my adorable boyfriend as your back where you belong now. Come along my retainers and bring the night's captured game. We'll be using the goats at the stables to fast track our wedded bliss.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rained kisses upon her captives struggling face while Machiko hefted the youth up .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We'll make both of your cute little feetsies into salt-licks for the horses I saw down there and let nature itself convince you that Chris Pao is the way to go. Mariko come along there's work to be done.''<br>\r\n''Just a second my lady I have some quick work to do.''<br>\r\n''NOOOOO!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris screamed as he was carried off to his fate while Mariko flipped the giggly traitor Yu over onto his stomach with little resistance. She sat herself atop her fiance's thigh's and smiled while unlocking the clasps keeping the special nylons on the young masters legs before pulling them off roughly. She took a deep smell of the freshly bared soles before idly stroking a finger down the heel towards the poor tired toes that at this point this point barely held enough strength to curl at the approaching digit.<br>\r\n''Nooo-no-nooo you promised no more.''<br>\r\n''Mmmmm we did, yes we did. You're entitled to a break now my but it's gonna break my heart-''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to rain down hard kisses upon the tired soles she was admiring as Pao-Yu could only let out a low moan of protest at this ''torture''. Truth be told this was a welcome if unwanted change from the earlier aggression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''nooooooo''<br>\r\n''Ha you sound just like your friend. Y'know the one just sold out to save your skin? Enjoy the break that got you as I'll be finding you later on my own time once he breaks. The chase is always far more fun than the prize after all and I do feel my own hunting skills have gotten abit rusty. I will miss these in the mean time though.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a loooong slow lick down Yu's sole savoring the weak struggles she felt of her seemingly ex-fiance under her before rolling the young adult over once more and planting an equally long and slow kiss upon the soft lips of her prey before leaving him gasping to go and help her lady with her task.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Pao-Yu awoke it was a slow process. The early 20 year old took a few minutes to piece together everything he remembered and did not like the picture of himself it painted. He was a low down dirty traitor who had just sold the only person in here who'd actually helped him so that some girls would stop tickling him. Not the former heir to a rich families proudest moment at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to should save Chris and y'know pay him back for saving and all. Since the boy had saved him from a supernatural eternity of torture the least he could do was save him.<br>\r\nHowever.... maybe he wouldn't. Pao-Yu was honestly extremely happy at the idea of even a respite from Mariko's cloying, clawing clutches and jumping right back into the lion's den and getting caught wasn't going to help anyone. Chris would probably want Yu to get out of the house first and get some help! Yeah he was a smart kid he'd understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud noise from outside the door made him jump and feel a good bit less cool. Was it his sister coming back for something?! Either way he didn't want a a reunion at all with her or the sisters. Where to go though? All those doors in here were still locked, He scanned the room and his lit upon a realization. Chris had had the best idea in this situation. That vent was the best place to hide but he wouldn't make the same mistake that he did. No sticking around he was going right through so he wouldn't get caught like Chris was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped to his hands and knees and scrabbled through as he heard the door being opened. Ha! He thought to himself. Smell ya later sis! He crawled through towards blatantly open other side of the vent ignoring how obviously suspicious that was and only thinking about his own freedom. When a painted face filled his view of the other side of the room he froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well hiya friend!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong pair of hands reached in and grabbed Pao-Yu by his narrow shoulders and pulled him forward. Not out of the vent mind but with incredible skill just enough so that his head and shoulders were out and his hands were uselessly pinned to his sides by the narrowing vent. He looked around the room and for his attacker and froze as he laid eyes on the Clown Prince himself sitting casually right next to him. Even though Pao-Yu'd never himself been at the hands of the villain working for his sister enough he'd seen the man's skills in action and was deathly afraid of him because.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sooooooo I know you from somewhere.... but where?''<br>\r\n''Uhh I-''<br>\r\n''Hmmm now who do I know that looks..like..you?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter obsessed loon laid down next to the trapped boy and positioned himself so that he almost had him in a headlock. However instead of cinching in the hold he hovered his fingers close to Pao-Yu's unprotected neckbones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wanna talk now? Hmmm''<br>\r\n''Wait I'm-''<br>\r\n''Too slow!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkilled fingers dug into Pao-Yu's neck and scratched up and down the sensitive causing the boy to thrash from side to side in an attempt to evade them. Instead they continued to find and nuisance his collarbones causing Pao-Yu's face to flush and giggles to flow interrupting his attempts to give the Prince what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah-ah I'mmehe neeh Pahahaohoho''<br>\r\n''Sorry little buddy I'm not understanding what you're trying to say.'' Maybe calm down abit and gather your thoughts? Here lemme give you a nice neck massage to calm you down okay Yu?''<br>\r\nWaahahaiitt whahah AHH-HA HAW AHHH NO STAH-HAW-AH-heeeheehee''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Clown interrupted his questioning with a series of aimed lightning fast tickles under his chin before pushing his head down onto the ground and absentmindedly tickling his exposed ear while delivering his monologue now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I always considered myself to be pretty perceptive. I mean not as much as these tenderfooted little detectives you've thrown in with now but y'know good enough to be notable. Let's play a game then! For each thing I get right I'll tape you up abit more! Just laugh if I'm right.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain produced a roll of duct tape to display the terms to the scared young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Your name is Pao-Yu? Gitchie-gitchie!''<br>\r\n''NeeheeheheeeSNNUKK!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Clown Prince took his snort as a yes and ripped off a strip which he placed over the boy's eyes. Thrown into a world of darkness with no way to even tell where the next attack could come. He would've begged to be let go but the Clown Prince continued to tickle the boys poor ears and even ran his own nails down his narrow shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Your the degenerate older brother of Pao-Ting.''<br>\r\nA solitary fiendish finger tickled at the boys nose teasing out more giggles and finally a sneeze.<br>\r\n''eeheheeehhheeahaSNNAWFWW!''<br>\r\n''Aww buddy are you sick? Well we can't have you spreading germs around.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince ripped off another strip of shiny tape placed it roughly over Yu's mouth before running his fingers through the boy's hair. They trailed down into another ticklish assault down the back of his neck. Deprived even of the ability to even scream the boy could only throw his head back and forth and plea into his gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mmmphhhheemmt!''<br>\r\n''Sorry buddy but that's the game! Soooo you've been kicked out of the Pao family because you got arrested and your sister set the whole thing up!''<br>\r\n''Mmmmpphheehmme''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile reciting the trials of Pao-Yu the Prince was applying a few loops of tape around the boys shoulders to bind what little arm movement he had. He flipped him over onto his back and snaked his hands into the vent to get at his bits that weren't in the room. He pulled the boy in further to his trap and scratched through his thin shirt so as to rake his chest. Yu pounded his fists uselessly inside the vent at this game that was made to lose and that he was losing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mmhmmeehmmumm''<br>\r\n''Right again? Told you I was pretty good.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tape now bound his shoulders tight to just above his armpits. The gap between was being fully exploited by the Prince who had wormed fingers in through the cracks and into the boy's sensitive hollows. He thrashed and screamed into the tape as the Clown continued his game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So at some point you got caught by...something in here and had a bad time.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe removed his hands and added some more tape before pulling the increasingly bound boy out of the vent and running his hands down his chest until finding what he was looking for. He idly scratched and toggled Pao-Yu's nipples through his shirt as he went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But it's okay cause you got saved! By Summer's good friends Chris and Jamie! The guy side of the Cackling Creek detective club pulled you my ticklish little side of bacon out of the fire! And you paid them back by?!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Yu couldn't even hear the degrading story the Clown Prince was reciting at this point. The feeling of his nipples being played with was driving him over the edge. At this point the Prince pretty much had him in his lap and as continued to add the tape Yu didn't even stop laughing into his gag. When the Clown Prince got a hold of his ribs and dug his fingers between them his back arched in the vent and kicked his feet so wildly that even the Prince started laughing along with his wiggly, wormy widdle guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hahaha be careful now you wouldn't wanna stub your toe in there! Come on silly boy out you come.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu's hand's were finally free! Fat lot of good it did him though as his arms were solidly taped to his sides. All he could even attempt to was absentmindedly wave them as if he could signal this torture's end. It didn't work as the Prince bent over as and buzzed his lips against the boys exposed little button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''BBBBZZ''<br>\r\n''mmmmMMMGHHEEGgggghhee''<br>\r\n''Aren't you a find?! Only had the pleasure of finding a few outies in my time. They're always so fun.''<br>\r\nAs he wiggled the fleshly little button between his fingers tears ran down Pao-Yu's bright red face. He could only dry heave behind the tape as the Prince pulled all the way out of the vent and hefted him over his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't worry buddy we're going for a ride. The game is still afoot! And I can't wait to get to yours!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carried the bound criminal over to the arm chair in the corner of the room before sitting down and laying the fledgeling adult over his lap like he was setting up a dinner tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So how do you pay the boys back? You sell poor little Chris to your sister to save your own hide! Like a ticklish little piece of meat you watched him get carried off and begged that they wouldn't come back!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the fingers of one of Pao-Yu's hands and bent them back then started tracing an errant finger along the soft palm seeking out the sensitive nerve endings. At this point even the light tickles of that had shaking him his head back and forth, screaming for mercy. The Clown Prince smiled at the reactions as he changed gears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well that's all the past I can get. Now let's see your future my pretty boy. It looks like tonight your going to have a simultaneous good time and really, really bad time.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Clown Prince surreptiously reached back until he found the waist of the boy's shorts. He snuck a finger in and undid the clasp without Yu's knowledge. As the boy's palms disappeared beneath the rapidly approaching tape cocoon that the Prince was giving him the villain laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I've wanted to have your sister in my hands for years but honestly you're just so delightful I've almost forgotten that.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Prince returned to roughly yet delicately tickling the boy's ears that did it. Pao-Yu's wildly kicking legs through sheer force divested themselves of his pants and let only a pair of thin athletic boxers covering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well what do I spy down theeeere?!.''</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the Crown Prince eyed the the bared boxers he couldn't help but notice that apparently the Pao boy didn't totally hate this despite his theatrics. He might just keep him. Despite the dread at what was coming Pao-Yu didn't have the energy. He laid back and gasped through his gag as a combination of sweat and tears streamed off his bright red face under the blindfold he'd been given. The Clown admired his handiwork as he did up another layer of tape on the boy before flipping his charge onto his stomach and placing him across his lap. <br>\r\nThe villain took pity and showed a small bit of affection to his captive, petting his sweaty mop of hair and scratching the boys scalp gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''There,There little guy I know it was rough but don't worry. You've had a HARD life. Born into the soft lap of luxury I bet you were once a pampered little prince.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy whimpered beneath his gag at the uncomfortable sensation of the Prince's nails scratching at his scalp. He didn't hate it because thank all that was holy that it wasn't tickling but he definitely didn't like either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You probably had it pretty good until your little sister came along. Probably for a good bit after that too. It's not like she came out of the womb looking to conquer the world. I've even heard stories about your littlest brother. Quite the terror for a twelve year old and with a fervor even your sister seems to balk at.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu groaned and tried in vain to roll off the chair and away from the Prince's care. Only for a stern yank of his hair to pull him back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh-uh-uh. Man give them an inch and they'll take a mile. I give you a little break and how do you repay me? By trying to bail on our fun game! Right as the good part was coming too! I tried the carrot buddy but you went and made me use the stick.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the boy over into an extremely uncomfortable position. The boy's erect manhood stuck straight out and the Prince trapped  it firmly between his knees. On the other side his hand took a rough grasp of the boy's buttocks. The Clown Prince held the grip hard as he was honestly surprised, The boy had a nice ass. He smacked it. Hard. The boy jumped in his embrace than regretted the involuntary jump as the Prince pushed him down with the same hand and his other still entangled in the boy's hair. Both rudely shoved him back down roughly rubbing the boy's erect penis between his knees. The young adult moaned beneath the tape before jolting at another hard smack to his backside. After lingering to feel the curve of the backside for a few moments the Prince spanked him again and again, and again, and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu couldn't help himself. After every spank from the strong hands of the Prince had him jump and when the Prince would push him back down his sensitive little man would rub between his captors knees. He was doing this to him. The boys head was swimming with all the different feelings that were going through him. Humiliation at what happening to him, At how his buttocks were being tanned and his organ fanned. Pleasure at what was happening down low, The Prince was amazingly skilled and had him sandwiched in just such a way so that the only pain he felt was from the strikes. Rage at how he'd gotten away from his sister just for this!? Fear at what his body might do if this continued it was all swirling in the boy's brains and his body betrayed him to continue to jerk and dance at the Prince's fingers like a sweaty, confused puppet. Just as he was about- nonononon he didn't want to but he needed to! He was going to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That should be about enough.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu was roughly pushed off the couch and out of his pleasure. The boy shook his head and tried to regain his bearings as the Prince tore the boy's boxers down his knees and dropped them right atop the boy's red-hot face. The cold air made it stand even stiffer and that made it easier for the Prince to cup his coinpurse and bind it tight with tape. Cutting him off before he stuck it to the boys stomach with another layer of tape. Yu's bruised and abused buttocks also found themselves disappearing into his cocoon. The Prince snuck in a series of lightning fast tickles to the inside of the boy's thigh's and loved how the pointlessly thumped his head on the floor and howled. Yeah this was a keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What's the matter little buddy? You getting tired? Haven't even got to those feet of yours yet though!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu was in hell. His heart was pounding and his skin was on fire.He tried thrusting his hips inside his cocoon but only managed to appear to be shuddering to the Prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Please! Please! Please I'll do anything you want. I'll give you whatever you want, and I'll do it smiling! JUST PLEASE NO MORE!'' he begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Clown Prince heard while teasing the backs of Pao-Yu's knees was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'''Mmmpgh! Mmmpgh! Mmmpgh nnf-nf mmhheem ffnnn!''<br>\r\n''Concise as ever my little tickle-pillar. Now, now I know exactly what you want don't worry. You'll be wrapped up nice and tight in your cocoon in no time at all!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince tore off another long strip of tape and and tied the boy's ankles tight together. Yu was wrapped up tight from his neck to his ankles. The only movement he was afforded was to lamely wiggle his exposed feet a few inches back and forth. The Prince looked over his handiwork and and smiled. He pulled the boy back to the sofa on his back and placed his feet in his lap while keeping him lying on the floor. Yu's feet were bared and helpless and as the Clown Prince drummed those devilish fingers on the ball of his right foot the boy screamed into his gag uselessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince watched the boy's toe's curl in fright with each tap. He admired his prize. Long toes, soft soles and deliciously pale arches? The boy's quite slender frame combined with his reputation had led the Prince to expect tough and calloused skin. The feet of an athlete. He'd broken those before (They were usually very surprised at how ticklish they were around their blisters.) These though? These were a pair of treasures. These feet had been pampered and very frequently. To be expected of an heir surely but to this degree? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the Prince had known of much treatment the boy had been through to reach this level even his twisted heart may have twinged with sympathy. Not only did the siblings Pao go in twice a month for regular spa treatments as their status allowed but his own sister felt that to be too infrequent a timetable and scheduled herself and her employee's for extra work. Of course she considered Yu part of that group and the boy would always spend his treatment sitting in Machiko's lap as the specialist's scrubbed away at his soles. Painting and massaging while occasionally remarking on the cute couple as she would play with his ears and whisper to him about how any laughter would be punished later. After all of those treatment's he was left with an extremely sensitive pair of of feet, Which was made worse by the late night visits from his younger brother. Yu would bite his pillow and endure as the young Pao-Ling would play with his feet, scrubbing away with his tools, brushes and that damned pumice glove of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince had struck gold. This boy was definitely coming home with him. He lowered his own face into meal and nipped the ball of the boy's left foot which pathetically wiggled while it's owner howled in his gag at the adventurous tongue that began it's journey, It began in the valley before the juicy and plump ball of the boy's foot. The Prince savored the journey as his captive bucked and shrieked uselessly and threw his head back and forth at the unwelcome visitor. The quest continued as the slimy sensation circled his sole before marching right to the top of the ball of Yu's foot. The Prince withdrew his tongue when he reached the peak of Mt. Yu before stabbing it back into the flesh like it was planting a flag of conquest. At this Yu couldn't anymore. With one final arching of his back at the battle on his arches he fell back upon the floor and let the reality sink in. He continued to laugh,sob and beg but the thrashing had abruptly stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''The taste sensation that is sweeping the nation! My boy you continue to amaze me at every chance. Mmmm I'll be keeping you very close.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu's toes didn't even curl as the Prince plucked one of them into his mouth. As he began to gently nibble the digit the Prince observed the pool of sweat and tears that had formed under the boy's head on the carpet, still growing due to the streams flowing from under the tape. Such a beautiful young man who had endured so much brought so low. As the released one toe and pulled in another, he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Damn I'm good. What next? Maybe a reward? More punishment?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bathed and caressed Yu's toe in his mouth using his tongue while he pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince decided on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unbeknownst to the Prince his show had an audience. Watching from the very vent that he had plucked his favorite new toy was none other than the younger sister of Summer Salt and the second member of the detective club. Susan Salt aka Mouse! After inadvertently chasing Pao-Yu right into the Prince's waiting arms by picking the lock to the room Mouse had been just in time to hear Pao-Yu's screams through the vent before he was dragged out and into the Prince's games. She'd had the wherewithal to keep herself quiet as she watched the Prince ravage his victim and at first had been trying to figure out a way to help but around when the Clown had started on the boy's lower half she'd given way to just watching in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time Mouse had been in the detective club along with her sister as well as Chris and Jamie she'd honesly wanted to gag at how Jamie and Chris were constantly trying to one up each other to impress her sister. She was in it for the tickling and honestly always thought that the two boy's were gross for being so obsessed with her clueless sister. Sure she had a good few posters up in her room of cute boys from bands and tv. Plus she herself as she was coming up on that age (Summer had breezed through it like a true airhead instead being way more into mysteries, Though Mouse had noticed that whenever any other girls came near her cute little Chris or mister dark and moody Jamie that she'd get a bit flustered and usually distrust them immediately saying that they clearly worked for Pao-Ting,The Clown Prince or some other villain. They usually did though) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she'd noticed one boy in the dumb adventures that she'd gone along with mainly for the chance to get tickled or dish it out herself.  Pao-Yu she'd found out later was Pao-Ting's older brother. Immediately though Mouse had been smitten with the tall and slender bad boy. She'd regularly ''accidentally'' gotten herself and Chris captured(He was funny to watch get tickled.) in the hopes that Pao-Yu would give interrogate her. Everytime though her damned big sister would save her or Pao-Yu would let them go.(He had his own little sister and as evil as she was, He still had a soft spot for little girls)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis though was an awakening for the young ''sleuth''. The object of her longtime affection was laid out and going through the most vigorous and terrible she'd ever seen had the girl feeling all different kinds of things. She'd always really enjoyed getting tickled but what Pao-Yu was going through right now looked terrible. However...the Clown Prince looked like he was having a blast turning the normally dignified older sibling of Pao-Ting into a blubbering pile of flesh. Mouse kind of wanted to try that herself. Sure the Prince was a bad guy who did bad things but she'd always enjoyed tickling. Pao-Yu looked like he was dying but Pao-Ting herself had always been really dramatic whenever Summer had gotten her hands on her. Maybe her lovemuffin was just being a drama queen about it? There was no way for Mouse to know unless she herself tried out the boy's...sensitivities for herself. Maybe he was a just an amazingly handsome drama queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was snapped back to reality at once when the Prince began to spank the boy. Despite not knowing exactly why she really liked that. Her eyes were glued to the boy's rear as it jiggled, twitched and grew increasingly red with each strike. Any thoughts of helping the boy or of her own retreat disappeared as there was this amazing sight filling her view. When the Prince ended that game and went on to the next she let out an audible sigh of disappointment before covering her own mouth in fear of the Prince hearing her. Thankfully it coincided with Pao-Yu's loudest muffled screech into the tape which the Prince seemed far more interested in. As the Clown moved on to the teasing of the boy's legs she was too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing caution to the wind she scampered out of the vent and took up a new hiding place in the room in the shadow behind an easy chair so that she could get a better view of the ordeal. the way the sweat dripped off the boy's bright red face. Mouse couldn't look away, She wanted soooo badly to touch the boy's red hot skin. She felt it'd burn her from how he screamed into the tape. She wanted to feel his skin under her fingers as he sobbed and begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Prince began the tongue lashing upon the boy's feet she almost moaned. After all this time wondering how the boy's skin felt HOW WOULD HE TASTE! Her own mouth sampling the imagined sweetness of that skin as her gorgeous prey begged her to stop making him so happy. She inched closer as a bemused expression overtook the prince's face. While he sucked the boy's toes and seemingly savored HER prize. She froze in place as the Prince seemed to stare directly at her with an intensity that pinned her in place with it's sharpness. The sadistic smile on the villain widened before he inhaled even more of Yu's poor toes and gave them a loud and disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Slluuuuuurrrrppp!!''<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYu moaned into his gag but didn't even have the strength to wriggle anymore. All his energy seemed to be going into letting off that heat that Mouse wanted so badly to feel. The muffled groans were enticing her forward as the Prince removed the toes and began a rousing game of this little piggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I sh-should help him. He's being tortured!''<br>\r\n''Mmppggff!''<br>\r\n''This little piggy went to market and got tickled for being too cute.''<br>\r\nThe Prince picked on Yu's tiniest left toe by pushing the sopping wet digit back and scratching at it's sensitive little stem.<br>\r\n''This little piggie went home and got tickled in his warm bed.''<br>\r\nThe Prince planted a kiss on the next toe before sucking it between his lips for a quick tongue bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse was beginning to sweat. Not nearly as much as Yu who's face was soaking but the bright color of it made Mouse ache. She wanted so badly to touch it! If only the Prince wasn't here. Then it would just be her and Yu!  Maybe he'd get bored and leave eventually?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''This little piggie had the tickliest lil' feet.''<br>\r\nThis time the Clown inserted his finger next to the eldest Pao heir's middle toe and dragged his nail all along nerve filled skin around it. Yu mmph'ed grrr'ed into his gag with even less energy than usual but still seemed to quiver as the Clown continued his demented take on the nursery rhyme.<br>\r\n''This little piggie had nothing but tickly bits.''<br>\r\nThis time the Prince moved his face in close to the boy's feet and actually touched his cheek to the soles enjoying the feeling of the helpless squirming flesh on his. He lightly blew his hot upon the defenseless digit but at this point he illicited barely any reaction.<br>\r\n''And this little piggie got ticcie,tic-tickled until he went wee-wee-wee all over his home!''<br>\r\nThe Prince brought out the big guns and and trapped the poor,poor by's big toe with his teeth allowing his devilish tongue to ravage the trapped stem and pad. This was actually the Prince's ultimate tickle technique and usually produced desired results which it did today as Yu went stiff and then finally slumped. The Princed gave a few more exploratory pokes before concluding that the boy was now down for the count. He spat out the toe and smiled. That was usually when they toddled off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''All tuckered out? S'okay buddy sleep it off. Pretty sure I saw another way to pass the time. So? Wanna come out there you little rugrat? I don't bite. Much. ''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't think I heard you right my little private eye.''<br>\r\n''I-I want to help. I want to tick-tickle him.''<br>\r\n''Do you? That's not very nice you know. I knew I always had a good feeling about you.''<br>\r\n''I-I don't care.''<br>\r\n''Well isn't this just one of the most interesting nights in recent memory. Come along princess I'll give you a tour then.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince hefted the taped up and dozing dreamboat over his shoulder before picking up the startled detective with the free arm giving her a comfortable seat as the new family exited the room. Mouse never took her eyes off the sleeping,gagged and blindfolded Pao-Yu even as the ambient noises of the manor gave way to the dull roar of laughter emanating from the drawing room. The Clown Prince had seemingly set up his people the willing and unwilling ones alike in there. As poor little Mousey entered she tore herself away from the object of her focus to gawk at all the clown's and their victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''How do you like it? We've been busy tonight.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed they had. As her eyes went around the room they lighted upon a boy from school she recognized being tormented. Poor little Donnie Jeffries was sitting crosslegged atop the lap of a larger clown girl who was also sitting crosslegged. His hands were bound behind her back with a length of rope another of which was wrapped around the farm boy's neck. The grim feeling of the rope around his neck didn't even see to be on poor little Donnie's mind as the clown was using instead digging in and ravishing the poor youngster's toes. Whenever the poor boy slumped forwards the clown pulled him back and shoved her tongue into his ear making his laughter jump a couple of octaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fantastic job as always Cheese get on into those bubbly little toes of his. Our little southern gent there has rough little bunions but we'll get those off and pamper him up nice. Know him my little princess?''<br>\r\n''Y-yes. He's in m-my class. He's n-nice.''<br>\r\n''Nice? A bit too nice. Butter there baited him in with the old ''Please help me.'' routine before bringing our little hero and all ten of his ticklish lil' piglets right to us.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse knew that Donnie was a nice boy and that regularly checked out with the kind of situations he usually ended up in. He'd stick up for some poor girl getting tormented by some of the bullies running around school and usually end up getting the daylights tickled out of him, humiliated in front of everyone or beaten up for his trouble. In one particularly memorable encounter he'd had with the Eastington twins all three at once. Mouse had to admit the she'd always found the boy cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Want to help her with the little farm boy? Cheese is a good teacher and she'll have you, having him screaming his head off soon.<br>\r\n''Hahaha heehllp maaee''<br>\r\n''I'm just just helping you get these tough little tootsies ready for sandal weather pumpkin. How about it little princess want to help me?''<br>\r\n''Mouse? Please,please,please help me! She said she needed my help then she chloroformed me! When I woke up ah was heeheeheerree nooohohoo DOOOHOONN'T!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese dug one back into the her little bundle of joy's toes breaking him back down into a pile of pleading,giggly pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well Mouse? Wanna help her with twinkletoes?''<br>\r\n''No''<br>\r\n''No?''<br>\r\n''I want to tickle him.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed at the sleeping Yu causing the Prince to visibly frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''He's busy sleeping off a ha-ha-hangover.''<br>\r\n''I want to tickle him.''<br>\r\n''Maybe tickle Donnie Boy till he wakes up?''<br>\r\n''I'll wait.''<br>\r\n''....Very well I suppose some other options maybe?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince carried his pampered princess and the poor perpetrator over to one particularly older looking clown who was tormenting three kids around Summer's age. Perched inside a literal gilded birdcage were the aforementioned Eastington Twins Lyle and Sylvia were laughing their heads off back to back with a really cute boy she'd never seen before. The spoiled bullies and the  foreign looking hearthrob all had one socked foot each hanging out of the bottom of the cage. There poor socked feet were all bound together into a tickly bouquet which their tormentor exploited by tickling the bejeezus out of those poor unfortunate soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''How 'bout these ones Princess? This hilarious little hat-trick is just another reason why Old Mr. Flour here is one of our best. He nabbed all three of them while these two were tickling the other. They were so preoccupied tickling their prey that they ended up his! Know them too princess? Friends of yours?''<br>\r\n''J-just those two. They go to my school as well. We're definitely not friends though.''<br>\r\n''W-w-wait no! We-we're totally friends! RIght Mouse?! You're our best friend tell 'em Lyle!''<br>\r\n''Ye-yes thick as thieves we are just like my she said. Tell your new friends we're with you Mouse and to let us out!''<br>\r\n''They're lying. We never got along at all Clown Prince.''<br>\r\n''Ahh? They did seem abit too desperate. How about the other one?''<br>\r\n''Nahaha plehehse being to theeehee stohohoping. Torvol is to behehegging-NOHOHO NAHAT INTO HIHIS TOOHOES!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the other's the stranger was not given a break by Old Mr. Flour and instead found his cute little rainbow kneesocks tweaked and tussled right through the the blonde Eastington's lies. At a gesture from the Prince, Mr. Flour moved over to once more teasing the twins leaving the boy to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ha-hah-heeh thankings for you to helping Torvol. Tickling while being nice, needs to be stopped when it gets hard to breath. Torvol thanks the pretty girl for giving his footsie the chance to rest. Truly you being the light at the end of the tunnel for young poor unfortunate me. Many thanks to you pretty girl.''<br>\r\n''A charmer isn't he Princess? How about tickling our funny foreign friends feet fiendishly?''<br>\r\n''Alliteration is thing you are being good at. A's Plus is your grade from Torvol.''<br>\r\n''I'm good at two things my exuberant captive. Know what the the other is? Give you one guess then you'll get tickled again by Mr. Flour.''<br>\r\n''Maybe is to being niceness and you are letting me to goHOHOHO''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning fast the leader of the Clown's shot a hand through the bars and and hooked one of the young fashionista's armpits and in seconds had the boy falling back onto the Eastington's in out of control desperation. Kind and loving as the twins were they of course did their best to push the boy off of them and incidentally right back to the Prince. All heart those two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Heehee yoooho arrhehee to beheeing goood at thihis AHH GAHA. Maybe to behehehe letting the cuuhuhgghte girl be having GOHO HAHAHA!''<br>\r\n''An interesting proposal eh Princess? Want to tease this trio then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse pouted and once again pointed at the sleeping,sweaty Yu.<br>\r\n''Him. I want him. No offense to you, maybe later. He's why I'm here though. I. Want. HIM.''<br>\r\nThe Prince scowled in annoyance before composing himself once more.<br>\r\n''My princess once more the young Pao heir sleeps. Give him some time to recover under Butter's ministrations. Then my sweet, you can have him to break or reassemble as you wish.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince whistled and a significantly larger clown lady came around the corner and relived him of Pao-Yu who weakly and unconsciously squirmed in her grip as she carried him off up the stairs. The Prince continued on as Mouse craned her neck to try to follow her intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Over here we have Cream one of my most devious lieutenant's and she so far has captured one of the best prizes of tonight.''<br>\r\n''Thank you so much babe. This is one helluva trophy if I can get a minute to toot my own horn.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse understood why lying on the couch with his hands bound behind his back and ball gag in his mouth was one Mouse's teacher. The dignified art teacher who'd always been extremely nice to her and the father of none other than her fellow sleuth Chris. Mr. Eli Sullivan was lying on the couch with his hands bound behind his back and his shirt open laying his thinly muscled chest covered in scribbles bare. His normal stern expression obscured by a ball gag and his dignity replaced with the drool leaking from behind it and dribbling down his chin. Down at his bared feet was a teenage clown girl with an athletic physique who was intertwining her fingers in the early 30 year old fathers toes and occasionally giving them pecks. She smiled as the Prince approached and shifted to a sitting position with the tall man's feet in her lap and displayed them to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''The finest catch tonight goes to Cream who exploited a father's concern for his son to bring us this wonderful canvas. What luck my princess his feet seem fresh off a cleaning and prepared for a brand new work of art.''<br>\r\n''Our darling daddy's a feisty one but I'll hold him steady as can be for you sweetie. You can draw, fingerpaint or write as much as you want until it's time for his bath. I got a bit bored while I was waiting though and doodled abit on papa's pecs.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse's eye's observed the happy faces drawn over the man's pink nipples and the various bullseyes all across his ribs, stomach and chest. Adorning a rib on each side was a message in flowery cursive <i>Baby Daddy Back Ribs</i>. Drawn on the side of the side of Mr. Sullivan's chinin the same style was <i>He actually loves this.</i> though it was starting to run due to the tidal wave of drool escaping from behind the ball-gag. His eyes looked pleadingly at the friend of his son before rolling back into his head at the devilish stroking of Cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''How about it sweetie? Wanna have some bonding time with your new best friend Cream?''<br>\r\n''Who'll it be Princess? I know you want Yu, Man I'm funny but you'll need to settle for the minute while me and Butter clean him up.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one will it be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'll be having such a time showing a daddy here a good time that she'll love it.''<br>\r\n''Take good care of them both Cream.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince walked off as Mouse crawled over and stared at the bound and twitching feet of her friends father and her favorite teacher as well. Mr. Sullivan had always been a stern but kind man both as a teacher and as a father to her friend Chris from what she'd seen. Looking over the large captive soles bound before her at the man's ball-gag bound face resting on a sweaty bed of his normally well-kept blond hair strands of which were currently stuck to his graffitied face by his own sweat and drool. He grunted into gag and whatever he was trying to say all Mouse heard was a wet ''..MMMPPGGH'' as more drool went down the chin and smudged Cream's message to the world upon her handsome canvas. A tinge of pity went through Mouse's mind before she bit Mr. Sullivan's big toe causing the man to start, throwing the small girl off the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ohh honey are you okay? I'm soooo sorry. I didn't think about that. He's such a big strong man I should've figured you wouldn't be able to hold him.You're okay sweetie right? The Prince would kill me if he you got hurt on my watch.''<br>\r\n''I'm fine don't worry, Just need a minute to catch my breath.<br>\r\n''Such a bad boy. Here I was thinking that you'd be good with kids since you have your own. You have to be gentle with little girls.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream mounted Mr. Sullivan's bound form while looking into his defiant eyes. The teacher, husband and father sneered around his gag at his captor, Mouse was impressed at him still being able to show defiance in such a bad position. Cream smiled and clapped her hands in childish glee at the disdain Mouse's new personal art project was showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That kind of thing is why I specifically went out to get you!''<br>\r\n*She punctuated that point by driving a finger into the man's abdomen and giving a quick dragging scratch up to the man's neck. Not hard mind you, pain was not the intent. She then slipped her hand behind the man's head before settling herself in beside him wrapping him up tight in her embrace.<br>\r\n''The Clown Prince was upset at first at how I left him without asking to get take-out. After abit of explaining though even he was impressed at my plan. See not only are you quite the chuckling catch but having YOU means that no matter what young Chrissy won't leave this mansion without you and by extension the rest of our honorable lil' detectives club won't leave without him. ''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the revelation that he was being used to catch his own son Eli started to buck far more violently than before. He strained himself in his bonds to the point that sweat started to soak his face and chest at his useless struggles. Cream laughed as she tickled his neck causing his efforts to slowly dissolve into equally fruitless wiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ohhh muffin don't worry I get that your upset at your family being broken up. So I left a little note back at your home so that your hubby will know where to find you and your son so he doesn't worry.''<br>\r\n''MMGGHPPH!!''<br>\r\n''You should always leave a note.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<i>Don't worry Mr. Sullivan. Chris and Mr. Sullivan will be happy here I promise.</i>''<br>\r\nMouse had enjoyed learning from Cream's trash talking skills and felt that now was her time to enter into the games. Both Mr. Sullivans had always been extremely nice to her and Summer(She didn't know why she'd always heard some of the other parents calling them an odd couple. They'd always seemed extremely similar to her.) So she'd decided to reassure Chris's blonde father with a nice message. That she'd written in pen across the his soles which were taped together at the ankles. Eli Sullivan responded to the unexpected assault at his soles by someone he'd considered a friend of his son by arching back to the point of almost angularity. Cream saw her moment to make it so much worse and hugged his neck before slipping her tongue into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''MMMPPPFF!!''<br>\r\n''Don't worry sugar that's not cheating.Your still a loyal man respecting the sanctity of your marriage.''<br>\r\n''<i>Sorry about this Mr. Sullivan but reially you're being a baby about this. Chris has been tickled plenty and he's fine.</i>'' <br>\r\nMouse left another message on the man's foot meant to offer a small amount of reassurance but frowned upon noticing the misspelling she'd left besmirching her canvas. She licked her thumb and tried to rub then scratch it out.<br>\r\n''MMGGPFF!!<br>\r\nNo good it was pen after all but his feet were still a bit wet from the previous cleaning that Cream had done so she'd hoped she might be able to just smudge it off. No such luck she was afraid, she'd settled with scratching it off and writing the correct spelling under it.<br>\r\n''NNNFFFG!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse giggled, she was enjoying this. Young Susan had always thought both Mr. Sullivan and his flame-haired husband were incredibly handsome. The way the two men had always looked so strong together in public but had always been incredibly tender with each other and their son Chris. They'd always been exceedingly nice to his friends as well. To have him here like this to draw upon, tease and generally play with like a toy while she was cheered on is like something straight out of her darkest fantasies. Sure there was a voice in the back of her head saying that this was wrong and that she should be trying to find a way to help Mr. Sullivan Donnie,Yu and everyone else to escape the Prince and his demented torture. That voice also sounded exactly like her sister and that's why it was easy to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse drew a happy little smile onto Mr. Sullivan's index toe before bending it back and beginning to color the very stem of it. Cream did her best to hold the man down by his shoulders but he still struggled abit before using his force against him getting  her devilish hands into his armpits. Her nails dug in and moved out before reeling his angry form back into soft love seat and her embrace. She wrapped her lips around his earlobe once more before bending it with her taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Shh-shh-shhhh calm down mister man. She's just being a kid like a she should. It used to be mysteries that she was all into. Now? It's your feet! She's just playing while the Prince is busy. So be good and let her have her fun. She'll have playmates aplenty soon. Chris always seemed like he was full of energy so maybe he'll be a good fit once Milk and Eggs come back with him?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut his thrashing off at the pass by whistling. At the sound the little light shining down on the unfortunate father was blocked out. Cheese stood above the menage a tickle bracing the knees of a sleeping and broken Donnie Jeffries under one arm, with the othe she waved and the two girls and one piece of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hullo. Cream did you need some help?''<br>\r\n''If your not busy Cheese. Mister man here just doesn't seem to know how to handle girls.''<br>\r\n''Cream y'know I'm a girl too.''<br>\r\n''So help me him some girl power Cheese! Unless your busy y'know.''<br>\r\n''Nooo I'm not busy Cream. My corny litte boy got all tuckered out and went to sleep. I was gonna go drop him off with the Prince. But if you need me I'll help. For girl power!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Cheese turned around and sat upon Mr. Elijah Sullivan's stomach. Carefully so as not to squash Cream but also to trap the man's midsection beneath her ample frame. She also was careful so as not to jostle her dozing little man Donnie. While Elijah squirmed under her she absentmindedly petted the boy's hair as he dozed and Mouse finished coloring in the last of that toe's stem and moved onto the making the pad match it in color. Robbed of his ability to fight back now Mr. Sullivan could only scream into his gag at the three girls ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse was now attempting to draw another reassurance to him.  A happy scene of Mr. Sullivan, his husband, and Chris all smiling and happy surrounded by their new extended family. Mouse wasn't the best artist so it may have just been stick figures but the girl believed it was the thought that counted. Eli couldn't take much more. Despite the girl's intentions each stroke of that pen's tip was like a knife made of ice to all the sensitive nerves in the man's size 13's. Cream continued to bite,lick,nibble at his ear keeping mind hazy at the unwanted gentleness. To compound it Cheese weighed what felt like a TON and had grown bored tending to the unconscious boy she carried and now was idly pinching and scratching at the papa's ribs. He wailed like a demon into his gag but the only mercy he received was a pitying chuckle from Cream at his desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mr. Sullivan calm down. I know you don't want to be tickled but it's not that bad. If you just accept we can be gentler and I can guarantee we can make it gentler so that you can see why we all love it!''<br>\r\n''Ooooh Cream the new girl's good. Sooo good, Wish I'd had her to help me out with this sleepy little cornpoke.''<br>\r\n''Yeah, right? I can see why the Prince was so happy to have her. She's a natural at this! So how's 'bout it Mister man?''<br>\r\n''MMMMGHHAA!!''<br>\r\n''Awww that sounded like no. You'll learn to love it though. NOTHIMG makes something more enjoyable that making it a family affair!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse was focused on her drawing so she didn't hear Pao-Yu coming up behind her. He slipped a hand over her mouth and lifted her up off the couch. Cream and Cheese were far too focused on their own games too notice so when he pulled her back they were essentially alone as he turned her around to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Mouse...''</span></div></div>",

I heard what you were telling him and you,the Prince and all of you were so right! It's great! It's like he saw all my problems and just pushed all the right buttons to make them go away! To just laugh and laugh until it's all you want to do forever!''<br>\r\n''You like that?''<br>\r\n''I love that and I love you, him and even my sister for helping me find out!''<br>\r\n''You want to be tickled? I can tickle you right now?''<br>\r\n''YES!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse's hands shot straight into Pao-Yu's hollows and dug like there was treasure in them there sensitive pitties. The new found tickle enthusiast threw his head back and laughed but held Mouse steady and with seeming zero intent of pushing her away or putting her down. Now that the boy's hair was out of the way Mouse noticed the boy's reddening face starting to stream a few tears. Mouse slowed down just a bit but this led to him squeezing her waist and begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nooho pleeease don't stop!''<br>\r\n''Ar-are you su-sre?''<br>\r\n''Yehehehes pleehehase''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued on unaware as two sets of eyes watched them so happily and a third oh so very fearfully. Cheese reached over and pulled the two over Yu twisting to land upon his back with little Mouse against his chest still tickling away at the young heir since he seemed to love it so. The boy's head beside Eli's bound feet as he shook his head the loose sweaty lightly tickled the poor soles that had been re-purposed for canvas. Eli kept himself as quiet and still as he could, thankful for even this small break. Cream sat up and moved over to get a better look at the two while Cheese and squeezed her own little teddy bear while fawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Aww Cream they are so cute.''<br>\r\n''Ya-huh see Mr. Grouchypants? He gave in and look at how much fun he's having! Isn't this sickeningly sweet young love just melting your heart? Isn't it my grouchy gus goochie-goochie-YOU! ''<br>\r\n''HMMPPH''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream dug her fingers into Mr. Sullivan once more and the sound the man's gagged yell caught the attention of Yu and Mouse as well as snapping Cheese's attention back to the task at hand. The larger scooched over and dug a devious finger the man's belly button as Yu turned his attention to his tiny tormentor with a devious look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You know what's more fun than being tickled Mouse?''<br>\r\n''Dishing it out?!''<br>\r\n''You got it.''<br>\r\n''Your just as perfect as I always imagined.''<br>\r\n''Huh?''<br>\r\n''I said get in between his toes! Guy's are always crazy ticklish there.''<br>\r\n''Ooooh sure.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young heirs fingers dug into the man's toes on which the ink was already starting to run due to the sweat. He responded by screaming into his gag and shaking with enough strength that even the plus sized Cheese was jostled off. She landed with a heavy thud that thankfully was cushioned by her own ample rump. She nonetheless let out a girlish squeal of surprise at the rough trade. Her own charge's eyes fluttered open at the impact and as the poor farmboy started she let her disappointment be known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Awwww Creeeaamm! He woke up!''<br>\r\n''Well that's your fault Cheese you should've been more careful!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clowns undid the evil papoose binding Donnie to Cheese, while Mouse and Yu now had climbed up and mounted their victims shins raining tickles down into their victims toes. While the Clown's bickered and poor little Donnie whined, the kids got more aggressive. They'd already been digging into the poor man's toesies like their was something hiding in them but now they were engaging in some devilish games. As Pao-Yu wiggled and played the pinky toe of Mr. Sullivan he looked to Mouse and smirked. Mouse responded by dragging her nails from the man's heel sooooo slowly up to the arch, over the ball and then wrapping them up in the toes before giving a firm slap to the now taut skin and smiling at her competitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I think Mouse did it better?''<br>\r\n''Awww no fair. No way you can know what he said Cream!''<br>\r\n''Sorry but I'm just skilled at this from practice y'know? That gives me a great idea though hey Cheese how 'bout we see who's America's next top tickler?''<br>\r\n''What do you mean Cream?''<br>\r\n''These two little devils are gonna have some fun and we don't interrupt their date. Still we gotta watch over 'em so they on't get up to anything too naughty. Nuthin' 'ta say we can't have some fun ourselves though! So go nuts kiddo's we're gonna do this game show style!''<br>\r\n''What's that mean?''<br>\r\n''Well I'll tell you Mousey-dear! You two use your best moves on our big ol' puddle of fluff here! Then me and Cheese here'll judge on who's better in an easily recognizable format that is a scale of one to ten!''<br>\r\n''Like American Id-''<br>\r\n''SHUT UP CHEESE! I'M TALKING!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Yu wasted no time and and started scrabbling his fingers wildly all over Mr. Sullivan's sole before attacking his toes as Mouse watched their mutual victim shake his head back and forth in response to his rather unimaginative torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sorry Charlie gonna have to give that a two at best.''<br>\r\n''Awww c'mon!''<br>\r\n''Try harder sweetie we're not gonna be nice to the loser!''<br>\r\n''Wait what?!''<br>\r\n''Yeah sorry but we're kinda evil like th-Ooooh nice work girl!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse had re-used her old tactic of bending back her man's toes and now was taunting her prey by slooooowly scratching one finger up the helpless former canvas of her's. The older man quivered with the movement a fact which was definitely noticed by her would-be judges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''HHHMHHHMHMM!!''<br>\r\n''Oooh you are a HIT with the audience little Mousie!''<br>\r\n''Uhh I don't know.''<br>\r\n''UGGHH What is it Cheese?!''<br>\r\n''I like traditionalism a bit more Cream.''<br>\r\n''YOUR JUST DOING THIS TO BE DIFFICULT CHEESE!''<br>\r\n''I have d--''<br>\r\n''SHUT UP CHEESE! MOUSE WINS THIS ROUND!'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Yu frowned at the unfarir snubbing he'd received but after a reassuring hair ruffle by Cheese and a totally un-heartfelt ''You'll get 'em next time slugger'' by Cream he turned his attention back to the task at hand. He purposely moved his back to block Elijah's view of his own bound feet. He then bent over and quickly tapped each of his poor toes with his devilish tongue before nipping at the man's index toe causing a girlish squeak behind the capture father's gag. Lightning quick the former heir snapped at each of the wiggly little digits and whenever they tried to curl up, an attack  on the ball of the foot would have them straighten back out for his teeth to nibble upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ooooh I LIKE THAT.'' Cream yelled ''You're gonna REEALLY have to try to top that one missy.''<br>\r\n''Cream don't you think we should try to be impartial here?''<br>\r\n''CHEESE be quiet I'm try to motivate her to do better!''<br>\r\n''Oh, your so smart Cream.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse turned away and crawled up Mr. Sullivan's chest she whispered something into his ear which made his tired eyes go wide before turning back and heading to her playground of his right sole. Cheese and Cream craned their necks to see her work before whistling in admiration. Mouse scratched and ran her nails at heels of the man's foot which was staying shockingly still in her grasp despite her faint pushing of the foot upwards toward her own smiling face. After a surprise pinch to just below the calf the dam broke and the foot jerked up. Mouse squealed with and bit at the man's middle toe catching it only in glancing and allowing the desperately crying man to pull it away. She laughed right along with him before turning back to chide him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I told you Mr. Sullivan if you can't keep that pretty foot of yours still and out of my face. I just won't be able to help myself with it there! Those cute little wiggle monster toes of yours just look too sweet not to taste.''<br>\r\n''Mmmhmmhmm?!? MMMPHH!''<br>\r\n''Oooooh Cheese this girl is A NATURAL! She gets this round and that's game!''<br>\r\n''I've gotta say it is Cream.''<br>\r\n''Hey wait what about a thir-''<br>\r\n''SORRY YU HONEY IT'S PUNISHMENT TIME!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCutting Yu's complaining short Cream dove and wrapped herself around him before pulling both of them onto their backs atop Mr. Sullivan. Yu barely resisted and his smile only grew wider as she vibrating her fingers against his sensitive ribbies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nahahah heeeheee Creeheeam thahat tihihickles bwaahaaa.''<br>\r\n''Mmmm I know. Why do you want me to stop Mr. Sweetie Giggly Man?''<br>\r\n''Noohooo heeehee haaw''<br>\r\n''Too precious.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream started raising kisses on the young adults reddening cheek as Mouse frowned. This didn't feel like she won. She wanted to tickle Pao-Yu. She scratched a finger up one of Pao-Yu's kicking soles causing the boy to snort laughter but all that did was make Cream kiss him more! SHE WANTED TO DO THAT! IT WASN'T FAIR!! Mouse's burgeoning tantrum was cut short as she was yanked up into her own kissy embrace by the one or steps past shapely Cheese who played with the little detectives feets as she reassured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Awww punkin what's wrong. You don't look like a happy winner.''<br>\r\n''Ahahm nohohot.''<br>\r\n''What's wrong princess?''<br>\r\n''I wahahahnted to tihihickle Yu.''<br>\r\n''Aww sweetie does someone have crush?''<br>\r\n''Nohoho.''<br>\r\n''Tell you what my sweet little pancake. Let's make it right! How would you like to tickle not only Yu but cute little old Donnie and mean old Cream. We'll make them a big silly sandwich. Would you like that honey bunch?''<br>\r\nMouse sniffed at finally being given a respite from the friendly tickles.<br>\r\n''Y-you mean it? I-I can tickle all of them?''<br>\r\n''Well heck yeah you can. It's your party and you can make them cry if you want too. It's looks like Daddy dearest nodded off from all the excitement anyway. So I'll take him to see the Prince while you have your fun. I'll get him out of of there and when they're distracted me and you'll get 'em! Sound like fun cinnamon bun?''</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jamie was scared and alone. After having been carried off by Mariko and Machiko he'd awakened bound with string?! In a dark room <br>\r\nlying in a comfortable chair. He'd snapped the string quickly guessing that it hadn't been meant to seriously bind him and if had that was really embarassing for the boy. Who they'd they think he was Chris? Finally free of his predicament Jamie had exited that room and entered...an extremely dark hallway. There was no Chris, Summer or Pao-Yu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was all alone and it was almost pitch black in the hallway as he snuck along. Trying to keep the noise level low and his own alertness up. How long had he been out? The last thing he remembered was Pao-Ting and Machiko asking him questions and him struggling to keep his eyes open. His face grew red at not only how he fell asleep in front of the girls but also at his attire. His own clothes had disappeared during his nap it seemed though that judging by the lipstick smeared on his chest it was done by one of those evil women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young detective was not a fan of the loose fitting and yet too small vest he'd been given nor the baggy pants arabian nights-ish pants that replaced his jeans. Despite the ridiciulous slave dancer look at least the material was comfortable if he hazarded a guess he'd say some kind of silk blend. His underwear was also gone and he really didn't want to think about that. Taking a seat against one of the walls he went over everything again. That ghost had sent him to Pao-Ting along with Chris and her brother Pao-Yu that he remembered. He had vague memories of her asking him questions along with one of her lady-servants either Mariko or Machiko whatever they'd asked blended together in his head but he also thought he remembered Pao-Yu there as well and he'd been laughing? Considering Chris was gone and it looked like he'd been someones Aladdin while he slept the jerk deserved that and worse in his opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smelled strawberries and quickly realized that it was him. In addition to the dress-up play it seemed like someone rubbed some kind of scented oil into his skin all over from his neck to his soles which were still bare of course. It felt slightly tingly and unbeknownst to him it was another of Pao-Ting's inventions. Whoever it was had also shampooed his hair and judging how his muscles felt applied the oil to him through massage. His skin crawled at the idea of that gross older one of Pao-Yu's goon girls doing that to him but he didn't know why he felt like it was definitely her that did it. For all he knew Yu could have done but that was gross too yet somehow he kind of preferred that to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrospection was interrupted as Jamie noticed someone run the corner quickly. He was a bout to call out to whoever but hesitated. What were the chances it was somebody in this place he'd actually want to find him like this? There were maybe three others in this house he could trust and Pao-Yu but countless others who only seemed to be motivated by tickling. More than likely it was one of them and whatever had been rubbed into his skin seemed to make it more sensitive which only made him want to be tickled even less. He turned and headed down the opposite hallway being as quiet as he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie thought back to all the lessons that Chris had given him. His little friend had been good at keeping quiet and out of the way probably due to all the people who liked to tickle him in his daily life. Whether it was the Eastingtons at school or Jamie himself at times little Chris had become quite the sneaky little snake. So if Chris who couldn't even get a C average in home-ec could keep it down than a straight A student like Jamie should have no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''.... tickle.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie froze before looking around the room desperately for the source of the taunt. Despite the gloom Jamie could make out only a few large pieces of furniture in the room. A rustling behind one of the armchairs caught his attention and alarmed the boy enough to make him call out in hope it was a friend as opposed to one of the numerous tickle-fiends haunting the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''C-Chris?! S-Summer!!?''<br>\r\n''....tickle.''<br>\r\n''Who's there!!''<br>\r\n''....tickle.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''A figure emerged from behind the armchair and began approaching him causing the boy to step back in fear. As whoever it was drew closer to the boy and his extremely vulnerable outfit he stumbled over an unseen obstacle and fell landing on his back. He kept backing up on his hands as the figure dropped low over him and began crawling forward before seizing him by the ankle. Jamie kicked and struggled in fear as he was dragged towards the armchair that the figure emerged from behind. He kicked several times landing his free foot into the character but did nothing despite Jamie feeling the impact. His attacker seated himself in the chair and brought Jaime's poor captured foot along for the ride. Getting desperate Jamie tried his hardest to pull his leg free but the dark figure had it in a vice it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single finger dragged up his bare and defenseless sole produced an unexpected result for both Jamie and his attacker. Once the nerve endings in Jamie's foot fired off every muscle in Jamie's body went limp on him. Jamie's neck lolled like a noodle and his head thudded into the ground as the finger stroked up his oiled and extremely ticklish foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vocal chords still worked of course. Pao-Ting had designed that oil with that in mind since laughter was her favorite sound and this was one of her favorite new inventions. The devious chemical reacted to the act of tickling by overloading the muscles and locking the muscles up painlessly so that the victim couldn't resist in any way physically. The slightest of giggly pokes or scratches on the affected area triggered it and since Jamie had been given a full body rub-down by the raunchy Machiko who always had enjoyed tormenting the larger of Summer's two male companions. After a fun game of dress-up with the boy as well as his massage she'd been confident that the boy wouldn't get far due to the chemicals effect and the guard they'd left in charge of him who Pao-Ting had built specifically for taking advantage of captives in that state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''...tickle.''<br>\r\n''SNNRRKKNoohohoSTAHAHP!''<br>\r\n''...tickle.''<br>\r\n''Whihiy can't I mohohve''<br>\r\n''...tickle.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assailant dragged that damned finger up Jamie's sole again and drew it right along the stem of his second to last toe on his tortured foot. His torturer seized that toe between it's fingers and wiggled it back and forth driving the boy mad on the floor as he snickered and gasped trying to hold it it in. Releasing the pinched toe his automatic attacker now began stroking both fingers along the sole and light scratching at the ball doing what it was programmed to by the devious Pao-Ting. The robotic guard was designed by the girl genius to trap and torture prey starting off slow but escalating every time that it detected a big ol' unrestrained laugh. Jamie didn't know this and was holding it in to try to save face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''...tickle.''<br>\r\n''Nnneeeheh leheehet goho''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the machine pinched the ball of his ticklish foot the floodgates burst for just a second but that was all it would take to kick into second gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''NNNGAAHHAAYEEH!!''<br>\r\n''...Tickle.''<br>\r\n''Nooohhohhoo pleeheesse.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the Tick-Bot was going faster and using an extra finger. One hand gripped Jamie's ankle and raised foot just enough so that the three fingers could tease and spider the boy's so sensitive heel and drive him wild on the floor. The paralyzed hunk was getting the tiniest bit of movement out of his fingers but at the same time the biggest laugh was building up in the boy's boys belly. When the game turned to scratches on the heel tears started to pool in Jamie's eyes as all he could do was seemingly lie there and take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mmmmhheennn.''<br>\r\n''...Tickle.''<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA quick raid into his toes broke him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''HAHAHAHE GEHEHET OOHOUT OF THEEIRE!''<br>\r\n''...Tickle!''<br>\r\n''HEEHEELPAAH!!''<br>\r\n''...Tickle!''<br>\r\n''NOOHOHO STAHAHAP PLEEHEESE!?!''<br>\r\n''...TICKLE!''<br>\r\n''MEHEEHEEEHEEE!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all ten fingers were at the four-front dancing away on that one poor foot and for Jamie it was two much. His vision was starting to swim and his head was throbbing as he tried to get air. The oil's effect was starting to fade it felt like but he didn't even feel like he had the energy to fight back if he could at this point. This was humiliating.

Jamie's here?! JAMIE!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie's siren-level pleading had caught some unexpected attention and he thanked his lucky stars as they tackled his cybernetic assailant off of him. He gasped for air as he was tended to by none other than the leader of the Cackling Creek detectives Summer Salt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jamie are you alright!?''<br>\r\n''S-s-summer?! Where've you been?''<br>\r\n''What?! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!? All you had to do was stay in one place!''<br>\r\n''Ohhh Summer a little help over here?''<br>\r\n''Your touching reunion will have to wait unless big, strong Jamie wants to help us!''<br>\r\n''Who's that?!''<br>\r\n''The Eastingtons now hang on!''<br>\r\n''WHAT!? WHY ARE THEY HERE!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was rudely cut off as Summer dashed off to help the twins in shoving the android tickler into a wardrobe rather hurriedly. The three of them forced the machine in and upended their impromtu prison so that it fell door side down trapping it inside. The twins celebrated their victory by pulling Summer into a ticklish embrace between the pair of them. Their fingers into the girl detectives shirt and played with her ribs causing her to squeal and giggle between the two of them. <br>\r\n''Good job group! See Jamie? Summer's so happy with how well that went she can't stop smiling!'' Lyle teased as he dug into Summer ribs. ''Yoohohouuur a jeherk LYHIHEEEHEELLE!''<br>\r\n''What was that Summer? That weird tic of yours where you burst into laughter when you get tickled makes you so hard to understand.''<br>\r\n''THEN LET ME GO!''<br>\r\n''Sorry can't understand you! Gitchie gittchie goo!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sadistic star of the Cackling Creek gymnastic's team got the girl detective once again laughing with a sneak attack to the back of her little knees using his toes which he'd honed into his own signature tickle tools over the years. The devilish little digits drove her crazy as she kicked her bare feet in the air and dangled from his taller and stronger sister's grip. Jamie got to his own still tingling feet. He wasted no time charging in and shoving the two villains off his friend. He got her out of their grips and made for the door-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''JAMIE WAIT! THEY'RE HELPING ME!!''<br>\r\n''Yeah Jamie'' taunted Lyle ''We're on your side tonight. Our little buddy is missing just like yours so when we ran into Summer she was eager to make a deal with us.''<br>\r\n''Summer you didn't!''<br>\r\n''Oh yes she did!'' Sylvia interrupted ''In exchange for a solid week of playdates with us and some other things. We're going to help her find Chris and Mouse.''<br>\r\n''Summer no.''<br>\r\n''It was the only way Jamie!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eastington's playdates were infamous around town. They'd trick someone into to coming over then take them into their ''gym'' than use them for whatever new games they'd thought up until the sun came up and they got let go. Jamie had been lured in one Christmas he'd been spending alone and ended up sealed in a giant present, with only his head feet sticking out. The twins had played the ''Twelve Toes of Christmas'' all night with the twins repeatedly going back to check their math until it added up. (It had in the end when they'd added in his nose and manhood) until they'd dropped him on Chris's doorstep in exchange for him coming over for a playdate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jamie if your concerned for Summer rest assured Sylvia and I will be perfect hosts but you could come and chaperone. The new swing we got can easily two.''<br>\r\n''We may have to get a second set of rollers since your soles are so delectably large Jamie but we'd accomodate you of course.''<br>\r\n''No way me or Summer are having one of your freaky playdates!''<br>\r\n''That'd be such a shame since we just Mouse just a bit ago didn't we Lyle?''<br>\r\n''Yeah me and Sylvia saw her and we owe her one since she's so close to the Clown Prince now. Nobody tickles my sister Sylvia but me!''<br>\r\n''The Clown Prince has Mouse?''<br>\r\n''Nuh-uh Mouse was helping him! She watched me and Lyle get our brains tickled out and just walked off to go tickle somebody else.''<br>\r\n''Aww Mouse what're you doing...'' Summer shook her head in frustration<br>\r\n''So she's with them? Fine then we'll pull her out of there and take her home.''<br>\r\n''Not so fast Jamie!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was suddenly grabbed by the waist from behind by Sylvia who pined his arms to his sides and forced him down to the ground.<br>\r\n''HEY LET ME GO!'' he yelled.<br>\r\n''Nuh-uh Jamie! Just like with Summer we're gonna make a deal with you before we take a single step more.'' Sylvia teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forced him up into a sitting position between while still holding him steady than started nuzzling his neck with her nose. Sylvia as captain of the wrestling team at school and an avid weightlifter had always been a strong girl and she was using that strength to keep Jamie still as she usually did when her and her brother got hold of him and the next step was the part he hated the most. He grimaced as Lyle sat down in front of him and once again Sylvia's powerful legs pinned his down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''SUMMER!!? HELP!''<br>\r\n''...I'm sorry Jamie but...this was also part of the deal...''<br>\r\n''Jamie!'' Lyle said in an offended tone as he scooched closer to his sister and her captive. ''It's almost like you don't like our ritual Jamie! If you didn't like me and you's special handshake together why do we always do it together?!''<br>\r\n''BECAUSE YOU HOLD ME DOWN!!''<br>\r\n''Jamie I don't know what your talking. Sylvia am I holding him down? I'm not right?''<br>\r\n''Lyle how could you you hold him down? You're over there!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia tightened her grip around and licked along Jamie's neck as Summer grimaced and looked away at her friend's pleading stare mumbling to herself. ''It's to help everyone Jamie''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I love doing this Jamie. I feel like it really helps us bond as boys. Boy's with nice feet that just want to be together...''<br>\r\n''Ohh nooo c'mon please Lyle!''<br>\r\n''Come on Jamie it's our thing!''<br>\r\n''A thing I hate!!''<br>\r\n''Oh you love footsies Jamie and you know it!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lyle's wiggling toes drew closer to Jamie's soles he turned pleadingly to Summer only to see that now she'd turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't worry Jamie just a bit of fun to change your mind about the playdate than we'll find the others but first...''</span></div></div>",

The room was filled with stuffed animals. To the point where he couldn't even see the walls due to the concentration of them. There were toy's scattered all over the floor of various kinds. There was no sign of whoever dragged him in here though. He got to his feet and tried to find a way out but stumbled and fell after he stepped on a plastic army man. Little Chris yelped at the pain as he fell back into a pile of stuffies so that they collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>''WE'RE UNDER ATTACK MEN! BATTLE STATIONS!!''</b><br>\r\nThe sudden yell scared Chris and as he scanned the room he realized that there was nobody in the room besides him, the piles of stuffed animals and a few random scatterings of the toy soldiers along the ground there was nothing else in the room. He stepped back then fell down cradling his poor foot after stepping on another of the army men that he swore wasn't there a minute ago. The startled teen detective than shot into a fit of giggles at the feeling of some kind of point jabbing into his free sole. He pulled it back reflexively and was astonished at the sight of one of the plastic army men pulling it's bayonet back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wha-wait what?!''<br>\r\n<b>''SARGE! THE GIANT'S WEAKNESS IS AT HE BASE! ATTACK IT'S FEET BOYS!''</b><br>\r\n''Hang on?! No-no wait...NO REALLY HUH?!''<br>\r\n<b>''AVENGE OUR BOYS!''</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Chris could voice any more protests a detachment of the Toy Soldiers broke cover behind him and fastened a rope around the big toe of his just attacked foot. They waved and more of their comrades emerged from the piles of toys grab a hold of the rope. Chris tried to pull his foot away but found that in those numbers the soldiers were pretty strong and they kept it still and in their grasp. A few of them broke ranks and started climbing up the captive foot resulting in Chris squealing and giggling as they wrapped themselves around his free toes and dug their little plastic combat knives into the sensitive stems. Chris grabbed a hold of the rope and yanked it so as to disrupt the little freakshow trying to drag him away but only succeeded in firing them like a shotgun blast himself. The soldiers flew straight at him and while most clattered to the ground a few got on Chris and started climbing their toward any opening in his clothes they could find. Chris rolled around on the floor trying to get them off but for everyone one he picked another two came running and climbed aboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris noticed out of the corner of his teary eyes more of them coming out and going for that damn rope. He grinned and beared in to start crawling away as he grabbed one of the little devils that had been knifefighting his nipple under his shirt. He made his way to his feet and looked back over his shoulder to see HUNDREDS OF THEM NOW! It was a sea of green carrying ropes and ladders to catch the giant. When Chris saw the little tanks with toothbrushes instead of cannon's that was his sign to run. Carrying however many of them were on him at the time he ran. He shed his shirt and hoodie to make it easier to pick off the last of the soldiers as he ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barefoot and shirtless boy detective dove into the stuffed animal sea and started toward where he remembered the vent was but immediately felt something wrong. Despite his efforts he couldn't move forward. It was like he was being held still by the toy's. Everytime he tried to pull away it was like hundreds of small fluffy hands were keeping him still.<br>\r\n<i>''What is this?! A visitor?''</i><br>\r\nChris looked around saw all the fluffy monkeys, elephants and bears heads staring directly at him. Their button eyes locked on him. Despite his struggles hundreds of little yarn hands and paws pulled him taut and moved him as they wish regardless of his wishes.<br>\r\n''Wait please let me go! I'm sorry to you and all the toy's!''<br>\r\n<i>''To us you seem like the toy now. We outnumber you and control you. We control you and you are happy with it.</i><br>\r\n''I'M NOT AT AHAHAHAHAGHHA''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWool hands invaded his armpit hollows as his wrists were dragged above his head. The scratchy feeling and the tickly sensations drove him mad.<br>\r\n''NOOONOOHOHNOOHOO''<br>\r\nHe thrashed as best as he could but only seemed to anger his snuggly tormentor's who took out anger by tormenting his bubbly little toes. They tied them back with more terrible woolen threads driving the sleuth mad.<br>\r\n''AHAIHIT'S SOO IHIHITCHY NAHGAHA PLEEEESE!!''<br>\r\n<i>''Such a fun toy we have now. Cootchie cootchie cooo little boy. Laugh for all your friends and the fun we're having.''</i><br>\r\nHis belly button was teased, His armpit hollows were scritched and his toes twiddled. Every one of his tickle spots were tormented and in one case a new one discovered! Who would have thought even poor Chris's elbows were ticklish? He tried to scream but one noise sensitive giraffe stuffed it's head in to muffle him as a pair of lions undid his zipper. <br>\r\n<i>Let us put you away for now. We don't want to break our new toy.</i><br>\r\nOnce his manhood was out in the cold air it was like a switch for Chris and he went out like a light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chris came back to world of the awake he was in a new situation for him and that was saying something. He couldn't move at all due to how he'd been entombed in a ticklish boy detective sized teddy bear. His face stuck out where the bears would have been and his feet stuck out of the bears paws. He could feel his arms crossed across his chest within his prison. It all served to keep Chris in a sitting position with his bare feetsies at the exact level of those toothbrush equipped tanks that the army men were rolling towards them....<br>\r\n''Ohh no...WAIT PLEASE NONONO!!''<br>\r\n<b>''WE'VE GOT THAT GIANT TRAPPED NOW! LET HIM HAVE IT BOY'S MAKE HIM SQUEAL!!''</b><br>\r\n''PLEHEEEEEHSEEEHH NAAHHHA!! GAAHAHAWAD SUHUHUHMER HAHAAALLLPP!!'' squealed Chris....already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the 3 inch tall battalion pulled their armor back they moved forward with a few troops wielding bayonets. The teeny troopers drove their plastic blades into his soles Chris threw himself around inside his stuffed animal straight jacket serving only to make the miniature military men laugh at his predicament along with him. The small soldiers weapons were nothing but dull plastic but they were just sharp enough to have Chris redfaced and sputtering helplessly inside the bear. They brought forward grappling hooks fashioned out of wool threads from the pile and threw them over the mountainous (To them) soles.<br>\r\n''LEEHET'S TAHALK!! NEHEHGOHOTIATE! PLEAHSE I SUHUHURRENDER!''<br>\r\nThe toy soldier pulled there ropes tight and hammered in plastic stakes to the ground to restrict those little toes good. Then a few brave souls began the task of using the ropes to climb to the top of bare soles. Once at the summit of Mt. Feeties the climbers called down to their comrades who threw more ropes up to them in response. They tied those ropes around Chris's free toes and and looped them around the others pulling the back completely immobilizing him.<br>\r\nThe soldiers made room for a collection of tiny plastic generals who stepped forward and scribbling on our heroes soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''WHAHAT NOHOHOHWW?!''<br>\r\n<b>''Gentleman as you can see here he is completely immobilized within.''<br>\r\n''Where on the battle plans is that exactly?''<br>\r\n''Right here let me circle it a few times.</b><br>\r\n''HAAHHA IF I CAHAN FEEHEL IHIT HOW CAN YOUHUHU NOHOT!?''<br>\r\n<b>As such he is perfect for our purposes!</b><br>\r\n''Heeh and what exactly does that mean?!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat felt like an eternity later to Chris he wished he'd never asked.<br>\r\n''COME AND SEE THE CAPTIVE GIANT WITH THE TICKLISH FEET!'' was emblazoned across both his soles. Small plastic children pointed and laughed at it as they went back and forth in the swings mounted to his pinky toes having fun as they simultaneously tweaked his small toes back and forth. After years of study the brave little men had MULTIPLE circles around each and every one of the worst tickle spots on his feet, some far too small for any human to find but perfectly sized for a tiny plastic hand wilding a tiner plastic knife. They'd set up a climbing path to the top for the little ones so they could read the special message that'd been written on his big toes for them.  ''THIS MESSAGE IS TO HONOR THE BRAVE SOLDIERS WHO GAVE THEIR TIME TO SCALE THE TICKLISH GIANT AND GAG SO WE ALL DON'T HAVE TO HEAR HIS SQUEALING ANYMORE!!''<br>\r\nAs Chris groaned into the stuffed giraffe stuffed into his mouth at the feeling of the four hundred and ninety-eight lil' climber reaching the summit of Mt. Poor ol' Mr. Foot he wondered if he'd ever be able to stop himself from counting them. If anyone would ever find him in here after what felt like years to the boy. Was anybody even looking anymore?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHE'D TAKE ANYBODY CAUSE HE COULDN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!<br>\r\nHEEELP!!  he thought as the tears flowed from the corners of his eyes.</span></div></div>",

The Asian boy yelled, his yell turned into a shriek of laughter, then he disappeared as a mess of flailing limbs into the wave of approaching dark. Chris and Jamie looked each other fearfully in the eyes, then began to sprint towards the square of light that was the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting closer...almost there...almost- aah!\" Chris's thinking was interrupted as, only a few steps from visible freedom, two delicate aristocratic hands emerged from the darkness, each grabbing one of Chris and Jamie's ankles. \"Ahm afraid you won't be rid of me that easily, sugah!\" Mrs. Featherton giggled. In an instant, the hands pull and Chris and Jamie's strength is reversed as they are pulled into the wall of darkness. First, for a moment, silence in the complete pitch black. Then the boys, who can sense their closeness to each other despite seeing nothing, begin to shriek with laughter as tickle tools assault their bodies. \"Ohmygod--nohohohoHAHAHAHAHA!\" Jamie yells as he feels cool, feminine fingers begin to slip between his clenched arms and legs, prying into armpits and soft thighs and behind knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, just open up for me sugah. There's no use strugglin'!\" tittered Mrs Featherton, hovering somewhere around the two boys. Now what should I choose...aha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris suddenly elicited a shriek as he felt a harsh brush, close to the type used for buffing shoes, begin to scrub at his arch. He screamed and tried to pull away, but nailed fingers held his foot and pried back his toes for the bristles of the brush to seek out. His vision turned red as the unrelenting shoe brush scrubbed his feet. Soon, Chris and Jamie passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chris awoke, he was in a totally different room, and Pao Yu was nowhere to be seen. Jamie, however, was tied up nearby and still out like a light. He looked around. The room was definitely cleaner and less decrepit than the others he'd seen in the gigantic Featherton Manor. It looked like a master bedroom: numerous portraits of a sultry Mrs. Featherton in dress and bonnet adorned the pink-wallpapered walls, and a truly massive flouncy looking four poster bed sad in the middle up against one wall, draped in curtains and larger than any he had ever seen before. An ornate dressing table sprawled at one end of the room, displaying a big silver mirror and covered in hairbrushes, powders, lotions, and other beauty items. On the other end of the room was a doorless entryway into a tile-floored bathroom with several cabinets and a wide, clawfoot tub. Overall this place, which must have been Mrs. Featherton's bedroom, displayed the luxury the old manor had been famous for before it fell into disrepair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do yah like mah bedroom, sugar?\" A voice drawled from behind him. Chris turned around, for his feet were not tied, to see Mrs. Featherton standing, not floating, behind him. She looked, somehow, more solid- she was no longer see through and the only way you could tell she was a ghost was by her glowing outline. She was wearing some kind of skirt that probably would have been scandalous back in her day- it displayed some of her pale, soft looking thighs. Her hair was still big, but was curled down her back to display its strawberry-blonde color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Chris stammered, feeling very out of place in the girly bedroom with all its soft lace and decorations. \"Why don't you look like a ghost?\" he said, not answering her question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugar, my essence is stronger in here. I don't need to look like a see-through spirit in my own chambers!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chris regained a bit of his brash courage and said bluntly, \"what are you gonna do with me? What about Jamie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Featherton giggled again, a girlish laugh that seemed to echo a bit, and smiled with her painted red lips. \"Your friend will wake up sooner or later. I was going to have a li'l fun with just you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached forward and grabbed the poor boy...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His fingernails dug into one somewhat loose floorboard causing the lich lady to pause and lecture him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sug after such a long nigh, don't y'all think a hot bath is what you need? Ah bet under those clothes your all covered in dust, dirt and yuck. Let's watch ah mean wash all that right off sweetie. Y'all're being a pest so just give up ok? You did LOSE!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swift poke into the upturned sole that she held caused Chris's struggles to cease as he instead began rolling as if it would somehow disperse the sensations attacking his nerve endings and causing his voice to crack into a distinctly unmanly...<br>\r\n''EEEEEPP!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the opportunity and quickly shed the boy of his underoos in one quick motion while he wasn't expecting it. This invasion of his privacy got Chris out of his giggle fit enough to try to the shield his fledgeling manhood from both the cold and the ghost. She twirled his undies on her finger taunting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sug' Ah've been around a loooong time while modesty in a boy is adorable your also not hiding anything ah haven't already seen. Whether it's that cute little thing there or a squirmy lil' boy who doesn't wanna take a bath despite being so dirty.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the cold air in the room Chris was bright red and desperately trying to keep both his hands as a shield over his nethers from her so when she grabbed the sleeves of his jacket it was easy for her to give a good yank and pull it off the hard enough to flip him back over onto his belly. He quickly realized what her game was and tucked one arm into the fabric of his t-shirt and tried to crawl away from the laughing spirit of laughter that was stripping him. A ghostly foot placed on the small on his back stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nonononoooo c'mon stop''<br>\r\n''Losers don't get to whine hun. Dirty little losers get warm baths with their new mommies though. Don't you want a hot bath june-bug? It's so cold and ah bet ya just can't wait to slip into the bubbly comfort and get all that dirt off?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly another foot invaded his other outstretched armpit and five ghostly piggies dug their insanely cold little snouts into the sensitive hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hhahahaaaha''<br>\r\n''See y'all can't even think of it without laughing at how fun it sounds. Let's just get the last little problem out the way.''<br>\r\n''Thahat doesn't sounyehd fun at all! Let me gohoho!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the t-shirt off the boy who squirmed and writhed on the floor due to the toes wiggling in his armpit and driving him into hysterics. He squirmed and writhed on the floor at the feet of the lady of the house. She laughed rather haughtily before adding her ghostly digits to the tickly assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Upsy daisy mah sweet thing. It's bath time!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked boy squirmed weakly as he was hiked up and thrown on the lady Featherton's shoulder like a sack of potatoes. A hard slap to the bottom as a humiliating reminder that it was indeed bath time. He tried to kick his way out but that quickly turned into just trying to kick them away as whenever they went still the spectral nails would invade between his toes. After awhile even that was too much and the boy just let it happen. He had lost and what could he even at this point?<br>\r\nChris went slack on the literal cold shoulder in this freezing room but started to notice a small amount of heat as he approached his nice warm bath he had to admit after all this cold even that slight warmth felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''See junebug? Don't that sound as nice as ah fire in the snow? Ah nice warm bath sounds amazing and'll feel great. Yer dirty cold and tired just let it change ya to clean, warm and happy. You'll be ah'll sparkly and clean an' when Jamie wakes up he'll be so jealous! Ahh here we go sweet thing IN YOU GO!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was suddenly and unceremoniously dumped into the hot and quite bubbly water disturbing the thick cloudy covering of bubbles  atop the soup which he had now been added to. The Lady Featherton as his ever gracious host caught him under his arms as his he sank and pulled the soggy boy up and leaned him back on the lip of the tub and below the faucet. As Chris tried to blink the sudsy warm water out of his eyes a loud series of clanks snapped him back to reality as a heavy harness pinned him to the the tub and kept his head just above water and his shoulders firmly against the tub wall. He was trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's an addition my darling husband had added. Nothing better than to just laze back in the tub and let the water make you melt and my friend Selkie get you clean!''<br>\r\n''L-LET ME OUUUU-HHIII!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris felt something deep in the bubbly depths brush over his foot. The faint touch was at first quick but when he suddenly felt a hand bend back the toes on his right foot he started struggling in his harness like a fish in a net. He attempted to raise his hands up to pull himself out of the tub but found that the contraption holding down his chest kept him from even raising his arms out of the water. As he flailed he felt another hand wrench back the poor little toes of his left foot so that now both of his soles were stretched taut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Do you like it sweetie? The tub was one of the count's finds in Ireland. A delightful little spirit dwells in it that just won't rest when it comes to dirt. Ah keep'a clean house of course but that darlin' lil' helper in there will clean even the dirtiest lil' boy until he ain't nothin' but pink and giggly! She's named the selkie and she'll scrub ya down good.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chris flailed below the suds Mrs. Featherton stroked a gentle index finger down his nose almost idly. She continued on with her speech as he wiggled and squirmed at the rapidly multiplying hands below the waves pulling open all of his most private areas and roughly scrubbing inside away all the dirt and pride he had. They held not only his toes in check but were grasping the boys fingers and pulling them apart so that calloused yet still dainty fingers dug into the crevices and cracks of his body. A particularly naughty pair of fingers stroked up the boys shaft and caused him to shiver despite the warm water and hot and heavy situation.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n''See it's actually some kinda spirit itself. Just like myself now ah imagine. It always starts off abit fast hon. Apparently we're all much dirtier than we'd like ta say in polite company.''<br>\r\n''AHHH-hghghgmmmbblbl''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lady Featherton pushed Chris's head down so his violated gasp was turned into the bubbly giggles of a toddler in the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ah'm a lady sweetie. Keep that ta yourself cause ah knows she's getting frisky down there now. She does have a process. ''<br>\r\n''Uhhhh wh-what? Where am I?''<br>\r\n''Ooooh Jamie's waking up Chris. Hang tight for me? Y'know as tight as y'all can. She is a persistent type so enjoy it while you can cause she'll get in 'ventually.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chris tried his best to hold his...everything closed. He heard Jamie's moaning turn into a high pitched giggle before becoming full blown belly laughs.As yet another pair of Chris's toes was pried open he gritted his teeth and took another breath before his slipped back under the waves. His only hope for this safety from these tickly waters was Jamie. Even if he was laughing his head off right now under the fingers of the lady Featherton at least he was out of these tortu-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">SPLOOSH!!</font></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And just like Chris's only hope Jamie naked as the day he was born, sank beneath the bubbles where the happy and eager fingers of the Selkie greeted him and eagerly led to smile being plastered upon his face.<br>\r\n''NAAAHHAAHA HOW DOES WAHAHATEHER TIHIHIHCKLE!!?!''<br>\r\n''DAAHAHMMIT JAHAMIE YOU WERE ALL THAT LEEEEHEEEEFFT!?''<br>\r\nChris squealed as his bastion was pried open and the very last inch of his ticklish lil' thighs became so much keyboard to the Selkie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady Featherton smiled at her boys laughing happily at thier tubbie time before grabbing one of Jamie's ankles and pulling it out of the water giggling herself at the brief splashes of the spirit's ministrations. She pulled it over to another one of the fiendish harnesses that Chris was locked in then buckled his foot up tight to the opposite edge of the tub. Jamie's soaked head surfaced directly in front of Chris and immediately after getting his breath launched back into raucous laughter as their host absentmindedly twirled her fingers between his toes, scratching at the sensitive skin between the digits. She left her newly trapped trophy before returning to the other side of the tub to resume bothering the securely strapped Chris.She twirled her fingers in the laughing child's hair and then went back to idly down the boys nose. It was rather relaxing shame he'd lost his voice from laughing so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ah've got such plans fer y'all. We're gonna play dress-up, go dancin' play footsies an' that's just to start! All show y'all the proper way to use mah special room-''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept on listing the future torments the two former detectives would go through Chris felt himself slipping away. It was too much he'd been tickled non-stop ever since he came to this mansion and now he was getting the worst tickling he'd ever had in his life TO START his new life of captivity. It felt like million fingers were attacking his poor nipples alone! He....was starting to like it. The warm water gentle strokes. The thorough cleaning and his friend Jamie's melodious laughter. No no no no. He hated being tickled! What was going on! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Then ah'll teach you boys how to give the best dang foot rubs in the world! Trick is you really got ta work the toes!''</span></div></div>",

All'a the ladies will be jus' so jealous of my two adorable escorts.''<br>\r\n''HAHAHAHA LEEHET MEEOUUT!!''<br>\r\n''Hush now Jamie-pie mama's talkin.''<br>\r\n''Blbbub..''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Featherton idly pushed Jamie's head beneath the soapy waves where the waiting grasp of the Selkie scrubbed away merrily behind his ears driving him nuts. The spirit scrubbed away at the boy's defenseless bodies Mrs. Featherton wandered away from the tub still fantasizing about all the fun her and the new prizes she'd won would have.Jamie summoned up all the strength he could muster to power out of the water and climb out of the tub. His naked form crashing to the cold floor and gasping for air. He sucked down as much air as he could trying to clear his mind and regain his footing after his hurried escape. Over the sounds of Chris's tortured and bubbling laughter he heard Mrs. Featherton stil ramnbling to herself about the perceived future she'd have with her fine young charges and teaching them to be cute little gentlemen. When the phrase ''Matching Onesies'' came up Jamie decided it was time to get while the getting was good. He waited until it sounded like she wasn't getting any further away before making his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he needed to help his friend Chris. He'd get Chris out of the water being really careful to keep himself out of it and that spirit's grasp. He'd pull Chris out and together the two boy's would sneak out of here ...somehow. There had to be an exit somewhere and Mrs. Featherton seemed like she was really off on whatever tangential plan she had for the two of them so she'd probably be easy to get by. The two boys would find Summer, Mouse and Pao-Yu then get the hell out of here. This mystery was on hold on account of tickle crazed supernatural forces who he swear he'd just heard mention collars and butt tickling. Yeah they were getting out of here fas-...wait. He didn't hear Chris anymore. He snuck a look over the lip of the tub and panicked at Chris not being at all visible. He did his best but the damn sudsy water was impossible to see through. He leaned out over this tub full of tickle soup looking for his friend but he didn't see anything. This was bad his entire body being in there gave that thing way too much play space and it probably wouldn't care about him getting air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Chris where are you, man? Come on buddy give me a sign here.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smaller hand shot out of the drink and firmly grabbed ahold of Jamie's wrist causing the would-be hero to let out a loud screech. Chris came out of the water smiling like a loon and wrapped his arm around his larger friend's neck attempting to pull him into the water. As shocking as his friends betrayal was Jamie still had quite of a physical advantage on him. He stood strong against his friends shocking betrayal and refused being pulled back into the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wh-what are you doing Chris?!''<br>\r\n''Your gonna make her mad Jamie..you'll make it worse and it's not like this is soooo bad right?''<br>\r\n''H-huh?! What are you talking about?''<br>\r\n''It's just tickling Jamie and what's the use anymore? Let's just accept our new lives!''<br>\r\n''What are you saying? Our new lives?! We're getting out of here Chris and back to Summer and Mouse!''<br>\r\n''Just like last time AND THE TIME BEFORE!? This keeps happening and it'll keep happening! Why not stay here than Jamie? There's no way to get away and we did lose...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie thought he couldn't feel any colder in this freezing room that he was trapped in naked and wet but when he caught a glimpse of his small friends eyes while struggling with him, a brand new chill went up his back at seeing the vacant stare from his friend and the haunted expression on his face. It was very specific and almost felt like a a set of ten light lady fingers skittering up his spine. It felt VERY like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ah leave y'all little gents alone for two minutes and y'all be getting to roughhosing. Guess this'n what it's like to have two little cute as a button boy's running around.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Featherton had returned, she hadn't stopped waxing on but now she idly tickled and scratched between Jamie's developed shoulder blades driving him up the wall. The largest and most athletic of the detectives was shaking with laughter as his childhood friend tried to pull him back into that warm tickle bath and simultaneously used his other hand to tickle Jamie's left ear. Jamie's ears were ridiculously ticklish. It was a weakness that had driven Jamie to his knee's begging hundreds of times in the tickle fight's between him and Chris. Eventually him and Chris had a contracted a peace treaty about it in exchange for hiding his weakness Jamie had hid Chris's surprising weakness (Cute little Chris had a super tickly button nose.. ) and the two had kept those between them and away from everyone from their parents to their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing keeping Jamie from crumpling into the bath with his empty-headed little pal and the waiting selkie who was scrubbing away at Chris petite lil' feets beneath the bubbles was Mrs. Featherton who'd wrapped one arm around him and was doing a much better of keeping Jamie away from the ghostly bath than Jamie's own arm's which had pretty much turned to jelly at Chris's betrayal and exploitation of his secret weak spot. She pulled him away from the tub and gave Chris a quick spidery tummy tickle (Which the boy leaned into) before shoving her new little ally back into the water and the tickly fun that awaited in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Featherton was a petite woman in life, However as a ghost she made up for her slight stature through her newfound spectral powers which she used to float Jamie before her like a piece of handsome bait. As Jamie dangled and kicked in futility in the air she worked her devilish hands in to knead and grasp at his ribs. Jamie tried to stop her but his hands just kept sailing through her ghostly arms and did nothing to stop the hands taking advantage of him. She placed her fingers atop the young man's rib and vibrated making him shriek in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ahahaha whaha-haht hahahappeehened to Chrihihihs?!?''<br>\r\n''Now that is just the cutest dang thing ah ever done seen. First thing on yer' mind is your little brother. Jus' like a good big brother would. Your taking care of him.''<br>\r\n''Weeheheh're nahahahat brohoohoothers.''<br>\r\n''Ah sweetie who you were outside is gone. Y'all belong to me now and ah've had a lot of guests down here but ah'm at that age now where ah wanna settle down. Hear the pitter-patter of ticklish lil' feet around an what better way ta be ah mee-maw than to two cute lil' ol' southern gentlemen.''<br>\r\n''Soohohunds greheaht mohohohohm!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sounded off from in the tub where the broken little tickle-toy had his tiny little feetses up on the lip of tub. As the selkie tickled away in the water Chris begged in between offering up his cute little nose to get to tickled to beg his new mom to tickle his tiny toes which he was offering up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mohohohmyy! Tihihihckle my feeheeheet pleeheeahasee!!''<br>\r\n''Chr-chrihihis whahahat's wrong wihihth you?!''<br>\r\n''Y'all are just darling.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Featherton dropped Jamie naked, confused and scared on the cold floor before drifting over to the little prizes her new son was begging to have played with. She grabbed a hold and pulled him out of the tub. Chris came out the way he was in the tub. Laughing his head off. He plopped down and immediately pushed his feet towards mama who eagerly wrapped them up and started up some mama's lil' piggies with him. Jamie caught his breath and took in the sight of his best friend who now seemed to be some kind of crazed tickle-slave to an angry and baby crazed spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Haahahahaaa''<br>\r\n''This little piggy does what sweetie?''<br>\r\n''Thahahat little pihihiggy went to mahahahahharket mahahma!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grasped the big toe and wiggled it furiously causing Chris to erupt in giggles and pound his fists on the cold floor. Jamie couldn't believe this what happened to Chris?! He giggled and squealed with as if watching a funny movie and made absolutely no attempt pull away. Jamie swore he wouldn't leave his buddy like this but right now he needed some distance. He took off running but glancing over his shoulder he saw that their game was continuing unabated by his escape. She worked the longest one of Chris's toes back and forth as she continued on her with her taunt's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''This little piggy was a bad boy that tried to run away and leave his poor old mama alone wasn't he sweetie?''<br>\r\n''Nahahaha mahahama thahahat piggy stayed hoohohme and got tihihihihckles!!''<br>\r\n''Awww my precious lil' thing aren't you just the sweetest slice of pie.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted Chris's captive foot up and gave his little a gentle kiss. She looked slyly at Jamie and locking eyes with the boy over his shoulder as he fled went in for more. She smothered the sole with kisses as Jamie just kept running. She got smaller and smaller in the distance until Jamie turned away from his broken friends torture. He saw a strange object coming up fast and was glad he did when he realized that it looked just like that damn tub he'd just escaped. He slowed down and went around it before he felt his ankle get yanked out from under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Weheehelcome bahahack Jahahahamie!!''<br>\r\n''Sugar did you have  a fun run? This foot of yours looks sore. Let's loosen it up a bit.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Featherton?! but he was running away from her! As she worked her thumbs in deep and began massaging away at his foot Jamie realized why this room seemed so empty. If he looked off in the distance he could make out the shape of the damn tub and could see some kind of shapes squirming past it and realized that there was no escape. He couldn't get away and as Chris begged for mama to get back to counting piggies with him Jamie realized....</span></div></div>",

Only harvest flies and muffled sounds from the house could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boys had not returned from their Pokemon Go hunt Summer knew where to go. They had agreed to share the Family Tracker app on their mobile devices. And before the tracking results faded they were located just outside the high wall of the backyard of the Mansion. How could the boys be so foolish to go here on their own, ie without Summer. Their greed for points, levels and eggs must have made them blind to the danger. She shook her head to affirm herself of the boys' ignorance. Of course she had left her own device at home after she had removed the battery a few streets away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to move. Her sneakers were inaudible on the soft grass. Years of gymnastics made her flexible. The broken window as an easy task.

The walkway and front porch looked suspiciously innocent, and the gate didn't even have a lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned away, something ran across the lawn and headed toward her. Chris drew back as several security lights snapped on, tripped by the motion of a... cat. Yep. Chris could see its shadow cast on the sidewalk through the gate's bars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a low hissing sound from the house, then a sharper hiss from the cat. The lights went back out, and the cat wormed through the ironwork onto the sidewalk. It was glowing, green as a lume stick, diffidently shaking its paws and stinking of whatever it had been sprayed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" Chris whispered to herself, managing not to crack up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat turned out to be more than chance entertainment; as it proceeded away from Chris along the sidewalk, it ducked into the thorny bushes growing outside the manor's block wall and paused to lick at its luminous fur. The wall-trained pyracantha had been enough to discourage any up-and-over plans when she'd reconned the area with Summer and Jamie two days ago, but the glowing cat revealed there was a break in the hedge and a tunnel through the thorns. She'd never have seen it, otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked around, made a larger entrance for herself (very carefully, the going still brambled enough to make her wince a few times), and squatted down in the low passage. Someone had done a great job sculpting through the spiky foliage, even if she had to duck-walk the length of the tunnel and work her pack and right sleeve loose from the occasional sticker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat was keeping its distance from her, torn between running away and cleaning itself. It provided more than enough light, and eventually pointed the way out at the far end of the excavation: there was a complete hole in the wall, six blocks pulled out and neatly piled to one side. Chris went through on her knees without even needing to take her backpack off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrubbery on the inside of the wall consisted of much friendlier honeysuckle, which Chris squirmed through easily enough. She had a great view of Featherton Manor's side yard, the grounds cutting away at angles toward both the front and back of the mansion. Chris watched the cat disappear into the rising fog, heading for the back gate and the cemetery beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis side of the house looked safe, a nearly blank wall rising to the manor's distinctive garrets and cupolas.

Duh. Packing the optics away, she spent several minutes listening for any sound of Summer or Jamie. Nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the fog from the swamp had thickened to an almost edible density, Chris made for the gazebo as quietly as possible, and then angled off in the general direction of the box she'd spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nearly tripped over a cellar door that was buried in shadows and flush with the ground. Someone had used stencils to spray paint \"Secret Enterance\" on the iron-banded slats, which meant they were bad spellers in addition to underestimating the local sleuthers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the ironic impulse to knock on the door and scream \"DUH!\" at anyone who'd answer, Chris kept looking for the junction box and spotted it: unpainted, very new, and nearly as obvious as the 'secret' door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipping into a pocket, her beloved Skeletool jumped into her hand (she even smooched its tungsten coat). Chris flipped the combo blade out and started to work on the faceplate, keeping back just in case the thing was boobytrapped. The plate flipped open on a hinge, revealing an electronic keypad so new that it still smelled of its packaging. Ha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grommet holding the pad in place had been hastily installed, and Chris thought she might pry it off and get at the wiring. Or else pluck out her 'Berry and reference the appropriate de Bruijn sequence, though that'd take some time to input and assumed a really stupid keypad. Or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris's train of thought was interrupted by a crackle of paper underfoot. Dipping down, she came up with a Post-It, on which was scrawled a five-digit code with fat, girlish cursive scolding, \"dont fergit!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour exclamation points, each one dotted with a heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet if I kicked this place hard enough, it'd fall right over,\" she groaned, starting to slap her forehead... before considering the note's code might be a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris thought it over, looked at the hearts again, and keyed the numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA piece of wall vanished just to the left with a 'Whhfft!' of compressed air. A ramp led down a short corridor and veered into a larger, open area; Chris could see distant light, and heard voices mixed with an occasional squeal of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris promptly...</span></div></div>",

Even the giggling sounded familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there <i>are</i> three, but they're the <i>wrong</i> three!\" someone complained. It sounded like an older girl. \"OK, two of them are the right ones, but the littler kid is Salt's brat sister. There's supposed to be another girl, same age as Salt and her boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris hung back before peeking around the corner, trying to determine where everyone was by sound alone. The complainer was talking to somebody on a radio -- someone who'd apparently been ordered to catch Chris herself! A good thing she hadn't tried going through the junkyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Boss sent M&amp;M out, so I <i>hope</i> you got her that updated gluepot map... because we don't want them coming back to kung-fu <i>us</i>! And Crispy wants first crack at these snot-nosed wannabes, but <b>only</b> the complete set. So you maybe understand why I don't care how cold it gets or how you can't see a thing -- you're on that back gate until the third kid shows up. No, she will, don't sweat it. These goody-goodies always stick together. There hasn't been anything up front tonight but a cat -- which, yeah, I already <i>know</i> you saw, because how could you miss it?! So keep your eyes open. She'll probably try sliding past you in the fog. And if she <i>does</i> somehow get around you, then... nice knowin' ya. Not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris heard more giggling, realizing who it was. She took a quick peek around the corner, and then settled for proper spying when she found herself completely out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer, Jamie, and Mouse were all tied up and packed in some sort of tricked out Tilt-A-Whirl car. Their wrists were bound together, and they'd had their shoes removed, their bare feet fastened to the grab bar with pink foam rubber (or something that at least looked pretty comfortable). Summer and Jamie had been gagged with their own socks, but Mouse had avoided that indignity. She <i>did</i> have kind of a cute laugh for a pain in the neck, so maybe that had saved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir captors were three girls dressed as clowns. Naughty clowns, Chris figured, since they were wearing candy-striped spandex catsuits with equally colorful heels. Though they looked a little 'light' to be truly wicked, and their florid Pippi wigs undermined any sense of lewdness. High schoolers? The Clown Prince must have been desperate for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe henchgirls were made up as grotesques, their greasepainted faces exaggerated into a simper, a sneer, and a genuine (if overdone) smile. Sneer was the one with the radio, and Smiley was the one occasionally tickling Mouse's feet -- to the visible enjoyment of both, strangely enough. Simper was working her way through a stack of Amusement Business Weeklies, ignoring everyone. Summer and Jamie just scowled, occasionally testing their bonds and making angry noises behind their respective mouthfuls of sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big room they were all occupying was cylindrical, looking like a deluxe version of that carnival ride where you spin around and stick to the wall. An intricate collection of shelves bordered half the room in a semicircle, and there was plenty of space between this and the wall for Chris to hide behind. The shelves were so loaded with junk, from plush midway toys to wrapped gag shop merchandise, that no one could see her unless they came looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all she had to do was figure out how to rescue the gang from the clown girls...</span></div></div>",

I got enough of that during our initiation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris hunkered down and slid along at a creep to avoid making any noise or sudden movements, continuing her search for an item that might save the day. Unfortunately, the offerings were a little slim for her needs, plastic vomit and wind-up teeth not likely to faze the Clown Prince's underlings. She was actually grateful for those moments when Smiley gave some attention to Mouse's feet, the kid's squealing enough to cover the sound of Chris hastily shuffling forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drew even with her colleagues on the far side of the racked merchandise, something substantial presented itself. Concealed behind a platoon of rubber chickens was a gigantic set of doll legs. That's what Chris assumed they were, anyway. Palletized and half-heartedly shrink-wrapped, the things were clearly meant to be the gams of some cute and cuddly thing that would top out at two-and-a-half meters. The glossy black Mary Janes were the length of Chris's forearm, and the white stockings with navy stripes looked like they could swallow a Ford Fiesta. From dimpled knees to mid-thigh, the rubbery doll-skin escaped the socks... but the mechanism from that point was all business. Segmented alloy shafts projected upward, bent ninety degrees, and met in a mirrored globe the size of a basketball. The orb bore a sinister resemblance to the flying, brain-sucking spheres in those movies Jamie loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a closer look, Chris saw just what she'd hoped for: a break in the seamlessly reflective finish that revealed a simple O/| power toggle. It looked as though a large knob had been in place before, and then removed. But Chris could see a 6-star indentation that looked just right for a Torx bit, so she grinned and came up with her Skeletool (smooch).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that humming noise?\" Lee asked, fingers poised over Mouse's helpless soles as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was suddenly involved with rubber chickens, kicked into flight by the autonomous dolly legs. The right foot balanced primly on tiptoe,  almost as though apologizing for the dramatic entrance, before stepping fully out of storage and deciding on its targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris knew she'd hit paydirt as soon as the clown triplets began screaming and scampering. She ducked through the space the legs had cleared and saw the sphere shooting a laser designator in the shape of a Mary Jane sole on Sneering Lin's spandexed butt. Prancing forward, the right foot delivered a kick that flipped Lin out of her heels, the THWAP! of contact making Chris flinch in sympathy. Lin howled with outrage and sprinted away, making better time without her shoes. With her partners left behind as speed bumps, it became a prospect of 'devil take the hindmost,' further shouts of dismay and stung pride attendant on each THWAP! The henchgirls managed to get another hidden panel open and charged up the stairway it concealed, Legs sashaying after them and gamely assisting their ascent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHRIS!\" shouted Mouse, straining to peek over her toes and see her rescuer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got stuck in traffic,\" Chris said, trying to hold back her self-satisfied grin. \"I guess you guys carpooled it?\"</span></div></div>",

Both he and Summer looked a little stung at the turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris explained how the villains occupying Featherton Manor had unwittingly shown her the alternate approach. She also detailed her precise path, in case any of the gang were later separated and forced to find their own way off the property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how exactly did <b>all</b> of you manage to get...\" Chris began, trying not to look as prim as she felt. She made quick work of the stuff binding her friends in place, and the three immediately got their socks and shoes back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind about that now,\" Summer quickly said, disregarding Chris's query with a furious blush. \"Were you able to find any clues during your stroll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this.\" said Chris, offering the slip of paper with the door code, which instantly took the edge off Summer's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The handwriting's obviously the work of one of the empty-headed Thorn triplets,\" said Summer. \"And the code could have some other meaning, so keep your eyes peeled for a pattern. The Post-It seems to have a watermark, but I can't make it out...\" Summer drifted off into one of her sleuthing fugues, gripping her chin savagely between thumb and forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Those</i> were the Thorn sisters?\" Chris asked, dumbfounded. It made perfect sense, now that she had time to consider it: Leela, Linsey, and Lissa had vanished some weeks before the current round of kidnappings had started, but the romantic rumor was that they'd run off to the city! Ha! And they'd instead been recruited by the Clown Prince?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh!\" said Jamie, pleased into a really irritating smirk at the chance to turn Chris's catch phrase against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm a little slow tonight,\" said Chris, arching her brow. \"Seeing as I was stupidly blundering my way to your rescue, I didn't get to know the floozies well enough for a round of 'This Little Piggy.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie went crimson and looked away, which was more than Chris had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigod, <b><i>did</i></b> they, Jamie?!\" Chris demanded, both delighted and appalled. \"That's <i>my</i> job! Is that why you were gagged? You loudly informed them they didn't have the right?! My hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, guys?\" said Mouse, eyes on every curve of the room. \"Shouldn't we get out of here before that thing stops kicking their butts, or someone else shows up?\" The junior Salt had already made a preliminary circuit of their surroundings, employing her uncanny knack for detecting things hidden. In addition to the secret stairway the Thorn sisters had used for a bugout, the cylindrical chamber accommodated two other disguised passages: one with a set of rickety stairs befitting an abandoned mansion, and the other containing a recently added personnel lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouse is right,\" Summer said, surfacing from deep thought. \"Chris, take Mouse and track down any scrap of information that could tie the Clown Prince to whatever dastardly scheme is being carried out in the manor. If we go running for the authorities now, he might slip away before we have any solid evidence against him. I think I have an idea why CP's grabbed all those kids, and what he's planning to do with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of that from a Post-It note some dopey girl scribbled on?!\" said Chris, flabbergasted. She was too amazed to be bothered at getting saddled with the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer, as always, completely ignored Chris's open-mouthed disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll meet back here in one half-hour, behind the shelving, to compare any pertinent discoveries,\" Summer declared. \"If one group finds the other absent, they'll immediately leave by Chris's path and summon the police. If no one makes it back, we'll wing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As usual,\" said Jamie, managing not to sound glum. Probably because he got to tag along with his crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Synchronize watches!\" said Chris, taking some pride in being the only one present whose timepiece received regular, accurate squirts from NIST -- which meant everyone <i>else</i> did the synchronizing, while she suppressed a gloating half-smile and felt justified in her technophilia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe junior sleuths having ironed out their immediate strategy, Chris and Mouse headed for...</span></div></div>",

The control panel was a long strip of too-modern touchscreen, at odds with the 'abandoned mansion' d\u00e9cor, and the car itself was about the size of a fat man's coffin. A <i>short</i> fat man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris brushed a finger over the controls, which underwhelmed by presenting a really long (bright, colorful excessive) 'down' arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the doors shut, a corporate logo was revealed on the brushed metal: two circles separated by an \"ibe\" abbreviation in that cutesy, lowercase script that resembled a kindergartner's scrawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks really familiar, but...\" Chris mused, breaking off as the doors opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and Mouse were at one end of a short, circular corridor floored with some light-gray spongy stuff. A blond girl was on a step ladder right in front of them, boots off as she kept precarious balance on her perch and futzed with something in the ceiling. There were plenty of lights and more colorful controls at various points along the hallway, but these were flickering on and off as the girl continued making adjustments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any help?\" Chris asked, half a second before the girl turned to see who was exiting the lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would y'all mind holdin' this light steady?\" the blond asked, stepping down and handing Chris an LED beam. She looked maybe nineteen, had a pronounced southern accent, and didn't look at all surprised to find Chris and Mouse wandering around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nodded and obliged, Mouse holding the ladder still as the girl went back up. Several seconds later, the lights in the passage steadied, and an HVAC system whooshed into operation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just <i>had</i> ta have everythin' installed in the wrong order,\" said the older girl, tucking tools away in her IBE corporate coveralls. \"The security foam cannons, the laughin' gas canisters, that rotten foil junk she came up with... I said, 'Maybe we oughta worry about, y'know, lights and ventilation and surveillance stuff first, so ya can actually see what you're shootin' at,' but that didn't make much of an impression, so we're still playin' catch-up. Lucky break for you guys, though, 'cause else y'all'd be squirmin' around on the floor right now, beggin' for mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you work for?\" Chris asked, eyes narrowing. That dumb corporate logo was eating at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the heck are we even <i>talking to</i>?!\" Mouse asked, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now, I'm Lottie Linhart-Corona... nanny, governess, general dogsbody,\" said the blond, leaning forward to shake hands. Her grin was so congenial and self-effacing that it was difficult not to like her. \"And I already know you're Susie Salt, Summer's kid sister... and you're Chris Boliski, Summer's best friend. She's got dossiers on both of y'all, 'seize-on-sight' directives, et cetera. But with everythin' else I do, I <i>specifically</i> had a <b>**</b>no snitchin', no scufflin'<b>**</b> clause added to my contract, so y'all got no troubles with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no!\" Chris shouted, figuring it out. \"IBE... Iron Ball Enterprises! You're working for that <b><i>headache</i></b> girl, Pao-Ting!\" Chris pounded her forehead and stomped in place, miming a migraine. Mouse threw her hands in the air to signal her ongoing bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh,\" Lottie said, managing to make it sound friendly as she maintained her grin. \"I'm surprised Michiko and Maruko didn't catch ya yet. Now, <i>they're</i> the muscle, and y'all might wanna skedaddle before they come back down to report in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Chuck...\" came a voice from the overhead intercom. Mouse and Chris jumped, startled. Lottie just rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHUCK!\" the voice barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I'm right here, MA'AM!\" Lottie responded, tapping a panel overhead. The overmodulated hum from the pager died down, and Lottie stood with her hands behind her, rocking on her heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you talking to yourself out there? How's it going? When do I get to train these targeting reticules on my arch nemesis and her hapless flunkies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris bit a thumb to stifle the urge to shout back an insult. That was <i>definitely</i> Pao. And... did she say <i>flunkies</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I've only just now got the lights on proper and the a/c goin' so all your toys don't overheat, first time ya use 'em!\" said Lottie. \"The cameras and this sensor paddin' is next on the list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chuck, you sound really comfortable and relaxed, for someone who's been hurling herself at my, well... 'light' work. Are you barefoot again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLottie winced, slipping her boots back on. The embarrassed pause tipped Pao off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it! If you're going to be <i>that</i> informal in our brand-new secret base, Chuck, I need you to come see me, right away. I've got a few really awful things that need calibrating, and an obedient country girl with no use for footwear would make for an ideal test subject!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLottie collected her step ladder, urging Chris and Mouse to silently scram back up the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and... bring some of those mints with you,\" Pao asked, politely. \"The good ones, Chuck, not the ones you've been trying to placate me with.

Chris managed not to flinch, and Mouse didn't gasp loudly enough for either to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both Asian, and appeared to be the same age as Lottie. Both had black hair that fell past their shoulders, both were wearing black jumpsuits... and the comparisons could proceed indefinitely, because they were identical twins. The only noticeable difference between the two was their footwear, the girl on the left missing a shoe, and the girl on the right down to a single sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, Chris thought <i>very</i> quickly. The clown girls had said something about \"Little Boss sending M&amp;M out,\" and something else about... gluepots?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pao didn't think that map was accurate,\" said Chris, nodding with what she hoped looked like rueful commiseration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we experienced some difficulty,\" said the twin with one sock. Her quiet, neutral tone was a little unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we mistaken in assuming your names are Chris and Susan... pardon me, 'Mouse'?\" the other half of the act queried. \"We have spent some time searching the grounds for you, Chris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are equally pleased to have Summer Salt's younger sister as a guest, also.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris groaned inwardly; was there anything worse than twins that took turns talking? If they started finishing each other's sentences, she'd scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The funny thing is, we just visited with Pao and have to go back out on an errand,\" Chris said, watching to see if they'd buy it. \"We sort of hoped you could tell us where <i>not</i> to walk? Lottie needs your help getting the cameras working, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not likely that you would be sent without our accompaniment, even assuming some unforeseen circumstance occurred which makes you now the comrades of our mistress and not her... honored guests,\" said Sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us return together, properly clothe ourselves, and speak to the mistress about your errand,\" said Shoe. Whatever brief confusion Chris had managed to cause between them was fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You oughta go like you are right now, so we can tell you guys apart,\" Mouse suggested, realizing that her paralyzed uncertainty wasn't helping matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Maruko,\" said Sock, bowing her head in introduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am Michiko,\" said Shoe, bowing similarly as she moved to close the distance between herself and Mouse. \"Tell us, if you have just recently left the quarters of our mistress... how has she outfitted herself for the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" said Chris, knowing she could buy a few seconds at best with her temporizing. She could angle past Maruko, maybe, and get back behind the shelves, try and duck outside... but Mouse was toast. Michiko all but had a hand on her, and Maruko was going to make a friendly grab any second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was she wearing?\" Maruko clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a stitch, unless you count the bows in her hair,\" said Chris, praying that might raise a chuckle. \"She's got oodles of self-confidence, but that's about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris could see Maruko holding back the ghostliest ghost of a smile, which must have meant she was wildly amused. Chris snaked a foot out and tried to stomp Maruko's toes. The older girl drew her vulnerable foot away, smooth as silk, but it left her off balance for a crucial second.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blind luck got Chris to the door she'd entered through, Maruko forced to slow just before making a grab and slipping on one of the rubber chickens scattered earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the inside, the panel's trigger had been kept simple: a big green button, backlit, with no keypad. Chris hit it and slammed her right shoulder against the opening panel in her haste to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the side yard, Chris thought she'd been plopped down in a world of cotton. The fog was so thick that she could barely see her hand flapping in front of her nose -- but she <i>did</i> see the advantage, and took several quiet steps away from the secret door along the side of the house. As she stopped, getting her breath under control, the panel hissed open again. She heard Maruko pad out onto the lawn, but saw nothing other than swirling fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute's wait started to work on her nerves, Chris having no idea where her pursuer had gotten to. For all she knew, Maruko had been clever enough to stop and listen for some sound from her... but the acoustics in the fog were weirded out, too. Chris thought she was hearing whispers, and then seeing a faint glow nearby. She tucked her glasses into a pocket, tired of wiping them clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris heard a gooey, slapping sound a few yards off, followed by muttered curses in another language. The phantom light she'd noticed earlier was back, brighter, resolving into a will-o'-the-wisp. Chris followed it and stopped short, spotting Maruko just ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Chris could see Maruko clearly, the reverse didn't hold. Maruko looked right at her several times with no sign of recognition. The older girl had finally run out of luck, and Chris got her first look at a 'gluepot.' The trap consisted of a hole in the ground roughly a foot in diameter, filled with... white stuff. Well, it looked like Elmer's glue, so the name fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruko's misfortune was in finding one with her bare foot. Tugging with considerable strength, both hands behind her knee, she was able to raise her trapped foot a few inches. But <i>only</i> a few inches; the glue, stretching like taffy, yanked her foot back into place each time with a tacky sucking sound. Maruko groaned with exasperation, music to Chris's ears. She found herself grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whispers in the mist were undeniable, now. Even Maruko looked around, clearly puzzled. As the mutters of an unseen multitude rose in volume, things started happening to Maruko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loop of brume furled around Maruko's right wrist and tugged. She pulled back, gasping with surprise, but the fog was stronger. Inch by struggling inch, her arm was pulled over her head. And then the other, and she was pinioned. The only thing anchoring her to terra firma was the trap she'd stepped in, her socked foot sweeping the air above the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris should have recoiled, as freaked out by the unseen force as Maruko, but she had a feeling she knew what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruko hissed, pushing her head against her right shoulder at an awkward angle. She clearly wanted to move her arm, but was prevented by the mist she'd been ringleted by. She gasped a few times, squirmed heroically, and then began giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris watched as tendrils of fog poked at Maruko, settling and stroking. Maruko squinted so hard Chris thought she heard a blood vessel pop. The giggling got louder, and the trapped girl writhed helplessly in midair like a marionette with its strings tangled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruko's remaining sock was peeled away and thrown at Chris (who caught it, absentmindedly tucking it away in a pocket), and the floodgates opened. The laughter Maruko had begrudged was being wrung out of her a lungful at a time. She shouted for help, looked ashamed to have been driven to that, and then vented an ear-splitting shriek that seemed to fall dead in the fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruko's scream represented her last slice of intractability, the next minute of the fog's attentiveness leaving her only enough respirational ambition for squeals and peals. Watching the girl she'd run in fear from being so casually dismantled was... very appealing, really. Chris considered getting her camera out, but decided the memory would be sweeter without distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tears began to run down Maruko's face... they <i>didn't</i>. The droplets were sucked up and wicked away into the fog, and that seemed to be exactly what it was after. Maruko's ticklish tears floated, incandesced, and vanished. The haze apparently had a particular thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a point where Maruko's frantic, streaming eyes and hopeless posture wore Chris down. There was also Mouse to consider, likely being entertained by Pao after this interlude.  Summer and Jamie were going to be coming back to meet up in a few minutes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris decides to...</span></div></div>",

This results in Chris trying to protect one ear as the fog tickled the other. Chris starts giggling as she starts to feel the adrenaline flow through her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"stop it!\" she giggles. The light tickling that was just brushing her skin felt as though the fog was taunting her. She knew this wasn't it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fog begins to wrap around her abdomen. It looks like there are tiny little tendrils beginning to wrap around her torso from behind. There is tiny tendrils between each of her ribs. She can tell that this was going to go downhill in a while. She closes her eyes and prepares herself for the terrible tickling that is going to start directly at her ribs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt a thickish tendril in her belly button wriggling like a frantic worm. Caught unawares, she screams as loud as she could and starts laughing. She tries to arch her back and to suck in her belly; anything to get the tendril out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tendril seemed to follow her every movement, making it impossible for her to escape from her predicament. </span></div></div>",

More fog formed into a hand-shape and started to scratch her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Chris was losing it. The ticklish tendrils had invaded her clothing and was tickling her bare skin. It was more than she could take. She was squealing and squirming in mid-air, trying desperately to escape the tendrils that followed her everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tendrils sneaked up her jeans, scratching at the backs of her knees and squeezing her thighs. As she stomped the ground, even her sneakers were being loosened. Chris became panicked as the tendril's light teasing because heavy tickling. Not a single inch of her body was forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, eyes streaming with ticklish tears, looked over at Maruko. The fog had left her, and she was standing up. Chris watched her as she tried to brush away the tickling tendrils. Maruko walked over to Chris and goosed her sides. Chris squealed and dropped to the ground. Quickly, Maruko flipped Chris onto her back, sat on top of her stomach and allowed Chris to squirm in place. With the relentless tickling of the fog, Chris was still laughing uncontrollably, trying to push Maruko off of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cute. I thought you weren't ticklish.\" said Maruko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tendrils had been working. Chris' sneakers were coming off, and her socks were following. Her shirt had been raised over her head, revealing the tank top she wore underneath the shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I help you?\" asked Maruko. She pulled the shirt off of Chris and slipped her fingers of expertise into Chris' bare underarms and wriggled them. Her intense tickling added to Chris' predicament, and Chris was continuously squealing and squirming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me tell you a secret, Chris.\" Maruko lowered her face to Chris' ear and whispered, \"I like a good fight in my victims.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris' eyes bugged out. She was so confused. She had never been so ticklish in her life, but here she was, pinned by Maruko and having the life tickled out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruko laughed. \"Confused, aren't you? The fog has a special power. It doesn't just tickle... it heightens sensitivity. Especially around those it doesn't know. From now until forever, you will be much more ticklish than you've ever been in your entire life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruko lowered herself and slid lower down on Chris' body, still tickling her underarms as she lowered her chin to tickle Chris' belly. Desperately, Chris tried to push Maruko's head away, but all the tickling had weakened her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the tendrils of fog had gotten her socks off. Tendrils sneaked between her toes and began to tickle her feet. The balls of her feet were teased, and her toes were scratched. Chris convulsed into silent laughter and could barely move for laughing. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chancing a glance behind her, Chris saw Maruko easily -- almost mockingly -- closing the distance. The headlong dash she thought would get her free now seemed no more effective than a toddler's scampering. When Maruko caught her around the waist and lifted, the contact was so gently ineluctable that Chris at first thought she was levitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, please calm yourself,\" Maruko urged. Her poise suggested she could hold Chris up at arm's length for a few hours, if necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was frantic, kicking and flailing as she tried to do some damage, or at least unnerve Maruko enough to get herself dropped. But her captor didn't even look annoyed, much less shaken. Maruko's composure was supernatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chris had worn herself out with her thrashing, Maruko set her back down.  Chris immediately thought to run, and was caught before she finished considering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you willing to accompany me without further silliness?\" Maruko asked, still quiet, unruffled, and completely sure of herself. Chris felt her eyes swim with tears of frustration, trying to swallow the lump in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruko, seeing the condition Chris was in, released her hold and gestured toward the elevator. Under other circumstance, Chris might have collected herself and followed along, relenting... but Maruko's impassivity made her feel like a bug under glass, and it was unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris made a move for one of her cargo pockets, deciding she'd get <i>some</i> reaction from the emotionless teen... and immediately succeeded on that count. Things happened so quickly that she was numbed with disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruko swept the area around them clear with her bare foot, simultaneously grabbing Chris, spinning her, and getting her backpack and hoodie off. Chris was then painlessly escorted to the floor, straddled, pinned, and allowed to squirm in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" said Maruko, looking down at Chris and smiling. \"We will proceed with concession to the absurd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was astonished by the smile, but even more shocked when the fingers of Maruko's free hand darted under her shirt and traced along her ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving long ago established her credentials as a tooth-gritting, head-pounding knot of obstinacy when being tickled, Chris demolished that meager piece of refinement in the first few seconds under Maruko's skillful touch, braying laughter so unselfconsciously that she felt like a spectator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat weird, out-of-body sensation lasted for perhaps another full second, at which point she stopped being a spectral observer and became a regular girl with ribs that were being tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had always thought the worst thing about being tickled was, underneath the annoyance and relative discomfort, it's still sort of fun. Maruko knew just where to tickle, for how long, and with the precise amount of intensity to boost the 'fun' ratio, which made Chris's earlier, baffled fury melt away, no matter how hard she tried to hang onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruko stopped, released Chris, and stood over the gasping junior detective until she'd caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, OK!\" Chris said, not feeling so bad about surrendering, now. She'd been bent, but not broken. \"I'll go with you! Just give me a break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you will go with me. And I <i>am</i> giving you a break, Chris. But I am <b>not</b> done tickling you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris shrieked at the moderate assurance, though not entirely with horror. Rather than attempting to run away, she pounced at Maruko and tried turning the tables. Maruko laughed encouragingly as Chris struggled to tickle her, before again infiltrating her untucked shirt and going after her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on her knees, Chris tried wrapping her arms around herself and squeezing... <i>anything</i> to stop Maruko's wriggling fingers. Her determination led to a bad case of the snorts, and Chris watched helplessly as her glasses slid off her face. Maruko caught the spectacles before they hit the floor, setting them a safe distance away on Chris's backpack. Another respite was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <b><i>finished</i></b>?!\" Chris demanded, bleary-eyed and trying to diguise the strange sense of amicability she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, Chris. Your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>That</b> was enough to send Chris for the door, Maruko chuckling as she reeled her back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Summer and Jamie returned on schedule after a half-hour, they found Chris prone, Maruko sitting on the backs of her knees. Chris's right foot was bared and under the weariless flick of Maruko's fingers; the junior sleuth was pounding the floor with her fists and had resorted to cramming a handy rubber chicken into her mouth to hold back the screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" Summer started to complain, perplexed by the tableau.</span></div></div>",

Chris realized it was a <i>lot</i> more embarrassing to be getting tickled in front of Summer and Jamie, and put up some token resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that tickling Chris is our job,\" Jamie explained. \"Don't look, Summer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris couldn't see what was going on, but it seemed like someone had put on a strobe light. It winked off before she could look over her shoulder, and Maruko had stopped working her poor, tortured foot. Chris wisely spent the free time gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off of her,\" Jamie instructed. Maruko complied, and Chris staggered her way upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you guys...?\" Chris began, trailing off as she stepped around Maruko and looked at her face. The older girl seemed to be in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found one of these crammed in with a bunch of other junk in a closet upstairs,\" said Jamie, showing Chris some ring with a fat hypno-swirly pattern on it. \"It's how the Clown Prince's goons have been grabbing the kids so easily. One shot of this, and anyone will do anything you tell them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's give <i>her</i> a ride on the Tilt-A-Whirl,\" said Summer, sounding uncharacteristically vindictive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you guys, listen,\" Chris said, getting her sock and shoe back on while rounding up the rest of her stuff. \"She's working for Pao-Ting! Pao's got one of her patented secret bases right under us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pao-Ting?!\" shouted Summer and Jamie -- because there was no <b>way</b> they'd forgotten last summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worse! Maruko, here... her twin sister, Michiko, grabbed Mouse! She's down there right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too many Ms in a row!\" said Jamie, trying to write it all down in his Notepad o'Clues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Summer whispered, face falling. \"Pao will tickle the stuffing out of Mouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with that hypno-ring, she won't,\" said Chris. She put her glasses back on and walked for the elevator, instructing the mesmerized Maruko to tag along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                     *                    *                    *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My leg's starting to cramp,\" Jamie complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, Summer, Jamie, and Maruko had all managed to jam into the tiny lift, which had been sort of like those old-timey pics of college students packing into a phone booth. Chris didn't mention he was standing on her recently tickled foot, because a little pain right there felt fine at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Maruko, have you got it?\" Chris repeated. \"You don't listen to anything anyone else tells you but me, all right? You take the ring, walk in and zap everyone you can. Send Mouse out, and then you and your sister catch Pao and tickle the sin out of her. I mean that literally -- tickle Pao until she turns into a good girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe junior sleuths shared a snort of laughter over the thought of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Maruko, quiet as usual. She took the ring and stepped out of the elevator, heading down the short walkway to Pao's sanctum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long?\" Pao asked over the intercom as soon as Maruko stepped out of the lift. Lottie must have gotten the cameras working. \"You didn't catch Summer's friend?! Mitch said you'd be right back with her! Get in here and tell me what happened, Marco! No mints for you, that's for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound of a hatch cycling, a surprised squawk from the intercom, and then silence. A really long silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck's going on in there?\" Chris wondered aloud. The doorway cycled again, and the sleuths risked a peek out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse was walking down the hall, barefoot and disheveled -- and looking very blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, how hard did they tickle her?\" Jamie asked, horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just hypnotized, Jamie,\" said Summer, relieved to see her sister. \"She got hit with the ring, too. Mouse, come on! Run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse ran to the elevator, looking hilariously unenthused about it. Chris sent them back up as Summer tried hugging her little sister in the cramped confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long does the effect last, anyway?\" Chris asked Summer and Jamie, looking at Mouse's peacefully expressionless mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... probably not too long, I guess,\" Jamie said, shrugging. \"The ring didn't exactly come with an instruction manual. An hour? I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the group was back up in the circular room, Chris pried the touchscreen out of the elevator and found some promising contacts. The elevator doors partially shut, then opened. Half-shut, opened. The cycle would keep the car jammed in place, with any luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they don't have another way out of there,\" Jamie muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's bail, just in case,\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and Jamie looked to Summer, who suggested...</span></div></div>",

The stairwell looked suitably abandoned, newel posts splintering and the runner coming up in tufts. A single, naked light bulb hung at the end of a long cord above the stairs, swaying and flickering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quartet proceeded through the only door at the top, stepping into a dimly lit hallway that angled past boarded windows covered by moldering lace curtains. Summer and Jamie headed for the first room on the right, no one speaking until the door was closed behind them, and then only in whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was your big brainstorm earlier?\" Chris asked Summer, referring to the Post-It that had so exercised Summer's sleuthing instincts downstairs. She regarded the room's fusty old bed with distaste before straightening the rumpled duvet and having a seat, Mouse automatically following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't what that ditz had written that tipped me off, but the paper itself,\" Summer replied. \"That watermark was part of the Iron Ball logo, and if one of the Clown Prince's minions was using corporate stationery, it stood to reason the big boss had teamed up with Pao and was getting spooned hardware for some nefarious scheme... I just had no <i>idea</i> she'd have set up base here, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Chris said, nodding, \"but why would the Clown Prince want to cooperate with Pao?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ignored what the clown girl had written and took a closer look at the note,\" said Summer. \"It's too dark to see here, but trust me -- someone had written hard enough on the pad to leave an impression. I could <i>just</i> make out a hastily jotted inventory that matched something we found in our first encounter with CP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" Chris groaned, flopping back on the bed and covering her eyes. \"Something about schematics for that idiotic Gelotron thing he'd been trying to put together?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That machine that collected laughter?\" Jamie asked, looking uneasy. \"We were wondering how he planned to get people to laugh. I hope it's not what I'm thinking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pseudoscience!\" Chris protested, sitting back up and scratching furiously at her nose. \"There's no 'psychic residue' or 'emotional essence' that you can scoop out of thin air and decoct into a diabolical mixture that allows you to... what? Power some engine of doom to take over the world, or at least a couple of small inland counties? Duh! Total nonsense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should run and tell him, right away!' Jamie teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not whether or not it actually works, Chris, but that he <i>thinks</i> it will,\" said Summer. \"The man is patently insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why's Pao doing business with him?\" Chris asked. \"She's not nuts, just a bratty evil genius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she wanted to team with someone who had it out for us as much as she did?\" Jamie suggested. \"I'll bet she wanted to help him build this thing and then &lt;gulp&gt; have him stick <i>us</i> in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So instead of this dumb Gelotron just being some big woo-woo pyramid hat, it's... a tickling machine?\" Chris considered, looking a little queasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my considered deduction, yeah,\" said Summer, looking pleased with herself. \"And based on the blueprints of the manor and the size of the device in the last set of diagrams we seized from CP, there's only one spot he could be putting it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The attic!\" said Jamie. \"And I figured that out myself, Chris, so stop giving me dirty looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to climb up another two floors past who knows how many of CP's lackeys, sneak into the attic, swipe the specs for the current model, probably get pictures of the thing, then free all the kids and march down to the police station?\" asked Chris -- although she didn't need to, because Summer smiled and nodded with each point of Chris's plan. \"Oh, c'mon! Can I just... go back home and join the backgammon club or something? You guys are as crazy as CP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, think about it!\" said Summer. \"They already know we're here, and they're <i>not</i> tearing the place apart looking for us after we slipped out of the clown girls' clutches. These guys are slackers! I bet they're all sacked out right now, and they'll maybe start kicking around tomorrow at the crack of noon. After they've had a few slices of cold pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the boss,\" Chris muttered. They <i>had</i> prevailed with a similar game plan, last time. If the hirelings were still as stupid, it might work. \"How are we going to get up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie and I are going to scout ahead,\" said Summer. \"We've already found a really convenient dumbwaiter. I want you to stay here with Mouse until she snaps out of it, then have her hide. You can catch up to us like this...\" Summer provided a rough map of the mansion on a piece of Jamie's notepad paper, and the dynamic duo went back out quietly and left Chris babysitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <i>going</i> to snap out of it?\" Chris asked Mouse, waving a hand in front of the kid's face without getting so much as a blink in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, there was a sound from the hallway...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris, feeling less intrepid than ever after her humbling encounter with Maruko, decided to investigate from under the bed. Collecting Mouse, she arranged her charge and herself in the darkest corner and waited, peeking at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps stopped just outside, the doorknob turning slowly. Chris held her breath. No option now but to keep hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom door creaked inward enough to allow entrance for a kid, who slipped in with painstaking care and shut the door just as cautiously. When the newcomer turned, Chris could see it was a girl -- with a mop of ludicrously frizzy red hair and a Fauntleroy suit that looked as though it had been Deadheading since the Felt Forum opened; every motion she made changed the velvet a different color. Trippy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kicker was her face, which put Chris in doubtful hesitation. Greasepaint, red nose, painted smile, the works... but if she was part of the clown squad, why was she sneaking around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the clown girl was looking to hide and about ready to crawl under the bed, Chris made the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you knock?!\" Chris demanded in a furious whisper. The clown girl gasped, biting down a yelp, bringing her head up fast and cracking it on the underside of the bed frame. Chris winced, catching the girl's oversized mandarin beanie as it tumbled off and dragging her under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not a moment too soon! The door opened again, slamming against the wall, as a guy dressed in a ringmaster's outfit took a quick look inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you they didn't make it upstairs,\" someone said from the hallway. \"They ran home after they got loose, is my bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bet that may cost us...\" the Barnum knockoff began, shutting the door as he continued chiding his partner in the hallway. Chris heaved a sigh of relief, along with her visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" they both demanded of each other, following a silent minute spent listening to confirm their seekers were walking away. The clown girl lost the staring contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Crespina, and don't laugh,\" said the clown girl. Chris immediately felt some sympathy, the poor girl stuck with a first name so bad that it overwhelmed the rottenness of her own in full. \"Call me Pin, though. Those guys are after both of us, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris introduced herself to Pin, along with the still-entranced Mouse, and synopsized her business at Featherton Manor along with the high points of the evening -- leaving out the embarrassing bit where Maruko had gotten the better of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Clown Prince caught all of us and made us dress up like clowns!\" Pin said, gritting her teeth and looking away. \"And then he tickled us. A lot! He's got this machine in the attic, like a carnival ride... but you <b><i>really</i></b> don't want to ride it, believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends are trying to get up there right now,\" Chris said, all three of them still scrunched up under the bed together. Their situation, along with Summer and Jaime's undertaking, seemed completely stupid when told to an escaping clown girl. Having talked to her, Chris could tell they were the same age, which just made it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh!\" Pin said, amazed at Chris-and-crew's cluelessness. \"If we don't stop 'em, they're just gonna get caught and... well, the Clown Prince asked everyone about you guys when he first caught us, and he's got three special slots in that machine marked 'Reserved.' <i>You</i> figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we have to catch up to them and convince them that this whole thing is stupid, like I've been saying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't even a <i>chance</i> I'm going back upstairs! Let's get out now, while we can, call the cops... and they'll probably send back a SWAT team before your friends get tickled to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can't do that,\" Chris replied, realizing that no matter how nutty this caper was or how high the odds against them, she couldn't leave Summer and Jamie behind. \"And if you try getting out on your own, you're going to get stuck in these gluey things they've got rigged in the ground. Even the henchpeople don't know where they all are! I know a safe way through the yard, but I won't tell you until I at least catch up with my friends and try to sell them on splitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two glared at each other in the fog-filtered moonlight coming through the bedroom window, Mouse lying placidly between them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris put up a determined front and, once again, Pin knuckled under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" said the clown kid, gloomy about their prospects. \"I'll try to bring you back the way I came, but I'm gone the moment it looks like trouble. When the Clown Prince's goons catch you two, you'll wish you'd run right out the back door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris didn't say anything, because Pin was probably right. Mouse made for the best excuse to cut out, but she couldn't do that to Summer and Jamie; they'd both saved <i>her</i> plenty of times, and under more trying circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were headed upstairs, Pin took the lead, Chris close behind and Mouse trailing woodenly. Chris wished she'd come out of her trance, but didn't have any ideas on how to hasten Mouse's revival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said something about a dumbwaiter,\" Chris whispered to Pin, the three girls creeping down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they didn't try <i>that</i>!\" Pin said, stopping dead with a look of alarm. \"The Clown Prince is using it for a lure, and he even said he expected one of you to drop right into his hands that way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic,\" said Chris, shaking her head. That <i>had</i> seemed a little obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's terrible timing, but I gotta go,\" Pin said, pressing at her middle and bouncing on her toes. Chris would have laughed, but then realized she was feeling a little pressed as well. \"There's a bathroom just a few doors down, and if we <i>do</i> get grabbed, I'd rather not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" Chris said, blushing. It hadn't happened to her yet, but last summer's run-in with Pao-Ting had been close. She'd been saved by Summer, just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPin led on to another nondescript door, though the hallway was picked up a bit better; there were no cobwebs, and someone had vacuumed the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring they'd take turns, Chris was surprised when Pin ushered them into a sizable break room, narrow but long. There were a couple of vending machines, two microwaves, a fridge, and a coffee maker. The 'big top' flair had been kept to a minimum, confined to purple and green floor tiles and a few stripes of color winding along the walls. The fluorescent glow was a little harsh after the dim hallways, but Chris was still impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" said Chris, looking around. \"Is this the minions' lounge? Very corporate! I wonder if CP's hooked them up with a health plan, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right back,\" said Pin, walking quickly and carefully to a door at the far end of the break room. Chris checked the machines, saw that everything was free, and got two bottles of water for herself and Mouse. Her mouth had been a little dry since Maruko's performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPin returned, putting her silk gloves back on -- which was sort of weird, because didn't she want to <i>get out</i> of that dumb costume? She could at least dump some of the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry!\" Pin urged. \"You never know when one of these guys will come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouse, go and use the bathroom like normal, OK?\" Chris directed, figuring Mouse definitely had to avail herself of the facilities by now. \"It's clean, right?\" Chris asked Pin, feeling a little creepy about sending Mouse in barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think CP had us do when we weren't getting tickled?\" Pin asked, getting something to drink for herself. \"Housework, in the high traffic areas -- <i>and</i> he inspects, because he loves to find things wrong, so he can... Look, it's spotless, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris went in after Mouse, who'd apparently had no trouble with the basics despite her condition. As promised, it <b>was</b> spooky-clean. Chris regarded herself in the mirror, after, washing her hands and seeing she didn't look much worse for wear, given the night's activities. She even got her comb out and tidied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" Pin asked, abandoning her fearful whisper, all trepidation gone. She'd sat Mouse down and was brushing the hypnotized kid's hair for her. \"Fresh as a daisy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" Chris began, confused, and then ducked as Pin's boutonni\u00e8re squirted water at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it! <b>That</b> was what I needed the bathroom for -- the sink, for a refill! Chris, stand still and lemme squirt ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something in the water?\" asked Chris, gesturing at the bottle Pin had been drinking from. Maybe the stress had finally gotten to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure,\" said Pin, mistaking Chris's point. \"It just makes the squirtee a little suggestible, and I thought we'd have more fun if you loosened up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck, Pin?!\" Chris demanded, pointing at the door they'd entered through, bars having slid into place on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you call yourself a <i>sleuth</i>?!\" said Pin, laughing out loud. \"The hat didn't give it away? It was a present from Pao! And my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pin?\" said Chris, looking around as she tried to figure how to play it. No coffee on, or she could have tried pouring a pot of joe on the clown girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Cresp</i>ina, though I usually go by 'Crispy,'\" said the clown, standing up and taking a bow. \"Or didn't you know the Clown Prince was my big brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>NOOOO</i>!!!\" Chris howled, stomping in place and yanking her hair in irritation. \"<b><i>Another</i></b> headache girl! It's like Scanners in here, tonight! My head's gonna explode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrispy just laughed along, which was pretty laid back for a villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel bad. <b>I</b> didn't expect Summer's little sister would be tagging along with you tonight. I'd planned for three, instead of four. I kinda like her, though!\" Crispy went back to brushing Mouse's hair, as if there was nothing to worry about. \"I was hoping to catch all three of you at once, but you and Mouse will get Summer and Jamie back down here, quick. I'll just put your squeals and begging over the intercom Pao rigged for us and tell 'em where you're at! I want you guys with <i>me</i>, not up in the attic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see who winds up <i>begging</i>,\" said Chris, shrugging off her backpack and getting ready to scuffle. Maruko had been out of her league, but Chris figured she could pop Crispy in that big red clown nose and change her tune in a hurry.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the threat, dropped backpack, and rolled sleeves, Chris had pretty well telegraphed her intent. Crispy responded by casually snapping her wrist, producing a remote from somewhere up her clown sleeve, and hitting a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris voiced a surprised and embarrassing yelp as the floor dropped away beneath her. She landed in a chute formed of something soft and slippery, sliding down in darkness as she frantically grabbed for something to check her descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A trapdoor?!\" Chris shouted back up into the break room. \"How clich\u00e9!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short ride, at least. Back down to the basement. Chris at first thought Crispy was delivering her to Pao, so it was something of a relief when she popped out of the chute and found herself in a cozy one-ring circus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe circular hatch she'd slid through snapped shut behind her, part of a clown's mouth that was howling with laughter. There were lots more of those, the curved walls painted with shrieking clowns being tormented by feathers held in cartoony gloved hands. Chris gulped hard, realizing the giggling and guffawing she'd heard on entry wasn't part of some psych-out soundtrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three clown girls who'd captured the rest of the gang earlier were squirming around not far from Chris, under assault by... Ugh! Cartoony gloved hands. Said gloves varied in size from teeny-tiny (for detail work) and too-friendly standard (the kind currently poking and stroking the clown girls) up to some really gargantuan mitts that could have grabbed Chris in one go, neck to ankles. The things were animated by some sort of black tubing, ridiculously flexible, that ran back up to a central box mounted on the ceiling. The most prominent marking on the device read \"Gelotron Mk. 1\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" Chris said, groaning with apprehension and hugging her knees. Things were looking grim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spotlight snapped on, focusing to one side of the writhing clown girls, and Chris saw that Legs had been caught too! A pair of the larger gloves had grabbed its... <b><i>her</i></b>... axial sphere and deprived her of shoes and socks; left to hang in the air, a bunch of the smaller gloves were hard at work on Legs, colorful feathers dancing mercilessly along her rubber toes and soles. She was apparently ticklish, straining with a tortured mechanical whine against the gloves holding her ankles as her doll feet wriggled in every direction, seeking a moment's relief. Chris sat flummoxed... by disbelief at a machine being ticklish, by a strange affection for Legs at having (or at least mimicking) this vulnerability, and by a freakily enjoyable dread as she waited her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the gloves seemed interested in her yet, so Chris tried to stand up and explore the general area. The footing was awkward, Crispy's one-room big top floored with the same stuff Chris had slid down on: shiny, purple, satiny stuff covering what felt like foam rubber, mooshy and slippery at the same time. It reminded Chris of her bounce house days, as was probably the point; the entire setup seemed designed to make you feel more childish and (Chris shuddered) <i>susceptible</i>. She lurched for balance and leaned against a wall, which was just as treacherous as the floor. Chris sank in to her wrist before sliding off and flopping down in a painless pratfall. She sat fuming, arms folded, hoping no one had seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpending a few maliciously gleeful moments watching the clown girls get it, Chris jumped as two panels snapped open behind her, delivering first Mouse and then Crispy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so formal, Chris,\" Crispy chided, seeming confused that Chris hadn't entered into the spirit of things. \"Take your shoes off, at least.\" Crispy kicked off her own outsized sneakers, which were immediately snatched up and taken away by a pair of gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round two!\" Chris shouted, after a moment of indecision. Her haymaker not only missed Crispy completely, but threw her off balance and put her face-down on the soft floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ding ding ding!\" Crispy shouted, stepping over gracefully and planting a toe-socked foot in the middle of Chris's back. \"The winner, by technical knockout...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris flipped around, almost losing her glasses, and grabbed Crispy in mid-tease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in a subdued echo of earlier events, Crispy turned out to be a much more accomplished grappler; she grabbed Chris right back, treating it as a game, and playfully wrestled the sleuth to a gasping standstill. Crispy laughed throughout, even as Chris looked for any opportunity to pop her in the face. Chris resented the heck out of being sat on twice in one night, but couldn't prevail between Crispy's hold and the cushiony flooring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off of me and let me beat you up <b>properly</b>,\" Chris suggested through gritted teeth, having enough dignity not to scream with rage. Crispy grinned down at her, taking a moment to consider it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, that wouldn't be much fun for either of us,\" said Crispy. \"Chris, why are you being so mean? I don't let just <i>anyone</i> in here, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crispy!\" gasped the nearest clown girl -- and she <i>really</i> had to work at it, sounding half-dead from being tickled. \"C'mon! UNCLE!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris tilted her head back and got an inverted perspective. It was Lin the Sneer, and it was nice to hear the snotty girl pleading. Despite current circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, all right,\" Crispy responded, sounding vexed. \"Release my miserable menials, GT.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrispy spoke into a smiley face button on her collar, and Chris tilted her head back once again. Sure enough, the gloves laid off and left the three stooges in a sweaty, tearstained pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Legs, too!\" Chris demanded, even if she wasn't exactly in the best position for it. Crispy lit up all the same, her grin slipping a few notches wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Chris... how sweet! That makes up for me knocking my head on the box spring earlier, and all your hilarious bluster about trouncing me!\" Crispy spoke into her smiley button once more. \"OK, GT, stop tickling Junior... but <b>don't</b> let her go! Even barefoot, she's a menace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrispy decided Chris was neutralized -- or at least not crazy enough to try anything when a single command would send several dozen eager gloves her way. She rolled off of Chris and stepped over to scold the clown sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you guys hadn't blown it, I'd probably have <i>all four</i> of them down here, right now!\" said Crispy, sounding genuinely disappointed at not collecting the entire set of junior detectives. \"And since I got so justifiably steamed at your running around the house for yucks and then blaming it on poor Junior, you've now been entertained to the point of uselessness. So just... go to bed. Depending on how the rest of the night turns out, you might be back here in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thorn triplets didn't need any more of an invitation, and crawled their exhausted way to a proper door that opened in the mural of laughing clowns. Chris tried to note where it was, in case she had to knock a hole in it later. Assuming she'd still be in any condition for something so physical by then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had just given up on the idea of pounding Crispy and was considering how to stall her when the chief clown girl spun on a socked heel, regarding her captives with obvious excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" said Crispy, \"Where were we?\"</span></div></div>",

Two or three times.\" The clown girl gave Chris a consoling pat on the arm, tossing her mandarin beanie away and preparing to issue dread commands to her smiley button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Chris said, too loudly, hands up as she managed a nervous smile. \"What about Mouse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her?\" Crispy asked, looking back at the younger girl. Mouse was still sitting as she'd slid down: feet straight out in front of her, staring at nothing. \"She'll get tickled as much as you, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's still hypnotized, so how <i>can</i> she get tickled?

Stand by for introductions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris backed away from the swarm of gloves slithering down at her, not noticing one had snuck up behind until it had grabbed the back of her belt and lifted her off the floor. She folded her arms and tried to look unflappable, fixing the back of Crispy's head with a withering scowl. Her pose evaporated when several gloves moved in, but they just wanted to get her hoodie off. Crispy looked back and grinned at Chris's anticipatory giggling, laughing out loud as Chris tried bicycling her legs to keep a half-dozen of the dinkiest gloves away from her feet... which only made the slow, torturous ceremony of unlacing and removing her shoes that much more agonizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want those back!!\" Chris yelled, looking from gloves to Crispy for some acknowledgment. Crispy muttered something at her collar, and the Gelotron dropped Chris's hightops rather than tucking them away in the inaccessible storage nook per routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris watched as Crispy pulled something out of a pocket and waved it in front of Mouse's face. The kid recovered at once, though she was clearly at a loss as to what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Pao?\" Mouse asked. \"Did I miss the most merciless part?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse made her way unsteadily toward Chris, trying to negotiate the smooshy floor and puzzle over Chris's predicament at the same time. She looked happier than Chris cared for at seeing the Gelotron, and responded with affable cheer as Crispy introduced herself. Chatting and <i>shaking hands</i> with their no-goodnik hostess, even!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouse, I'm starting to wonder whose side you're on!\" said Chris, trying to ignore all the gloves ranked around her. A pair dipped down, grabbed one of her shoes, and brought it back up near her face; one held the hightop as the other suggestively ran its tiny gloved fingers along the rubber sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Chris... where <i>are</i> you most ticklish?\" Crispy inquired, capitalizing on Chris's discomfiture with precise, aggravating enunciation. Chris just yanked on her hair in \"Headache!\" mode without uttering a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under her arms!\" Mouse blurted, looking surprised. \"That's where everybody's most ticklish! Crispy, you've probably watched your machine tickle all sorts of people, so quit kidding that you don't know the First Law of Ticklishness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris noticed Crispy becoming even more charmed by Mouse, now that the kid was unhypnotized and back to spouting Mouse-isms. Maybe she could use that to her advantage, somehow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GT switched its grab on Chris, abandoning the increasingly uncomfortable belt-dangle in exchange for a larger, more comfortable glove around her waist. Chris struggled in the grip, just to see if a decent squirm would get her anywhere... but the hold was La-Z-Boy cushy and straitjacket-stubborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a more technical interest in the Gelotron's mitts, Chris grabbed the tiny glove still immodestly stroking her sneaker and had a closer look. The thing's \"arm,\" black as pitch with the approximate diameter of a garden hose, had the feel of latex filled with warm jelly. It made no mechanical sense to her. She'd expected a more solid frame, finely segmented to allow for the arms' weird plasticity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands were just as supple, if not so yielding. The white glove was sort of slippery and fuzzy at the same time, its material gathered into three distinctive black darts at the back and rolled at the arm to imply a join with a non-existent wrist. Three fingers, one thumb. The little glove put up with Chris's prodding and poking before gently twisting in her grasp and tickling her palm. She let go at once, scoffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't even make any <i>sense</i>!\" Chris said, deeply annoyed that she was about to be undone by something whose operation she couldn't explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me to get you the FAQ later,\" said Crispy, smirking at Chris's uncompromising rationality. \"GT, I think Chris has been sitting around long enough to gather dust. Give 'er the glove test!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the many gloves queued around Chris's middle eagerly complied, worming under her purple \"Night of the Uncool\" T-shirt and tracing across her belly, right to left. Chris grabbed for the intruder, shivering... and had her grabbing hand caught at the wrist and lifted above her head by a second glove; the first continued checking along her ribs and under her arms, one stroke for each. She relaxed a little despite her ill-tempered groan at being so casually handled; objections aside, it felt sort of nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inspection wasn't complete until Chris had her neck, knees, and feet fingered; the single stroke down her right sole dragged her sock halfway off, so the glove doubled back to yank the dangling article loose and repeat on her bare foot. Chris bit back a laugh, but couldn't repress an even more embarrassing snort as her foot tried for orbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inspecting glove dutifully held out its index finger for Crispy to examine, the smaller gloves producing score cards ranking Chris's sensitivity -- which indicators the three girls took immediate interest in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it!\" said Crispy, pleased with the numbers. \"Chris, we've got exactly the same rating! It's like being sisters. Cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not an Olympic event!\" said Chris, trying to slap her right hand over her eyes in disbelief... except it was still grabbed by a glove, so she had to use her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you guys should get married!\" suggested Mouse, teasing Crispy for her enthusiasm. \"We could have the wedding right here, and your tickling machine could mess around at the last minute trying to find the ring, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was as far as Mouse got, two gloves launching for her ribs and putting her on the floor with a surprised shriek. Chris was intrigued to see Crispy had just angled a thumb at the pesky kid, no voice command needed. So how did the Gelotron sense things? How did it 'think?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking,\" Crispy said to Chris, talking loudly enough to be heard over Mouse's ticklish squeals. \"I'm going to leave you guys alone, not resting until I catch Summer and Jamie, too. And then you'll find some sneaky, technical way to escape while I'm gone -- maybe even catch me and turn the tables, and bring me back down here for a taste of my own medicine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" Chris said, heaving a sigh. She didn't have the same faith in her abilities that Crispy did. Once the Gelotron started in on her, she'd be out of commission. Not that there was anything to be gained by letting Crispy know that, so let her sweat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only I've decided they're not as important anymore, and I'm not going to burn myself with the expected villainous overreach. I'm happy with you and Mouse! So we'll all stay and have fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thrilling,\" said Chris, making a face. She hoped Summer and Jamie were doing better, wherever they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GT, make it a Grand Tour for me and my guests!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother big glove dropped down to grab Crispy, and a number of smaller hands matching Chris's complement formed up and readied themselves for the clown girl's annihilation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's <i>that</i> going to prove?\" Chris asked, gulping as she wondered what exactly a 'Grand Tour' consisted of. It sounded awful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see if our numbers really match up,\" Crispy whispered, cutting her eyes at the GT's primary assembly and winking. \"And it'll be fun! My current batch of subordinates aren't very amusing, so it's been a bore lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll do everything I can to be really, really boring!\" said Chris, eyes wide as the GT's gloves passed several feathers among themselves, seemingly bickering over the choicer offerings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just saying stuff like that makes you anything <i>but</i> boring, Chris!\" said Crispy, grinning. \"I want a red one, GT, and... oh, you're way ahead of me! Purple for Chris, that's right. Go ahead and use all the rest on Mouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can you... stop it... if it gets... too terrible?\" Chris asked, trying to duck away from the purple feather being used on her chin and ears. The GT was going to start gently and work its way up to maddening, it seemed. Fiendish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would be the point?\" Crispy replied, wincing as she blew at the feather dancing around her own face -- Chris was relieved to see she wasn't a complete masochist. \"If you know you can end things just by saying the word, where's the challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Challenge?!\" Chris gaped, scrunching her shoulders up as her neck got feathered. \"What if you can't stand it? Because I'm already there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <b>have</b> to, because there's no escape. For either of us! Duh!\"</span></div></div>",

That's the spirit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris's heart was pounding, and seeing Mouse under full feathery assault was no help. The GT had taken Crispy literally, employing every feather it had (except two, darn it) against Summer's sister. Mouse was on her back with her feet in the air, tee-heeing to her heart's content as the GT's automated mitts meticulously introduced a rainbow of plumes to the girl's soles. To actually <i>enjoy</i> being tickled... it was too weird for Chris to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she <b>did</b> understand was that she had to come up with something, fast, or risk losing her mind in Crispy's warped playroom. The obvious course suggested itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say our rating for ticklishness or whatever matches, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, <i>GT</i> does,\" said Crispy, whispering as she rolled her eyes. \"I'm not convinced. Only we'll both get tickled to death if it tries to justify its figures, so just pretend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK... so since we're both exactly as ticklish as each other everywhere, how about a little bet? Have GT tickle us both -- at the same time, in precisely the same way -- and see who laughs first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if it's me, I let you and Mouse go - otherwise you'll stay here forever and ever as my loyal tickle slaves, blah blah blah. Something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Loyal tickle slaves' wasn't what I had in mind if I lost, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, the thing is, I like laughing, and I <i>especially</i> like hearing other people laugh! If you somehow manage to slip out of here without a single hysterical shriek, I'll be devastated! How about a contest to see which one of us can come up with the goofiest laugh while getting tickled? <b>That</b> would be interesting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's so subjective!\" Chris complained, disappointed that Crispy hadn't jumped on the idea of her wager at once. \"Who's going to decide whose laugh is goofier, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse, who'd by now given over to an uninhibited round of hiccupping titters, volunteered without realizing it. Crispy looked at the kid and considered, nodding to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouse sounds like she has a pretty ridiculous laugh! And since I know she's not as eager to get out of here as you are, I could consider her unbiased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I</b> couldn't, for just that reason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She tagged along with you guys because she wants to prove she's a competent junior detective, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... and now look at her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris privately had to admit that Mouse would be happier saving her big sister and playing mascot on future cases rather than hanging around and getting tickled, though. Crispy noticed Chris silently relenting on the point and made it official.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GT, quit feathering Mouse and bring her over here to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Mouse complained, frowning as she was hustled over between Chris and Crispy at the behest of several dozen gloved hands. \"Why don't I get to get tickled more?! I wasn't ready to be let go! I keep getting cheated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bet, Mouse, and you can be the judge,\" Crispy told her, explaining her idea and Chris's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll count it as a laugh even if you bite your tongue and snort!\" said Mouse, pointing a finger at Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nodded, scowling. If nothing else, she'd bought herself a little bit of time without being tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll it be, Mouse?\" Crispy asked, sounding a little nervous. \"A test of endurance, or comic sensibility?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse thought about it for several seconds, finally saying...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris could see Mouse thinking it over. However nice Crispy might be, she was still the Clown Prince's sister. Who knew how she'd react if Chris won? And if Chris <i>didn't</i> win, what then? Crispy hadn't mentioned what she had in mind for them if they lost, but it had to be something dire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Mouse went with the option Chris had more practice with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Let's see who can hold out the longest!\" said Mouse, giving Chris an evil grin. Mouse made it look good (Chris had known the kid long enough to recognize her <i>truly</i> evil grin, and this one was a put-on), so Crispy traded her cheerless sigh for a smirk, thinking Mouse was rooting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And no clown tricks!\" Chris warned, which made Crispy laugh out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of 'clown tricks' do you figure...\" Crispy began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She laughed, Mouse! We're out of here! GT, put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, it's gotta be a laugh because she was getting tickled,\" Mouse explained, trying to sound very patient and grown-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The old Salt integrity!\" Crispy said. \"I knew I could trust you, Mouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this over with,\" Chris grumbled, thinking it should have counted. Now she'd have to get tickled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gelotron was quick to oblige, bringing the purple and red feathers back into play. Both Chris and Crispy scrunched their toes and winced as their feet were gently tickled, gritting their teeth once the strokes became more insistent. The gloves that had been working on Mouse added their own gossamer urgency to the mix, and soon Mouse couldn't see either girl from the ankles down for all the gloves and feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot feeling the need to protest the treatment for form's sake, Chris had been confused: the feathers felt kind of good... not terrible, but tickly in an almost relaxing way. The bad part was that she couldn't giggle, which was what she most wanted to do right then. She glanced over at Crispy every so often, satisfied that her competitor was having just as hard a time of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to squirm, but the fluffy nimbus of ordeal tracked her feet through every wiggle and contortion she could manage. Chris squeezed her eyes shut tight enough to see stars, a single tear rolling down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she started to gasp, which was a prelude to a giggle. She tried to get herself under control, but it was no use. With a despairing squeal, Chris gave in and started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept... so did Crispy. The GT stopped feathering the contestants, putting the quills away in apparent defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse was agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You guys both laughed at exactly the same time, I swear it! GT, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gloves paired up by size and showed their palms, indicating a collective shrug. GT flashed its score cards again, the rest of the gloves pointing at the numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's true!\" said Mouse. \"You guys are exactly as ticklish as each other! On your feet, anyway. With feathers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and Crispy didn't care to hear it, both of them sullen at having survived an intolerable amount of foot-feathering with no determination of a winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who laughed harder, then?\" Chris demanded, knowing that was irrelevant. Again, Mouse confirmed a deadlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GT took initiative, a swarm of featherless gloves returning for direct investigation. Chris and Crispy both went ballistic in perfect synch, screaming with laughter as their feet were overwhelmed by silk-fingered irresistibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris felt like she'd had the wind knocked out of her, waiting to see if her lungs would go sailing past her teeth and land on Mouse. It <span class=\"cpink\"><span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">TICKLED</span></span>! Attention from Crispy's dreadful device wasn't <i>anything</i> like being tickled by another person, or even a bunch of people. Her intellectual estimate of a worst-case outcome to this gamble had just been swept aside. This could potentially be lethal! That, or her transcripts would be forwarded to the local acorn academy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCringing, Chris peeked at Mouse once she'd caught her breath. And again, it was worse than losing! Another tie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try someplace else instead of their feet, GT!\" suggested Mouse, the gloves already in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had been required to memorize and recite all 132 lines of a particular poem last year, and 'eternity in an hour' now made direct personal sense to her - in the space of a couple minutes! There was no question of stinting on the laughs, and there were gloves left spare to grab and hold her when she started thrashing too much. Chris had a feeble awareness that Crispy was getting massacred as well, but didn't think much of it. Once upon a time, she remembered making a bet over who could keep from laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris found out her tummy was more ticklish than her feet, which retired one of the enduring theories of her first decade. She also rediscovered that trying to crush her arms against her sides was no effective defense against fingers in her armpits, and that GT didn't find desperate elbows any sort of obstacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, GT lowered both Chris and Crispy to the floor, and the girls immediately tried to squirm away to safety on their bellies. They were caught by their ankles at once and slowly dragged under the massed gloves again, given something to squirm about. Chris tried to defend her stomach and got a dozen gloves swarming over her soles in answer. She tried to draw her legs beneath her and felt gloves sliding under her shirt and going for her armpits again. As redness pounded at edge of her vision in time with her frantic pulse, she glanced over and saw Crispy wasn't doing any better. Mouse was still standing by, dodging as needed when the two victims thrashed too near, lecturing the ticklees about how they should be conducting themselves. Thankfully, even GT wearied of Mouse's chiding and added her to the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter not very many minutes following the start of hostilities, Chris and Crispy were beyond demanding the particulars of \"Who won?\" and trying to ignore just how sweaty, tearstained, and generally ravaged they must look to each other. Mouse was still a thrashing blond indistinctness powered by screeches and squeals nearby, but graduated to complete prostration soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGT slapped its gloves together, as though dusting its hands off following a piece of work done well, and retreated to its main housing. Chris watched the gloves -- even the huge ones -- somehow deflate themselves before rolling up in a symmetrical mass of arms' lengths for storage. It even let go of Legs, despite Crispy's earlier order, but the automated doll gams were content to walk along the mooshy floor in obvious enjoyment of the soft surface rather than approaching to kick helpless butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mk. 1, undeployed, trundled off via a powered locomotion link in the ceiling and disappeared through a panel in the far wall. There was a burst of kaleidoscopic light, calliope music, and a whiff of popcorn before the egress snapped shut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and Crispy both tried to sit up at the same time and fell back, whupped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw?\" Chris asked, eyes on the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" replied Crispy, without any reluctance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse, impartial judge that she was, responded with the slow, steady respiration of a kid pressed to her limits and zonked as a result.</span></div></div>",

Her makeup had run a little, and Chris glanced at her with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Chris said, managing to stand. \"No winners, no losers! We don't have to stay around! And your enforcer's gone to bed, I guess, so you don't have any way to keep us here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris flinched as Legs strode over, apparently attracted by the sleuth's insistence on her freedom. Expecting a kick in the pants, Chris was nonplussed when the doll legs stopped, heels angled outward as the toes took turns hiding under opposite insteps. Now what?! Legs was acting all bashful instead of tromping around like a respectable engine of derri\u00e8re-booting doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, Chris!\" Crispy warned her, grinning. \"I think Junior's got a crush on you! Watch it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme a break!\" said Chris, weirded out. \"You told her to mess with me or something. Call her off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrispy just laughed as Legs extended a foot and playfully brushed against one of Chris's own. The rubber was warm and pliable, but a little large and ungainly for this gesture of... affection? Ewww!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get this thing off of me!\" Chris complained, moving around the currently gloveless Glove Box to get her stuff back. She had her glasses, pack, and footwear gathered in short order, but Legs was following her at a respectful distance and getting some accomplished Footsie Fu moves in the entire time. Chris realized there'd be no way to get her shoes and socks back on with this sort of stalking playfulness, and once again shouted at Crispy to get Legs under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it!\" said Crispy, looking like the last thing in the world she wanted to do right then was laugh. \"She gets real sweet before bedtime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris tried to stomp one of the doll feet when it darted in to nudge her ankle again, but Legs sandwiched Chris's kicking foot between her own and indulged the young investigator with a rubbery kneading. Chris shouted about how awkward this all seemed, and Crispy was back on the floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more!\" Crispy gasped, holding her sides as if she was on her way to a life-threatening giggle. Chris felt a little bad for her, as she knew the clown girl <i>really</i> couldn't have wanted to laugh after what they'd been through. \"Chris, please! <b><i>Stop</i></b>!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not my fault,\" said Chris, taking some spiteful cheer in Crispy's giggling agony. \"Legs is in <b>LUV</b> with me, and I don't have the heart to put the kibosh on her crush, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any fingers poking her, Crispy was past the point of begging -- again! Chris sneered and met Legs, footsie for footsie, elevating their little dance to a burlesque that kept Crispy incapacitated. Mouse snored through the entire thing, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris decided to go for the kill, dropping to grab a big rubber dolly foot. Squeezing the instep, Chris watched as Legs lost control and collapsed on the floor, her central orb bouncing off the plunkety surface as her toes wiggled in rapture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Legs was foot massaged into a Mouse-like torpor, and Crispy's face had drooled a little further down her chin with more unwilling tears. Chris thought she could even see some actual skin under the greasepaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm nearly dead!\" Crispy complained, catching her breath. \"I could sleep for twelve hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" said Chris, letting up on the deactivated Legs to get her socks and hightops on. A glance at her watch showed it was just after midnight. There was no school tomorrow, but there <i>had</i> been today -- or, errr, <i>yesterday</i> -- and Chris had been up for sixteen hours... sixteen hours with a relentless cherry on top, thanks to GT. She wanted nothing more than to go home and crawl into bed, and the idea of getting the best of the Clown Prince before dawn made her want to weep with exhaustion. Even the thought of trying to find Summer and Jamie to convince them to leave now and come back fresh tomorrow afternoon seemed miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could sleep over, if you wanted!\" Crispy offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then have my mom find out in the morning that I wasn't home all night, only she'll think I got kidnapped, and then my sleuthing career is sunk and I have to take piano lessons every day after school until I'm 45 and a half. Thanks, Crispy, but I need to get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Mouse, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be a screaming, cranky mess, but it comes with the territory. Geez. We need to solve mysteries on Saturdays, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be a <i>lot</i> happier if you'd just trust me,\" said Crispy, raising her clown eyebrows in an impeccable \"I've got a secret!\" pantomime.</span></div></div>",

Even the idea of walking home seemed agonizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a hand with Mouse, and I'll show you,\" said Crispy. They each grabbed an arm and hoisted Mouse upright. The kid mumbled in her sleep, but didn't complain as they carried her along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were heading for the door Crispy's clown girls had crawled through earlier, and the Thorn triplets appeared just as Crispy was preparing to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you let her keep her shoes, boss?\" Lin the Sneer complained, seeing Chris still in her hightops. \"Didn't even have her tickled until she passed out? Gettin' soft?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris saw the clown girls were carrying their shoes, since trying to negotiate the smooshy Glove Box floor in heels would be impossible. She considered stomping Lin's toes, but wasn't sure how Crispy would take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrispy was already scowled out, debating whether or not to chastise Lin, and decided it would depend on a certain result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the rest of my package arrive?\" Crispy asked, digging in a pocket with her right hand. She must have plenty of other firepower, because Lin looked pale and nervous right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they slid down just before we woke up,\" said Lin. \"We kept it pretty light, but they look like they're ready for bed. No endurance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, they're just kids,\" said Lee, leaning forward to smooth Mouse's hair. This close, Chris had to wonder how they'd recovered so quickly. Even though it had <i>seemed</i> like hours in GT's clutches, Chris could see it hadn't been more than about twenty minutes. Ouch! Maybe Lin had a point about endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept the triplets had been blubbering, tear-stained wrecks when they'd slithered out on their bellies, so how did they look all bright-eyed and flawless in so short of a time? 'Before we woke up,' Lin said? Like they had time for a nap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLis was quietly pointing out to her sisters that Legs was slumbering, but Crispy headed off their revenge with a direct order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I got what I wanted, you guys are off guard duty for now,\" Crispy told them. \"Go down and see if Lottie needs any more help with Pao's stuff. You had plenty of time to sleep and goof off, so get to work. And leave Junior alone! If you wake her up now, she'll <b>really</b> do a number on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe triplets sighed and minced over to another hidden panel in the laughing clown mural. They stepped into a lift and storked to get their shoes on as the doors closed. Chris thought that was as good a reason for a refreshed Mouse as any: there were so many secret panels around this place that the kid's weird ability to find hidden passages would be indispensable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was really corny, I'd say 'Welcome to my universe!' or something,\" said Crispy, urging Chris through the door her henchgirls had issued from. Chris shied away at once, because several of GT's mitts immediately poked out. But they were just interested in grabbing Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put her to bed, GT, and then stand by,\" said Crispy, and Mouse was whisked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris poked her head around the doorframe suspiciously, not pleased with losing Mouse again, and ducked right back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you thought <i>GT</i> didn't make any sense?\" Crispy teased Chris. \"You're not going to believe the FAQ on this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had another peek, reasoning it could all be done with mirrors, but the sense of space was too compelling. Plus, the staircase/roller coaster/Habitrail thing was surrounded by a massive black and white scrim, and Chris could hear the curtain rippling all the way up as it stirred in a whiff of breeze from... where? The Twilight Zone? You'd have to stack three Featherton Manors on top of one another to fit this whatchamacallit inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet you'll want to stay until you figure <i>this</i> out, right?\" Crispy asked, sounding a little excited. Chris didn't answer, stepping into Crispy's flipped out pad and looking around. It didn't help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the... space... was cylindrical. Chris was starting to feel like she was being held hostage in a series of Pringles cans. The floor was made of tinted black and white tiles, and she could see other floors beneath her, which was as creepy as the eleven or so levels above. The central space had a huge set of spiral stairs with -- it was still there, and didn't make any more sense up close -- a roller coaster track tracing around it, and some of that translucent conduit that hamsters run around in stuck between the coaster track and the stairs, though the tubing was big enough for a person. Chris hoped Crispy didn't have giant rodents running around in there, but at this point nothing would surprise her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staircase wrapped around a column of dark mahogany with doors set at even intervals at each landing. If you were to stand on the stairs and look straight at one of those doors, you could pretend you were in a New England boarding school because your parents wanted to get back a refined young lady at the end of term. If you pulled a 180\u00b0, you were on a Victorian landing dropped from low orbit that had crashed into Space Mountain after smacking into a stray Chuck E. Cheese on the way down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even though Crispy had up the world's biggest collection of carnival posters all along the stairwell, the color still seemed to be overwhelmed by all the black and white. The carpet on the stairs was black and white, along with the banister (the shafts alternated), and the hamster chute was translucent black plastic with a barely discernible white interior, and the coaster tracks were black tubular steel with white struts. The whole shebang was swathed with the big black and white striped curtain, a flap of which had been folded back to allow access through the door leading back into Featherton Manor. The decrepit mansion now seemed a lot less weird, and walking home didn't seem like such a terrible idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Crispy?\" Chris said, having to say something. \"Look. I'm just a plain old junior sleuth, and poking around abandoned mansions looking for bad guys is pretty much the limit of what I deal with. Sure, sometimes you get caught and tickled, but that's the life. I don't really know how to handle alternate realities, or whatever you've got going on in here. So I'm going to go back out and pretend this never happened. Bring back Mouse, help me find Summer and Jamie, and we'll all split... maybe come back later on today after we sleep and shower and have breakfast and stuff. It'll be our secret!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Chris, don't be such a wet blanket!\" Crispy said, grabbing Chris by the arm and dragging her further in. \"I thought you'd love it in here! Anyway, Summer and Jamie are already waiting in another room. They tried taking that obvious dumbwaiter after all, and it dumped them down into one of my traps! I knew you guys would fall for that one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, having had a really weird night so far...</span></div></div>",

You won't be able to continue looking like a grade schooler forever. Look, your plump is showing.\" She reached down and squeezed Mouse's sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse jumped, but she did not look angry because she did like Chris and Chris knew this, and always exploited the fact that Mouse probably saw her as a 2nd big sister figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was feeling chirpy and playful since morning, and secretly has been musing about who he could target today for some time now. Ever since she saw Mouse's outfit earlier, she's been thinking about how she could get her out of those sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowshe felt like she couldn't bear it anymore. Besides, what were they gonna do? She was their senior.<br>\r\nAnd Mouse was so cute, nobody could contain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped Mouse unceremonously, and both girls landed on the ground, laughing.<br>\r\nChris reached down and started to ubuckle her sandals.<br>\r\nMouse knew what was coming, but being the tiniest and youngest she knew she would be powerless to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sat on her legs and started raking the five fingers on each hand on those bare soles.<br>\r\n\"Aw maaaan\" Mouse wailed, though she was clearly enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShy and hesitant but determined Jamie edged towards the floored Mouse when s/he saw that ticking action was happening. A slow and careful hand reached out and started squeezing Mouse's sides.<br>\r\nJamie moved slowly and always seemed to be pretending that s/he was not therewhile she worked but the slow, soft yet unshakable movement of his/her soft and slender fingers (much like Jamie him/herself) was murder to a person with a few certain sweet spots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mooon. Guys, please.\" Mouse giggled. She squirmed and trashed as she was filled with tickly feelings until her hair came undone and all of her body was covered in dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh, guys, seriously, you're doing this now?\" Summer said, turning around and walking back to her group. \"C'mon, we've got a mystery to solve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other threegot on their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what you guys did, now my shirt's all dirty.\" Mouse complained.</span></div></div>",

She had come up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, I have a proposal.\" she announced as soon as Mouse emerged from the back room. \"I think we all agree that we are still unprepared to fight a real bad guy head-on, so we should try working on our skills first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know - team building, learning practical skills, building up resistance...That kind of thing...\"<br>\r\nShe picked up the hairbrush from the nightstand.<br>\r\n\"Basically\" she said, turning around , \"We should tickle each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Mouse shouted. \"I don't see how that would help us, right Summer?\"<br>\r\nSummer though unexpectedly looked hesitant.<br>\r\n\"We-ell, the Clown Prince DOES seem to like to tie up and tickle us more than usual recently... <br>\r\nMaybe trying a few things out first could be useful.<br>\r\n\"Right! It'll be like a practice session, right Summer? I bet you could learn all sorts of things!\"<br>\r\nSummer nodded. \"Alright, I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, so here are the rules!\" Chris said, ignoring Mouse's cry. \"We'll have two rounds of one-on-one tickle fights, to find out who among us are the two weakest. Then we'll try to train them to do better. Um. By tickling them some more.\"<br>\r\n\"Er, why?\" Summer asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, if someone gets tickled a lot, their body grows used to it. Check it in your sleuthing books if you don't believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I agree to this\" Mouse yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you want to be seen as a grown up detective right? You know there are some things detectives must do, right?\"<br>\r\nMouse didn't say anything.<br>\r\nThe all put their names in the box, even Mouse, hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris reached and pulled out two of the four bits of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the first round is...Mouse VS Chris!\"<br>\r\nMouse's heart sank.<br>\r\n\"'C'mon, that's not fair!\" Mouse complained. \"You're like, twice as big as me and only half as ticklish.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you admit that you're not strong enough to come with us on adventures, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse gasped; she could not take step back without admitting that she was too young.<br>\r\n\"I...Dammit. Fine. Fine. Just...Try to give me an advantage or something.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright! Hmmm...Oh, I know! You'll get to wear your socks. That should provide you with some protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited until Mouse picked out some kitty stripe socks and put them on her feet, then reluctantly took her place opposite Chris on the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris charged ahead and she laughed as she took Mouse down without any difficulty. Mouse tried to reach out to tickle her sides, but her wrists were grabbed with ease by Chris and forced behind her back, then Chris forced Mouse to lie down on the ground and turned her around onto her stomach.<br>\r\n\"I knew it! Chris is a big fat cheater!\" Mouse shouted while the laughing Chris secured her legs, and she even had time to reach behind her back and give Mouse's sides a quick tickle, who couldn't move away at all.<br>\r\nShe then ran her fingers alongside her two legs.<br>\r\nMouse banged on the ground as her socks were peeled off effortlessly, being of no use at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse had cute plump little feet, with short toes and arches.<br>\r\nChris loved playing with them, while Mouse did not enjoy her situation at all.<br>\r\nShe licked her lips as she started with stroking her arches. <br>\r\n\"Does lil' Susie have ticklish little toes?\" Chris cooed. Mouse screamed-laughed as Chris spider-tickled along her soles and  then started to pinch and stroke around her toes one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little exhausted from the excitement, Chris turned and flipped Mouse around oton her back, and started squeezing her sides.<br>\r\n\"Well do you give up yet? Huh? Do you.\"she asked the shrieking Mouse into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse squirmed but tried to keep it in and contain her smile, and bring down her two arms to protect herself.<br>\r\nBut Chris cruelly grabbed them, and pulled both arms above her head, then started spider-tickling her underarms.<br>\r\nMouse flailed her head around, and took about 20 seconds before she realized that there was no point, there was no way she could win this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give a-ha-hap! Just let me go! LET ME GO!!\"<br>\r\nChris stood up letting the panting Mouse have a break, and wiped her forehead, satisified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, lil' Susie has lost. Tie her up, girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, that's why I told you I didn't want to do this!\" Mouse complained while the other two grabbed her and tied her down to Summer's big bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" Chris said. \"We only have two beds. Move her to her own room, instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse's and Summer's rooms were on the opposite sides of a long corridor, so if both doors were open, you could see what was happening in the other room. Mouse's stuff was swept aside from the sheets and she was tied on her own bed.<br>\r\nShe was stretched out, her tiny feet hanging over the end and flapping about and her two arms hanging above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the next round is Summer vs Jamie.\" Chris announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer and Jamie circled around on the mat for a while, then suddenly Summer pounced and grabbed Jamie by the waist, and they both fell on the ground...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although Summer had a reputation of being the most resourceful and wilful of the group (hence her status as impromptu leader) these characteristics would count for little if somebody so much as dragged a lone finger across her bare sole. Her incredibly ticklish feet were her greatest weakness and she knew she'd have to keep Jaime from getting at them if she was to win this. The thought of losing filled her with incredulity; how could her friends possibly see her as a leader if she was tickled into submission by a 'subordinate' and then reduced to a restrained, giggling mess alongside her little sister? As she took her place opposite Jaime on the mat, Summer resolved to strike quickly and to hopefully catch her opponent off guard. After all, she thought reassuringly, Jaime was known to be the most reserved of the team and was therefore more likely to hesitate at a crucial moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your marks\" recited Chris. \"Get set. Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer and Jaime circled each other ponderously for a time, each probing the other's movements and poised for a counterattack. Then, without warning, Summer pounced, grabbing Jaime around the waist and sending both girls tumbling to the ground. They grappled and rolled around the mat, each girl giggling softly as they attempted to prod and pinch each other's sides. Eventually Summer came out on top, sitting on Jaime's upper legs to pin her body to the floor. Triumphantly, she reached down and began to squeeze Jaime's sides, causing her opponent to dissolve into a cascade of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Ready to give up?\" Summer asked sweetly as she slipped her hand beneath Jaime's shirt and continued to knead the girl's bare lower belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NeheheheheheheveheheherhahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" squealed Jaime as she tossed her head from side to side and struck at the ground fruitlessly with her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer began to dig into Jaime's lower ribcage with her nails, causing the latter to thrash around more energetically as her cheeks began to grow flushed with laughter. Chris and Mouse watched curiously from the other side of the room; Chris brightly pondering who her second victim would be and Mouse wondering who would be sharing in her torture, not that it made any difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaime, meanwhile, was beginning to lose it. She knew that she couldn't take much more and had to act immediately if she was to have any chance. She was so ticklish around the waist that she had temporarily forgotten that her arms were still free; Summer had neglected to secure them with her legs when she had gotten on top. An uncharacteristic oversight by the cunning and quick-thinking sleuth but Jaime was not about to question that now. She knew reaching up tickle Summer's own belly would expose her underarms and that would surely spell the end for Jaime. Focusing with all her might to momentarily forget about the barrage of tickling, she reached behind Summer and grabbed at the only area she could reach: Summer's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outcome was instantaneous. Summer jerked, let out a surprised shriek and reeled back as if she'd been given an electric shock. Even she hadn't been aware that her thighs were so sensitive. Frantically, Jaime tried to take full advantage, continuing to squeeze Summer's thigh until the elder Salt sister lost balance and was tipped onto her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally free from the tickling and from the weight of Summer's body, Jaime wasted little time. She twisted to disentangle herself from Summer's collapsed body. Summer herself darted a hand back towards Jaime's belly, hoping to regain the advantage but the other girl managed to get a hold of both Summer's wrists. Summer yanked free and managed to sneak a few pokes to Jaime's sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehehenotthihihihihistihihihihihime\" Jaime managed to articulate through a fresh stream of giggles as she skittered her own nails across Summer's navel, causing the latter to drop her hands and double over. As she did Jaime quickly managed to get behind her adversary and tackled her face-first to the ground. With that she clambered atop Summer and sat on her butt, facing her socked feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nohohohohoho.....!\" whimpered Summer as she realised her predicament, kicking her feet and already giggling in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" purred Jaime, reinvigorated, as she secured both of Summer's ankles in a headlock. She placed her index finger at the base of Summer's toes and slowly trailed it down the length of the foot to the heel, causing the girl to squirm wildly with barely-contained laughter. After repeating this a few times on each foot Jaime grabbed the top of Summer's pink sock and gently tugged at the soft fabric. Feeling her last line of defence gradually slipping away Summer tried desperately to kick her feet away but Jaime's grip was too tight. Pinned face down on the mat there was little Summer could do to shift Jaime. She couldn't even reach far enough behind to counter as Jaime had succeeded in doing previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, both socks were off, exposing Summer's smooth bare feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Salt, what was that you said the last time we were captured and the Clown Prince gave you that truth serum to reveal your most ticklish spot?\" asked Jaime casually, waving her fingers menacingly over the trapped feet. \"That you have the most ticklish feet in the world? Tickle tickle tickle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers made contact and began to scribble rapidly up and down Summer's ultra sensitive right foot. Summer valiantly held firm for all of 3 seconds before dissolving into a fit of hysteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOHOHOHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" she screamed as she attempted to buck Jaime off of her but it was no good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaime used her long nails to softly scratch along the length of Summer's arch, using all fingers in a clawing gesture while occasionally using just her index to tease her victim. It was taking all of Summer's resolve not to give in. As little as she could stand this she was still stubbornly proud and couldn't bear the thought of conceding defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Summer. Let's hear that laugh. Ticka-ticka-tickle. What about the toes?\" Jaime wiggled a finger beneath Summer's toes, which instinctively scrunched up protectively but effectively trapped the probing finger in the process, perpetuating the torture. Summer threw back her head, the muscles in her face strained with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHASTAHAHAHAHAPNOHOHOMOHOHOREHAHAHAHAHAPLEHEHEHEHE HEASEHAHAHAHA\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that surrender I hear?\" cooed a beaming Chris as Mouse looked on, stunned by her older sister's predicament. \"Did the great Summer Salt, junior detective, just say she's had enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEHEHEHEHEHESTAHAHAHAHAPEHEHEIGIHIHIHIVEHAHAHAHAHAHAPHAHAHAHAHA\" screamed Summer as Jaime slid a finger between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds Jaime finally relented and clambered to her feet. As she raised her fists in victory and hugged Chris in celebration Summer could only lay there panting as she contemplated her defeat, and her impending penalty, in disbelief. She was suddenly very much regretting having agreed to this stupid tournament.<br>\r\n\"And to Jaime go the spoils!\" exclaimed Chris, already happily contemplating getting her hands on the Salt sisters' bare soles. \"Well Summer, it looks like you've got a lot of work to do. But don't worry, your good friends are here to help you raise your endurance.\" Nervous irritation flashed across Summer's face at her friend's mocking tone but Chris hardly seemed to notice. \"Jaime, help me tie up our fearless leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two victors each grabbed one of Summer's arms and hoisted her to her feet. They led her back across the hall to her own room and proceeded to tie her as they had Mouse: arms restrained over her head with her bare feet suspended just off the edge of the bed. Summer's toes, decorated with sky blue nail polish, flexed and curled restlessly at the thought of what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\" said Chris, allowing her enthusiasm to show. \"We need to, uhh, 'train' as hard as we can to make sure these girls are in peak condition for our next adventure. But first we need to decide who will tickle who. Hmmm...\"</span></div></div>",

Why, I bet you\u2019re even more ticklish than your nuisance of a sister.\u201d, I say, admiring the slim, flawless young body on display.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe raises her left leg and attempts to kick at me, but I catch her foot in time, \u201cOh, I do like you, lil\u2019 Mousey!  You\u2019ve got fire like your sister.  It\u2019s going to be such sublime fun making you squirm and dance for me!, I laugh, then tighten a thick leather binding around her little knees, tying them tightly together.  \u201cYou are now utterly helpless and mine to tease to my heart\u2019s delight, but I can\u2019t have you attracting Summer and her pals, so\u2026\u201d, I pluck the now wet sock out of the little ten year old girl\u2019s lips only to replace it with a mouth-stretching round extension ring on a tight collar that forces her mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlah glah glah!\u201d, I laughed, mimicking her attempts to communicate, \u201cIs that little girl talk for \u2018Tickle me, Mr. Clownie?\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in front of her, I smiled as Mouse writhed and wiggled around in place, utterly helpless  to do more than look slightly down at me, seated and relaxed, enjoying her struggles and the anticipation of the soft touch of her tender,  trembling little body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse was breathing fast, and I watched as her ribs expanded and contracted, her little chest heaved, and her belly squirmed around.  She had almost instantly began dribbling over the cruel ring keeping her jaw wide open, and looked so adorable with those doe eyes watching my every gesture, and flinching if my fingers drew near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, Mousy, Your big sister and I have a bit of\u2026history, shall we say?\u201d, And I produced a pair of stiff duck feathers, white with bluish tings at the tips.  She went into hyperdrive spastically fighting to get her wrists free, but her restraints held, as did the belt around her knees.   I grinned, my face inches from her little chest, as I looked Mouse right in her bleary eyes and began ever-so-slowly tracing tiny strokes down her arms toward her  exposed underarms.  It drove her NUTS, and I smiled some more as a cascade of dribbling made its way down, darkening the fabric of her training bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilly little Mouse!  Where do you think you\u2019re going?  I wouldn\u2019t want anything but your undivided attention for my tale.  Don\u2019t you want to hear how I first met your loathsome brat of a sister?  How I know how terribly ticklish she is?\u201d <i>And how it happily appears to run in the family!</i> I think to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mouse continued to caterwaul unintelligibly due to the jaw-widening gag, I let first one and then the other feather trace down into her silky armpits.  Mouse\u2019s reflexive too-and-fro wrestling with the restraints is a joy to watch as she wriggles side-to-side, then sort of up-and-down-in-place, neither direction affording any option of freedom from her helpless situation.  I closed my eyes, in bliss at the genuinely ticklish screams of laughter that came from my gurgling, giggling toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Mousemousemouse\u2026the FUN you and I are going to have together!\u201d, I enthuse, my eyes again wide and enjoying the sight as I let the tickling tips of the feathers glance and glide down past her little pits, still slow and circular, but inevitable, \u201cIt\u2019s as if each new area on your cute young body is an adventure!\u201d.  Oh, she whine aplenty at her tender treatment, but I was in my element, almost forgetting all about the pesky Summer.  If Mouse, was here, Summer had to be around, also.  Yet, with this adorable, doll-sized little plaything to tease, my mind was completely distracted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI led the feathers slooowly back up across her underarms , then dooown again, as I said to the little captive, \u201cNow, where was I?

Or, I can tell you the story of the first time I met your nuisance of a big sister while I tickle you all over your adorable little body!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which I naturally punctuate with more of the feather tips gliding up and down her silky smooth arms and torso, sending her into further dribbling conniptions behind the mouth-widening rubber ring gag forcing her little mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, oh, oh\u00e2\u0080\u009d I tease, mocking her tone in a high voice while delighting in her renewed thrashing and gibbering at the maddeningly delicate feather torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She almost looks in tears and is frantic with reflexive laughing and jerking around, bobbing awkwardly in place as she is, and gurgling back, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!

She has effectively been rendered into a purely reflexive toy for me to tease now, unable to do more than respond to the constant barrage of sensations all over her soft little body, breathless and sweat-soaked from her helpless exertions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Mousey-wowsy is so tickle-wicklish!

Relax!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, I laugh, tickling her into histrionics with my fingers along her ribs and down to her hips and bellybutton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going anywhere for a while, and it really is important for me to feel that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an attentive audience while I relate this fascinating and may I say, deplorable story so that you might better under\u00e2\u0080\u00a6why, look at you!

She was able to rest her bottom against the crossbeam of the sawhorse, but was unable to gain any vantage point with her arms, as the clown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistants had tied her wrists together behind her neck (in much the same position as someone who has their hands clasped behind their head while at rest).  This caused her entire torse to be helplessly exposed, from her groin clear up to her underarms!  The rope line led down from her wrists and tightly wound between her slender hips, then up again, tied off around her waist so that every time she moved, she felt the tug of the line as it stretched between her legs, and wedged tightly up her bottom and up to her wrists again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Evil face inches from his fearful captive\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, the clown asks, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow then, Sandy, are you prepared to tell me how you alerted the insufferable Salt brat and her annoying pals, or shall I employ dastardly methods of coaxing the information out of you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He thrilled to the way her tummy flinched as she felt his hot breath on her face.

Why won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you believe me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what your pretty sisters tell me, Sandy\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he lied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say <b>you</b> are the one who I should talk to.  They said that you have <b>all</b> the answers!  Now then, are you going to be a good bunny, or a naughty bunny?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and with that, he began his fingertip onslaught, tickling the screaming girl all up and down her sides and through the sheer fabric of her leotard, causing her to  yank and thrash around, fighting the ropes to no avail.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sandy threw her head side-to-side fitfully, and her torso writhed and wriggled around.  She was screaming and laughing at the same time as the fiend went from his slight fingertip glances to more poking touches, sometimes wandering down to around her delicate thighs, hips and even lower to areas that caused her to flinch and strain at her bonds with an even greater urgency!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She tried to plead her case, of how she barely even knew Summer, though she was in a class with her little sister Mouse; but that they mostly only knew each other from school and birthday parties and sleep-overs.  Every time she even tried to get a sentence of the above information out, the cruel Clown would renew his grinning poking and stroking, already finding her hot spots and eagerly exploiting them so that all Sandy ended up doing was crying and laughing some more, still unable to guard her torso from his malicious tickling attacks, the rope line stretched taut between her legs causing her an unusual sort of consternation she was unaccustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!

Eek!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, was all the little tickle victim could muster now, as the clown grabbed a chair and sat right in front of his captive, enjoying every second of her duress.  The meanie seemed to thrive off of her histrionics, to almost feed off her exertions, and he was still gleefully grinning that horrible, toothy grin right at her while his fingers ran amok all over her sensitive body, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYesss, tell me bunny!  Tell me everything!  Every. Single. Little. Detail!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he smiled, while he insinuated his long fingers underneath the sleek bunny costume fabric, and proceeded to tickle and squeeze and then pinch her little bottom as she wriggled around in place in front of him, backed against the strut of the sawhorse, then hips thrust out towards her abuser as she reflexively wrestles around in her bonds, being tickled worse than she has ever experienced in her entire young life, with seemingly no respite in sight!  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

THIS IS ALL A HUGE MIS\u00e2\u0080\u009d, begs the evil mastermind, but it is too late, as he feels the spray of the plastic gag flower sending him right down into a dead faint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Waking up with a start, the Clown Prince opens his eyes to a worst-case-scenario!  He stands, tied-off in only his dirty old long-johns in a similar predicament (adjusted somewhat for his relative height) to the same sawhorse he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d bound the kidnapped Hasenpfeffer girl!  He feels one more tight tug on the line running from his wrists to between his legs in a most uncomforting fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, says Summer as she finishes the knot while demonstrating proper rope techniques to her junior sleuthing friends, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how you complete the barnacle knot.  See?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cW-What are you going to DO with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, asks the seemingly recalcitrant villain as he groans and strains with his difficult position.  He only then glances up to realize the kids have also replaced his fright wig with the bunny ears he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d made his prisoner Sandy wear, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, very FUNNY, Salt!  GOOD one!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, snarls the humiliated madman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Summer then stands in front of him, hands on her hips, surveying her handiwork.  Due to his much larger size and strength, she had added more restraints, as she also knew her enemy was a master contortionist, and capable of escaping from captivity.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that should hold you until the authorities arrive, evil clown!  I would have thought you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have learned your lesson by now.  As long as you are in this town, me and my friends, the Junior Sleuthers are going to keep an eye on you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Clown Prince is now blubbering and pleading, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!  Please!  I-I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you a cut of the ransoms!  Anything!  I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t survive in prison!  Do you know what they DO to clowns inside?  Please!!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry\u00e2\u0080\u009d, says Summer, looking smug as can be, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should have thought of the consequences before performing your dastardly deeds, creep!  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably be going away for a looong time this time, clown\u00e2\u0080\u009d,  and one of Summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends calls down, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSummer, come on!  We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be here when the authorities arrive.  Remember?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuh!  Of course I know that!  I'm the one who usually gets to say that at the end of one of our adventures, Chris.  Just putting the final touches on our own little going away present for this sicko pervert\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and with that, Summer hops up on the stool in front of the tightly restrained clown, and begins sprinkling some of his own secret ingredient itching powder down into his raggedy old long-johns.  As the madman begins screaming with laughter and thrashing around in his bonds, Summer next pours a can of his own patented Pants Ants down his britches, further adding to his consternation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The evil wacko is left simultaneously crying and laughing as the powder makes its way further down his body while he grinds around in place in his ungainly pose tied-off to the stock horse.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNONONO!  PLEASE DON\u00e2\u0080\u0099T LEAVE ME LIKE THIS!  AAAAAAAAHAHAHAHA!  IT'S MADDENING!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProud as she can be, Summer turns and leaves the clown there, in his agonizing state,  sweating and straining against the bonds, twitching around from the duel pain and pleasure sensations assaulting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A sycophant, Pao-Ting often gagged her when it got to much,  but Frieda would strip down to her bra and panties if asked by her, so she was also a tickle slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another loyalist was Irene Nashton, a computer whiz and expert hacker.

Then that <i>shetjan</i> and her friends interfered with my experimenting und saw to it that I could never do anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting eyed the claw wearily. \"Wait here please.\" She left, then returned with a rusty lead pipe. \"Use your claw on this please.\" Ilsa opened the princers and Pao-Ting placed the pipe in the middle. Ilsa squeezed hard and the pipe broke in half. Pao-Ting let out a brief whoop. \"Welcome aboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Third on the list was a Mexican bandit. \"You, I suppose, are El Bandito?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Si senorita</i>.\" The bandit pulled out a gun and said, \"Please make dollar into paper airplane.\" Pao-Ting obliged and launched the dollar airplane. El Bandito fired at it, and ten dimes came raining down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting swept up the dimes with a grin. \"You just guaranteed a spot <i>senor</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Muchas gracias, senorita.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, there was a woman with a long rapier. \"Anna McNabb?\" The woman nodded. \"What do you know how to do?\" Anna Drew her sword and slashed the air. Pao-Ting suddenly felt colder. Looking down to see that she was on nothing but her bra and underwear, she gasped and tried to cover her body. \"You're on, you're on. Just take-\" Anna held up a hand, looked around, then pounced. There was a shriek and Anna walked back, dragging \"Hannah Faris!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chubby brunette theatre student who was currently hanging from Anna's fist. Unfortunately, the green shirt was small enough so that when she was lifted off the ground by it, her midriff was exposed, hanging out over her blue jeans. \"Pa Pao T Ting,\" stammered Hannah, \"Wha wha what are y you doing here?\" Anna started to move her blade slowly towards the captive's trembling gut. Hannah squeaked and immediately sucked in her belly, trying futiliy to keep away from the stabbing object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting smirked, all embarrassment forgotten. \"Well Hannah, you just found yourself as a prisoner of the Legion of Evil!\" <i>Although capturing Summer Salt seems like a higher priority.

So unwilling she was to admit her helplessness, and yet reduced to a powerless little girl, lick-lick-lick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer grinned.<br>\r\nIf one tongue crushed her so thoroughly, what is a dozen going to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe invited the other cats closer. The panting Pao-Ting was trying to catch her breath and bargain with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer...You don't understand...What this is going to do to me, it's too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sssh ssh. Maybe this'll help you understand why you should quit trying to challenge me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored how Pao-Ting screamed as the cats started to REALLY get her feet, and walked out of the room. Paying no attention to the frantic sounds behind her, Summer stepped out of the mansion and looked around. <br>\r\n\"But I wonder what happened to my nosy sister and my busybody friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA helicopter suddenly burst out from among the trees! and rose into the sky. Two long ropes were hanging from it. On the end of the first there were two people tied together, and the second ended in a smaller one in a hog-tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a loudspeaker she heard the Clown Prince's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have defeated me this time, Summer Salt, but we shall meet again! Until then, farewell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahanooo!\" \"Summerhaha save us!!!\" the trio screamed as the helicopter disappeared over the hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the wailing of Pao Ling from the floor above, Summer stood tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clown Prince, you might tickle my friends until their skin falls off today, but justice WILL prevail in the end! I'll catch you by my own hands no matter what even if I have to chase you naked to the end of the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so ends another exciting adventure of SUMMER SALT! - with a sense of victory for some, days of excrutiating tickle-torture to come for others. But what will the future hold for our heroes?Can little Mouse stand stand days of tickle-tease and not squeal? What will Chris and Jamie do to cope with their torture? What new torments at Summer's hand still await Pao-Ting? Will the Clown Prince ever find true love?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoin us again next time for another amazing adventure of SUMMER SALT!</span></div></div>",

No...no... it's cliche but it might work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse is skipping through the woods, exploring the backyard of the mansion. Summer had given her somewhat pudgy sister (there <i>was</i> a little chub on her belly, but not enough to make her fat) permission to go on her own, but only for a limited amount of time and meeting her at a certain spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Mouse is just heading to the rendezvous point when Pao-Ting appears. \"Hello,\" she greets her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister says I'm not suppose to talk to strangers,\" Mouse says immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very wise of your sister,\" retorts Pao-Ting, \"but this won't take long. I just want you to do a little thing for me. All you have to do,\" she pulls out a Nintendo Switch, \"is beat the boss I select in this game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok!\" Mouse is much more enthusiastic about it. Needless to say the boss, General Cryptor, had wiped the floor with her before she beat him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" says Pao-Ting, producing a tank top, \"you can't win everything instantly. Now change into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think-\" Mouse starts, but Pao-Ting places a finger on her nose. \"Change or I yank your shorts down.\" Mouse shrieks and obliges, only to find that the tank top doesn't cover the lowest part of her stomach. \"This is too short.\" Suddenly, she feels her arms pinned to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting grins evily. \"All the better for me to tickle your belly, my dear.\" The next thing Mouse knows, her hands are tied to a low hanging branch above her and bandana is wrapped through her mouth. She looks down to see that the too short tank top is raised to expose her ENTIRE midriff. \"Mmmm hmmm mmm hmm,\" she mumbles through her gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPao-Ting cackled, \"Now that I have the bait, my trap is complete! All that's left is to lure your sister here. I'll conceal myself in the hopes that she'll see you and come out to free you, she'll be captured with her shirt raised up for a tickling she'll never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr I can free your mouth and tickle you, the screams drawing her here to bargain her captivity for your freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr I just tickle you gagged and even if she doesn't show up, I'll still have a prisoner.\" She pulls out a feather and Mouse nervously sucks in her belly. \"So, what shall I do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But the Chinese woman seemed to understand. \"To keep you gagged and tickle you until your annoying sister finally finds you.\" She prodded with her index finger into the exposed side of the young girl, feeling the layer of fat under the skin. \"Ffffffeepfffft\" the kid squealed and tried to evade, turning on the spot. Pao-Ting put the feather into her back pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit touchy you are, but there is a cure for that.\" Using both index fingers she playfully dipped into the girl's skin, be it belly, sides or back while Mouse was turning on the spot ever faster while starting to dance. \"Hhwwwwwwwweeeep Gnnnnnnnnnohhhhhhhhhh. Thhhhhhhhhhehhhhhhhhhhhhhhe\". But she felt her arms being pulled up higher from the now shorter rope. This made her tank top being raised further until it was just about to expose her...\"Mmmmmmmmmhnn?\" she yelped in surprise when she felt her ankle grabbed by the evil Chinese woman. A loop was swiftly cast around it and within seconds she could not spin anymore due to her feet being tied to roots of the tree. \"Marvelous, better than I thought I could tie you here. A helpless belly, stretched and vulnerable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out her feather, wiggled it in front of Mouse's nose. \"Tickle Tickle Tickle\". The soft tip just touched the nostrils of the poor girl, causing her instantly to sneeze a few times. Then it slowly traced over the girl's ear, cheek, neck and  down her chest where it took a bee line for the bellybutton.<br>\r\n\"Tickle Tickle Tickle.\" Round and round the tip of the feather went, drawing circles around the sweet little spot. \"Kkkkkkkkkklllllllllllpffffftahhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhha\" Mouse squealed even higher, only being able to wiggle on the spot. Going in circles was bad, but Pao-Ting changed the pattern to a lazy 8-curve with the bellybutton in the center. When the feather touched the delicate flesh the first time Mouse emitted a pitiful \"Hhhhhwa\". This sound could be reproduced so a series of \"Hhhhhwa Gnnnnnnnn Hhhhhwa Gnnnnnnnn\" bubbled from under the girl's gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom time to time Pao-Ting looked around and listened to any suspicious movement in the shadows or behind the trees. Summer just must be around. When would she show herself and demand that Mouse was to be released?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sign of Summer - time for more belly tickling<br>\r\nSummer peeks - time to negotiate<span style=\"line-height:1.0;\"></span></span></div></div>",

Anyway, Jamie went into the kitchen where she felt something cover her mouth and a tiny pain on her throat. \"<b><i>Not a word</i></b>,\" hissed a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was studying a dinette set when he heard a sensual voice. \"<i>Chris</i>.\" He located the voice coming from the open door to the kitchen, where a bare leg was sticking out. He nervously tugged his shirt collar and headed over, calling, \"Jamie is that you?\" He got closer. \"If that's you, then please stop with the flirting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the leg stepped out and Jamie was revealed, her shirt turned into a crop top, a piece of tape across her mouth,  her hands forced behind her back, and a feather hovering over her exposed midriff that she struggled to keep sucked in away from the tip, all courtesy of \"Pao-Ting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese woman grinned. \"Hello hot stuff! Now, if you don't want your partner to suffer perpetual tickling, you will take off your shirt and stuff it in your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnn!\" protested Jamie.<br>\r\n\"Quiet you.\" Pao-Ting thrusted the feather closer, forcing Jamie to render her tummy borderline concave. Chris hastily obliged. Pao-Ting's eyes lit up. \"My my, you <i>are</i> hot stuff,\" she purred, then tossed him a roll of tape. \"Now secure it.\" Once the gag was in place, she added, \"Now remove your shorts and footwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm,\" Chris scowled, but after Pao-Ting wiggled the feather, he was soon gagged and in nothing but black underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking in his bare chest and stomach once more, she ordered, \"hands behind back and walk backwards to me.\" Feeling humiliated about the whole thing (and fearful that his armpits, belly, and feet were exposed), Chris placed his hands behind his back, turned around, and walked backwards slowly. When he stopped he could feel the sticky substance of tape binding his wrists and hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant!\" cheered Pao-Ting. She pulled her bound and gagged captive's to her. \"My plan is almost complete. I just need to decide what to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I take you two down to the basement for further tickling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I lock one of you in a cage suspended at the rooftop for Salt to notice?\" </span></div></div>",
