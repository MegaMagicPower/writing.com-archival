Is This shop new?\" Ian asked himself as he glanced up at a shop, reading it's sign. \"Jewels, Gems and Junk huh?\" Ian muttered, taking a second look. It was a pretty run down old place, the paint was peeling and the windows could use a good washing. Ian wondered if it was new, because he couldn't remember having seen this shop before, even though it was an eye-sore. He glanced down at his watch and shurgged. \"I've got time, might as well go inside and see what is has...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan entered the shop, a small bell ringing as he opened and closed the door. He gazed around the dimily let area. There was alot of strange items lining the shelves, and the air was thick with dust. Ian sneezed, and when he opened his eyes again, there was a crogity old man behind the counter.<br>\r\n\"Kekeke, Welcome! Welcome!\" The man cackeled, rubbing his bony hands together.<br>\r\n\"Uh...Thanks...\" Ian said, turning towards the door to leave. That old guy gave him the creeps.<br>\r\n\"Wait! Wait! Don't go!\" The old man called out, cackling again. \"You came to buy, yes? Special item I have for you!\"<br>\r\n\"Special...Item?\" Ian asked, gancing back over his sholder, one hand already on the door handel.<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! Kekeke...Come see, come see!\" The old man beckoned with a bony finger, snorting his nose.<br>\r\nIan sighed, this guy was creepy, but he was after all, just an old man, it's not like he could really hurt him. Ian walked over to the old man, who cackeled with glee.<br>\r\n\"A game? Yes? Like to play games!?\" He asked, drumming his fingers together.<br>\r\n\"Uh...Yeah, I guess...\"<br>\r\n\"Ah-ha! Just the game, I have for you! Very fun, Yes! Kekeke!\" The old man cackeled, quickly ducking down behind the counter. He remeraged a second later, holding a small DS card between his old, dry fingers.<br>\r\n\"You like? Yes?\" He asked, as Ian read the black title, 'Max Control'<br>\r\n\"Uh...Sure...\" Ian said, as the old man twirled the game in his fingers.<br>\r\n\"You buy? Yes? Very good price, only 5...only 5!\" He cackeled.<br>\r\n\"Uh...5 huh? Well...Alright...\" Ian said, quickly reaching into his pocket, pulling out his wallet and offering the man a five dollar bill.<br>\r\n\"No no! 5!\" The old man said stubbornly, as Ian looked a little confused.<br>\r\n\"This is 5...\" He treid to explain, but the old man shook his head, snorting again. <br>\r\n\"This is 1 boy! Four more!\" He snapped iratibly.<br>\r\n[i]\"Oh for the love of...\"[/i] Ian thought annoyed, but took out four ones and placed them on the table. The old man cackeled in delight at having 5 bills, and quickly reached out, grabbing Ian's wrist.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Ian yelped, as the old man presed the game firmly into his hand. Ian quickly jerked his hand away, and hurried towards the exit, officaly creeped out.<br>\r\n\"Have fun! Fun n'yes! No refunds!\" The old man cackeled as Ian flung open the door, and hurried away from the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy was a nut...\" Ian muttered after he had sped away, walking down the sidewalk towards the park. He shuddered, remembering the cold, clammy feeling the old man's fingers hand when he grabbed his wrists. He opened his hand and blinked, he had nearly forgotten about the new game he had bought.<br>\r\n\"Oh...Yeah...\" Ian muttered again, looking at the DS card. It had a simple label, a white background with the words 'Max Control' on the front in black.<br>\r\n\"Huh...I don't even know what this game is...\" Ian muttered, shurgging his sholders as he continued walking.</span></div></div>",

He quickly popped the current catriage out and slid in the Max Control. He flicked it on, and started up the game. He blinked as he saw two buttons appear on the lower screen.

An array of seemingly somewhat list random options appeared on the bottom screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess this is the character creator?\" Ian asked himself, looking at the options. There were odd options for a creator, like second name, ghost or control. Rest he assumed was strange naming for the normal options. Oddly enough, there wasn't a continue button to go into what he would assume would be the main game. Of course, this was already the main game, but that's not something he would know yet. Looking back at the top screen, he saw the character character model of himself still sitting. \"I don't want to play as myself really, let's change this up a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan proceeded to use one of the options below to, at the moment, unwittingly change himself.</span></div></div>",

He put in the first name that came into his mind, that being of being of his girlfriend Samantha. Just like that, an image of her popped up on the top screen as well. \"Wow, does this game know what everyone look like? I thought it got me from the camera or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to test this out a bit, he entered in random names of people he knew without confirming yet. Each and every one popped up as he knew them without problem. \"This is pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter messing around with the names a bit, Ian ended with putting in his stuck up older sister's name in last. Seeing as she'll be as good of a start as any, with the possibility of messing up her virtual model, Ian accepted on her being the second name. This opened up the swap options, the option to apply effects together and that to switch between the two names. Still thinking its kind of odd but still curious at the same time, Ian decided to do what he was trying earlier. He clicked on one of the swap options at random, curious to see what they did.</span></div></div>",

He also noticed pink nail polish on his thumbs, and as he turned his hands, he realized it was on all of his fingernails. He looked down and saw a pair of D-Cup breasts encased in a lacy pink bra, under a pink tube top, and further down was a black skirt. He also saw his bare feet were slimmer, just like his hands, and had matching nail polish. He then looked over to the full-body mirror across the room and saw a reflection of Kayla. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d As he surveyed his new body, he noticed the DS sitting next to where he was sitting on the bed. \u201cDid that weird game do this? What kind of crazy game can swap people\u2019s bodies?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to survey his body more, until a perverted smile came to his face as an idea formed in his mind.</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s nothing stopping her from \u2018changing her mind\u2019 before giving her virginity to Mark, and I\u2019ve always wondered what sex was like for a girl, so why don\u2019t I stay as her to make sure she loses her virginity.\u201d Ian reasoned, before examining himself in the mirror. She smirked as he traced a finger around his new, flat crotch. \u201cI\u2019ll be doing her a favor. It\u2019s better she lose her virginity now, so she\u2019ll be ready later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days passed. Ian had snuck into his former room to steal back the DS when his former body wasn\u2019t looking, and used the mental commands to make sure his former body didn\u2019t come looking for the DS. Now, he was waiting in Kayla\u2019s room, watching anime. Something Kayla never did. He was laying on her bed, wearing a similar outfit to what he was wearing when he first swapped into her body, but this time, he was wearing a red tube top, and the miniskirt was even shorter. He decided to wear a thong too, and a strapless bra. He had her hair tied up in a ponytail. Her phone\u2019s text tone went off, alerting him to a text. Looking at it, he smirked as he saw it was from Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019m outside. Ready to go?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan quickly typed a reply. \u2018Omw\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan quickly put on some lipstick while looking in the mirror(he had put on the rest of Kayla\u2019s makeup earlier) and blew a quick kiss at his current reflection. \u201cTime to go.\u201d He grabbed Kayla\u2019s purse and phone, put her high heels on, and headed out the door. One of the first things he learned in Kayla\u2019s body, was that he had her muscle memory, which is why he could replicate her handwriting without even trying. It also let him walk in high heels as if he had done it for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, he was outside, walking towards the car of Kayla\u2019s boyfriend, Mark. Getting in the passenger seat, he absentmindedly kissed Mark, who kissed back. And before Ian even realized what he was doing, the two were making out passionately, with Mark groping Ian\u2019s breast. Ian finally regained control of himself, surprised at his own actions, and pulled away. \u201cWe should get going.\u201d He blushed slightly as Mark nodded and started driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the couple were at Mark\u2019s house. They went inside, and Mark immediately resumed their make out session, with Ian once again losing himself in the make out. They pair slowly made their way to Mark\u2019s room as they made out. \u201cI love you babe.\u201d Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too!\u201d Ian instinctually replied, and was surprised to find he meant it a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the couple were in Mark\u2019s room, and their clothes were quickly discarded. Ian briefly thought about how he should make Mark put a condom on, but he was so lost in the lust they were both feeling that it quickly slipped his mind. Mark was soon thrusting into Ian\u2019s vagina,and eventually cummed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple laid on Mark\u2019s bed for the rest of the night, Ian cuddled into Mark, both enjoying the afterglow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That was....incredible!\u2019 Ian awed at how sex had felt as a girl. He was now considering how he could keep feeling this amazing sensation. The most obvious method would be remaining as Kayla. However, he wasn\u2019t so sure he was ready to abandon being Ian forever. At the same time, he had grown to enjoy being Kayla, so maybe he would stay as her forever after all. Another method would be to return to being Ian, but use the DS to control Kayla so she would let him know whenever she and Mark were going to have sex, and switch into her body when they do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a third option though. Ian had used his time as Kayla to examine the capabilities of the DS, and had tested a few things out, but made sure to stay as Kayla as he did. He learned he could swap genders with someone, so he could return to being Ian, but swap genders with Kayla so he\u2019d be a girl. Then he could use the DS to get whatever boyfriend he wanted, maybe even Mark. It strangely turned him on to think about having sex with Mark as a female version of himself after having had sex with Mark as Kayla, not that Mark would remember it if Kayla is a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he contemplated his option, laying in the embrace of his current boyfriend, he decided...</span></div></div>",

He laid on the bed and just smiled as he thought about the amazing sex he had last night. It was both his first time having sex as a girl, and his first time having sex EVER, so in a way, Kayla and Ian had given their virginity to Mark together. Even though Ian\u2019s body is still a virgin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Ian pulled out the DS from where he had hidden it, and put his and Kayla\u2019s names into the boxes, before initiating the same swap that put him in Kayla\u2019s body.

I had...sex...with Mark last night.\u201d Her blush deepened.\u201di don\u2019t even know why I decided to go through with it. When he asked me if I would come over on the weekend, I was going to say no because it was obvious he wanted sex, but...then I changed my mind for some reason. And I...went through with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? How was it?\u201d Ian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla grinned. \u201cIt was amazing. I don\u2019t know why I chose to do it, but I don\u2019t know why I ever didn\u2019t want to either.\u201d She bit her lip as she thought about the sex, not realizing it wasn\u2019t even her at the time. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to do it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan input another thought into her mind with the DS. \u201cYou should let me know when you do. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yeah. I should always tell him when I have sex with Mark. I\u2019ll need the support from my brother.\u2019 Kayla thought, courtesy of the DS. \u201cI\u2019ll do that. But...what do you think? About me losing my virginity?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m surprised it took you this long. Most girls lose their virginity in their mid-teens, not late teens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot all girls.\u201d Kayla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but still. In any case, I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks bro.\u201d She hugged him. \u201cIt was nice talking to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was nice talking to you too.\u201d Ian said, as he walked out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks pass. Kayla kept to her word, and let Ian know every time she was going to have sex with Mark. He swapped into her body every time, and enjoyed having sex in her place. And every time, she would remember having sex, despite it always being Ian who did the deed in her body instead of her. He was enjoying life more than ever thanks to this little arrangement. And the siblings were closer than they ever were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, bro.\u201d Ian looked at his doorway to see Kayla standing there, looking uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?

He then felt something touching his arm. Looking down, he saw his slimmer arm, brushing against a D-Cup breast. It was being held by a strapless bra, within a red tube top. Looking further down, he saw a toned stomach, and a black miniskirt around his waist. He quickly touched his groin to find it was flat. He looked around his room to see it too, had changed. He still had his video games, but that was the only thing that didn\u2019t change. He also had a vanity with all sorts of makeup by his bed, and a wardrobe next to his closet. His bed was now more comfortable, with a softer mattress, and red hearts on the blanket. He got up and went to the vanity quickly. Looking at his reflection, he saw a beautiful girl his age staring back at him. She wore the outfit he saw himself wearing a moment ago, and her golden blonde hair was in a ponytail that reached down to chin level. She was also wearing small diamond earrings. He touched his ear with one of his hands and felt the earring. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan chose to explore his changed room. He eventually found a diary hidden under his bed. After looking through it, he learned about some major changes to his life. As a girl, Ian, or Eve, had become a gamer girl, who started a YouTube channel at the suggestion of her boyfriend, Luke. After getting into YouTube, she became an internet star, and Luke, who also has a YouTube channel(they even did some collabs sometimes) had bought her the diamond earrings Ian was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter learning about all the changes made to his life with a simple gender swap, he was understandably in shock. He wondered why being a girl would change so much, but he guessed it was because, as a girl, he had attracted a classmate who had a YouTube channel, and that one change lead to all the others. He realized that since he had used the DS to swap genders with Kayla, she must be a guy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought about how his life had become much better by becoming a girl, he...</span></div></div>",

It was still early in the morning, so there was a lot of action on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan looked to the side and saw a mostly empty set of cubicles for an office building. Flying through the window (so cool!) he looked around the floor. There were all of two people in the entire, very large room, and they were conveniently seated at opposite sides of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one closest to him was a woman in maybe her early thirties, brown hair tied in a bun, wearing 'no-makeup' makeup, and dressed in an uncomfortable looking skirt suit, black tights and black wedges. She sat at her desk, and was browsing what looked like Instagram on her phone. Clearly waiting for office hours to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would do fine for a test, Ian thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how would this work...\" Ian wondered, floating closer to his target. The instructions hadn't been super clear on how possessing worked, exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to just go for it, Ian sunk himself right over the woman's body. As he overlapped her, a tingling sensation confirmed something was happening. Ian's legs went in first, and when they sat right over where hers were, Ian felt himself gain control. His torso soon followed, then his arms, then finally his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his head phased in he felt his vision flicker briefly as he took control of the woman's eyes. He was done, and seemingly in total control of the woman's body. He moved his arms as he got used to the physical sensations of having limbs again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his hands, the woman's phone staticked out for a second, only to have her Instagram temporarily replaced by the Max Control interface. Had his DS just possessed her phone? That was pretty sweet. And speaking of sweet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan put the phone down and brought his slender, neatly manicured hands to his chest. The woman had a sizable bust, contained by a shirt and blazer. Ian's borrowed hands swiftly grabbed a handful of them, taking advantage of no one being around. He would have gone to his new lower half as well, but the skirt was tight and prohibitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he had time, Ian could run to the bathroom... or he could find someone else to test his newfound powers on.</span></div></div>",

A bright flash, and the look of the mailman switches to one of sheer bewilderment at the change in her appearance.

You switch back to the mailman, feeling guilty for cheating your way through the game. Mrs. Yossarian shakes her head and focuses on the mailman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Mister Yossarian isn't in right now.\" She intones meaningfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You don't hesitate to command the mailman to lean into her, lips pouted. She eagerly accepts the kiss, pulling him inside the house. You watched as she dragged him directly towards the bedroom, closing and locking the door behind her. \"I don't want my daughter to see us.\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was... actually fine by you. Somehow the idea of someone else fucking your 17 year old girlfriend...troubled you. Sex was sex, and Mrs Yossarian looked attractive enough. A little on the old side, though. But that was easily rectified. You command the mailman to continue this because it had been his secret fantasy ever since they met. Then you re-select Sam's mom, turn down her age to 30 and watch as the scene turns into a hardcore porn movie. About fifteen minutes later, you're done masturbating and stare at the screen a little bemused. They're still at it on full blast, with no signs of tiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to check back on Samantha, and see that she is now walking down the street. In fact, she looks like she's about to go to your house.   <br>\r\nHe watched her figure moving to press the doorbell. His doorbell rang. Ian just stared at the screen, a creepy realization suddenly crawling over him. He grabbed his phone and called her. His vision blurred as Samantha's phone on screen started ringing. He watched delirious as the character on screen answered her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ian. I mean baby.\" She quickly corrected herself. \"You at home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost dropped the phone as the words synced up to the log-messages on screen.

Yeah I'm at home\" You say, suppressing a shiver in your voice. \"What's up with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I was just doing a restyling, baby.\" She said, a little more breathy than usual. On screen, Samantha was doing a few sexy poses. \"So I thought, why don't I give my baby Ian a visit, show him a thing or two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right down.\" You say, before storming downstairs to let her in.</span></div></div>",

She rides you, in the cowgirl position, eyes rolling back in her head as she fills herself up with your cock. After that, you get to fuck her doggy style, listening to her moan as you thrust into her from behind. The only weird part is near the beginning, when she seems annoyed by your insistence you wear a condom. She\u2019s always been the one to bring up contraception before, but now it\u2019s almost like she needs you bareback.

If only this body could be a tad more receptive...\"<br>\r\nAs the train set into motion, she lingered on the thought, until some pervert went up to cop a feel of her chest. She was more surprised than anything, as the pervert's seemed awfully small, and only pushed on her chest. Than he squeezed. Samantha jumped in the air and wheeled around, only to find an old lady minding her own business. Another squeeze. She wheeled again, to find no one. Finally she looked down, only to discover that the pervert was herself. Her arms were currently fondling her breasts like they were heaven on Earth. The rest of her body was less than amused. She tried to pull her off herself, but her rebellious limbs just continued to grope harder and harder. Suddenly, they went limp, and Sammy quickly pulled them down, shielding her gaze from the interested onlookers. <br>\r\n*****************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn\" said Ian. He still thought that it was a game, although a complex one, and thought the goal was to maker her horny. <br>\r\n\"She is still not aroused. Damnit Ian, groping doesn't make a girl aroused.

It was a quiet place, way too big for a community such as this one.  The property developers didn't seem to mind, though. Neither did the few kids like Ian who treated this as their own indoor lounging space, with lots of nooks and crannies for private conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ian! Over here!\" Samantha waved from the edge of a derelict water-fountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurried over to his goth girlfriend.  She was wearing a pair of baggy black trousers,  black jacket and jewelry to match. Make-up was simple, in that she had only used some purple lipstick and (he suspected) a minimum of foundation to cover up blemishes. He sat down next to her on the stone rim, pecking her on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Here. Got you something.\" She fished out a tiny box, wrapped in shiny purple foil, a green sparkly ribbon to top it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gee, thanks.\" Ian said, hugging her tightly before unpacking it. \"What's the occasion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's our one month anniversary, silly!\" Sam blurted, then chuckled at his expression. \"It's ok, silly. Here. Just unpack it.\" She urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan unwrapped the box, feeling a little bit guilty at not getting her anything. Well, the day was still young. Maybe he could get her something nice at the goth-shop later. He opened it, revealing a leather wristband with stainless steel joints. Putting it on, he admired his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's perfect.\" He said with appreciation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I got it at the flash-shop over there.\" She said, pointing to a shabby looking outlet on the second floor. \"Wanna check it out? They've got some really freaky stuff in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment. Sounded like fun. Still, there were other options. For one, he was getting a little thirsty.

Lead on, panda-bear.\" You say, getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, blushing slightly at the nickname, gets up and grabs your hand. She leads you up a broken down escalator, past even more abandoned shopping-windows. The two of you enter the store, and are greeted by a friendly sales-woman in her twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey. Back so soon?\" The clerk states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi Abbey. I just had to bring along my boyfriend\" Sam says, grabbing Ian by the shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Welcome to Her Today.\" The clerk known as Abby nods to Ian. \" Let me know if I can help with anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thank you. We'll just be browsing.\" He mutters and is pushed ahead to the back of the store, where a couple of clothing racks and make-shift changing booths are setup. She sits him down on a bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait here. I want to show you something.\" She says, before disappearing between the racks of clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan sighs. Tricked by his girlfriend into going clothes shopping. Like he needed any more confirmation that he had been deceived into girl-shopping, the store was filled with mainly fashion and beauty products. Nothing really to strike his interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saleswoman gave him a glance from across the store and chuckled. Ian scraped his throat. Abbey was looking hot, with a tight pair of jeans covering a well rounded ass, her D-cup breasts contained by a simple but elegant white shirt. She turned to him again, and  he quickly looked away as she noticed him staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed without anything happening. He was getting kinda bored. Then he remembered the game. Fishing it out, he put the game in his DS and started it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Enter a name</i>, it stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan decided to put in<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He jumped in shock as he saw two C-cup breasts on his chest, encased in a pink bra under a sky blue tube top. \u201cWhat the hell?!

Cool, it switched the letters of Ian around to make it a girl name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s your name now?\u201d Ian, now Nia, asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill Sam.

Her new body's hormones were getting to her, and combined with the power to control her own body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a flurry of transformations, she stared in awe at her old body. Tall and thin - still goth in style, but a lot sexier. Knee high boots and a black leather miniskirt, a black and white striped crop top that stopped only a bit below her generously augmented D-cup boobs. Her hair was now long and sleek - still black, but with purple highlights. Her face remained largely unchanged - better skin, less pimples, but otherwise the same. Still wanted it to be her, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly transformed Sam looked at her boyfriend with a sexy glint in her eye and smiled. Sam-in-Ian felt a brand new sensation in her pants as her new body reacted to the sight of her old, upgraded body. She returned the smile and looked at the DS again. </span></div></div>",

Life was a little simpler back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can I have the DS?\" He tried his cutest pleading face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure sweetey, here's your toy. Oop, wait. One more thing. This should make blending into our new lives a little easier.\" She tapped away at the DS, after which Ian felt a tingle running up his spine. It reached his head, bouncing around inside her brain until it faded. \"There. That's some basic memories and mannerisms to help you navigate us through this new life. Now.\" She scraped her throat. \"Where to, pumpkin?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam handed her daughter the gadget, which the little girl took greedily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go home, mom.\" She said, this time sounding a lot more sincere. \"Katie will be back from riding school in an hour, and we usually drink tea and talk after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan scratched her head. It was weird, having all these new memories. She still remembered being Ian like she was herself. Her own body, plus this weird dangly bit down there. Despite the high value he had given it as a boy, she was feeling quite comfortable with the lack of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Katie goes to a riding school? Like an equestrian facility?\" Sam asked while they walked back to the car, hand in hand. Ian just shrugged, not sure what she was talking about. \"Ooh. You're just too cute.\" Sam patted the girl on the head once more, laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we could go home... or you could go shopping with your mom! And because I'm such a good mother, I'm going to let you choose. What do you want to do, pumpkin?\" </span></div></div>",

Realizing this Ian hurries towards his school. while going there, he puts the DS card into his pocket. Right after that, because he wasn't paying attention, he runs into a complete stranger, knocking him on the floor. \"<i>Hey watch it! You're gonna get it punk.</i>\", the guy says. Ian apologizes: \"<i>I'm sorry.</i>\" and quickly continues to school. Once almost there at the last crossing, Ian feels the sweat rise. The road is full of traffic, rushing back and forth. He feels the wind on his face blowing past him, as cars drive by at extreme velocity. His mind got distracted on the game he bought, a strange DS game. The card reminds him of another game, which is about these kind of situation. A game called \"Frogger\". In that old game, you have to help a frog cross the highway. Ian feels kinda like that frog now, but luckily there is a crossing here with a traffic light. Ian approaches it quickly and presses the button. He can only think \"<i>Turn green turn green, please. Darn lights... green.</i>\". After a minute or two, the lights turn green for him and thus red for the traffic. Instead of what the light sign says... \"Walk\"... Ian runs to the other side and head to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got there, he quickly heads inside and rushes towards the his locker. Not noticing who, he almost bumped two students onto the floor. At his locker, he opens it and takes his bag out of it. He checks if the right stuff and books are inside and... notices he forgot to bring his DS back home yesterday. Not trying to get distracted Ian continues. He closes his locker after and heads to the first class room for today. Once he got there he notices the door is shut and it's all silent in there. Through a window he could see that he is the last one of his class to arrive. All his classmates are already there. Ian knocks three times on the door and heads inside. Then, the fist thing he says is: \"<i>I'm sorry I'm late... Miss... huh?</i>\". Fortunately, the teacher isn't there yet. That means for him, he won't get into to much trouble, but still. Wondering where he or she is Ian asks: \"<i>Where's the teach?</i>\". The class stares at him and he realizes he attracts a lot of attention right now. Slowly Ian closes the door and walks to his sit. When there, he puts the bag on the floor and sits down. Right then, a classmate who sits next to him explains: \"<i>The Teacher has not yet arrived here. Don't worry.</i>\". Ian feels relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his breathing getting slowly more and more calm,some place at his pocket starts to itch on his body. Trying to scratch there Ian realizes it's the DS card and takes it out of his pocket. He looks at it carefully, seeing only its name. \"<i>\"Max Control\", What kind of a game is that?</i>\", he wonders as he stares and sees the card is pure white, except for the title. Then he recalls, he has his DS with him. Ian searches his bag and finds his DS. A game is already inside of it, so first he takes it out. Ian doesn't pay much attention it that games title while putting it away into his bag. After that, he replaces the empty slot with his white DS card... the one he bought. He turns his DS on. A short sound comes out of the device and \"Nintendo DS\" appears in the top screen. In the bottom screen it says something about a warning, which Ian doesn't pay much attention on. He grabs his stylus and touches the bottom screen. A game selection screen shows up at the bottom screen, giving him the choices \"Max Control\", \"Picto Chat\", \"DS download play\", \"GBA Game\". Some icons are placed in the bottom of the screen. The top screen displays a huge clock, giving you the correct time. Ian knows what to do next, so he touches Max Control, noticing the weird M mark in a circle as icon. The game starts up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first message displayed is \"This game is not licensed by Nintendo\" on both screens. Then a commercial of the makes shows up... of which you have never heard before. A second later the top screen says \"Max Control\u2122, for Nintendo DS\u2122\u00ae \u00a9Copyright\u00ae2009\". On the bottom screen, it says \"Touch to begin\". Seeing that, Ian wonders... \"<i>Shouldn't it say, touch to start or something. Whatever.</i>\". He touches the bottom screen. The top screen turns white and a blank box appears. The bottom screen turns white too and two options appear. \"Enter a name\" and \"Search a person\". Ian wonders what this is about. \"<i>Shouldn't it say something like \"New Game\" or \"Load Game\". And if it's entering a name, shouldn't it be... \"Enter your name\" instead?</i>\". Ian really starts to wonder what game this is. Looking at the second option, he thinks this might just be some kind of chat tool instead of a game or something. He compares both options and wonder why they are given, then he came to the conclusion that it isn't his name he must give. Because else it wouldn't say \"Search a person\" as second option. Ian taps Enter a name. A box and a virtual key board appears at the bottom screen. Another button saying \"back\" is also there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the teacher isn't here yet, Ian has nothing else to do at the moment. He wonders what name he must use to put in, but at the same time he thinks... \"<i>The teacher might arrive any moment. I haven't got much time.</i>\". What should he do?</span></div></div>",

Ian typed, and sure enough a small caricature of his classmate showed up on the screen. He moved the stylus around, seeing that the app had her in full school uniform - collared shirt, knee - length skirt, tall socks and black flats.

It showed him just as it had Lily. It also showed a small loading box... 'Primary user detected. Switching order'. Ian watched as his sprite slid over and pushed Lily's down to the second screen.

Some of the older menus also disappeared, leaving 'Copy', 'Paste', and 'Edit'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....\" Ian thought to himself. With no teacher around, he still had at least some time to play around with this. \"Let's try...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan tapped on Lily's chest, and saw her boobs light up on the screen. The DS automatically zoomed in, giving him a rather close view of her chest, wrapped up in that school uniform. Tapping now on edit, a dropdown of more options appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove? Sure!\" Ian sniggered, tapping the button, and watched the shirt on the model of Lily disappear. Left behind was a plain white bra which covered her modest boobs. By chance, Ian looked up and nearly dropped his DS. In front of him, the real Lily was also missing her shirt, wearing only a bra! And she continued to sit as if nothing happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this for real?\" Ian asked himself, before feverishly tapping at the screen some more. Shortly after, Lily's boobs swelled from their previous modest size to gigantic DDs. Her bra matched them, and no one in the class seemed to notice anything - not Lily, whose own chest had just effectively tripled in size, nor any of the guys who periodically glanced in her direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means...\" After a few more presses, Lily had long, toned legs, and her uniform had been reduced to thigh-high stockings, a ruffled miniskirt and a bra. She seemed none the wiser, despite being significantly taller, more well endowed and very provocatively dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder if I can do myself too?\" Ian wondered, before testing it out. Naturally, the first thing he did was give himself a massive cock. Feeling the change in his own pants, he wondered. \"Well I felt it.. why doesn't anyone else? Could it be the DS?\" Deciding not to let a good thing go to waste, he further transformed himself, becoming taller and more buff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now, though?</span></div></div>",

It didn't stop him selecting things though, he noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ought to be funny\" he thought, before finally tapping himself on the chest, and hitting \"Paste\". A sudden shift in his body weight indicated that something had indeed happened. \"Holy shit!\" Ian swore under his breath, feeling the weight of DDs on his chest. A stolen look down revealed that while he did still have his own shirt on, Lily's enormous boobs had indeed been copied over to him. He grabbed a feel of them, noticing how soft they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...\" he moaned, before searching for an undo button. Eventually he found one, and reverted himself back to his fit, enhanced and male chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can mix and match...\" he realized. \"And change what I want...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the possibilities made his head swim. He could turn himself into a copy of anyone in this room... or turn anyone into anyone, really. But he had already transformed himself... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should mess with Lily some more, since she's already here loaded up.' He looked around. A few seats away, behind him, sat Kylie Senn. Kylie was a brunette bombshell, super hot, super thin, and with an impressively large rack. She definitely knew how hot she was, and wasn't shy about using her body to get what she wanted from anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what we can do with Kylie...\" Ian thought, before tapping away at the DS.</span></div></div>",

Kylie's model showed up, and he hit the OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis world flashed momentarily, and he found himself no longer sitting directly behind Lily. \"What the...\" he mumbled, before realizing he was no longer holding the DS. Instead, he was holding a phone. And the hand holding the phone was soft and thin... \"Oh fuck\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan looked down to be greeted by Kylie's boobs, in her school uniform. The top button was undone, and Ian could see down his top. A hand ran down his torso, where he no longer felt the toned abs he had crafted for himself. Instead, it was soft and smooth. A slight further dip found a skirt and a definitive lack of the cock he had set himself up with. \"Fuck, how did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone beeped, and he saw the 'Max Control' logo flash on it, before showing a model of Kylie, with an icon with his face on it next to her head. \"No fucking shit it's Kylie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this...\" said Ian, and stood up. Kylie's long legs under him, he stepped over to the door of the room. No one said a word - Kylie wasn't exactly known for being a model student, and would wander off randomly anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan's chest bounced, the weight unfamiliar to him. He closed the classroom door behind him, and looked down. Brunette hair played at the edge of his vision, and he could feel the soft caress of the hallway airconditioning on his now bare legs.

Kylie sure was a hottie, and she was staring back at him in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\" Ian said, before cupping the boobs on his chest. \"Mmmmm\" he moaned - they felt nice, plus he had never dreamed he would be fondling Kylie like this. Or at all. Seconds later he threw her top off to the side, and began working on removing her black lace bra. He kept staring at his reflection, Kylie's beautiful face and body there as if taunting him. The bra unhooked, and joined her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" Ian mumbled as he stared at the topless, braless Kylie in the mirror. His hands caressed his borrowed nipples, tingling at the touch. \"This is unreal...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis slack-jawed stare was broken by an unfamiliar sensation from under Kylie's skirt. Was he getting wet? This was so weird and so cool... Ian clumsily fumbled the skirt, slipping it down his sexy legs. Kylie's panties matched her bra - and were soon removed in much the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fucking god this is amazing\" Ian breathed, now staring at a completely naked Kylie in the mirror. He admired her curves with such detail that he never had before - since was never in a position to stare at her like this.

Ms. Caliber was known for not liking her students using phones - or handheld games - in her class, and would confiscate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe DS closed, and Ian felt a lurching sensation, pulling him harder than anything he had felt. His eyes refocused and he found himself sitting a bit closer to the front than he remembered. Lily was also no longer in front of him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and was greeted by two small protrusions on his chest, as well as a plaid skirt and a mobile phone. Had he become Lily? He quickly touched the phone, only for it to light up with the 'Max Control' logo, and showed him and Lily on two halves of the screen. Next to Lily was a small icon with his head floating there. Nothing like that was around his sprite... had he copied himself into Lily's body somehow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Fields, you know the rules...\" Ian was pulled out of his musings by the voice of the teacher. He looked up to see Ms. Caliber standing there with her hand out. \"Phone, please. You can pick it up from my desk after class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan reluctantly handed over the phone, and saw as the app interface disappeared from sight. Yet he was confident he could fix it... somehow. He just needed the phone back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Caliber dropped the phone on her desk, and stood up to teach. Today's topic was... integration? Ian watched, getting more bored by the second, as Ms. Caliber drew equations on the board, and explained each symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan's attention soon wavered and moved to his current state. Rather, the fact that he was stuck in the body of his classmate Lily for at least the duration of this lesson. Lily was nice, moderately attractive - not super hot, but not ugly either - and mostly kept to herself. At least that reputation meant that Ian wasn't in for any nasty surprises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying his hardest to stay focused on anything but the fact that he was in another person's body - which was totally cool, but weird as well, he of course managed to only keep thinking about it. Ian fidgeted, trying to keep his hands on the desk. Of course, his elbows somehow kept finding the not-usually-there mounds of firm flesh on his chest. His thighs also rubbed together constantly, drawing attention to the lack of usual parts between his legs. It was strange. Really strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Ian was barely aware of what was going on in class, and much more aware of how different Lily's body felt to his own. And how knowing that made him... nervous? Excited? Something like that. There was definitely a foreign tickling sensation in his ... skirt, Ian thought with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock on the wall, Ian realized there was a whole twenty minutes of this torture left.</span></div></div>",

Ian was not really affected by the first two qualities, as he was an impertinent student who did things like play his DS in class. He was trying to reform himself, but a schism had already come across the two, so Ian thought of Ms. Caliber as a unjustifiably cold and serious teacher. He could not help but appreciate her body, though. With a firm D cup chest, a bounteous behind, and the perfect curves along were figure, completed by her red hair and normally sweet face, she was frequently the subject of Ian's fantasies. It was a shame that she was very conservative in her attire, today donning a tactful blouse and long skirt.<br>\r\nAs she began to teach the class about the importance of integration in mathematics, Ian's bored mind quickly returned to the DS. Excusing his previous commitment not to play it, he carefully pulled it out of his backpack, turned the volume down, and relaunched it, using the girl in front of him to shield from Ms. Caliber's eyes. He curiously went back to the Max Control option, and confirming that no one was watching, entered Ms. Caliber's name. He wondered what purpose the game had in requesting a person's name, but it couldn't be bad, could it?<br>\r\nSuddenly, the screen cuts into two parts. On the top, he could see a third perspective rendering of Ms. Caliber as she taught the class, mimicking her exact movements. On the bottom screen he could see a list of options, beginning with \"Second Name\" and ending with \"Total Control.\" Pressing the options would give him a description, so Ian quickly realized just how powerful his tool was. <br>\r\nAs a preemptive test, he went to partial control, selected to enter a command, and entered:<br>\r\n<i>Ms. Caliber will not be aware of me during this class period, other than knowing that I am current present. Any intrusions I make will be unnoticed be her.</i><br>\r\nIan then tried to get Ms. Caliber's attention by raising his hand, raising his DS, and flat-out yelling at her.

Strange looks from other class members reminded him that he was invisible only to the teacher, and gave him an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else to add...\" Ian pondered, silently this time.

Many potential guinea pigs sat in their chairs - some paying attention to the class, some just to the teacher... and some were ignoring everything altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan decided to enter in the name of one of the nerdier kids in the class, Matt Parker.

Ian was unsure about the purpose of the figure, so he absentmindedly clicked on her chest. An outline appeared around her blouse, and a set of options descended from the side concerning how to manipulate it. Ignoring those options, he simply tapped and pulled the blouse with his stylus, only to have half of the blouse pull itself off. Suddenly, the cartoon figure's face changed to shock as Ian heard someone shriek. He looked up, finding Ms. Caliber tucking her blouse back in and muttering apologies to the class; the girls were indifferent and the guys were less than offended. On the display, the face was now embarrassed, despite Ms. Caliber now displaying her cheerful face to the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It must be showing what she truly feels</i>\" Ian thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying closer attention to the options, Ian selected <u>Layer Down </u>, changing the cartoon drawing to one of Ms. Caliber in her underwear and socks. Even the simplistic figure aroused Ian, who quickly tapped on the bra. Selecting it, he then typed into the command box \"Unhook,\" turned up to look at the teacher, and when she was walking bending over to help a student,  he hit <u>Send</u>. Ms. Caliber's sizable chest now expanded considerably under her blouse, and she quickly pulled herself up, caught herself before she tried to readjust herself right there, and pardoned herself as she went to the restroom. Although appearing stoic in real life, the cartoon face displayed a thorough annoyance. While his classmates talked to each other about the teacher's recent oddity, Ian watched the 3D rendering of Ms. Caliber in the restroom, resetting her bra and blouse, and seeing the cartoon figure display the same. Out of curiosity, Ian pressed <u>Layer Down </u> again, and found the cartoon of Ms. Caliber change to nothing but her bush. He found, still, that he could select her individual body part, with many options attached to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan grinned devilishly. This was going to be an interesting day.</span></div></div>",

Somehow, she made it through the lesson with time to spare, and began. <br>\r\n\"Okay class, so here are your assignments for tomorrow.\" she said towards the end, handing out papers.<br>\r\nYou considered having her rip up the papers, but you knew damn well that you were not going to finish it either way. On the lower screen, you typed into the main command bar that \"<i>Ian Madison will receive an 100% on this assignment</i>\" and hit send. The command appeared to be accepted, as neither the teacher nor the game responded. <br>\r\nSnickering, you then selected her nipples and viewed the option. There was a bar labeled <u>Erectness</u> which you slid all the way to the top. Even padded by her bra and her blouse, her erect nipples were proudly visible. Ms. Caliber could little but ignore them as she continued to hand out papers, her persona displaying her extreme frustration at both the irritation and the ogling caused by her nipples. While trying to reselect her tits you accidentally hold and pull over on her left tit, causing it to launch itself to the side in real life, sending Ms. Caliber  and her papers wheeling into a boy in the front. She crashed right into him, a skinny, socially-inept nerd you knew as Carter, who was protected by her bounteous bosom. She profusely apologized and continued to hand out papers, while Carter just blushed and began working on the assignment. Before you had time for more shenanigans, the bell rang, and the students filtered out of the classroom. <br>\r\nYou walked up Ms. Caliber and nearly said a mean comment to her as you left, but she first looked at you and smiled, saying \"have a good day.. oh! and by the way, for not causing any trouble today, I will give this assignment a perfect grade for you.\"<br>\r\nYou then realized that since the class period had ended, your previous invisibility command was null and void. You would have to be more careful about such things from now on!<br>\r\nAs you closed the door, you could see Carter still packing his bag, him being the only person left in the room besides Ms. Caliber. Although you felt no particular remorse for him, you did feel that he intentionally excluded himself from others, which was kind of silly. <br>\r\nSeeing as how he blushed after the collision, it was obvious he was attracted to Ms. Caliber. Maybe you could set something up right now. But you were also dying to test this device on others. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Ian (Insert A Name) wanders into a pawn shop one day. As he's browsing around the shop, he notices there happens to be a white DS card, just lying on the counter, with the title ' Max Control '. He asks the owner how much, and gets it at a real bargain. However, once he turned on the game, he began to realize that it wasn't just limited to his two screens. It seems, if he wanted, he could make anyone...and everyone, play along. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSo basically, it\u2019s a DS game that allows you to control things around you. But, like all games, there\u2019s a limit to what it can do. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe game starts out with a blank box in the upper screen, and the options below in the bottom screen, either 'Enter a name' or 'Search for a person' If you know the name you want, you just type it in, but if you're unsure, you can hit the 'Search' button. Then two more options will appear, 'Search Local' and 'Search International' Search Local will scan the area 100 feet around the DS, and bring up a list of names of all the people in that area. Search International will bring up a list of names of everyone in the world, for you to choose from. Each time you select a name, a full body picture appears on the top screen, asking for your confirmation, so that you know it's the right person/get a glimpse of who you'll be playing with. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAfter selecting 'OK' you will be given a list of options on the bottom screen. Here are the options: <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSecond Name: You can type in a second name, used for things below. Works more or less the same as the First name you type in, only you can choose to apply the effects together, or switch in between the names <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTransform: A virtual image of the person will appear on the bottom screen. Using the stylus, or by just going to the side scroll bar, you can select different parts of the body and modify or transform them. You can also use the 'Second Name' option to transform the first name you chose into an exact duplicate of the second person you've selected/ swap their parts <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGender Swap: Swaps the gender of whatever name you've selected into the opposite, showing you what you would have looked like if you had been born that Gender. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBody Swap: Only works with two names. The selected people will swap bodies. There are two options, Normal Body Swap and Sub-Body Swap. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNormal Body Swap: Both individuals realize they have swapped bodies, and retain their own thoughts and feelings. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSub-Body Swap: Only the first person will remember the swap, the second person will believe they are truly the first, and act out that person\u2019s life as the original body owner would normally. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAge: Allows you to modify the age of whatever name you type in <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMind Set: Allows you to see what the name(s) are thinking, as well as allowing you to change There inner thoughts/brains. There's a list of suggestions, basic emotions such as 'Caring, Angry, Sad, Happy' as well as whole new minds sets, such as 'Nurse, Teacher, Girlfriend' and even a keypad for you to type in your own commands, such as 'Slut, Mommas-Boy, My Slave' and so on. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGhost: Allows the person to turn into a ghost, and possess other bodies. The Ghost is invisible in both sight and sound, and will gain full control over the body it inhabits, and has complete control over entering and exiting the vessel. The Host body will have a blank memory for that period of time. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nControl: This is broken into two sections, Partial Control, and Total Control <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nPartial Control: The person whose name you entered will still be conscious and able to make their own decisions. However, you will be able to view everything they see, do, and think through the Upper screen. In the bottom screen, you will be given a Keyboard (type), as well as a 'MIC' (speak) option. Using these tools, you can enter in virtually any command, either written or verbally spoken, to the person(s) and the command will be carried out, while the person(s) is conscious of every action they take, though they will be unaware as to why. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTotal control: Works more or less like partial control, only the person(s) consciousness is suppressed, making them more or less an empty shell, a puppet for you to control, and will have no idea or recollection of the commands given to them. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn both controls, the person(s) can be as far away as they like, the commands will still follow through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChars: Ian (Insert A Name: You) Main character, Age 17. He\u2019s generally a good kid, but a bit of a slacker when it comes to school work. He\u2019s a bit of a pervert, but he writes it off as, \u2018Who isn\u2019t at age 17?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla Madison, Ian\u2019s mother, Age 42. Kind and caring mother, she\u2019s a bit of a neat freak, and very strict when it comes to keeping things clean and doing chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob Madison, Ian\u2019s father, Age 43. A strong willed Father, he can often lose his temper and shout when he doesn\u2019t mean to. He\u2019s very into sports, though Ian doesn\u2019t take after that trait to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler Madison, Ian\u2019s Brother, Age 21. Already off in collage, he visits home every once in a while. He got in on a sports scholarship, and is the apple in his fathers eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla Madison, Ian\u2019s Sister, Age 18, A bit of a snob, she always thinks she\u2019s right just because she\u2019s a year older then Ian. She\u2019s a real preppy girl, into being pretty and pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa Madison, Ian\u2019s sister, Age 13. She really looks up to Ian, admiring and energetic. She\u2019s into sports like your father and brother, but doesn\u2019t rub her accomplishments in Ian\u2019s face like they sometimes do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha Yossarian, Ian\u2019s girlfriend. She\u2019s a bit of a goth, and very into darkness and despair. She\u2019s know Ian since they were small, and it\u2019s only been recent their lives have taken a romantic turn.</td>",
