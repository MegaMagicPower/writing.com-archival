As he and Aang had both found from experience, Tom foolery had done little to lighten the mood. Being in Fire Nation territory made this kind of a fight much more serious. His steps were surprisingly quiet, but it didn't make a difference. She might be blind, but it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could sense him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't turn and he didn't care. \"Come on. We need to talk.\" And with that he walked past her. He heard Toph sigh, but she followed him without voicing her complaints. After a minute or so they reached the cliff's edge and sat down. He was sure that the river below was a beautiful sight, but there was no way it could compare with the sun setting behind the waterfalls on the horizon. He silently wondered why he so rarely took the time to appreciate these picturesque views.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me guess,\" Toph began. \"You brought me out here to tell me your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" he said casually. \"She's pretty much a pain. She's always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Toph chimed in. \"I don't know how you can deal with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. \"Actually, in a way, I rely on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph still sat there, staring into nowhere with her blind eyes. \"I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up from his comedic side was tough, but Sokka went through with it. \"When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess...But Katara, she had so much strength She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crooked her head slightly to the side, turning her head towards him. \"I guess I never thought about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a good chance that he'd regret saying this, but it was too late to turn back now. \"I'm gonna tell you something crazy. He started. \"I've never told anyone this before, but honestly: I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there. And now when i try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was looking fully in his direction now. Suddenly, Sokka felt awkward. opening up to anyone in a serious way was <i>not</i> his strong suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph filled in the silence. \"The truth is, sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind and she actually cares about me.\" She rubbed at one of her eyes. A tear? \"You know- the real me. That's more than my own mom...\" For a brief moment, she was quiet, was she about to cry? She hauled off and punched his arm. \"Don't <i>ever</i> tell her i said any of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" He said defensively. \"My lips are sealed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both walked back as the sun set. With at least one of the girls in a calmer state, Sokka decided that it would probably be a good idea to let them come to terms on their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",
