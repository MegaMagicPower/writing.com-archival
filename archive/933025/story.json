The 17-year-old high school student tossed his backpack onto the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had ditched his final class of the day in order to get home before his younger sister, Kellie. He wanted to have some privacy for his experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt nervous and wiped his sweaty palms on the front of his jeans. All his research appeared about to pay off. He got a bottle of water from the refrigerator and gulped down the refreshing liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager hadn\u2019t shared the nature of his research with anyone else. He wanted to make sure his formula worked before he shared the story of his success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt already suffered from teasing, especially from his kid sister. Kellie always took delight in ridiculing her big brother\u2019s interest in science, making fun of his geeky ways and nerdish behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t matter. Soon, very soon, Matt told himself, he would get the last laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his water and made his way down to the basement. With his parents\u2019 permission, Matt established his own private laboratory in the basement. Matt\u2019s parents felt proud of him, even if they did worry that he spent too much time in his lab rather than socializing with his peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt logged on to his computer. He saw an e-mail in his Inbox from his best friend. He could not wait to see the look on Andy\u2019s face when he revealed that his formula worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpatient to begin his experiment, he decided not to read Andy\u2019s e-mail. He could read the e-mail later, after conducting his experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt moved to a mini-fridge. He opened the door and took out two glass jars. One jar held a red liquid. The other jar held a pale blue liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed the jars on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into his desk drawer, Matt removed a small portable tape recorder. He pressed the RECORD button and placed the recorded on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am proceeding with the experiment. Earlier successes have led me to believe it is time I test the formula on myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached for the jar with the red liquid. He tilted the glass back and quickly chugged the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I am correct, I should feel the effects begin almost...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stumbled. He felt very strange. The room started spinning until everything became  a blur of color. He experienced the sensation of falling before everything faded to black.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She shouts down asking if your here and Kellie tells you to stay quiet as she stretches her thigh high socks she drops you in and snaps it shut trapping you against her thigh. You are able to move to try to get more comfortable but the socks are to tight for you to try to escape. She puts the remaining formula on the table then walks up stairs and tells mom that she was looking for you but, you weren't around. She then asks if she can get a ride to a friends later and after some small talk she heads to her room to get ready. When she gets there Kellie takes you out and softly tosses you on her bed before she picks her outfit for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl partially under her pillow to try to make up for the lack of clothing you have as Kellie picks out her outfit. It will be cold so she picks out yoga pants and a long sleeved shirt that she can put her dress over then she sees you shivering in your makeshift cover. So she brings out her uggs and puts you in one of them. She tells you she is going to take a shower and that it will be warmest in the tow, then warning you may want to come out to be visible when she returns. When Kellie leaves you go into the toe part to get warm and as you lay on the soft furry material you start to drift between sleeping and awake.</span></div></div>",

Then she sits on the bed and takes off her boot so she can check on you once more and give you the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves you in the heel of the boot as she explains, \"I told you to come out when I came back so you need to stay in the boot for the night as punishment for not listening.\" She then tells you that your going to Monica's house for a group movie and smore cooking. She tells you the rules are that if you are in trouble or pain when her boots are on to rapidly hit the side of her toe and she will try to adjust what may be wrong if that doesn't help she can check on you, and if her boots are off you need to stay hidden and in the boot. She ends the explaining by telling you that she won't keep up these light punishments if you can't start listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she puts back on the boot and gets a ride to her friends by mom and soon she takes off her boots and you hear some pre movie commercials starting.

He would rather be in more dependable hands, but at his tiny size, he has no choice but to try the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven, except for his enormous size, looked like any other sweet, adorable little boy. He might only be six years old, but if Steven got clumsy or impatient, the consequences could be dire for Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt figured he could reason with the boy and convince him to get him back to his home. Without access to his lab, he knew he had no hope of getting back to a normal size and a normal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after a long, boring journey in the pocket, Matt was ready when Steven's hand intruded into the pocket. The huge fingers nabbed tiny Matt and pulled him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny youth found himself on a vast bed. Steven sat on the bed, looking down at tiny Matt.<br>\r\nSteven, with that mop of golden blond hair, still looked like an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very big angel as he loomed over Matt a colossus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt very nervous, but he had to regain the upper hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we now, Steven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt remembered that Steven's room meant that he was far across town, actually in the countryside, probably in one of the many subdivisions that had been constructed on former farmlands. In other words, he was a good distance from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, you have to help me...\" Matt began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Steven reached down and poked Matt with a big finger. The simple jab bowled Matt over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy laughed. \"How'd you get so tiny if you're not a fairy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I invented a formula,\" Matt said, but then Steven looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like medicine,\" Matt said. \"And I drank it, and then I shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Steven said. \"And now you're my pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Matt exclaimed. How to convince this huge boy that he wasn't going to be his pet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he didn't have any options. Without warning or permission, Steven scooped him into his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Matt's fright, he felt almost crushed in the boy's grasp. Finally, when he felt he might suffocate, Steven released him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...by dropping him into a enormous glass bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked around the curved walls. It was! Steven had put him into a huge fish bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven!\" Matt screamed. \"Let me out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel with the golden hair looked down at him and smiled. \"That's your new home,\" the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt stared up at him from the depths of the glass bowl, Steven smiled again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be the bestest friends ever, little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Matt wasn't quite sure he shared the boy's optimism.</span></div></div>",

He yelled to his mother that he was coming. Steven said \"I have to keep you a secret from my mom and all the other people. They may not want me to keep you. But I want to keep you so I have to hide you. And once you agree to be mine then we can have some fun otherwise you're going to remain in this jar Forever Until You agree to be mine.\" Just that Steven's mom walked into the room, \"Steven come on we have to go. What are you doing? \"Stephen said\" I'm playing with my toy mom\". Stephen's mom looked over and saw a tiny figure in the jar. \"Why did you put them in the jar\"? She asked. Steven quickly said \"because it's my toy Mom and I want to keep it and he doesn't want to live with me.\" Stephen's mom started giggling as she knew her son had such crazy imaginations. She even laughed to think that he thinks it's a tiny little man. So to humor her son she said \"it's okay Steven he's your toy he belongs to you. \"She then look towards the toy and said\" little guy, it doesn't matter what you want. You belong to my son and you will be his toy for the rest of your life, okay.\"and before you can get her attention, she looked back at her son as he put the jar down and said \"see sweetie mommy made everything all better.

It looked the size of a billboard and he remembered the letters 32. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed. He felt a chill. His eyes snapped open. \u201cWhere are my clothes?\u201d Matt mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted and pushed himself onto unsteady feet. A large wall of white surrounded him. He walked closer to the expanse and touched the wall. It felt like thick cloth. That\u2019s when he noticed that strange billboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of Matt\u2019s mind, he knew he had seen something like it before. It looked like the label in his boxer briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap!\u201d Matt exclaimed. The wall of white...everything made sense. \u201cMy formula! It worked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had shrunk. And he had shrunk out of his clothes until he now stood, very small, in his own boxer briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran toward the wall. He began to grab with his fists at the fabric, determined to hoist himself out of the enormous boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had failed to take into account that his formula would have no effect on his clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Matt escaped the boxer briefs, he saw more articles of clothing. He found one of his sneakers turned on its side. The shoe as big as an apartment building. A strong stench wafted from the interior of the sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything looks so big!\u201d Matt wondered how small he had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got closer to his size 9 sneaker. The shoe dwarfed the tiny teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must be only an inch tall!\u201d Matt exclaimed.

He saw the jar with the pale blue liquid, the antidote to his shrinking formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap!\u201d Matt felt like kicking himself. \u201cHow am I going to get to it now?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I keep on changing size, dude!\u201d You grumble as you stand up, looking up to Andy again. You grew, but only to two feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda strange, you keep on changing size!\u201d Andy pondered. \u201cFirst, you were really tiny, then you became really big, then you shrunk to tiny size and then you got bigger again\u2026 It seems like there is a pattern, here!\u201d Andy thought out loud while you got back on your feet. You burst out of the doll clothes and you were naked again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026. What do you mean?\u201d you ask your friend. \u201cThe events keep on repeating?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but at variable degrees of growth or shrinkage!\u201d Andy added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm You might be right! After every shrinking spell, I end up growing again! So, if the last event was a growth spurt, the next event will be a shrinkage!\u201d you reason out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, 2-feet-tall, looking up at Andy, who is 5-ft-6 inches tall. You barely reach his big, thick quads. This can only mean one thing. You\u2019re about to get smaller\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Matt didn't know how, but when she stomped on him, his body briefly flattened out, and then reformed under her foot. He figured his new size must have changed the composition of his body. The smell of Kellie's sock was pretty gross and Matt just couldn't shake himself lose from the sock. He kept getting tangled in the sweaty fibers, his face being stuck directly into the moist fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kellie arrived in her room, she just decided to go to sleep. She had never been one for hygiene, so she really didn't care that she still had her sweaty stinky gym socks still on. She laid in bed and fell asleep quickly, picturing how it would be if her brother were trapped under her foot, forced to smell it. Little did she know, that was more than her dream, it was his reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough out the night, Matt tried desperately to escape Kellie's sock. But instead, it felt like he was only being further entrenched into the sock. The stench was getting to be too much, and Matt was losing strength. Suddenly, Kellie extended her leg, pushing her foot onto the board at the foot of her bed. This forced Matt into her socks through a hole that he himself had created. Being face to face with Kellie's stinky sole was as much of a nightmare as he expected it to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot was very soft, his body being pressed deep into the sole. There was barely any room to breath, and it only smelled of horrible foot odor. No matter how hard he fought, he couldn't squeeze out of this position or breath anything but the odor of the foot right in front of him. As the night progressed, Matt was unable to fall asleep, as he was continually coated in Kellie's foot sweat the more she perspired. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The room had become cool and all of the sweat coating Matt dried and stuck him to her foot. Kellie woke up in a mad rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! It's 8 o' clock already??!! I have to get going!\" Kellie yelled as she started dressing for school. As she was rushing everywhere, Matt was getting crushed over and over under her foot. Finally after dressing, she just had her shoes to put on. She sat on her bed and yanked her socks off. Matt was still stuck to the bare sole, right on the ball of her foot. She dangled her feet just above some black flats she was going to wear, but stopped putting them on to check something on her phone. She was wiggling her toes a lot which caused Matt to fall off her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was descending quickly to the ground. He could clearly see where he was falling to. \"Please! Not in there! Anywhere but in there! The smell will kill me!\" Matt knew that Kellie's flats were her stinkiest pair of foot wear she had, second only to her gym shoes, which she used to play sports. As he got closer and closer he could feel the heat from the flats, that never quite seemed to dissipate. Matt landed with a bounce on the spongey insole, which had clearly absorbed so much foot sweat. He almost passed out instantly from the incredible stench. It smelled like complete death, as if something had crawled in and died, but the odor was distinct foot odor, specifically female foot odor. It was somehow uniquely disgusting. Matt looked around and noticed how black the insole was, only where her foot would be. The rest was a gray color, a clear indicator of how frequently she wore these. Matt looked up to see her foot dangling right above the opening. It looked like the universe was telling him that soon, that foot would be his everything. He could see her foot was still mildly sweaty, and it was slightly red. As she wiggled her toes, Matt could clearly see gooey bits of toe-jam in between her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instinctively began to walk backwards, his first mistake. He slipped on the sweaty insole, and landed on his back. Instantly, his back was soaked in foot sweat. His body was laid out vertically where the ball of her foot would rest, and his head extended into the gap where her toes would be. Suddenly, things started to get dark. He looked and saw Kellie's foot approaching. Matt was paralyzed in fear. It was too much for him to handle. The thought of being stuck inside his sister's sweaty stinky black flat, under her sweaty foot all day. He burst into tears and begged any deity that would listen to prevent this from happening. Unfortunately, his prayers went unheard, and Kellie inserted her foot into the flat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie was surprised momentarily from the feeling of something in her shoe, but she also felt it flatten out rather quickly, so she just ignored it, as she was in a rush. :Whatever that is in my shoe, is gonna have a really stinky time today. Especially during gym time\" she shuddered at the thought of someone have to inhale that stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside, Matt was squashed, his body felt extremely weird. He was panicking, wondering how this was possible. His body had gotten pretty flat, but his head remained unsquished, and simply remained in a small gap in between her big and second toe. The smell was unbelievable here. His body was completely immobile, and moving his neck only moved his head into either side of the sweaty foot flesh of her toes. There was no escaping the smell. It burned his nostrils with each breath, and he could feel the burn all the way down to his lungs. Breath after breath of pure foot odor, he began to feel lightheaded, until he passed out shortly thereafter. </span></div></div>",

Matt's body was still stuck under her foot, his body flattened under her sole, however, his head has since slid under her foot as well and was flattening out. This did not stop Matt from being able to breath or prevent foot sweat from being forced into his mouth. A truly disgusting amount of foot sweat was pouring into Matt's mouth, which was now stretched out rather wide. He couldn't close it if he wanted. It was like being bathed in a thick hot stew of stinky feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie had just arrived at school to begin her day. She still felt whatever it was that she squished inside her flat, but didn't really care much for it. She had already felt her feet begin to sweat pretty bad, to the point where when she wiggled her toes, she felt the sweat that had accumulated in between them as they slid past each other. \"Man, my feet are going to REEK by the time today is over. Gross!\" Kellie thought. Just then, Kellie's best friend Jazmine began talking to her, \"Hey Kellie, you ready for our game today?\" (Jazmine is a beautiful hispanic girl with long black hair, tan skin, and an amazing athletic body.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CRAP!\" Kelly worriedly replied. \"I wore my flats today! I forgot to bring a spare pair of socks.\" Jazmine laughed with a disgusted look on her face..., \"Gross Kellie. You're going to go through Gym and our Soccer game without socks? I feel bad for whoever is gonna be around when you unleash those things. But you're stinkers still have nothing on these!\" Jazmine said as she patted her thick ugg boots. \"I'm going sockless myself today, and I was sockless yesterday too with these boots. Pretty sure there's a whole hurricane of stink brewed in there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I'm not the only one haha\" Kellie laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was listening to this little exchange. The amount of anguish he felt inside of there was almost enough to drive him insane. He couldn't help but think, \"How in the world did I get here? Why did this happen to me? WHY ME? WHY FEET? WHY KELLIE'S STINKY FEET?!!! This is so gross, and what the fuck is happening to my body?...All this sweat, my body is flat...I feel like a sticker on her foot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's thoughts were absolutely correct, Kellie's foot was acting like a steam press, her foot sweat acting like glue and the immense pressure acting as the press. It was like he was being ironed to the bottom of her foot, and there was nothing he could do about it. The pressure had completely immobilized him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day progressed, Matt was pressed deeper and deeper into Kellie's sweaty foot. He was growing delirious by the fourth hour of being trapped in her flat. \"When is she going to take it off? How long will I be stuck in here? I can't spend my life stuck to her foot! Why aren't I dead yet? I should at least be dead from all the sweat, if not the smell!! I have to get to my antidote somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was 5th period, Gym class. Kellie and Jazmine began changing together. Finally, Kellie pulled off her flats, and Matt felt an immense amount of relief, as he was hit with a rush of cool air, not that any of it got to his face, which was buried in her sole, he was still cursed with pure foot odor air. As Kellie and Jazmine were finishing up changing, they were just about to put on their gym shoes....</span></div></div>",

As soon as Kellie began to lower her foot into the soccer cleat, Matt could feel the heat of her cleat. It was filled with a sick humid air. The cleat was a portal to a whole new world of Kellie's feet. The flats were clearly nothing compared to these soccer cleats. Matt could feel as though the air was composed of pure foot sweat vapor, and it's odor was somehow condensed inside the shoe. The air itself was heavy, and didn't rise out of her cleat, it just stayed trapped inside, building from her already 3 years now of soccer practice and gym. When her foot finally got halfway into the shoe, Matt was now consumed by this new world of feet. The air was so dense with foot odor, Matt didn't think such a thing was possible. It burned his nose and made his eyes water and his head hurt. It smelled like a combination of infinite girls feet and sweaty socks, all trying to make it's way into his lungs. Breathing through his mouth felt like he was drinking the air, which tasted of pure sweaty foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was desperately trying to yell for Kellie to hear him, but all that came out was a gurgling sound, and he began spurting up some foot sweat, which at this point was embedded in his body. To Matt, the smell was simply something inhuman, it was consuming him entirely. \"Oh god, the smell. The stink! I can't take this anymore! How much longer will I be a human insole to stinky sweaty feet?!\" Matt cried out in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and put those cleats on kellie, they smell disgusting!\" Jazmine yelled. Kellie stuffed on her cleats very quickly, sealing the stench in, along with Matt. A place that was meant only for feet, stink and sweat, was now seemingly Matt's new home, his destiny, or his prison. Regardless, it didn't seem like he would get a break from the oppressive foot odor anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conditions inside this cleat were at least 10x worse than inside the flat. The smashing soon began, as Kellie started playing volleyball in gym class. There was no room to even try to move a muscle, which soon became irrelevant, as any progress Matt made in reforming was instantly undone. The sweat began again, and stench rose, and Matt's disgust and fear increased. 10 minutes in to class, Matt realized just how different the inside of the cleat was vs the flat. The heat rose tremendously inside this cleat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If hell exists, this has to be it!\" Matt thought, as he experienced the inside of his Sister's disgusting soccer cleat in it's full force: The unreasonably sweaty conditions, the unbearable stench, and to top it off, the intense heat that only served to make the conditions even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst day of Matt's life continued on in his Sister's hot steamy cleat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more hours of that hell, Kellie had begun her Soccer game. Halfway through the game, the stench had at least doubled. Her slimy footsweat felt like it was now a part of him. When the game was finally over, Kellie, Jazmine, and the rest of the 10 girls on the team returned to the locker room to change....</span></div></div>",

He hadn't realized until he tried that he was too short to reach the knobs on many of the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sent texts each day using his phone to explain that a \"project\" he was developing with Andy required all of his time and that he was staying over another night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I grow back soon,\" he said after sending another text to his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, after a sound night's sleep, he screamed in delight after waking to find himself back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream didn't do much for Andy's mood. \"Damn, man,\" he complained. \"I thought you'd shrunk again when I heard that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Matt said, realizing he was now naked under the sheets of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Glad you're back with the grown-ups.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of that... could I borrow some clothes from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy chuckled. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy's clothes were a bit roomy on him, but it was better than the alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should go home,\" Matt said. \"I can resume my work on the antidote and make sure it's stable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to come with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you've done enough,\" Matt said. \"I'll call you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, the figure was a tall as a skyscraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrrrnngg\u2026 Andy? What happened? Owww\u2026. My head hurts\u2026\u201d Matt groaned as he tried to sit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had shrunk back to 12 inches in height. He was sitting on top of his gigantic shorts, which were now much too big for him. Andy was holding his large t-shirt in his hands as he squatted down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt got up and took a few steps back. It was a scary sight for him, seeing the giant boy squat down before him. Andy\u2019s thick, muscular legs suddenly folded together and his huge, thick, long legs were only half as long as his knees were sticking out and blocking Matt\u2019s view. Andy\u2019s face now seemed a lot closer to him, but he still had to look up to the giant boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019ll be spending a few nights at my house, little guy!\u201d Andy grinned, lowering his mighty hand down so Matt could step on it. When Matt got on, Andy gently raised his hand up, along with the rest of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was overcome by a head-rush and fell down on the palm of Andy\u2019s hand as he felt the hand rise up and go higher and higher above the ground. It was making Matt dizzy. Finally, Matt looked up and found himself staring into Andy\u2019s huge, brown eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! I can\u2019t stay home from school this week, even if I\u2019m tiny like this! What am I gonna do?\u201d Matt shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you to school and carry you around until you grow back\u2026. Assuming you\u2019ll grow back to normal!\u201d Andy smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 Thanks, big guy\u2026\u201d Matt sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy placed Matt on the passenger seat of the car and he drove home. Once he arrived, he took Matt into his bedroom with him, where he removed his clothes. He set Matt on the floor while he took all his clothes off, except his underwear. Matt just marveled at Andy\u2019s large, hulking, muscular body as he looked up from the ground. Andy was like a huge muscle giant to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Andy crawled on his bed and he placed Matt on his pectorals where the tiny teen dozed off, falling asleep on Andy\u2019s right pec. Andy couldn\u2019t help but smile as he watched the tiny foot-long buddy sleep on top of his chest. It was adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy gently reached over and turned off the lights, hoping to have more fun with Matt the rest of the week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He still felt dirty, covered in spit but it felt better than the butter and salt. Matt had a problem though. His genitals were still coated in a very thick coating where butter had collected between Matt's legs. Matt tried to clear it with his hands but butter smears and is not easy to clean. He thought about getting Matt to lick it off but no, he couldn't do that. Still that thought plus all the rubbing butter off his genitals caused a boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy pulled into his driveway.

They discussed their options and agreed to meet for burgers at their favorite restaurant. With inexpensive food, fantastic fries and big burgers, it's popular with almost everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor such a warm day, Matt wore only shorts, a T-shirt and flip-flops for the short walk to the restaurant. He puzzled over his lack of insight into the formula problem, but he decided to let it go for one evening. Perhaps relaxing and enjoying himself might clear his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he arrived at the restaurant ahead of Andy, who was always running late whenever they made plans. He was glad to see their favorite booth in the back, blocked off from most of the rest of the dining area by a large juke box. He slipped into the booth and told the server he was waiting for someone. The guy left so soon Matt wasn't able to ask him for a drink of water. The walk to the restaurant had left him thirsty. Strangely thirsty, in fact. He also felt sweaty and clammy at the same time. He barely had time to hope he wasn't getting sick when the room began to steadily grow around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of heavy clothes as he shrank into them alerted him to the reality. The restaurant wasn't getting bigger. He was getting smaller, again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to slide out of the booth when the shrinkage kicked into high gear. An instant later, a shrunken Matt found himself on the pad of one of his plastic flip-flops, buried beneath the tent-like proportions of his shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Matt exclaimed in a shrill voice. He climbed from beneath his clothes and stood naked and tiny. He discovered that his clothes had slipped between the seat and the tabletop, which would make concealed from any casual observance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, he was tiny. Incredibly, extremely tiny. The size of an ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, after waiting for what seemed like centuries, nothing had happened. Just that, nothing. Andy watched as his friend frowned and sunk his head into his hands. Shaking his head, he started, \"Well this is it. I'm going to be a walking freakshow for the rest of my life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy started to flex his swollen muscles, feeling the new power course within him. It felt so good. He had only grown about 3 feet but he felt incredible. All from just a few small sips of a supposed \"antidote\". With a malicious grin, Andy's eyes narrowed as he looked down at his tiny friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaking a warming tone, \"Hey Matt, do you have anymore of this stuff?\" Blinking in surprise, Matt sighed before responding, \"A whole crate full of it so I had enough for experiments, why?\" Chuckling softly, Andy spoke again, \"Oh well....maybe we could try to make it work, you know? There's gotta be some way to get you back to normal.\" He faked a kind smile at his distraught friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up with a thankful expression on his face, and motioned for his friend to take him, literally, back to the drawing board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding with a slight thud, Matt sighed again, \"Well, here it is, my well-stocked supply. Now then, there's no telling how many different calculations will have to be made, let alone the test runs. I don't even think we'll have enough of the antidote to experiment with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy laughed wickedly and loudly, sending the hairs on Matt's back on end. \"Oh I think we have just enough.\" Matt looked up to see his friend's evil, toothy smile. Speaking with a wimper, Matt tried to reason with his gargantuan \"friend\", \"An--Andy, now ho---ho---hold on. There's no telling what that will--will do to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy payed little attention to the tiny insect before him, and started to gulp down the first bottle of antidote he could get. Not showing any signs of stopping, he continued, gulping down bottle after bottle, with a vicious, burning desire in his eye. He wanted more. He had always wanted to grow before, but now that it can be an actual reality, he wanted more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt started up in horror as the terrifying scene began to unfold....</span></div></div>",

He was shrinking again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026. Matt? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Andy wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndy? ANDY! Andyyyyyyy\u2026.\u201d Matt shouted as he reached over with his arms extended upward as his body rapidly dwindled down, shrinking lower and lower. His shirt, his shorts and his cleats were quickly becoming far too big on him and within seconds Andy saw nothing but a pile of soccer clothing on the floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit! MATT!\u201d Andy gasped as he quickly reached down and pulled the jersey, the shirts and the cleats out of the way. Suddenly, on the ground in the bedroom, there he was\u2026. Andy let out a loud gasp as he saw a tiny figure lying on the carpet\u2026 He was barely an inch tall when he stood up, completely naked\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026 Matt? Is that you?\u201d Andy said as he carefully squatted down before the miniature figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up\u2026 He saw Andy\u2026. GIANT Andy looming over him\u2026. Just by looking around and by looking at Andy, Matt guessed that he was maybe one or two inches tall\u2026 no more than that. He leaned forward and buried his head between his hands on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026 NOOOO! I shrunk AGAIN! Now I\u2019m REALLY small!\u201d Matt shouted out loud. \u201cAnd I\u2019m NOT growing back anymore! This is it! I\u2019m staying this tiny forever!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeyyyyy\u2026. I\u2019ll take care of ya!\u201d a booming voice spoke as a giant hand suddenly scooped him up off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Matt looked up, he realized he was suddenly in the giant palm of Andy\u2019s massive hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got this, Matt\u2026. I\u2019ll take care of you\u2026. You\u2019re mine from now on\u2026\u201d Andy said as he started to walk out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026. What\u2026 Where are we going?\u201d Matt wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo my house, of course. You\u2019re staying with me from now on, little dude!\u201d Andy grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes Andy walked over to his house and he entered his own bedroom. He set Matt on his desk and he removed his clothes. Then he crawled on his bed with Matt in his hand. He set Matt on his chest as he spoke to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt looked on, all he could see was a wide, long landscape which consisted of Andy\u2019s huge, muscular body. He was standing on his chest, and no matter where he wanted to go, it would be a long walk across Andy\u2019s massive torso. Andy finally dozed off on his bed, completely naked, while tiny Matt rested on one of his pectorals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Matt woke up and attempted to walk across the expansive landscape, which was Andy\u2019s body. Where would he go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Justin was a stark contrast from either his brother or his father. While being smart, Justin wasn't interested as much in science. He studied pre-law in college. Justin was also a gifted athlete, excelling in basketball. Justin was tall, six foot-three and around 200 pounds. In fact, Justin had just returned from shooting hoops over in the park a short distance from the house. He saw his dad's car in the garage and Matt's bookbag on the kitchen table. He was still dressed in his basketball clothes: a sweaty tank top, navy basketball shorts, and a pair of well-worn white &amp; gray, Nike 'air force one' high tops. It was a misnomer to call them 'sneakers'...the thick rubber soles of Justin's size 13 1/2 basketball shoes thundered with a dull, heavy 'BUMP' against the concrete floor with each step Justin took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger stepped out of the mouse hole and ran to where Justin was stepping; \"JUSTIN!!! JUSTIN!! SON!! DOWN HERE!\" the tiny middle-aged man yelled, hopping and waving, hoping that his movements would catch Justin's eye. \"BUMP!!!\" Justin's right foot landed right in front of his inch-tall father, roger nearly lost his balance. Justin continued walking, looking around puzzled. \"Where is everyone?\" he said aloud. Justin's voice roared to the tiny men on the floor; Matt had finally ventured out of the mouse hole, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Roger raced toward Justin, who had stopped walking for the moment. Roger ran toward the shoelace on Justin's left shoe, which was untied and dragging along the floor. Roger grabbed it and began to climb. \"C'MON, MATT!\" yelled Roger. \"GET ON BOARD!! WE CAN\"T STAY DOWN IN THIS BASEMENT. NOT AT OUR SIZE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin ran and grabbed onto the same shoelace his dad was climbing up. Just then, Justin began to walk again! \"HOLD ON, SON!!\" yelled Roger, who had climbed to where he was off the floor and not in danger of being stepped on. Matt soon climbed right below where his father was as Justin jogged up the wooden basement steps. The thunder of Justin's footfall was deafeningly loud! Soon, Roger and Matt could see that they were now in the kitchen, as Justin stepped toward the refrigerator.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeremy liked collecting bugs and small animals.  His 11 year old brother always called him \"the little critter man\" because he was constantly catching crickets, lizards, frogs &amp; minnows.  His Mom was always getting on him for his critter hunting because he didn't like wearing shoes (he didn't think he could creep quietly enough in shoes) but didn't like going barefoot.  So he would get a lot of grass stains &amp; holes in his white socks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew the neighbor's yard would be perfect for getting some bugs since it hadn't been mowed for a few weeks.  His teacher had assigned the class to collect &amp; identify four different types of insects, an assignment that was right up his alley.  Even though he still had a week to do the project he couldn't wait to start.<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was desperately trying to find some high ground so maybe he could see above the grassy forest he was trapped in, find his house over the tree-like strands of grass and head that direction.  He figured if he could make it back home he could get either his sister or Andy to help him get back to normal.  The grass was about twice his height, but looking up through it he could see the big maple tree which was in the middle of the backyard.  He decided to make his way towards the tree so he could climb it a little bit to figure out where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass was like a jungle, and at his size each blade seemed thick and heavy.  He moved around a large cluster of crabgrass, and stopped because he heard some rustling up ahead.  His heart started pounding as he could hear something making it's way toward him through the grass.  But in addition to the rustling he could also feel very large vibrations, almost like some very large object was pounding over and over again on the earth a short distance away.  The rustling and the pounding vibrations seemed to be two different things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a large cricket lept right at him, knocking him to the ground.  The cricket seemed to be as afraid of him as he was of the cricket and with one huge jump lept away from him.  And that's when Matt saw the source of the pounding.  It terrified him when he saw that the cricket that just knocked him down was now trapped in a net hundreds of feet above him, and was being put into a giant jar.  He saw the huge figure of Jeremy, his little (!!!!) neighbor kid, looming very large above him.  Jeremy was very happy with his first capture.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt never occured to Matt to try to get Jeremy to help him.  He had always considered Jeremy to be a little bit annoying and so he picked on him a lot.  He knew that if Jeremy were to find him at 1 inch tall he'd be in a jar for the rest of his life.  So simply by instict Matt started to run.  <br>\r\n__________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy cupped the cricket gently in his hand and dropped it in the jar.  He had handled bugs for a long time, and was always very careful not to harm them.  Then he picked up his net again and crouched down low so he could search through the long grass.  Out of the corner of his eye he noticed some movement in some of the long grass about two feet to his right.  He slowly stepped in that direction, being very careful not to step on whatever it was that was in the grass.  He set the jar down, and then reached down towards the moving grass.  He gently moved it aside, and saw something, he wasn't sure what, trying desperately to move away from him.  He took his net and dropped it right over the small creature.  Then he carefully moved his hand under the net, moved the grass aside so he could find the little critter to trap it.  Jeremy's eyes got rather large as he realized what was trying to escape him.  He knew it couldn't be, but it looked like a very tiny man.  He very gently picked up the small creature between his thumb and index finger, turned the net over and dropped it in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy sat down cross-legged on the lawn so he could see what he had found.  A good bug hunter never goes hunting without a magnifying glass, so Jeremy pulled his out of his pocket so he could get a better look at his little captive.  He put his left hand under the net, so that Matt was lying on the netting on the palm of the boy's hand.  Holding the magnifying glass in his right hand he got a closer look at Matt, and realized instantly who he was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!  What happened to you?\"  he said softly.  He studied Matt for a few moments.  Matt was trying to shout up to Jeremy for help, but Jeremy was unaware of it because he was so preoccupied with the fact that he was holding a tiny man on his hand.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy slowly lowered his left hand from under Matt, and let the netting (and Matt) rest on the fabric of his sock on the side of his foot.  He put the magnifying glass back in his pocket, grabbed the jar, and got up to head back to his house holding Matt in the net.  He didn't want anyone else, especially his brother Jimmy, knowing what he had found.  He got to his bedroom and...</span></div></div>",

He saw the little person jump down off of the net, so he picked it up and put it down next to his closet door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man was running all over Jeremy's desk, trying to get his attention.  Jeremy was fascinated.  He had to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy sat down at the desk and Matt continued to try to attract the giant boy's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Hey!  Listen to me!\"  Matt yelled up at the boy, but he backed away from the edge as Jeremy pulled himself towards the desk, his form looming larger and larger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, little guy,\" said Jeremy, putting his hand onto the desk, trying to stop the little guy from running around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Matt saw the hand descending into his path, he veered away, he did not want to get anywhere near a hand again, being picked up by two fingers was bad enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop,\" Jeremy said, moving his hand, trying to get the little man to stay still so he could get a closer look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt kept running to avoid the giant hand.  Jeremy began to get annoyed and reached into his desk drawer.  He pulled out  roll of tape and tore off a piece.  This was all happening high over Matt's head, so his first inkling was the shadow of Jeremy's hand coming down.  He was not quick enough to avoid the clear tape descending on top of him, pushing him down to the desk top, trapping all but his head and one arm.  He struggled to free himself, but the tape was too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go...\" Jeremy said and lowered his head towards the tiny man.</span></div></div>",

He struggled to slosh his way through the bowl, which was very deep to him. To his tiny body, it was like trying to swim through a pool of concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above him, Kellie and her friends were engaged in conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE IS MATT TODAY?\" Kellie's friend Julie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEATS ME, I CAME HOME AND HE WASN'T IN HIS LAB. OR ANYWHERE ELSE, FOR THAT MATTER.\" She responded while <br>\r\ndropping a chip into the bowl of dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had looked up at the sound of his name in time to see the chip descend, held in Kellie's impossibly huge hand. It entered the thick dip several meters in front of him and shoveled towards him at an angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kellie, don't!\" Matt squeaked pathetically. The combination of the cavernous bowl and the thick dip swallowed up his puny cries for help. Matt's heart sank as he felt the massive chip move underneath him, like some gigantic whale below the vast surface of dip. Even worse was the horrific squelch as the chip began to rise out of the dip. Matt felt himself going up. But luckily enough for him, Kellie's angle caused him to only be caught at the edge of the chip. A small dollop of the dip, him included, plunged back into the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis problems weren't over, however. He had landed on his back now, and the thick dip was finally winning it's battle with him. He tried valiantly to right himself, but the dip was like quicksand and he was stuck fast. He had a full view of Kellie and her super-sized friends high above him, enjoying their snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE'S BEEN REALLY BUSY WORKING ON SOME KIND OF SECRET FORMULA. HE WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT IT!\" Kellie boomed as she shoved the chipful of dip into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW, WHAT A DORK!\" Came the thunderous voice of Amanda, another of Kellie's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEA! A SECRET FORMULA? SERIOUSLY!\" Said another girl, Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, even in spite of his predicament, felt a pang of hurt. His formula worked! It would make him rich! Provided, of course, he first find a way to avoid being eaten by a couple of teenage girls! Matt's chances, however, got slim as he watched Amanda lower a chip into the dip. He looked to his right as the chip plunged into the dip and moved at him. This time, perfectly square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, no!\" Matt screamed, but it was in vain as Amanda unknowingly scooped up the tiny teen with some of the dip. All Matt could do was scream in sheer terror as he felt his whole world rise up rapidly as Amanda picked up the chip and stopped it level with her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S VERY OF NICE OF YOU GUYS TO MAKE FUN OF HIM!\" Kellie thundered. \"HE'S NOT EXACTLY HERE TO DEFEND HIMSELF AFTER ALL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVEN IF HE WAS HERE,\" Amanda said, \"HE'S TOO QUIET TO EVEN WORRY ABOUT DEFENDING HIMSELF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked in the direction of his gigantic sister as she came to his defense. She was looking right at him, but his body was covered in the dip and he blended right in onto the chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kellie, you have to stop her! Don't let her eat me!\" Matt screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention was focused back to Amanda as he felt himself start to move. She wasn't even looking at the chip, focused on her chat with Kellie. She began to slowly part her gigantic lips, adding to Matt's torture as she slowly opened her mouth. The light from the room illuminated her huge, pink tongue, framed by rows of clean, white teeth. In the back of the enormous cavern he saw her throat, open and waiting for him. He screamed again as he and the chip approached her cavernous open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, no!\" Matt screamed. \"Don't eat me!\"</span></div></div>",

High above him Matt saw his teacher, Mrs. Graham. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe no nonsense literature teacher seemed to wear a permanent scowl. At 63 years old she had spent over thirty years dealing with high school kids. She was stern, but Matt did enjoy her classes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Graham! Look down!\" Matt screamed while trying to climb out of the thick dip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy sunk deeper into the dip as the plate was roughly deposited onto the table. Mrs. Graham sat down, immediately striking up conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt could hear the voices of several other faculty, and parents. He struggled back to the top, and called out for help again. His already pitiful voice drowned out by idle chit-chat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess teacher began to eat while still being enthralled with the table's discussion. She lifted fork after fork of green beans and corn. Along with chunks of honey ham. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aggressive beating of Matt's heart was nearly enough to vibrate the entire plate. Though when Mrs. Graham suddenly dunked a cracker into the creamy dip Matt honestly believed his heart exploded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop! I'm down here!\" Matt cried out in desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasually snacking at the end of her satisfying meal Mrs. Graham took another scoop of the delicious dip. Only now there was another ingredient on this cracker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt screamed in horror as he was carried towards his teacher's enormous mouth. \"Please don't eat me!\" He begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could see every detail of her teeth. The slight yellowing near the gums. The cavity in one of her molars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous tongue pressed down firmly awaiting the delicious morsel. Damp breath, smelling mostly of the previously devoured ham. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality it only took a fraction of a second for the giantess to deposit the entire cracker into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light was extinguished as massive lips closed tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n For barely an instant the cracker remained centered on the saliva coated tongue. Matt screamed desperately as the muscled beast shoved the cracker between Mrs. Graham's teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crunch reverberated through the inside of the mouth. Matt struggled to slide off the cracker and onto the tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tumbled over the side the cracker and dip were mashed into unrecognizable paste. Mrs. Graham shifted the lump back onto her tongue covering Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue rose up and pressed Matt and the chewed food against the roof of the mouth. As the esophagus opened the tongue slid backwards forcefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe undulating  esophagus walls captured the glob of food. It along with Matt were being swallowed into the stomach below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was still struggling to hang onto anything he could. Managing to get free from the actual food Matt tried to climb back up the fleshy tunnel. Unfortunately the way was tightly closed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling something stuck in her throat Mrs. Graham swallowed hard. The undulations returned causing Matt to slip further down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was able to brace against the esophageal walls. Just as he began to force his way back upward the walls opened above him. Mrs. Graham had taken a big gulp of her drink to wash down whatever was stuck in her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to hold on Matt was swept away. He flowed through the esophagus and through the sphincter at its end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt splashed down into the putrid juices below. He swam to the surface as quickly as he could. He wipe gunk from his eyes, but instantly knew something was very wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin began to burn horribly. The acid in Mrs. Graham's stomach was wasting no time attempting to dissolve the shrunken teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn horrendous pain Matt tried to find anything to climb on. With absolutely no light inside the stomach he was simply flailing about aimlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach groaned as it began to churn. Its massive walls squeezed inward. Matt was pushed deeper inside. With no chance of resurfacing Matt drowned as his lungs filled with the burning acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Graham finished her meal. \"Not bad.\" She commented on the food to a near by teacher. \"Nothing too special though.\" Unaware that one of her students was a secret ingredient. </span></div></div>",

Which is obviously impossible.\" Mrs. Graham said, unaware that Matt was very much successful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty's eyes lit up. \"Really, shrinking?\" She said amused. \"That'd be fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a pointless thing for a boy so bright to focus on. Why on earth would anyone want to shrink themselves ?\" Mrs Graham asked as she pulled into her driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some people would get off on being so tiny. Then again, I bet there's a lot of people who would love to own a tiny pet.\" Patty said with a sly grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Graham looked at her daughter with a dry smile as she unbuckled. \"Well, I'll make sure to ask Matt if he's looking for a giant owner when he shrinks.\" She said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty clasped her hand tightly around Matt as she climbed out of the car. \"Don't worry about it mom.

His one inch body slipped between her sprawling toes as she stepped forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being so tiny, Matt was far too large not to notice as the giantess' toes squeezed back together as her foot landed on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Graham instantly felt the strange lump between her toes. In a hurry, and impatient the giantess raised her foot, and roughly jostled it side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt like he was in a massive washing machine. His body was tossed violently back and forth against the giantess' toes. Somehow he remained wedged between the chubby digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated Mrs. Graham lifted her foot and grabbed her yellow Clark's sandal. Matt held onto the side of Mrs. Graham's big toe to avoid falling to the ground below. It was a pointless effort as a massive finger shoved between the toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flick Mrs. Graham dislodged the annoyance between her toes. As Matt tumbled across the tile floor the giantess slid her sandal back on. Casually as she moved forward she kicked the tiny object out of her path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt rolled across the unforgiving tile as if he had been shot out of a cannon. His body going completely limp. His limbs flailing uncontrollably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken teen came to a stop in the middle of the floor. If any, or all of his bones were broken he couldn't feel it. In a barely conscious state Matt's vision was locked straight ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt watched as a pair of slender ebony feet clad in simple tan, leather flip flops moved towards him. The enormous feet belonged to his chemistry teacher, Ms. Martin. She was young, only mid-twenties, and very intelligent. She actually helped Matt with some of his formula, though she didn't realize that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt attempted to croak out the ebony giantess' name, but his body refused even that. He could only watch as she grew nearer with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful impact just behind him sent tremors through the floor. Matt could not even look back to see who had nearly crushed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping to get to talk to you!\" Ms. Martin said gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's managed to clench his eyes shut as Ms. Martin's right foot fell right beside him. She stopped to talk to the unknown giant. Matt tried to get his body to obey, but it was far too broken. He could only watch as her foot began to fidget back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA casual shift to the monstrous foot was an enormous impact to Matt. Without warning the sole of the flip flop landed on his already useless legs. With an effortless movement she crushed his legs entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt barely managed a garbled moan. It was all made worse as her foot shifted again, dragging Matt's limp body with it. Every movement over the next few minutes saw Matt mercilessly ragdolled by the leather flip flop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the short conversation ended, and Ms. Martin began to walk Matt felt his body slap wildly against her toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso feeling the tiny impact the giantess stopped. Looking down she groaned audibly. She roughly drug her foot backwards. The motion rolled Matt under the sole, instantly liquefying the rest of this tiny body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was left a smear on tile, wiped away by the foot of a giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her feet resting on their heels. Matt laid between her toes, almost relaxed until Samantha put on music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie shot up from the bed. As she danced around Matt was tossed violently under her toes. He was held in place under the pudgy, sweaty digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all became too much to handle.

Kellie took her time casually strolling home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy time she walked through the front door Matt was drenched in sweat. Mostly Kellie's.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"MATT? YOU DOWN HERE?\" a booming, feminine voice boomed across the laboratory. Matt crouched down; the voice was nearly deafening. \"Oh man! That's Kellie!\" Matt cried. Footstep thundered as Kellie and her boyfriend, Josh, walked down the basement step. Josh was two months from his 15th birthday, a few months younger than Kellie. Both Kellie and Josh were freshmen at the same high school as Matt, who was a senior. Even though Josh was not even 15, he was a large, blocky, athletic teenager, a much bigger than the 17 year-old Matt (even when Matt was normal size). Josh was nearly six feet tall, stocky (around 230 pounds) with broad shoulders and barrel chest. Josh certainly wasn't know for having 'six-pack' abs. He was thick around his mid-section, having the build of a defensive lineman. Josh actually was a very good athlete, possessing a lot of strength and surprising speed, leading him to excelling in football and on the basketball court. He had thick, shoulder length blond hair; soft blue eyes; a prominent, rounded jaw; a small, slightly upturned nose; and a cute, boyish smile that melted many hearts. He had a few blond hairs growing from his chin and soft blond fuzz along his jawline, which was probably the extent of his facial hair. Josh had a smooth complexion with freckled cheeks and marked by a few small pimples on his broad forehead, which were mostly concealed under his long bangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird. His bag's upstairs, the lights on down here. What the--? His CLOTHES are piled on the floor! What is he up to?\" Kellie wondered aloud, her hands on her hips, looking around the lab. Josh looked around the lab and wrinkled his nose. His facial expression said it all: 'God, what a loser!' Josh took a few steps and snorted, \"Maybe his home planet beamed him back aboard the mothership!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, and what are you saying? He's my BROTHER! If he's an alien, what am I?\" Kellie turned, slapping his solid torso. <br>\r\n\"They probably want to leave YOU here! Cuz you're so MEAN!\" Josh laughed. Kellie tried to slap him, but Josh grabbed her arms. The two play wrestled for a few seconds, with Kellie pulling away. She folded her arms and pretended to pout. <br>\r\n\"Hey, baby. You're the cutest little alien I ever met\", Josh said in a sing song voice, wrapping his arms around Kellie from behind in a bear hug. Kellie pulled away. <br>\r\nMeanwhile, Matt was on the floor, a mere 1/2 an inch tall, trying to avoid being stepped on, but about sick of watching the interplay between his sister and her boyfriend. Matt didn't like Josh and Josh didn't like Matt. Matt felt protective of his little sister, but knew that even at his normal size, he was physically no match for Josh. Josh was also an all A student and was likely to be voted into the Honor Society, of which Matt was president, whicn really annoyed Matt. It also bugged Matt that Josh once bragged that he scored a 176 on an IQ test. What a loser. Bragging about an stupid IQ score. He HAS to be lying. At least, that what Matt told himself--Matt scored a 154 on the IQ test! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! the heel of Josh's colossal sneaker thundered down an inch from Matt. This woke Matt up in time to realize he better get away from these two giants! Josh had fairly big feet anyway--he wore a size 13--but at Matt's tiny size, Josh's sneaker was almost as large as their school building! Josh's sneaker was a well-worn, white with green trim, Nike 'elite' high top from last year's basketball team at the middle school, the cuffs of his jeans was half-stuffed into the shoe, the velco strap undone and flopping around. Kellie pink, canvass tennis shoe slammed down right in front of Matt as he tried to escape Josh's path, 'AACK!\" cried Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie and Josh wrestling around looked harmless enough, but for a tiny, 17 year old on the floor, it was frightening as hell! Matt was amazed he wasn't squashed by one of the high school freshmen, who, from Matt's perspective, towered hundreds of feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stepped over to the table, his beat-up basketball shoes bumping heavily on the concrete floor, and picked up the jar with the shrinking antidote. He sniffed it and wrinkled his face: \"This stuff smells like ass!\" Kellie walked over, the footfall of her pink canvass sneakers thundering but not nearly as loud as Josh, and took a whiff :\"Ewww! Gross!\" Kellie then picked up the jar with the shrinking formula. Matt saw this and ran to the giants, yelling: \"NOO!! BE CAREFUL WITH THAT STUFF. HEY! HEY!! DOWN HERE!! STOP!!\" But it was useless; he was too tiny to be heard. \"What IS this stuff?\" Kellie asked, brow furrowed. \"I dare you to drink it!\" Josh laughed. \"YOU drink it!\" said Kellie, thrusting it toward him. \"I don't want that!\" said Josh, pushing it back with the back of his hand. When Josh slapped the jar back, some of the shrinking formula splashed out!</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, he heard Kellie shriek. When he turned, she was gone, but her clothes were in a pile on the floor! Josh swore and called out for Kellie. He crouched down an reach for her discarded t-shirt. suddenly, something moved! At first, Josh thought it was just a bug. He squinted...and gasped, \"KELLIE??? HOLY SH--\" \"Oh, God Josh! Not so loud!\" The tiny girl cried, covering her ears and crawling under the fabric of her t-shirt, which now stretch out for acres. Kellie was shrunk to around 1/2 inch tall! She hid under her t-shirt, covering her nakedness and protecting her from the cold chill in the basement. Finally, she looked around and saw her brother, running towards her in the pile of clothes. Josh saw Matt, \"Oh...my...GOD! This can't be happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on down there?!?\" A young female voice called from the top of the stairs. it was Ashley and Trisha, Kellies friends. The girls were waiting all of this time in the kitchen as Kellie and Josh went to find Matt. Kellie wanted to tell Matt to let their parents know that she, Josh, and her friends were going to Taco Bell and would be back after dinner. The girls climbed down the steps and saw Josh, crouched over a pile of clothes. They saw another pile of clothes and could spot what looked like two bugs, one crawling in the t-shirt and one along the floor. \"Josh?? What's going on? What are you doing and where's Kellie?\" demanded Trisha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sputtered and pointed to the pile of clothes, \"Kellie...she's sh-she's...ah...she's shrunk! She friggin' ant sized! And so's her nerdy brother!\"<br>\r\n\"What are you TALKING about??\"  said Ashley, closing her eyes and shaking her head. Josh carefully picked up the t-shirt and cradled it in his arms, his tiny girlfriend hiding inside, only her tiny head and arms peeking out. <br>\r\nAshley and Trish were dumbfounded. \"How, how did this HAPPEN??\" cried Ashley. <br>\r\nMatt ran up to Ashley, Trish, and Josh, waving his arms: \"HEY!! HELP ME!!! I'M DOWN HERE TOO!!!\"<br>\r\nAshley saw the tiny teen and knelt down. She laid her finger on the floor, allowing Matt to climb on her well-manicured, strawberry-colored fingernail. She slowly stood up, lifting her finger close to her face, with Trish and Josh moving in close to get a look at the tiny boy. He sat, covering his privates with his hands. He was shivering, from cold and fear both, no doubt! \"Oh God, he's naked as a jaybird.\" she said, closing her eyes and turning her head away. \"Really?\" asked Trisha, squinting in for a closer look. \"Hahaha...you can't even see anything, Ash!\"<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Josh peered down at his 1/2 tall girlfriend, covered in the material of the massive t-shirt. For once, he didn't have a smart crack to make, he was in shock. \"Don't worry Kellie, it'll be ok!\"<br>\r\n\"OK?? How can it be OK??? How did I SHRINK? How do I grow back?? And the dance is coming up this Friday! What am I going to do, Josh?\" wailed Kellie. Josh looked down, \"Uh, babe? I can't hear a thing you're saying.\" <br>\r\n\"Can you hear THIS??\" she said, flipping him the bird.<br>\r\n\"Jeez! You act like no one's ever been shrunk before.\" he said, smiling. \"At least you're still bigger than....than a flea--maybe.\"<br>\r\n\"WILL YOU SHUT UP!!\" cried Kellie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Trish found a cotton ball in the lab. It was used to make covering for Matt and Kellie. Soon, Matt and Kellie were clothed in their little cotton fluffs, standing in Trish's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed out loud, \"Aww, you two are like little pixies. At least, Matt's ALWAYS looked like a pixie! Ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, REAL funny, Josh.\" growled Matt.<br>\r\n\"Dont' let him get to you. He CAN be a BIG JERK,\" she said turning toward Josh, \"It's best to ignore him.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, a gust of wind picked both Matt and Kellie up, nearly blowing them off of Trish's palm. Josh had leaned in. pursed his lips, and blew a short, quick puff at the two tiny teens. \"Josh, careful!\" said Trisha, glaring at Josh. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, Josh. Totally uncool!' said Ashley. <br>\r\n\"What? Just having a little fun.\" replied Josh<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" asked Trisha.<br>\r\n\"Let's ask Wayne Salinsky down there how he did this and if he can fix them.\" said Josh. Josh them glared down at Matt, \"Seriously dude, if you shrank my girlfriend, trust me, I better not get a hold of you!\" growled Josh.  </span></div></div>",

Matt and Josh endured Kellie's worrying for another minute when they began to find their surroundings returning to normal.  Kellie's face was no longer a moon above them, instead appearing more like that of a giant.  \"OMIGOSH!\"  Kellie boomed, \"YOUJUSTGREW.\"   Matt paused, hoping that now that he had grown she could hear him properly.  \"It appears so,\" Matt gestured to the table.  \"Quick grab my tape measure!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie stood up, her imposing body towering above them.  Matt was busy looking for something to cover his nudity.  Josh was busy admiring the enormous size of his girlfriend.  This new size had...possibilities.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kellie returned, bouncing down into a crouch over Matt and Josh.  She plunked the tape measure down for them.  Josh followed Matt who stood beside it.  \"It looks like,\" Josh began to say before another quick spurt happened.  Redoing his estimate, Josh said \" Matt and I are about a foot and half tall.\"  Kellie smiled, \"That's great!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt wasn't so positive.  \"Not really sis, are bodies were so small they became super saturated.\"  He began to pace around.  Josh tried to look away, because you know, naked dude.  Kellie on the other hand was rapt.  She had always liked her Bo, as she called him.  She had secretly harbored a crush on him, one that was forbidden.  And Josh, well, she liked Josh of course.  Allot!  And the thing was, they were cuter than ever small!  Granted, she wanted them bigger, ideally big enough she could kiss and play with.  But she liked being bigger.  It made her feel powerful.   It was clear that when she moved they watched, when she talked they listened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt continued, \"So, while our bodies rejected the formula, the bigger we get the less our systems reject it.\"  Josh spoke up, \"So we aren't going to grow back to full size?\"  Matt shook his head.  \"No and with each smaller gain, the next one takes longer to occur!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kellie can't make formula's like Matt can but he tout her plenty to easily recreate his.

Josh charges forward shouting but the only reply he receives is another dose of the formula making him shrink to a quarter of an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt calmly tries to tell Kellie that every time someone is exposed to the formula their body will have less resistance to it making them grow less in a longer time frame. Kellie seems to ignore him as she sits down on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then waves the formula in front of him teasing, \"Then you will do a great job licking my boots clean.\" Matt hesitates before getting on all fours licking her boots lick like a dog. Sam and Josh sit there stunned until Kellie looks at them asking herself how many times she would have to shrink someone before they wouldn't be visible anymore.

She probably would want to talk with him about homework or something. Once she got over the shock of seeing him like this, getting returned to normal would be no problem. Matt's only worry was whether she would bring her friends with her. He didn't really want to appear tiny and naked in front of all her friends, it would be hard enough with just her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were soon interrupted by the basement door opening and footsteps on the wooden staircase. The sound of girls talking let him know right away that Kellie was here with her friends. Turning crimson, Matt wished there was a way for him to cover himself a little better. Unfortunately, he would get his wish in a way that he didn't intend. Matt felt a tingling sensation over his entire body as some unprecedented side effects began....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie reached the bottom of the stairs. Behind her were her two friends, Julie and Samantha. \"Matt, where are you\" Kellie called. Looking around, she saw Matt's notebook laying on the table, along with a jar containing some kind of blue liquid, and a pile of his clothes in the corner. \"Are you sure he's here?\" asked Julie. Kellie's confused expression made her look in the same direction, at the empty pile of clothes. \"Oooh he must be naked!\" Samantha exclaimed. \"Yuck, I hope not\" said Julie. Her eyes traveled to a tiny, tan object not far from the pile of clothes. \"Hey Kellie, what is that?\" \"What's what?\" \"That thing moving around near Matt's shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie, Julie and Samantha walked over to the tan object moving across the floor. By some trick of light it appeared to be getting darker as they approached, and changing shape slightly. By the time they were standing over it, it looked completely different. \"Oh, it's just a fly. It looked really weird for a minute, almost like it was....\" Julie drifted off, unsure of what to say. Samantha bent down and blew a puff of air at the fly. Almost immediately, it took off and began circling the girls. \"Shoo, get out of here\" Samantha said, swatting at it. Almost as though it understood, the fly took off up the stairs and out of the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was the first to break the silence. \"Let's go to Wendy's for some fast food. We can find Matt later.\" \"Alright\", Kellie agreed, preoccupied with what she had just seen. Surely it was just her mind playing tricks on her.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps a fly had stumbled into the formula, mixing its DNA with the powerful ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibility presented a new host of problems. Would his antidote, still on hand in his basement lab, restore his size along with his human form?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Matt pondered, his sister and her friends prepared to leave for lunch at their favorite fast food restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he felt tempted to follow them, he nixed the idea.

Obviously, his formula still had some flaws because in the process, he has metamorphosed into a tiny fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrival of his sister and her friends, all three girls looking impossibly huge, brought into focus the extent of his dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed desperately to get back to his makeshift basement lab. With access to his antidote, perhaps he could reverse the bizarre transformation and regain his human form and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvents were moving by with a blur-like speed, even as his six tiny legs clung to the vertical surface of the living room wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie, Samantha and Julie walked in unison toward the front door. Flying outside with them looked to be his only hope of admittance to his lab after his sister has closed the interior door leading to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a little nervous, especially after seeing the size of the girls, about venturing into the vast outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie led the way, and her transformed fly-boy brother left the wall and buzzed toward them. He zipped between Julie and Samantha, emerging into a world grown colossal in all respects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with his wings buzzing like mad, the tiny fly failed to keep pace with them. In only a moment, they left him behind as they got into Julie's car and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't let that concern him overly much. There would seem to be very little Kellie or her friends could do for him at the moment. It just might be safer without them looming over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe renewed his determination to get back into his lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne route was represented by an old stairwell from the outside of the house that also accessed the storage area of the basement. Dusty, littered with old cobwebs, and crowded with crates and boxes, that deep pit might be his best opportunity. He flew toward the old stairwell, but the deep tunnel looked very dark to the tiny fly-boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reconsidered, thinking it might be safer to try some of the screened vents located along the upper walls of the basement. He began searching for some opening in the screen that would let his tiny fly body squeeze through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on a screen, he could peer into his basement lab. He could see his antidote, waiting for him, held in a bottle on a gigantic table. Seeing it made him even more desperate to get back into his lab. The mesh of the wire screen, however, didn't offer any viable entrances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, he flew back toward the exterior stairwell, settling on a concrete ledge. He was debating his next move when a large yellow van with red lettering on the side pulled into the paved driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Matt looked curiously at the huge vehicle, but when he read the letters he felt real fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMATHESON PEST CONTROL loomed in huge red letters against the yellow van. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months ago, his mother had been aggravated by a problem with ants in her kitchen.

He looked at the report, which indicated a past ant infestation but no serious problems since that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying everything with him, he walked from the driveway to the sidewalk to the back of the customer's home. He passed a dusty stairwell and peered into the shadowy, dusty passageway. \"Looks like a likely place for little pests to hide out,\" he remarked. \"Might as well start out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started down the stairs, he heard a buzzing around his ears and saw a blurry, tiny shape as it flew away from the stairwell toward the yard. He absently swatted at it with his free hand, but didn't get bent out of shape because of one stray fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exterminator's reaction had shocked Matt. He had been clearing out, but the guy must have heard or seen him. The tiny fly-boy evaded the swat, but the guy's huge hand had raked his body with air currents as it passed through the air near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he feared the toxin-toting behemoth, Matt realized the exterminator might be an unexpected opportunity. If he followed him, as a safe distance, the guy might open the door to let Matt slip back inside his lab. The transformed teen felt confident he could regain his human form and size if he could simply regain possession of the antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, instead of remaining in the jungle of a yard, Matt flew back toward the stairwell, hoping to follow the gigantic man down the steps and into his lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne problem was that Justin, still new to the job, liked to make a very thorough effort. He raked away cobwebs that had accumulated in corners for years. He sprayed streams of insecticide into various nooks and crannies in the concrete walls of the stairwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Matt buzzed in the background, impatient for the huge guy to make it to the basement. \"Enough already!\" He buzzed. \"Just go to my lab, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin got to the bottom step and faced the door that led inside to the basement. He brushed away another cobweb in the corner, this time dislodging a spider that fell to the floor and started to crawl away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Matt buzzed and zipped forward. \"This is my chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin saw the spider trying to scurry to a new hiding place, so he lifted a boot and brought it down with a crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that same moment, he heard an irritating buzz near his head. \"Should have spared that spider,\" he reconsidered. \"At least they're good at catching flies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, many people didn't consider anything about the ecological benefit of spiders, instead just surrendering to their unreasonable fear of the eight-legged creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt realized he had anticipated too soon, arriving at the door before the giant man opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin heard the irritating grow louder in his ears, then he saw the tiny fly hovering between him and the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, you little fucker,\" he said while aiming the nozzle attached to the insecticide tank on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tried to buzz past the bulky man, now desperate to get past him and to safety. His plan had turned into a nightmare. The solution was on the other side of the huge, heavy door\u2026 but he could not risk it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin squeezed the trigger to spew a stream of insecticide...</span></div></div>",

The tiny fly-boy knew he needed to escape the stairwell and get to the safety of the yard, away from this killer.

Out of control, the tiny fly-boy spiraled toward the wide lower steps of the deep stairwell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he crashed onto the concrete surface, he tried to gain control of his body.

The man was staring at the dusty steps. When he saw his target, a tiny, twitchy insect, he grinned and stepped closer. His huge boots lifted high into the air, giving Matt an unobstructed look at the wide, destructive soles. Deep in some of the tread, he saw the unidentifiable remains of other hapless bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne wing continued to malfunction, preventing Matt from taking flight again. In desperation, he tried to crawl, but the dose of toxin has also played havoc with control over his six spindly legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow of one of the boots fell over him...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stop! I'm in here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie toyed with the cleat, tipping it backwards with her toes. Anne was sent sliding until she slammed into her daughter's pudgy digits.

Now she was no longer in the position to get onto her daughter for anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie began to casually walk as if she didn't have her mother trapped under her toes. The tiny woman's body was shifted constantly with each pounding step. She grasped on to rope sized cotton strands to keep from slipping further under Kellie's foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the soccer field was unfortunately a short one. Before long Kellie began to run. The massive impacts shaking Anne to her core. Her grip quickly failed her. Despite her efforts Anne slid under the ball of Kellie's foot. If her daughter noticed the change, she didn't care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne expected to be snuffed out instantly, instead she remained intact. Somehow her tiny form withstood the assault. As the sweat oozed from Kellie's sole Anne questioned if surviving was a blessing. Gagging the ting mother tried not to swallow her daughters foot funk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time under Kellie's foot seemed to be endless. Anne had no sense of how long she had been trapped. All she knew was the repeated booms of Kellie kicking a soccer ball as she ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully though the play finally stopped. The casual walk home was almost a relief to Anne. Her daughters steps seemed like gentle whispers in comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home Kellie kicked her cleats off at the door, leaving her sweat soaked socks on. She padded cheerfully to her bedroom. After flopping onto her bed she began to slowly peel the socks off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne felt the heavy cotton pulling away from her splayed body. To her humiliation, and Kellie's amusement she was left plastered to her daughter's sole. \"Wow, you're a tough little bug.\" Kellie said as she roughly picked her mom off her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe she made it.\" Samantha said laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that whatever shrunk her, made her super durable?\" Julie asked, her eyes fixated on the tiny woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie just shrugged. \"I don't know. Maybe. Looks we get spend even more quality time together, <i>mom</i>.\" Kellie said, putting emphasis on the last word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do to her now ?\" Samantha asked with morbid curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie grinned devilishly. \"How about....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked all around him trying to figure out what was going on. It wasn't until Julie moved in front of her full length mirror that the horrible truth became clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt couldn't believe what he was seeing. There was nothing on Julie's belly, yet he was obviously there. He tried to stretch and pull as hard as he could, which only served to cause Julie to giggle,  as if she had been tickled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it.\" Matt said in shock. \"I've become Julie's belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie stopped and stared down at her belly for several moments. \"Matt?\" She eventually asked also in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several moments of silence.

It must be a side effect of the formula.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a devious grin Julie rubbed her belly. The circular motion of her hand caused chills to run through Matt. \"Do you think it's permanent ?\" Julie asked lightly tapping her fingers across Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of being Julie's belly for the rest of his life terrified Matt. \"I don't know.

Of course! Let's do it!\" Kellie said pulling Julie inside. The due ran upstairs to Kellie's room quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie pulled over her t-shirt as she entered. Matt could see Kellie getting her piercing kit ready. \"Kellie! Don't do it. She's crazy!\" He screamed, but the only person that could hear him is Julie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt cried, begged for Julie to back out as Kellie used disinfectant on the area. Strangely he realized he could taste the alcohol as it sat on Julie's skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie pinched the flesh with a pair of special pincers designed for piercing. the pressure from the plastic jaws caused a lot of discomfort for Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could only watch as Kellie placed the piercing needle against Julie skin. \"Please, God stop!\" He screamed as Kellie quickly shoved it through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Matt it felt like someone ran a machete through his face. He cried, and whimpered as the actual piercing was threaded through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie smiled down with satisfaction as she toyed with the new piece of metal. It didn't hurt her anymore than getting her ears pierced, but she knew it caused Matt serious pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did you decide now all of the sudden ? Kellie asked spraying more of the foul tasting disinfectant on Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie shrugged. \"I thought Matt might like it.\" She said with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie rolled her eyes heavily. \"You have got to get over that weird crush you have on my brother.

I still haven't heard from him.\" Kellie said, concern in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie couldn't help but smile. \"I'm sure he's around here somewhere.\" She pushed to her feet. \"Okay so, what do you want to do ?

Once I make it to your shoulder, you will know for sure.\" Thought Matt.<br>\r\nMatt made it to her elbow then up to her bicep.<br>\r\n\"Home stretch.\" Thought Matt.<br>\r\n\"Home stretch.\" Said Julie.<br>\r\nHe crawled up her bicep then to the edge of her shoulder.<br>\r\nJulie was still looking at him intensly.<br>\r\nMatt then walked along her shoulder, over the strap of her tanktop until her was standing in the middle of her shoulder.<br>\r\nJulie looked at the little fly on her right shoulder. She was speechless, scared, confused, worried and sympathetic.<br>\r\n\"M....Matt? Thats really you.\" Whispered Julie.<br>\r\nJulies eyes began to water.<br>\r\nMatt then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I cant speak.\" Thought Matt.<br>\r\nMatt looked up and noticed a drop of water coming straight at him. <br>\r\n\"SHIT!\" Matt screamed (in his thoughts)<br>\r\nHe narrowly dodged it and it splashed down in front of him.<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry Matt.\" Said Julie. \"I'm just worried for you.\"<br>\r\nMatt was still looking at the tear droplet infront of him. It began sliding down the incline of Julies shoulder and continued sliding down her chest until it dissapeared down her cleavage. Matt watched it the whole time and he noticed something. The tear left a trail of moisture on Julies skin that made out line.<br>\r\n\"Thats it! Thats how I talk to her!\" <br>\r\nMatt looked up at Julie. She was looking away from him so her tears wouldnt drown him.<br>\r\nMatt flew up to Julies face and hovered infront of her right eye. Julie looked at him and Matt could see his reflection in her pupil. Once he had her attention, he then flew to the middle of her face and landed on her nose.<br>\r\nJulie had to go cross eyed abit to be able to see him on the tip of her nose.<br>\r\nMatt used his legs to motion to Julie to lean over a little bit. <br>\r\nShe listened and leaned over until her head was over her desk. <br>\r\nMatt motioned her to say there, he flew off her nose and landed on the desk in front of her. She looked down at him with a confused look and one eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n\"You seem like you have a plan.\" She said.<br>\r\nMatt shook his head up and down to signalfy a \"yes\".<br>\r\nJulie wasnt crying anymore but she still had a tear resting on her cheek just under her left eye.<br>\r\nMatt tryed to signal her to keep crying but as a fly, he wasnt to good with charades. <br>\r\n\"Matt? I dont understand what you're trying to say.\" Said Julie.<br>\r\nMatt stopped. He looked at the tear still on Julies face. It was slow as hell sliding down. Matt took off from the desk and flew up towards Julies face. He landed beneath her eye and dipped his front legs into the tear.<br>\r\nHe then flew down to the table and began writing out a message.<br>\r\n\"B....R....I....N...G\"<br>\r\n\"Bring? Bring you where?\" Asked Julie. <br>\r\nMatt was running out of moisture. He flew back up to Julies eye and dipped his front legs into her tear duct.<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Julie winced. \"I could just get some water Matt!\"<br>\r\nMatt hovered infront of her eye and nodded.<br>\r\nJulie got up and grabbed a water bottle off her nightstand, while Matt went back to writing his message.<br>\r\nJulie opened the lid and set it down near Matt.<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" She said.<br>\r\nMatt finished up then went up to the water bottle to refill. He dipped his legs in deep and went back. After around 30 seconds he finished up.<br>\r\n\"B...R...I...N....G  M...E  T...O  M...Y  L...A...B\"<br>\r\n\"You're lab? You call the basement you're lab?\" Julie giggled.<br>\r\nMatt felt alittle embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"Okay. Hop on my body and lets head out.\" Said Julie.<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Stop moving!\" Matt was yelling at the fly personality.<br>\r\nHe manged to have enough strength to keep it from flying, but Matt wasnt to sure the fly wanted to get off Julies body. Or it would be crawling down not forward.<br>\r\n\"Matt? Where are you going?\"asked Julie.<br>\r\nThe fly crawled slowly to the other side of Julies shoulder. Until it was at the base of her neck. It crawled over the chain of her necklace, then began to crawl up her neck to the side if her face.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing you stupid fly! Stop right now you bastard!\" Thought Matt.<br>\r\n\"Matt?\" Julie asked. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\nThe fly continued his walk along the side of Julies face.<br>\r\nWith Matt fighting against the fly. It could only take afew steps at a time. <br>\r\nThe fly made it to Julies cheek, and it was there when Matt realized where the fly was taking him. <br>\r\nJulies ear?!<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? Why her ear? Are you trying to help me or something? Will I be able to speak to her?\"<br>\r\nThe fly made it to Julies earlobe. It crawled over her cardilage and stood at the entrance to Julies ear cannal.<br>\r\nMatt was astounded. Julies ear looked like a cave entrance. He could see the little hairs in her ear but couldnt see to far in because it was to dark inside.<br>\r\nThe fly then began to walk forward into the ear cannal. It walked deeper and deeper into Julies head until it finally stopped again.<br>\r\nMatt could hear Julies voice outside. She kept on asking him why he went inside her ear. But Matt also smelled something strong, he had smelled it at the entrance but not as strong as this. What wad the fly doing?<br>\r\nThen all of the sudden, Matts face went straight into a glob of waxy gunk.<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing? Are you eating her ear wax you disgusting freak?! What is wrong with you?\"<br>\r\nJulie started to feel a strange sensation in her ear. It gave her a chill.<br>\r\n\"Matt seriously what are you doing in there? Get out of my ear!\" Yelled Julie. She always knew Matt was alittle weird but thats part of the reason she had a crush on him. She didnt know he was the kind of freak that eats ear wax!<br>\r\n\"Matt either you come out or I get you out!\" <br>\r\nThe fly continued chowing down. Julie didnt have alot of ear wax but there is always that little bit you cant get. Which is more than enough for a little fly to have a full course meal on.<br>\r\nJulie had enough. She went to the bathroom and opened the drawer. She fished around the contents until she found a pair of tweezers.<br>\r\n\"Last chance Matt! I dont want to hurt you by accident!\"<br>\r\n\"Its not my fault! Please wait! I can make him stop I just need more time!\" Thought Matt. <br>\r\nJulie wasnt having it anymore. She looked in the mirror and turned her head to get a better view inside her ear. She then slowly guided the tweezers inside and brought them to where she could feel the tingling. <br>\r\nThe fly continued to eat until it stopped and turned around. It faced the entrance of Julies ear. A large hole with light pouring in, which made some details of  inner ear visible. <br>\r\n\"Finally.\" Thought Matt. \"You done now? Then lets get outta here.\"<br>\r\nThe fly didnt budge. The light at the end of the tunnel was suddenly blocked out. Then two giant metal spears entered inside. <br>\r\n\"Holy crap! Are those tweezers?!\" <br>\r\n\"We should stay here fly. Julie wont hurt us she is just trying to get us out.\" Thought Matt.</span></div></div>",

If I go any farther I could stab my ear drum. What are you doing Matt?\" Julie thought.<br>\r\nJulie withdrew the tweezers from her ear. She cleaned them off (even though her ears were pretty clean) and set it on the edge of the sink.<br>\r\n\"Fine Matt. I'm going back to you're house to see Kellie. Then she'll see how much of a freak you're being too.\" Said Julie.<br>\r\n\"Yes! Take me back to the house! You got me into this mess fly, dont screw it up now!\" Said Matt to the fly.<br>\r\nJulie put on her sandals, grabbed her car keys and walked out to her car. Matt could see the light shifting in her ear, he could hear the front door opening and he could feel her walking. <br>\r\n\"Good. She is on her way.\" He thought.<br>\r\nJulie started up her car and drove for 15 minutes until she pulled into the driveway of Matt and Kellies house.<br>\r\nJulie walked up to the door and knocked.<br>\r\nAfter afew seconds, the door opened and it was Matts mom in the doorway.<br>\r\n\"Julie? Werent you already here today?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am. I just left to grab my phone and feed the dog.\" She lied.<br>\r\n\"Oh okay. Well come on in, Kellie is upstairs in her room.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\nMatts mom steps aside to let Julie in. Completely unaware that her son is inside her daughters friends ear.<br>\r\nJulie walks up the stairs and down the hallway until she is outside Kellies room. She opens the door quickly, speed walks in then shuts it.<br>\r\n\"Julie? What are you doing? We could have been naked in here.\"<br>\r\nKellie and Julies other two friends had arrived since Julie left. They had just got off work at the local grocery store.<br>\r\nThere was Taylor, a brown eyed brunnette with a tanned, skinny body. Her hair was long and draped just padt her shoukders and was slightly curly. She was wearing a black sundress a series of pattern designs printed on it. She was also barefoot, with her high heel sandals sitting beside her fine, tight ass on the floor.<br>\r\nThen there was Sophia. A blue eyed blond with a tan, perfect sized body. She was not to skinny and not to thick. She had a body like Eugenie Bouchard (look her up). She was wearing a white tank top that was very loose on her, so her dark blue sports bra was very visible. She was also wearing tight black workout shorts that cut off midway up her thigh and a pair of white sneakers. Her hair was done back into a pony tail.<br>\r\n(Now back to the actaul story)<br>\r\n\"Its nothing I havnt seen before.\" Said Julie.<br>\r\n\"Now, you guys need to do something for me. And keep an open mind okay?\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Asked Sophia.<br>\r\n\"Kellie. Do you remember how before I left I thought their was something up with that fly?\" Julie asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You thought it was my brother.\" Said Kellie.<br>\r\nTaylor and Sophia were ready to start giggling at her but Julie gave them a \"dont even\" look. So they didnt.<br>\r\n\"Ok. Well i took the fly with me back home and I asked it again to prove it was Matt.\" <br>\r\n\"Ok... and?\" Kellie asked.<br>\r\n\"Annnnnd he did!\" Julie exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"But ummmm. For some reason... he is now inside my...ear.\"<br>\r\nThe girls all gave Kellie a confused look.<br>\r\n\"Why is he in your ear?\" Asked Sophia with a hint of disbelief.<br>\r\n\"Well um.. heh heh. He was eating my ear wax.\" Julie murmured.<br>\r\n\"Ok first: thats disgusting. And second: thats probably because its a regular gross fly.\" Said Taylor.<br>\r\n\"No its Matt!\" Yelled Julie. <br>\r\n\"Well then tell Matt to come out and say hi.\" Said Sophia.<br>\r\n\"I cant. Theres something wrong he wont listen to me.\" Julie said.<br>\r\nSophia looked at Kellie and Taylor who looked back.<br>\r\n\"Julie.. you know we love you but your just acting weird.\" Said Sophia.<br>\r\n\"Well atleast know im not lying about where the fly is. Look inside my ear.\" Said Julie.<br>\r\n\"Ok fine.\" Sighed Sophia.<br>\r\nJulie sat down on the bed facing forward.<br>\r\nSophia walked over to and sat doen beside her on her knees. Sophia leaned over to her ear. Until her eye was adjacent to Julies ear cannal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt heard the conversation but was still not in control. He could see out of Julies ear and could see the end of the bed. She must have sat down on it. <br>\r\nThen suddenly Matts view was blocked by Sophias giant breast.<br>\r\nSophia was on the bed on her knees so her breasts were infront of Julies ear. Sophia then began to bend her back to look inside. And Matt saw her breast, neck, chin, one side of her lips, and a nostril lower out of sight. Until finally her massive blue eye came into sight and stayed there, peering in. Matt wanted to move into sight, but the fly wouldnt budge, he was to deep in the ear and it was to dark. Sophia couldnt see anything in there.<br>\r\nThe giant eye then backed away and rised out of sight.<br>\r\n\"I didnt see anything Julie. Sorry.\" Said Sophia.<br>\r\n\"What? But Matt was in there! I didnt feel him leave! Where is he?\" Julie was frantic. She bowed her head and started crying. Sophia hugged Julie with a look of deep concern on her face. Kellie and Taylor joined in and tried comforting her. <br>\r\nMeanwhile in Julies ear. Matt noticed a giant pair of lips outside. It was Sophia, she was talking to Julie and had brought her head down to help in conforting her. Which brought her mouth down beside Julies ear.<br>\r\nEvery time Sophia talked Matt could see her teeth, tongue and uvula clearly. Just then.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She lifted the lid and one last time looked at the fly, frantically buzzing around for freedom. She considered letting it go, when Kellie yelled to her from the house, \"Come on Julie! Throw it out! I don't want it flying back into the house! And hurry, the guys just called! They're gonna meet us soon And Sean is coming!! He really wants to meet you!!!\" Julie's eyes lit up. Matt saw her completely lose focus on him! \"Sorry little guy! Wish me luck with Sean!\" Julie told Matt as she dropped the cup in the giant garbage can and slammed the lid shut! Within 5 minutes the girls were gone. While they were having fun with their dates, Matt was completely enclosed in a cup and trapped in a garbage can, with no way out and stuck in complete darkness. Evening came, and poor Matt was freezing. He thought he was going to die out there. He fell asleep. Around 6:00 am he was awoken from a noise. Light filled the can as the garbage lid was opened, revealing the face of his mother. \"MOOOOM!\" Matt buzzed, but the late for work mother never paid attention and dropped in a huge bag of trash in the can! It landed on the cup and crushed it a bit. Fortunately, the cups lid popped off! Matt flew out, but unfortunately, his mom slammed the lid too fast, and the impact knocked Matt out cold! She dragged the can to the curb, got in her car and left for work. Matt came too just as the garbage man grabbed the can and dumped it into the truck. Matt was buried under the trash, and unfortunately was stuck in some very sticky substance. He almost freed himself when another load of trash was dropped over him and pushed him deeper in the stickiness. It was a pile of dog poop! He started gagging. He was pressed so deep in it he couldn't move. More and more garbage fell. There was no light for Matt and he couldn't move. A few hours later, all the trash was emptied at the dump. Matt was buried so deep. He cried. Fortunately he was dislodged from the poop, but was still covered in it. One of his wings were ripped off and stuck in the poop. He was in pain, but he saw light. He went towards it and finally made it to the top layer. There was air! There was freedom! He tried to hop along when he fell into a cup half filled with old milkshake. He was stuck again! The cup was bent at the top, so he couldn't see much light! The more he moved the deeper he got stuck. Then a loud familiar noise came back! Another truck came to dump the trash, and it was right above the cup he was in. The trash fell, forcefully compressing all the trash beneath it, including the cup Matt was in! A large, heavy can landed right on the cup and crushed it flat. The milkshake oozed out a bit, and Matt was squashed completely out of existence. The harsh reality is that Julie was about to let the fly go, but because of Kellie mentioning Sean, she got sidetracked by a crush. </span></div></div>",

She told her friends to go on ahead of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving at the pool she made her way into the locker room to change. She hadn't spotted Kellie or Julie, but knew there were running around somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling exhausted, and ill she undressed,  and pulled on her new one piece bathing suit. Letting out a sigh she rubbed her eyes before shoving her belongs into a locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned for the door, her steps sluggish. \"What's wrong with me?\" She muttered under her breath. Barely able to take another step Samantha's vision darkened as she fell unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samantha regains consciousness she feels pressure over her entire body. With no light penetrating where she was confusion washed over her. \"What the hell ?\" She asked, as she sat up, pushing the strange feeling material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling forward she hoped to find some way out. She felt like she was in a collapsed circus tent made of some sort of cool, squishy ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha felt unusual rhythmic tremors, like heaving drumming radiating through the ground. She assumed someone had brought music, and was playing it very loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha?\" She heard a unbelievably loud voice call out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not in here\" another voice boomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly recognized her friends voices. She felt both relieved and confused. \"Guys. I'm right here. Something fell in me! Help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where she is ?\" Julie asked, moving further into the room. She glances down at a random discarded bathing suit on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was getting more, and more confused if that was even possible. The tremors started again, this time louder. She continued to push her way from under the material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People are so gross.\" Kellie said, moving towards the discarded bathing suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie, Kellie?!\" She called out. Ahead she saw light breaking in. With a rush of energy she forced her way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world seemed to slow down as Samantha's brain tried to understand what she was seeing. in front of her towering above her was Kellie's right foot. Five pudgy digits, moist from already being in the pool wiggled menacingly. Samantha slowly craned her head back to try to see the full height of her now gigantic friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be real.\" She whispers to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie appeared beside her, her moist feet causing an audible smack. Samantha realized they were both looking down at the ground. Not at her, but at her bathing suit. This was her best chance at getting their attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie! Kellie!\" She called as she waved her arms. She noticed a strange feeling just as their eyes locked in on her tiny form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before she could even react Julie pushed them out of the walk way. She could only cower, and scream as the rubber soles of the flip flops flew past her like speeding trains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart racing faster than should be possible Samantha stood in shock for a few moments.

Using her tiny size to her advantage she quickly bound down the stairs. As she hopped from tread to tread she heard someone moving in the lab. \"I hope Matt is here!

She rummaged through her bag, and pulled the container out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie popped the top off to make sure it was still alive. Samantha called up to her friend fruitlessly. \"Okay, good.

It was long, rough, with unkempt nails paint green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange to think but Samantha recognized the giantess based solely on their foot. Craning her neck up to see the girl's silhouette in the sun Samantha knew this was Karolina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarolina was best described as a 20 year old who was born in the wrong decade. Everything about her was very hippie, flower child. Samantha and her friends would always avoid the strange girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother series of quick tremors reminded Samantha that Karolina was never alone. Turning around Samantha saw the outline of Gwen towering above her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was very similar to Karolina, and the pair were rarely seen apart. As she knelt down Samantha could see the giantess' ever present camcorder. The device was clutched steadily in her hand as she scanned the ground with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see anything yet ?\" Karolina asked, her massive barefoot shifting in the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha backpedaled away from the gargantuan digits wiggled just in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I see a really weird one right in front of your toes.\" Gwen said, zooming her camera in on Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barefoot giantess bent down to see the strange insect for herself. Samantha was frozen in fear as she realized the giantesses were focusing their attention on her vulnerable form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi there little guy.\" Karolina cooed softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's body was trembling uncontrollably. She wanted to run, but was frozen under the gaze of Karolina's piercing green eyes. She couldn't take her eyes off of the giantess as she swept her shoulder length red hair behind her right ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what it's like to be so tiny.\" Karolina mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down with her index finger outstretched. Samantha finally found the ability to move again. She scurried backward but was overtaken by the car sized tip of Karolina's finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout adding pressure the giantess was easily able to hold the tiny fly girl immobile. Meanwhile Gwen adjusted to get a good shot of the insect's struggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel your teeny-tiny legs tickling my finger buggy.\" Karolina said with an amused tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess adjusted her finger behind Samantha as her thumb slid into place. Gently pinching the bug Karolina brought Samantha into the air. She then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Karolina dropped the tiny fly girl into her awaiting right foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed on top of Karolina's monstrous bug toe, just behind the nail. The skin was dry, and dirty, with lightly colored hair at the knuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Samantha could even Karolina playfully wiggled her toes. The minuscule fly girl was bounced across the giantess' long digit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a vice like grip Samantha grasped onto the hairs on the second toe's knuckle. She held on tightly as Karolina wiggled her toes more aggressively to dislodge her little play thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not playing fair buggy.\" Karolina pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarolina raised her foot upwards, leaving her heel on the ground. She wiggled her toes in the air before slamming her foot back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact shook Samantha to the core. Her grip held, but barely. Unfortunately Karolina was already lifting her foot again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the foot hit the ground again Samantha was toss between the second and big toe. Karolina spread her toes wide sending the fly girl into the ground below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha screamed as the toes fell down around her. They arched over like fallen buildings. \"Stop!\" She cried out, but was unheard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen held the camera at ground level. She zoomed in on the tiny bug as Karolina playfully tapped her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess shifted her foot off of Samantha. Looking down she wore a satisfied grin. She raised her foot all the way off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha cowered as the rough, calloused ball of Karolina's foot repositioned over her. It lowered down slowly, but raised up again. She heard menacing giggles from above as the giantess toyed with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot slammed down next to her without warning. The impact sent dust into the air around the fly girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the dust could clear Samantha saw Karolina's toes above her again. The big toe was held above her as Gwen adjusted for a new angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting her foot on the ground Karolina smiled as she held her toes over the bug. When Gwen was in position she quickly dropped her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha barely had time to brace as the gigantic pad of the big toe slammed down. The impact pressed the rough flesh into Samantha. her body creaked in protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as fast as it fell the toe lifted. Samantha was alive, but could no longer move. She  could only stare upward as Karolina brought the toe down again for a second quick tap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three more taps Samantha was nearly crushed. Still alive, but suffering horribly Samantha watched as the foot raised into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarolina repositioned her foot over the insect. With a powerful stomp she felt the bug crush under the ball of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twisted it back and forth before raising it back into the air. Grabbing her ankle she held her sole skyward. Gwen zoomed in on the tiny insect carcass splattered across the dirty flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one was very fun.\" Karolina said with a smile. \"Let's find another one.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Taking a deep breath she slapped her foot down. Nearly as quickly she hopped back away from the insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha screamed as the plump, soft ball of Kellie's foot shot down. The impact pressed her into the tile for only a fraction of a second. The hard chitinous armor covering most of her body prevented her from being turned into paste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie laughed wildly at her friend's 'bravery'. \"Oh, you're so tough.\" She said flexing her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellie scowled at Julie. \"I did it didn't I. You where too scared to.\" A smug smile stretched across her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked down at the still twitching bug. \"Uh-huh. Good job.\" She said, clapping her hands with a mocking rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the bug still alive drained the smugness from Kellie. She rolled her eyes. \"Let's just see you do better then.\" Her hand gesturing towards Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body cracked, but not broken Samantha tried to ignore the pain to stand. Somehow she hot her legs under her. Wobbling, but not falling Samantha turned towards the bench for safety. she knew her friends wouldn't recognize her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie narrowed her eyes staring down at the bug as it attempted to escape. She closed the distance between her and the bug in only a few steps. Towering above the injured insect she  brought her right foot up above. With a glance, and a grin to Kellie she stomped down with force. She felt the bug crunch under the ball of her foot.

Anticipation turned to frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I need more.\" Matt theorized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swiftly returned to the jar for another intake. Repeating the process he returned to the table to wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen nearly ten minutes past with the same lack of results Matt began to panic. \"What if it doesn't work ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew there was always a possibility of failure. There always is with experimental. \"No! This will work!\" He proclaims confidently before repeating the process again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime and time again he drank the antidote, and waited for it to work. After a dozen attempts Matt simple let himself float in the blue liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing more depressed with the lack of growth Matt began to fear this form was a permanent one. \"I'm trapped as a fly forever.\" He said completely heartbroken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his oblivious state Matt hadn't noticed someone entering the lab until a shadow cast over the jar. </span></div></div>",

Wake up!\" He screamed, without buzzing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant obviously didn't hear him, but that didn't surprise Matt. All he heard for too long when he spoke was buzzing insect sounds. Despite still being roughly half an inch tall Matt felt confident that he could return to full size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his new combination of fly wings, and human hands Matt hoped to escape the plastic container. He flew to the ceiling above, and tried to force open one of the small lids.

Matt was practically ready to jump out of his friend's pocket as the antidote was pulled from the refrigerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy set Matt on the table while he poured some of the antidote into a small plastic cup. Matt was literally salivating as he reached for the cup. Without hesitation he chugged down the bucket sized cup of antidote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty slow, painful minutes past before Matt shot up to six inches tall. \"Yes!\" He screamed with pure joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy poured another cup for him to down. A few hours of incremental growth began. Eight inches, then twelve. Around the twelve inch mark Andy brought him a cloth to cover himself with. Matt was soon nearly two feet tall, and able to drink from the jar on his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly wanting to drink enough to return to full height Matt only took in about a quarter cup at a time. By now he was able to wear his own lab coat, although it was a bit baggy still. After taking one final sip Matt watched with glee as he grew the final few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stared at himself in a full length mirror for several long moments. He was beyond ecstatic to no longer be a fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you might actually be an inch taller.\" Andy pointed out with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shrugged. \"I deserve an extra inch after what I went through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're back buddy, but never do anything this stupid ever again!\" Andy said with a huge grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt lowered his head. \"Yeah, I know.

Matt hated to say it, but he felt like she was way out of Andy's league. To this day he still wondered just how he landed someone so beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instinct to hide bubbled up inside Matt, but there was no where for him to seek cover. Instead he decided to try for Beth's attention. she was always nice to him, he didn't seen any reason she wouldn't help him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Beth! Over here!\" He called out as he banged on the plastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Andy, Beth wasn't mostly asleep. She turned to investigate the tiny noise. Her crystal blue eyes widening as she spotted the tiny Matt. \"Oh my God.\" She mouthed in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please help me!\" Matt cried out, unsure if she could understand him through the plastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked confused for a few moments before groaning. \"Andy told me what you guys were working on.\" She said. \"I just can't believe he tested the formula out on you.\" Her lips twist into a half smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Matt shouted, equally annoyed by her misunderstanding, and that Andy blabbed to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked shocked little guy. Andy and I don't have any secrets.\" She said playfully tapping the side of the container. \"Although, he didn't mention shrinking you. Maybe he wanted it to be a surprise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt couldn't believe what he was hearing. Beth actually believed Andy shrank him, and trapped him in this container. \"Andy didn't shrink me! This is all a misunderstanding!\" Matt screamed desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth pursed her lips together as she narrowed her eyes. \"Uh-huh, sure tiny. Then why are you stuck in this terrarium? \" she asked not believing Matt's pleas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed, and rubbed his temples. \"I tested the formula on myself, it turned me into a fly. Andy caught me and brought me here unaware that it was me!\" He yelled up, realizing how insane it sounded as he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth just rolled her eyes, and groaned. \"Do I look stupid to you ?\" She asked leaning close to the container. \"Andy definitely would have a good reason for shrinking you. Knowing how selfish you can be, he probably got fed up with you treating him like a lucky.\" She said accusing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was very quickly growing anxious. He took a step back away from the plastic wall. \"Then just leave me alone, until Andy gets home. He'll prove I'm right.\" He said, knowing that his friend would clear this up, and help him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth glared down at Matt. \"And risk him kowtowing to you like always. No, I'm taking you with me.\" She said pulling the lid off the container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tried to run but Beth's manicured fingers grasped him effortlessly. For a while he was feeling large compared to his former size. Now he felt small, and powerless in Beth's enormous hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This punishment starts now tiny.\" She said dangling Matt by the ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on the edge of Andy's bed Beth used her free hand to pull off her fur lined moccasin. Matt could barely manage a scream before Beth deposited him inside. The moist, hot air was instant gagging. A not so gentle shake sent Matt harshly into the toe box of the moccasin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the plush accommodations tiny.\" Beth mocked before her meaty toes appeared inside the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the foot slid forward Matt did the only thing he could, he laid down flat as her toes crawled over him. His entire body was wedged tightly under Beth's toes as the moccasin was pulled over her heel. Matt writhed as he attempted to reposition himself as best as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth callously dropped her foot to the floor and stood. Her toes wiggled mercilessly on top of Matt. Immediately she began to walk, the impacts sharing Matt to the core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tiny prisoner under toe Beth grabbed what she came to Andy's for and left.

He knew she would be on her feet for the better part of eight hours. \"Let me out! Please Beth!\" He cried out, writhing under her heavy toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without being able to hear his cries Beth responded to his movements. Effortlessly clenching her toes she immediately put an end to Matt's protest. As she walked inside the Denny's she continued to put extra weight on her right foot with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed slowly inside the shoe for Matt. Minutes seemed like hours, the hours like days. No matter how much time passed by Beth never seemed to grow tired of toying with him. As she stood at a booth taking orders she constantly tapped her foot. Each rise and fall of her toes shaming Matt to his core. Occasionally she would pop her heel out of the moccasin allowing cool fresh air to enter. This was a blessing, but also caused the sweat Matt was soaked in to congeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Beth sat down in the back for her lunch break. Matt felt her toes clench around him before she pulled off her moccasin. She plucked Matt from under her toes with her left hand, dangling him roughly by his ankle. \"Bet you wished you treated your friends better now?\" She said mockingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand! Just call Andy, please!\" Matt cried out as he hung upside down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's eyes narrowed as she leaned into Matt. \"Shush, I didn't say you could speak.\" She said in a low threatening tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry giantess mercilessly dropped Matt back into her sweat soaked moccasin. As her foot shot down Matt frantically scurried towards the toe box. To his horror he never made it before her clammy sole rolled over him. Dropping her heel in place Beth trapped a splayed Matt under the ball of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pushed to her feet Matt screamed into the matted fur insole. Her meaty flesh molded around him like putty. Somehow as she took her first step Matt wasn't crushed. Through the intense pain Matt realized there must have been more side effects to the antidote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove Beth was shocked that Matt wasn't crushed under her foot. This unexpected development only excited her further. With her new toy under foot she returned to work eager to finish her shift.

His entire body protested movement as he slowly pushed back to his feet. He craned his neck up to see the still towering Beth above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared down at him with a crooked smile. \"You're a very comfortable insole.\" She said. \"It definitely made being on my feet all day more enjoyable.\" Her toes wiggling excitedly as she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth, you've had your fun. Please just call Andy!\" Matt called up, still hoping to return to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth rolled her eyes before effortlessly knocking Matt back with her big toe. \"Maybe I'll call Andy soon,\" She said lowering her big toe onto Matt's chest. \"But you have to so something first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt groaned as her toe pressed down with more and more pressure. \"What's that ?\" He croaked out as loudly as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her toe off of Matt, Beth set her still sweaty feet in front of him. \"You're going to worship me, starting with my feet.\" She said. \"Kiss my feet, now.\" She ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt struggled back to his feet. \"What!? Are you insane ? I'm not kissing your disgusting feet!\" He protested defiantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation Beth's foot shot out hitting Matt with extreme force. The tiny teen was sent tumbling across the floor. Before he even came to a stop Beth was on top of him. He looked up in time to see her rough heel lowering down. \"Wait! Stop!\" He screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his cries Beth set her heel down on his entire body. She added more and more pressure as she twisted it back and forth. \"You're pretty tough Matt. Do you think you could handle me stomping on you right now?\" She asked, raising her heel above Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, don't stomp on me, please!\" He screamed out knowing he'd be crushed instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's foot drop next to Matt's cowering body. \"Kiss my feet, and call me your Goddess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegrudgingly Matt crawled over to Beth's feet and began kissing the salty flesh. \"Thank you for not stomping on me Goddess.\" He called out between kisses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth stared down in pure excitement. She was elated to have a tiny foot slave. \"Lick them.\" She ordered, giggling as she felt Matt's tongue run across her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt wanted to scream in anger, but he knew Beth would end him. He continued to obey her commands as if she was a Goddess. Because until he could come up with an escape plan she might as well be one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth grinned widely as she watched Matt. \"Okay, now that we've established the proper pecking order I think I should....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was the voice of Matt's older brother, Shawn, who was home from college on break. Shawn and Shawn's friend, Trey, had just returned from playing basketball at the park nearby. Shawn was the jock of the family, tall and well-built. Trey was about the same size as Shawn, who was six foot-two and about 190-200 pound weight range. Shawn was 19, and Trey was probably about the same age. Both of the young men were still sweaty from their game, both wore sleeveless t-shirts. Shawn wore dark green basketball shorts, an oatmeal gray sleeveless tee, and a well-worn pair of high-top Nike 'Air Force Ones', which were white with gray. Trey wore a white tee, navy blue shorts, and a pair of low-cut 'Nike Shox' running shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn and Trey reached the basement and stopped. They looked around. Shawn saw a pile of Matt's clothes on the floor. \"What kind of freaky @#$! is he into now?\" Shawn snorted. \"Hey MATT?? Dude, where are you?\" Shawn's baritone voice called out. \"There's no one in here, man.\" Trey said, still looking around the lab. The two 19 year old jocks stepped toward the pile of clothes, their sneakers bumped on the basement's concrete floor, oblivious to a strange little bug, trying to dodge their footfall. Shawn crouched and picked up Matt's jeans. He pulled the wallet out of the back pocket. \"Dude, don't just take the money from him!\" said Trey. Shawn opened the wallet and snatched out a $20 bill. \"He ain't here to ask.\" Shawn wanted to borrow money from his brother. \"Hell, the little dork owes me more that this! He's the one trying to borrow money from either me or mom and dad for his goofy science crap. In fact...\" Shawn went ahead and took out another $10 bill, leaving Matt with just $6. Shawn dropped the jeans back on the floor. \"Don't know what the kid does down here. Thought he was just a nerd, but hell, looks like he totally stripped naked. Man, I don't even WANNA know!\" Shawn continued, as he put the money into his own wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn then stepped over to the work table, where Matt had all of his lab material scattered. Shawn began to snoop, flipping notebooks. Trey stepped over to an old phonograph, the one with the big horn for a speaker. \"Man, this is older than hell. Where did he get this?\" Trey asked. \"Dunno. Some yard sale. He's a nerd. He collects things like that. Uses the parts for his geeky projects I guess.\" As Shawn finished flipping through the notebook, his hand bumped a jar of iron fillings. It fell from the table and broke on the floor with a loud crash. \"Aw @#$%!\" exclaimed Shawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice move!\" Trey said sarcastically, chuckling. \"Shut up!\" smiled Shawn, punching Trey in the arm hard, but in a good natured sort of way. Trey pushed back, and the two young men wrestled around for a bit, not paying much attention to the 1/2 inch tall creature, so close to their colossal shoes. After the young men were down horsing around, Shawn walked around the basement, looking for a broom and dustpan. He found one. Shawn then kicked aside Matt's clothes and was about to sweep up the iron filings and broken glass, scattered everywhere...</span></div></div>",

He felt tremors...these tremor shook more and more, until Matt was nearly knocked over. Two colossal pairs of feet stomped down the steps and across the concrete floor. The sneaker soles of the giants bumped along the floor, dull and heavily. Soon, the terrified Matt was looking up the toe of his brother's colossal Nike 'Air Force One' high top. The sole alone was twice as tall as Matt was! To Matt, Shawn and Trey towered like skyscrappers hundreds of feet tall. \"SHAWN!! SHAWN!!! TREY!!! DOWN HERE!\" Matt cried frantically, he ran up to his brother's sneaker sole and banged on it. But it was no use. Poor Matt was far too small to be heard or seen. Just then, the shoe lifted, as Matt was thrown back. Matt saw his brother crouch down and grab his clothes. And Matt saw Shawn grab Matt's wallet and swipe the money. \"HEY!! HEY!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?? DON'T STEAL MY MONEY, YOU JERK!!\" he ran toward his brother, but then stopped cold. He slapped himself in the head, \"Stupid! What can I do. Like I can stop him. I don't think I could stop him if I were my NORMAL size!\" Matt was frantic...he can't believe he got himself into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt saw his brother and Trey snoop around his lab, his sanctuary! \"STOP IT! YOU GUYS, STOP. GO AWAY!\" Matt whined. Matt sat down on a pencil that was lying on the floor. He had tears. Matt knew he couldn't live in the world at this size for long. He had never been so scared in his life. Suddenly, a loud BANG!! Matt was knocked clean off of the pencil and thrown back on the floor. The force of the jar of iron filings falling knocked the tiny teenager off his bearing. He laid flat on the floor on covered his head. Thank God none of the gigantic shards of glass landed on him. Several iron filings covered him, but they were light weight. \"Oh @@#@$%!\" exclaimed Matt. \"My stupid brother is going to wreck my whole lab!\" Still worse, Shawn and Trey were wrestling around. Trey's massive Nike running shoe nearly stomped poor Matt. Matt began to run for cover. \"Those big @#$%^ idiots are going to stomp on me yet! It's like Gozilla and King Kong going at it!!\" Matt yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Matt horror, a massive object cut off his path. He looked up...it was the biggest broom he had ever seem!! The bristles towered several stories! And the broom was coming toward him. There was no way he could outrun it. The massive broom caught Matt up among the iron filing, glass, and other debris on the floor. Matt hung onto the bristles for dear life. Meanwhile, Shawn swept up the mess into a pile. Then, Shawn grabbed the dustpan and brushed the pile onto the dustpan. Meanwhile, Matt's strength was waning. He couldn't hold on any long. He let go, and fell right into the debris that was swept into the dust pan, just as Shawn set the broom aside and picked up the dustpan. The trash can in the basement was heaping full, so Shawn carried the full dustpan upstairs to the kitchen trashcan. Shawn and Trey climbed the steps and into the kitchen. Shawn stepped on the pedal that opened the trash can lid. The tiny teen in the debris was horrified. He tried crying out: \"SHAWN!! I'M DOWN HERE! DONT' THROW ME AWAY!!\" But it was useless. The half-inch tall teen was now soiled and totally blended in with the iron and dirt in the pan. In fact, if anything, his soiled-dark color made him look more like a bug and a tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt everything slide at a steep angle...\"AHHHH!!!\" cried Matt, as he landed in the almost-full trash can. Fortunately, a balled up wad of paper towel broke his fall. The last sight Matt saw was his brother's face. His brother spit out a wad of gum, and then, everything around Matt went black as the lid slammed shut. Matt lay still for a moment. As his eyes adjusted to the dark, he got up and tried to find a way out. He overheard his brother outside say something about taking the trash out. Matt stumbled around in the dark. Suddenly he tripped over something and landed in something warm, wet, and extremely sticky. Mat knew what it was...it was Shawn's gum. Matt swore and he tried to free himself...</span></div></div>",

Then he heard footfall leading to the stairway, and then clatter of giant shoes hitting each step. Matt was left in the dark trash can all alone, and as time passed his eyes continued to adjust to the dark. His mind turned the objects in the trash can with him into mysterious creatures, and he was becoming even more terrified. Eventually he tried moving again, but alas he was stuck in place by his brother's chewed gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly can he hear from the basement Shawn screaming, \"WHOA, DUDE WHAT JUST HAPPENED!!!???\" Matt was confused as to what was going on. He heard Shawn say something, but couldn't distinguish it. Then his brother yelled \"MATT, IF YOU'RE SHRUNK, COME OUT. I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIND YOU.\" \"So Trey must have shrunk,\" thought Matt. After a while of Shawn searching around the basement, Matt heard him slowly come up the stairs. Shawn must have been watching each of his steps. The footfall came closer to the garbage can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Shawn lifted the lid of the trash can, Matt involuntarily closed his eyes to protect them from the great light. Shawn muttered under his breath, \"Man, I must have swepted him up.\" Matt hoped that Shawn would see him attached to the chewed up gum, but his titanic brother's eyes glazed right over him. Suddenly two hands reached out and began shifting the objects in the trash can. Matt was tossed up and down as his brother searched. Eventually Shawn's arm pushed aside a paper near Matt, and got stuck to the gum in the process. Suddenly Matt went into vertigo as the gum moved with his brother's arm. Shawn reached out to pluck away the gum, but as he touched it he noticed that it felt funny. He took a closer look at it and realized that he had found his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MATT,\" Shawn exclaimed! \"I'm so glad I don't have to scrap you off the bottom of my hi-tops!\" Suddenly Shawn stood up, and reached out for a miniature half-inch Trey that was on the counter. He put both of them into the palm of his hand and told them, \"Don't worry guys, I'll take care of you both as we figure out what's going. Until then, I'm not going anywhere near the basement, as I like being the big man around here. For now, we can make a home for you two.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With his brother and friend in tow, Shawn made the journey upstairs to his bedroom. Upon entering, Trey and Matt were petrified by teenage smell of Shawn's room, which at their magnified scale became a miasma to their noses. Dirty clothes were strewn across the floor, with countless pairs of used socks that reeked of sweat to be found. Shawn went over to his dresser, which was mostly bare save for a deodorant stick and a couple of basketball cards, and placed his two new miniaturized dependents down. Shawn's voice boomed over the two, saying \"ALRIGHT, GUYS, I NEED TO FIND A PLACE TO KEEP YOU. I NEED SOMETHING THAT WILL BOTH CONTAIN YOU TWO FROM WONDERING AND KEEP YOU SAFE.\" Both Matt and Trey gave him a thumbs up, and Shawn left to scourge his room for somewhere to hold them. Matt became walking around the dresser, deciding to get a closer look at the larger-than-life objects. He was absolutely astounded by the sheer size of the basketball card that was next to him. The name of it read \"JAKOB POELTL,\" and the thought that something that was normally a minor object instead was dwarfing him give him a shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching through his entire room, Shawn grew frustrated that he couldn't find anywhere to place his brother or friend without suffocating them or keeping them in the dark. Just when he was about to give up, he looked down at his feet and saw his two Nike High-top Air Force Ones. Then it hit him: he could just keep them in his shoes. The opening of the shoes could provide ventilation and a way to bring light down, and the largeness of his feet meant that the two of them would have plenty of space. The nature of the high top also meant that it would be nearly impossible for either one of them to climb out. He also had other high-top shoes that could be used instead, so that way the two could be kept home whenever he went out. He walked over to his dresser, and spoke above the two insect sized people, \"I GOT AN IDEA. YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE TO FOLLOW IT, OKAY?\" Both Matt and Trey gave a hesitant nod of approval. Then, Shawn sat down on his bed, untied his high-tops, and took them off. Both Matt and Trey were still waiting for Shawn to pull some sort of containment out when he shocked them by standing up, putting the opening of his shoe to the edge of the dresser, and motioned for the two to jump in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Matt saw that Shawn intended for him and Trey to live in his high-top, he immediately decided to resist at all costs. But Shawn was persistent, and given his much large size, was able to get his way. Shawn's massive hand descended upon the two and swept them into the high-top. Both Matt and Trey fell directly into the shoe, and once they hit the bottom they were confronted with sweat that oozed out. \"Oh man, this is nasty!\" cried Matt. Trey tried to communicate with his giant friend by yelling, \"The smell is awful, man!\", but his voice was too weak for Shawn's ears to pick it up. Shawn then walked over to his closet, sat his pair of Nikes down, and told his miniature captives, \"DON'T WORRY, LITTLE GUYS. I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU. SOON I'LL FIND A YOU WAY TO GET YOU TWO BACK TO NORMAL.\" Then Shawn got up, walked over to his bed, pulled out his phone, and started to research a plan to try to reverse the shrinking effect, only to fall asleep within a couple of minutes. Matt and Trey were left to loaf around their new, foul odored prison to talk about how they shrunk.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt and Trey spent what felt like eternity waiting. Hearing the loud snores, they realized that Shawn had fallen asleep. But about an hour later, the titan awoke. Scratching his head, Shawn checked his phone that was sitting next to him. He had received a couple of messages from his friends. \"MAN, WHAT WAS I DOING?\", he questioned. Sitting up, he realized that his mind was blank. Then he thought of shrunken Trey and Matt, only to deduce that it was some strange dream. He walked out to the bathroom to splash water on his face, with each of his footsteps being heard like thunder to the minuscule ears of Matt and Trey. Shawn went back into his room and texted his friend Brandon to see if he wanted to shoot some hoops. While waiting for a response, Shawn grabbed his favourite game shoes, the Nike Air Force Ones. Unbeknownst to him, Matt and Trey were in his right shoe. First, Shawn began putting on and tying up his left shoe. By this point, his brother and friend figured out the giant's oblivion. Acting quickly, the two insect-sized boys run to the toe section of the high-top. Thankfully Shawn was still groggy from his sleep, so they had extra time to reach the ending. Both Matt and Trey watched in horror as a massive athletic socked foot descended into the chamber. Instantly the potency of the stench multiplied exponentially. Matt knew that Shawn had the habit of reusing socks without washing them, and with their luck this bad boy's been out for a while. The sock, which was so massive it seemed like a monster to the two, moved quickly towards them. Right when it was encroaching, it suddenly stopped. The two shrunken teenagers were so close they could reach out and touch Shawn's building sized foot, but the little gap in which they existed meant that they would be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step Shawn took, Trey and Matt were subjected to a thrilling ride. Up-down-up-down they went, and were able to hear in great detail every minuscule noise Shawn took. Eventually Brandon showed up, and Matt and Trey got the experience of being a fly on the wall as the two titans conversed. In the dark prison, the two insect teens heard everything from conversations about girls, slams of car doors, burbs, until they finally heard the bounce of a basketball. Both the dribble of the basketball and the squeak of the shoes created a dissonance of sounds that forced them to cover their ears. But the longer the game went on, the more Shawn's feet sweated. The humidity inside the shoe skyrocketed, and the temperature became hotter than an August afternoon. In addition to the mugginess, the sweat accumulated so much that both Matt and Trey felt like they were swimming in Shawn's perspiration. Shawn and Brandon played for another two hours, which seemed to pass on like an eternity for the insect-sized teens. At some point a mutual friend of Shawn and Brandon, Connor, showed up, and the group continued their fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the three titans were finished playing basketball, they all headed back to Shawn's house to relax and hang out. The three of them put their feet up as they watched some pre-season football, but inside Shawn's shoe was Matt and Trey trying to balance themselves on Shawn's toes. Brandon and Connor both wanted a soda, so Shawn told them to help themselves from the fridge in the basement. Trey and Matt gulped when they heard the unaware jocks descend the wooden stairs. Then, over the sound of the TV, Matt could hear what sounded like whipping noise. \"Those two imbeciles must be playing with my clothes!\", cried Matt. Suddenly, they hear Connor yell, \"WHOA, WHERE DID YOU GO?\". Then, within a minute in typical fashion, Connor shouts, \"SHAWN, YOU GOTTA COME DOWN HERE! BRANDON JUST DID A MAGIC TRICK!\". Grumbling, Shawn gets up off the couch, sending his two captives in motion hitting the walls of the shoe. Heavy footsteps on each wooden step ringed in Matt's and Trey's hears. \"WHAT\"S UP MAN?\", asked Shawn. \"LOOK AT THIS!\", replied Connor, who then handed Shawn a miniature Brandon that waved upward. Connor continued, \"HE POINTED ME TO RIGHT HERE. CHECK THIS OUT, BRO.\" Then Connor reached out to touch the red shrinking solution. Shawn, realizing what was going on, tried to shout, \"NO, DON'T DO IT!\", but was cut off by the instant miniaturization of his basketball friend. He then walked over to Connor's clothes that were on the floor, and shuffled through them until he found his insect-sized friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both tiny Connor and Brandon in hand, he tried to jog his memory. He knew that both Matt and Trey had shrunk, but he couldn't remember where he put them. He went into his room, put his friends on his dresser, sat down, and tried to figure out what had happened and what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Help me! Please, look down!\" Matt implored. \"I'm here! On the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Shawn's well-worn pair of high-top Nike Air Force Ones hit the basement floor as he stepped off the bottom step. For little Matt, the result was worse than any earthquake. The impact of a simple footfall knocked him off his feet and flat on his butt. Before the insect-sized youth could get back on his feet,  Trey's low-cut Nike Shox running shoes landed on the basement floor and triggered a second massive aftershock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants continued to stomp through the lab, and they also found Matt's discarded clothing. As the half-inch tall guy watched, they pawed through his belongings, even stealing money from his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified of getting stomped, however, Matt could do little more than try to avoid the gigantic sneakers. He thought the worst was over when one of the titans knocked the jar of iron fillings off the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fraction closer, the impact would have obliterated the tiny man. As it was, Matt was so frightened by the close call that he could barely move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the shrunken teen saw something that gave him the motivation to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis towering brother had grabbed a huge broom. \"I BETTER SWEEP THIS %^&amp;* OFF THE FLOOR, OR I WILL CATCH IT FROM MY NERD BROTHER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bristles swooshed across the floor, sweeping everything, the iron fillings, shards of glass and one unseen tiny teen, into a tidy pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrey helped out his buddy by grabbing a dust pan and holding it on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn swept the mess onto the dust pan, which Trey lifted.\"WHERE'S YOUR TRASH CAN, MAN?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnoticed, tiny Matt tried to climb through the piles of debris. He waved his hands over his head and screamed. \"No! Shawn! Please, I'm here! Don't toss me out with the garbage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn answered in a booming voice. \"TOSS IT INTO THE GARBAGE CAN...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy, then, did everything look so unreal? He had trouble focusing his vision on the enormous laboratory. His computer, distant on a mountainous desktop, loomed at the edge of his horizon. Shelves and counters looked like natural features of some majestic landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap!\u201d Matt exclaimed. \u201cHow small am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and saw a pile of clothing on the floor.

The cracks between floorboards looked as wide as he was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not even an inch tall!\u201d Matt exclaimed. Without a more reliable way to determine his height, he estimated he must be about an eighth of an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m no more than a speck!\u201d Matt said aloud. His colossal surroundings swallowed up his tiny voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo earlier tests had indicated such a dramatic shrinkage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he had proven that his formula worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all he wanted was the antidote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d His voice carried a hint of panic. He titled his head back and gazed toward the distant jar with the pale blue liquid, the antidote to his shrinking formula. The jar far, far out of reach on surface of the skycraper-sized table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt goosebumps rise on his bare skin. \u201cOh crap!

He soon ascertained he was still trapped in the jar. He looked around. He saw Andy standing overhead. His friend looked like a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndy!\u201d Matt stood and waved. \u201cHelp! Let me out of...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt fell to his knees and felt like his head might explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a huge pole burst through the metal jar lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHERE!\u201d Andy said. \u201cDON\u2019T WANT YOU TO SUFFOCATE UNTIL I CAN SHOW YOU TO MY BUDDY MATT.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM! BAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy drove a pencil twice more into the metal jar lid to make sure the weird bug would have enough air for the trip back to his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, in real pain, fell to the glass surface beneath his feet and slipped back into a numb limbo.</span></div></div>",

It was starting to get hot in the jar from the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy managed to find what he was looking for, a magnifying glass. Matt's heart jumped with excitement. Andy might actually be able to recognize Matt if he looked at him through that.

He carefully positioned the magnifying glass between the sun and the bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt realized that something was wrong. He had seen Andy position the magnifying glass, but it wasn't between Andy's eye and Matt. For some reason he had placed it between the window and Matt. Matt was starting to sweat from all the exertion that he had been doing. Suddenly it was very bright and very hot. With a yelp, Matt realized what Andy was doing. He quickly dived out of the pillar of light and heat. The paper where he had just been standing blackened and crumpled up. Smoke was rising from the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy laughed as the bug tried to escape. He followed it with the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt quickly got up and ran.

He had a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy watched and followed the bug, highly amused by its antics. He had done this with other bugs before, but they hadn't been nearly as entertaining. They had pretty much just run in a straight line until Andy had gotten bored with them, and toasted them. This was though was at least making things interesting. Part of the trail behind it even looked like Andy's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy stopped concentrating on the bug and the magnifying glass and looked closer.

Hey, Ted.\" Andy's voice booms from above.  Matt recognized the names.  He knew them from school, but wasn't really friends with them.  Since they lived near Andy, they had become friends and hung out together whenever Andy wasn't busy with Matt - mainly for sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play some ball?\" one of the other giants asked.

I wanted to look at it before I gave it to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" and that was the end of it.  Andy lowered the jar to the ground, making sure to keep it upright so the little bug couldn't escape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, once he recovered from the downwards motion, pressed himself against the glass and was terrified to see the 3 titans looming over the jar.

Andy was taller than Matt and more athletic, but Matt was more academic. Despite their differences, they'd always stuck with eachother through thick and thin. But Matt had no idea how Andy would react in this situation; Andy was fun, but he was also mischevious and sometimes didn't know when to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt dashed as far as he could, resisting the limp in his leg. He had escaped the shadow of the crane-like hand of his best friend, though, not for his speed. Andy had probably lost sight of the speck that Matt was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven once Andy's palm had stopped eclipsing the basement light (which was like a sun), Matt kept running. He churned his legs until he nearly collasped, having travelled perhaps twelve inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was convinced he was in a safe place under the basement table, he began to breathe: first heavily, then panting. It blew his mind how much he had run and how little he had traversed. He looked up at the titan in his basemment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy's palm, which Matt had had a close encounter with, seemed to have been like a footfall field. Each of his fingers were thicker and taller than trees and he couldn't help but think of the way that one could easily crush him out of existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould he trust Andy to help him, or would his garagntuan friend only be amused by the situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Matt could have no idea from now. Andy might even never know. He would have to attempt to get to the antidote himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt took hold of a side of the desk. What looked so smooth from normal view was now full of things to clutch and various footholds. The rough wood hurt to climb up. This was an extreme sport that Matt didn't even think Andy would enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Andy had gotten comfortable to wait for his friend.

I'LL BE OVER AFTER SCHOOL. TALK TO YOU LATER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's concerns were not the history project. In fact, he wouldn't have minded if Mr. Szaneck flunked him for the rest of his life -- as long as  he was normal-sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb was going to be impossible.

The force of the air he was falling through was mighty and Matt felt like his movement was rough and interupted over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's mind worked even as the ground rushed up at him. Because he was so small, he wasn't falling right through the air, he was sort of falling *over* it. Like somebody falling down steps, Matt tumbled and fell and regained his footing as he fell through the air. It was nauseating, but slower than falling at average height; Matt knew he would survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had his eyes shut to reduce the pressure of the wind against his eyes, but he opened them for a minute. He was greatly surprised: He saw a gargantuan white cruise ship in a concrete sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Matt made the connection. He was going to land on his best friend's shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made contact with the Adidas sneaker softly, considering what the fall had been in proportion to an average fall. He lay there, silent, trying to recover from the shock of his life. He had just experienced what was equivalent to a more than 3000 foot drop. The wind was knocked out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground beneath him began to shift. It was a rugged white landscape, with huge wall-thick ropes latched all over. Behind him, the tongue of the shoe loomed like a mountain. Matt couldn't believe that this new \"world\" he was on was just his friend's shoe. He was struck with a miserable lack of self-esteem: Here he was, the size of a gnat, clinging to his best friend (who had become a god)'s shoe (which was also bigger than the block Matt's house was on. Andy thought he was some meaningless bug and was going to kill him for fun, under his foot. Matt felt so humiliated and humbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoe shifted only a couple of inches, but it was enough to throw Matt off his legs. He thought he had hurt his leg; it hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked at the tongue of the shoe, which seemed to be a mountain. But above it, Andy's jeans hung like a beanstalk to the clouds. But it wasn't the clouds: it would only lead to his thigh. Above that, was Andy's torso and head. He couldn't believe how huge Andy was. It was completely incomprehensible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have to climb it, he realized. To get his friend's attention, he would have to get to Andy. He hoped his friend would just stay still. </span></div></div>",

He was a bit tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yawned loudly and stretched out his arms behind him, cracking his knuckles and arms. He tilted back in the swivel chair, propping  up his long legs and large Adidas-covered feet on Matt's desk. He stared absent-mindedly at the moniter, then his gaze moved to his resting white Adidas. Andy's eyes lingered there for a moment - he thought he'd seen something - and then he let them drift away. Was Matt going to get here or what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Matt had taken a step to climb over the tongue of the Adidas shoe, the entire world turned upside down. And then right-side up again, and soon Matt was lost in a whirlwind of movement. To him, Andy's Adidas was the Earth and the Earth was moving. A lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground began to fly though the air, and the pressure of the air suddenly coming down on him was unbelievable. He was pushed onto his back and stuck into place as thousands of winds attacked him, knocking the air out of him and holding him against a moving landscape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the instant that the universe had shifted, it stopped. Lack of centripetal force meant that Matt was no longer bound; he noticed that the Cruise Ship Adidas had up righted itself. Matt would have fallen into Andy's ankle, but a tree-trunked size rope suddenly hung out of place: a shoelace. Matt, with eyes shut, grabbed the shoelace in midair and swung an inch before letting it go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt soared away, about an inch above the surface of the desk; equivalently, he was very high. He hit the desk roughly, and rolled once. His nose was bleeding, but otherwise, he was suprised that he had survived. The compacting of his skeleton hadn't made him invulnerable, not anything near it, but it had made him more enduring. For the first time, he was glad he'd been shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt lay, battered, on the cool surface of his desk for a minute without moving. He started breathing slowly, gaining more and more breath as he found he was able to stand. His vision was blurry, but focused and he realized where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, he found that he felt very insignificant. He stood in the shadow of the sky-scraper sized tennis shoe of his best friend. In sports and physical activities, Matt always felt like he was in Andy's shadow. Now, of course, he really was. Matt felt incredibly inferior: If Andy's foot was a skyscraper, Andy himself was...monumental. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Here was this little creature, I mean, his best friend, in his hands. He wasn't sure what his agenda was, exactly, but he knew he wanted some fun first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people would be shocked. Andy had already been shocked and now he was curious. That was the essence of his personality - he was always calm. Mischevious, yes, didn't know when to stop, yes, but frantic? No. That wasn't Andy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned way back in the chair, re-adjusting his feet around the computer to get more comfortable. \"SO,\" he blasted into Matt. \"HOW'D YOU GET SO SMALL ANYWAY, LITTLE BUDDY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pun didn't evade Matt's mind, but he decided that it was best to ignore it. He didn't want to think - or even consider - that his friend would be difficult. Because Matt was the opposite of Andy. Matt got frantic..a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt amused Andy, now, as his rice-sized friend began to leap around, waving his arms crazily like an ant in a parade. He was screaming something, but Andy could barely make it out. He knew that Matt had some speakers around here that he could hook up (actually, they were within his grasp), but Andy wanted to take advantage of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHHHHAT WAS THAT, MATT? I CAN'T HEEAR YOU!\" Andy said these things breathily. He watched in amusement as his friend was physically pushed down by the force of his breath. \"WHHHAT'S WRONG? IS MY BREATH BAD?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was. Matt was too small, but Andy wondered if he was tearing up from the scent. He squinted. Matt was kneeling down on his hand, pointing to his nose and shaking his head. Andy knew he was hurting his friend, but he was just joking right? It was funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, trying to figure out what to do next.</span></div></div>",

The high walls and floor were spongey; they felt like felt. But they were so indundated with Andy's foot sweat, the same sweat that Matt was stepping in like a puddle. He was so nauseated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Andy just kept on smiling down at Matt in his shoe; he was enjoying this too much.

He deposited Matt into the front pocket of his own dark-green shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed to himself again, but he wasn't speaking to anything but the wall of the shirt.

Get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe authorities had been notified when Matt was missing for twenty-four hours, of course, but Andy wasn't going to be dropping any hints to the police. In only seven days, Matt had quickly gotten used to the flow of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis world was Andy's bedroom and any other place that his master saw fit to put him. Twice, Andy had left Matt at home (in a secure place) but he preferred taking Matt to school with him. Where? Wherever Andy. Today he was in a shirt pocket, but he had spent a days in Andy's pants pockets, clinging to a hair on his head, in a  hollow necklace around Andy's neck, and even in Andy's sneaker, pinched into place, with the company of two toes rising up on either side of him like hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy still lived his day-today routine normally, though pretending to look sad that his best friend Matt was \"kidnapped.\" Andy knew that his pet depended on him for survival, and it was that fact that Andy relished. Matt ate from Andy's hand. Matt did whatever tasks Andy desired: math homework, and Andy enjoyed how much Matt struggled to perform calculations when the printed numbers were the same size as he. He would perform for Andy, doing small things to amuse what seemed to him like his new god. Andy would even torture Matt with his socks and sneakers, and that was the worst punishment (but certainly not the least used). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was in a horrible state. He has been shrunk naked, but Andy had provided him with a small toga to wear. He smelled like Andy's sweat and his face was covered in food that he ate sloppily. He had not yet felt himself succumbed to the mental state of a pet, but he was worried. Everything seemed hopeless -- he was incredibly insignificant next to titanic Andy. He felt there was nothing he could do, but live day to day on Andy's wishes. Either that or dive off Andy's hand thousands of feet to the carpeted floor, but Andy would probably catch and punish him.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now was not the time to think about would-be escape-attempts. 7:30 AM.

Andy hadn't exactly been the most hospitable person towards him, had he? He'd belittled and teased him. And this was Matt's best friend; he couldn't believe that Andy was frustrating him so much, on purpose or on accident. Maybe Andy's older brother would be more mature about the situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought lingered only a millisecond longer in Matt's head. He had to give Andy a chance, and if he got worse, then maybe he'd go to his brother as a last resort. Then Matt saw Andy's brother and decided that he'd go to him as a *last-last-last resort.* If Andy was godly, his brother was universal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy's brother, Jake, was home from college and was twenty-one years old. Andy was close to his brother; they both excelled in sports. But he didn't want him to know about his discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt dove randomly backwards when he saw the shadow pass over him. He slid along the counter before feeling his back bump up against a white ceramic skyscraper: a sugar bowl. Matt scurried behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy made small talk with Jake (small talk, the irony didn't miss Matt) for a few minutes before his brother vanished out the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PHEW, THAT WAS CLOSE,\" Andy said, and then the that trademark grin was upon his face again. Matt was about to come out from behind the sugar bowl when Andy became impatient and grbbed him. His enormous fingers seemed as if they would crush Matt. He braced for the impact, but that was when Matt realized Andy had licked his finger. The saliva touched Matt and when Andy pulled his finger away, Matt found he was stuck. He was completely powerless aginst his (ex?) best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy set him back down on the edge of the top of his soda can. To Matt, the pop tab looked like an enormous diving board and the hole was a lagoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'MON MATT,\" Andy urged. \"LET'S PLAY A GAME.

Andy brought the can of soda to his lips, and the current - along with tiny Matt - began to float into his truly gigantic cavernous mouth. But that didn\u00b4t bother him that much. It was his best friends\u00b4 betrayal. He has known Andy for years, and he thought that he could trust him. But this behaviour of Andy, this betrayal of one of his few friends almost brought tears to his eyes.<br>\r\nThe soda was washed over Andy\u00b4s enormous wall of teeth and floated directly toward his throat. Matt, being hurled around in the cold soda, knew that trying to swim back was impossible. He watched how he and the soda passed Andy\u00b4s uvula and floated down his throat. As a side effect of the formula, he was actually able to see inside the normally dark throat, but honestly, he didn\u00b4t really want to see the slimy red esophagus. So he closed his eyes during the fall. After a few seconds, he reached a hole that opened and squeezed him and the soda into Andy\u00b4s stomach. With a wet plop he landed in soda and - that\u00b4s what really frightened him - stomach acids. The stomach was really large, and there was no way to climb back, but obviously, there wouldn\u00b4t be much time for Matt to think about it, as he would die soon.<br>\r\n\"No. I won\u00b4t die inside a traitor!\" Matt shouted.<br>\r\nHe was prepared. When he created the shrinking formula, he knew there could be some unpleasant situations, just like ending up inside someone\u00b4s stomach. He took out a syringe with a greenish serum in it. He had no time to test the serum, but did he have a choice now?<br>\r\nIf I ever get out of here and back to normal, I should be nominated for a novel-prize. A groundbreaking discovery in modern medicin.\" he thought to himself. This serum was able to make the human skin resistent to the most threatening acids, but he had no idea whether there were any side effects. He injected the serum into his carotid. Seconds later, he began to scream in pain. His body began to burn, but not because of Andy\u00b4s stomach acids that were now surrounding Matt. He writhed in pain, but then the burning suddenly stopped. Did it work? There was only one way to find out. He jumped into a pool of acids, and surprisingly, it didn\u00b4t hurt him. Good, now he had to think of a way out of Andy\u00b4s body.</span></div></div>",

He was upset, and actually coming up with a plan was harder than he liked... Andy had swallowed him like he was nothing! ...and that was a problem... he virtually was nothing. Even if he got back out of Andy's stomach, what would he do? He was no more than a pathetic grain of rice and what would keep Andy from trying to get rid of him again... or worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed to himself. Andy and him were so close. Did he really think so little of him this whole time? Or maybe... maybe it was just a power trip? Maybe he was feeling guilty now for what he did? Maybe if Matt got back to normal he'd apologize profusely and they could... no... Matt didn't think they'd ever be friends again after this. After all, as far as his ex-friend knew, he was committing murder as Matt sat in his tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes passed, then the little teen decided it was time to make his escape. He had two options- the throat or... well... the back door. And like hell he was going to give the bastard the satisfaction of that option! So he carefully began his ascent. His biggest problem was getting back through the sphincter at the top of the stomach, but once he got past that it was just a matter of climbing. One step up at a time. He got about halfway and took a small break. He felt insanely lucky that Andy hadn't gotten thirsty again yet, or started eating or something. Matt sighed again and started to begin the climb when something started happening- his body started burning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Andy was sitting back in his chair and rubbing his stomach. The idea that Matt, his best friend from forever, was slowly digesting in there and becoming his food was intoxicating. He didn't know if he felt remorseful or guilty for his friend. He didn't know if he felt happy, evil, or anything at all. All he knew is that there was a <i>person</i> in his stomach. A teeny, tiny person who would be a part of him... giving him nutrients. It was food for a <i>god</i>. And that's all he felt. That he was godly to Matt and that Matt was lucky to be sustenance for his god. That was the only feeling he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is... until something itched in his throat. He coughed a little but the itch turned into something worse- before Andy knew what was going on he was choking and doubled over. His airflow was blocked and he was trying desperately to spit it out. \"It.\" He knew exactly what \"It\" was! Somehow Matt was doing this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy couldn't get the blockage- or Matt?- out by coughing (given that he couldn't cough anymore) so he quickly threw himself to the floor and forced himself to throw up, and all at once the soda and the little human snack spilled onto the ground. The 'godly' boy collapsed onto his side, coughing, gasping, and trying to fight back tears. When he regained his composure he looked to see...</span></div></div>",

It was always a little bit of an annoyance... trying to get Andy to pay attention to him, or the assignment they were working on together, or the game they were playing... Andy would always proclaim 'So!' with a mischievous smile on his face and change the topic entirely. But it became more than an annoyance in the basement when tiny Matt was sitting in his godly hand; <i>\"So! How'd you get so small anyway, little buddy?\"</i> pounded through Matt's body like a sonic boom. It wasn't an annoyance, it was a change of fate. In his semi-conscious state he had realized that was where everything had changed. No longer was he Andy's friend, but something to be toyed with or gotten rid of as the giant pleased. That was the point of no return for their friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quieter now, though. It didn't rip through his body like before. It was still booming, but it was much more bearable now. That's when Matt remembered what had happened in the giant's throat. As he was climbing, a side effect from the acid-proof serum he'd injected himself with had made him grow considerably. He was still quite small but he was big enough to clog Andy's throat up, but it was certainly an improvement from being a speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"SO!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh hell, he remembered hearing it... he started to open his eyes as he was scooped up into Andy's big hand. Then he started struggling, \"N-No! Andy! Let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy was amused to know he could hear him now, but he ignored him and continued. His cheeks were still red from the tears and picking up the little guy from the mess wasn't something that pleased him, but he forced a smirk anyway, \"You just <i>had</i> to come back out, huh? I'm going to assume that means that you don't want to leave my side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and carried Matt to the sink. He stuffed a rag into the drain to make sure Matt wouldn't go anywhere, then filled it up a little and put Matt in it so he could get clean. He didn't care if Matt really wanted to or not at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!\" There it was again... \"Since you want to be with me so badly, I'll go ahead and give you the chance to apologize for choking me and pledge yourself to be my pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shivered in the water. Not because it was cold, but, well, because of the fear he was starting to have of Andy. He weighed the options very quickly- he couldn't leave Andy waiting for him for too long and he knew it. He could submit and hope that Andy would be kind, or maybe that he'd be able to escape... or he could refuse and see what punishment Andy might give to him...</span></div></div>",

Once he was up and running though, four very important thoughts raced through his mind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) He was bigger now. One of the side effects of his acid-proof injection must have been extreme growth! Things still looked endless, but now he could make out furniture (and people) much easier than before. Which also meant they'd be able to see him much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) The floor was slippery because of the nasty expulsion of the soda from Andy's stomach... and he wasn't getting very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) He was slippery because of the nasty expulsion of the soda from Andy's stomach and that was not only just plain gross but it might make it harder for anyone to catch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd 4?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy was getting up now and wiping his mouth off on his sleeve. He could worry about cleaning and washing up later! Right now he had to catch Matt. He worried if he didn't the little pest would find someone else and tell them what was done to him. But more importantly, if someone else found Matt, they may just keep him for themselves! And Andy wasn't going to let anyone else have him without a fight. Maybe it was the need to protect his little friend and maybe it was the ideal that he was Matt's god and he should be taking care of him... whatever it was he didn't care. He quickly got up and attempted to grab the now much more visible little Matt.</span></div></div>",

Through the wrinkles of the aluminum gum wrapper, you can see that Andy\u2019s brother Joe just came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in his usual soccer attire, you find him struggling to make it in the door. With the temperature in the triple digits, he came in all hot and sweaty. By the looks of it, it seems as if he was playing hard, and got covered in dirt from head to toe.  This is kind of surprising for a Jr. High soccer team; you thought that practice could not be THAT intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy interrupted Joe\u2019s groaning and grunting as he entered the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the looks of it, it seems as if you had a hard day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, coach made the whole team work on endurance today for two. I had no problems with it, but the others made me trip and fall so I was slower. I HATE MY TEAM! But that\u2019s not the worst of it. We had to work on our abs afterwards and boy, let me tell you. After the first 100 you get kind of tired\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Joe made his way over to the counter where you sat, rubbing grumbling his stomach as he was talking.You knew that after exersise you got tired and hungry too. The rumbling was so disturbingly loud that it actually caused you to shiver a bit, and serve as a reminder as to how small you really are.  Andy started to go into a silent panic and immediately got in-between the counter where you lied and Joe stopping his advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know if there\u2019s ANY food left in the house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a few snacks, but you look tired.

I\u2019ll make you something\u2026 special\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks bro, I\u2019ll be back right after my shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe still unaware of your presence suddenly threw his soccer bag. Unfortunately it looks as if it is heading right for you, but thankfully it falls short and lands on the floor.<br>\r\nAndy watched Joe leave the room and go upstairs to the bathroom where Joe closed the door. Then through the sound of the wall above he could hear water starting to run.<br>\r\nNow Andy\u2019s attention was back on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well!

Dashing in and out of the refrigerator, he placed many more things on the counter. You still could not see what it was so you decide to get a better look. Moving out from your tin like metal shelter, you decide to move a little closer to the edge of the counter to get a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling across the tiled plain you find out how small you really are. Staying inside the grooved surface of the grout you slowly move to the edge of the counter. Looking to the left and right of you were the tiles themselves which extended into the sky like small single story homes from your perspective.  You constantly thought about a bug or a spider you would run into but fortunately you never did. Finally reaching the other side, you climb up onto the blue tile surface and sit there staring back towards Andy. Before you could get comfortable, Andy walked over and stood right next to the counter that you were sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still couldn\u2019t believe his size. You lived in several cities with large sky scrapers but Andy was still the largest building you had ever seen. His muscles were standing out even more, but it was hard to tell if it was because of your perspective and not the protein shakes he recently started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy picked up the gum wrapper you were sitting under, but much to his surprise, you weren\u2019t there! Andy slowly lifted up his shoe to see if he accidentlly killed you, but was a little relieved when he found nothing. Lowering that foot, Andy lifted the other and found nothing but a few grass clippings. Soon his attention returned to the counter. Franticlly searching, Andy kept looking and searching around the counter for any sign of you. Soon enought, Andy\u2019s eyes finally detected your microscopic-like body contrasting the blue tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHERE you are! Don\u2019t scare me like that! I\u2019ll be right back; I just need to get some cola out of the garage. Don\u2019t go anywhere else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy stormed out of the room and into the garage leaving you alone on the counter. He was obviously in a hurry to make it back before his brother came back down from his hot shower. However these distractions were not why you moved yourself closer to the edge.

Don\u2019t worry, you will get your pizza Matt, I\u2019ll make SURE of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy\u2019s stomach must have heard the word pizza. As if on cue, it suddenly let out a large rumble causing you to stare blankly at his abdomen. You were imagining what lay just beyond the tattered t-shirt, the very thought of if made you feel once again very small and for whatever reason extremely nervous. This grumble was a true indicator of an empty stomach, empty and ready for all new entrants and many different kinds of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems as if, I\u2019m a little hungry also\u2026\u201d said Andy, \u201cMight as well get these Pizza\u2019s cooking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Andy warmed up the oven and placed the frozen pizza on the pizza stone. Carefully placing the pizza onto the center rack of the rickety old oven, Andy closed the door, set the timer, and brought back his attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we play a game Matt? If you can get out of this container, before my little bro comes down to eat, you win! Consider this a game of survival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy already had in his hand a small metal container with glass for shredded cheese. He lifted it up and shook it in front of your face highlighting that it was definitely that container. Matt, in total shock that his friend is now treating his life like some sort of game, backed up a few steps and looked at this massive and irregular shaped object. The cheese was surrounded by glass walls curving outwards making them impossible to climb from the inside. The roof was no better being covered with holes in a stamped press designed for a limited amount of cheese to come through. This would be an impossible task to do, so realizing your options; you decide to franticly run back to the safety of your metal shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly out of the sky, you see Andy place the unscrewed lid somewhere next to you causing your whole world to shake. Losing your footing, you trip and fall on one of the imperfections in the tile. After, regaining your balance, suddenly there is another and much harder thud, but this time right in front of you. A beige colored fleshy hand abruptly appears but it represents more than a wall than a hand from your perspective. Without any sign that Andy would let you go past that hand, you turn around and run towards the edge of the counter. Then your worst nightmare came true. Andy started to slide his hand and push your microscopic body at an alarming rate towards the side of the counter. You rapidly got tunnel vision and all you could focus on was that ledge. You realized there was nothing you could do to resist Andy\u2019s plot and allowed Andy to throw you off of the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds into freefall, you opened up your eyes and looked up at the face of your former best friend. But as soon as you got a good glimpse gradually glass walls appeared and you landed on a powdery substance which cushioned your fall substantially but it did smell of a common cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal. Since I have no idea, how you were shrunk in the first place, I have no idea how I would even begin to help you with returning to a normal size. Hell, no one even knows you\u2019re shrunk other than me! So while I was out and in the garage, I decided that you, Matt, are going to be too much to handle on a day to day basis. Sooooo\u2026 I decided to come up with a game that involves you walking away from this situation in one piece, or you will serve one of our bodies as extra calories! If you survive getting out of the dinner table alive among our hungry, cavernous, stomachs, I\u2019ll try to keep you alive. But if you disappear and I cannot find you, I\u2019ll think about you when I take my next shit. That\u2019s all you really were as a friend to me anyways, a shitty one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was absolutely confused. He helped Andy work on his science homework many of times, and you always offered to tutor, but what does Andy mean by shi- Oh. I see now. I\u2019m in a pizza topping and if I cannot get out of here before they add me to their food, I\u2019m done. Well that sucks and being turned into shit is even worse\u2026I don\u2019t even want to imagine that slime pit of a stomach.  \u201cMake the best with what you got I guess\u201d I said to myself. I have to get moving and work quickly if this is to ever work!<br>\r\nAndy walked over to the small dinner table and set you and the container down in the center and between two plates and the bottles of Dr. Pepper, and you immediately got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet the games\u2026 Begin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScraping the cheese like sand, you tried to create a tall mountain of cheese to help propel you out of this hell hole. Working tirelessly you slave away at your only chance for survival and your way out, when you are interrupted by\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Andy now satisfied that you knew your own fate, moved back to the oven to check on the pizza. The aroma from the pizza had already filled the room with its fragrance of bread, sauce, mozzarella cheese, and pepperoni. Andy now looking into the oven discovered a perfectly cooked pizza just begging to be eaten. The crust had risen to an adequate level and the cheese was a beautiful plain of oranges and yellows found on most restaurant style pizzas. Noticing its completion, along with the help of an audible cue from the timer, Andy pulled the delicious pizza out of the oven and set it on the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, still sweating from stress in the small glass container was gradually making progress and was closer to getting out, but it was becoming progressively harder to place more and more on the top of the edible mountain. Gravity was working against him. Matt could always climb down the man-made hill to get more material, but every time Matt climbed down and back up, he caused miniature landslides to occur, similar to those caused on a sand dune. However Matt did not care that he had to do extra work to get out of this place. All he wanted to do was to get away from the hungry jock\u2019s stomachs and away from all the food with Joe on the way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy wanted to let the pizza sit out and cool for a bit before he served it up.  So he walked away from the oven and sat down in one of the chairs looking into the glass chamber where his shrunken friend laid. Smirking and smiling into the glass, he saw Matt slaving away trying to save his own life, but noticed how far he was from his goal. Andy saw this as being kind of cruel to put someone in a situation where they could do nothing to save themselves, but he found it to be the perfect way to dispose of a former friend. And finishing that thought, Andy lifted his head from the table to see Joe following the trail of delicious smell to the freshly cooked pizza to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm\u2026\u201d Said Joe, \u201cPepperoni is my favorite kind of pizza, and this has to be the best thing to settle this hunger. I\u2019m starving, serve me some pizza bro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this, Joe sat down at the accidentally bumping the leg of the table. This sudden earthquake was not the thing Andy was expecting during his construction of his escape! Similar to the homes in California, his mountain slowly collapsed into nothing. His futile attempt at freedom was short lived as he watched his work disappear into a perfectly level plain. Seeing his whole work lost with one casual and non-deliberate bounce to the table, Matt lost all hope at escape and figured that someone would have to help him out. After dusting the cheese off of him, he turned his attention to the outside world and noticed that Joe was now sitting at the table waiting to eat a delicious pizza. However due to the quality of the glass, his vision is slightly blurred and foggy due to the years of abuse in the dishwasher and handling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy took both plates over to the counter and loaded them up with individual slices of pizza. Then placing them on the table, Joe and Andy immediately got to work devouring the pizza, trying to quickly satisfy their hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Matt\u2019s perspective he could see them eating the pizza, but he had no clear view of everything that was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMmmmm\u2026 Deeeee - licious! Now this is what I call a pizza! But it does seem to be missing\u2026. Something\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you see a hand wrap itself around the glass and you are lifted upwards into the sky. Then your whole world started to shift around you and you found yourself sliding. Working against gravity and from the current of cheese flowing beneath your feet, you do your damn best to make sure your still in the bottle, and not on the entree. Unfortunately Matt\u2019s valiant efforts go unrewarded as your chamber is shifted vertically, causing him to slide out from his glass prison and fall in free-fall towards the pizza below.<br>\r\nStill clambering and screaming in plain slight as he fell, went unnoticed in the open air. Rather than focusing on the landing below, you decide to look up and see who\u2019s including a little extra meat with their slice. You cannot believe your eyes when you see\u2026.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slipping through the tiny holes, you were finally free of the oppressive glass prison. However being added to a main course generally is a huge problem. As you looked down below, you saw the slice of steaming hot and fluffy pizza lying below to cushion your fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou along with the cheese that fell out with you soon landed on the pizza. The impact was hard enough to send you down a few feet in your perspective into the crust. Looking around you saw the surrounding terrain of a typical pizza. From the rolling hills of cheese, to the endless seas of tomato sauce all of which helped to create your new found horizon. Among the cushiony terrain surrounding the pizza slice, you also noticed many individual pieces of freshly cooked pepperoni extending into the sky like small apartments. But being on the pizza was not the worst thing in the world. Given enough time, you think it would be possible to struggle out of the mess you were in, but looking above you saw Joe, a hungry teen with an appetite for YOU! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreshly out of the shower, Joe had yet to put on any clothes yet other than his Calvin Klein white boxer briefs outlined with red stitching. When he sat down, the ruby red label became level with your horizon, and enveloped your new view.  Looking up towards the god like figure sitting in front of you, you find his soft looking blond hair which helped to complement the marble textured blue eyes. Water was still dripping out of his hair and onto his torso, running the course of his well-built muscular maze. Following the smallest of drops, you couldn\u2019t help but notice the other features of the muscular body. His belly button helped to contrast the many hills and valleys of his six pack abs.  Even when he was not flexing, those muscles were built up enough to stand out on their own quite well. He never really had to tan his body, as his sport gave him a tan that made many others quite jealous. The lean teen body was obviously ready for food as Matt continued stare at Joe\u2019s torso when it made another yet another gurgling noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe being none the wiser of your presence picked up the pizza and placed it in front of his cavernous mouth. From your perspective, you saw the god like figure lick his lips anticipating the delicious slice, and saw many watery strands of saliva starting to form on his tongue. Before you even had a chance to scream, Joe parted his teeth and slowly brought the first part of the pizza into his salivating and expansive mouth. Slowly biting into the piece, Matt watched in horror as his teeth got to work on the chewing what must be acres of pizza. Seeing his deadly fate in sight, Matt tried his best to pull himself out of the pizza, but every push or pull into the melted cheese only made him sink deeper <br>\r\ninto the crust. With no one other than Andy knowing he was there, his odds were pretty slim at escaping as he was situated in the middle of the slice. You tried to turn around to see if Andy was looking but a set of glasses were in the way. Feeling a sudden acceleration, Matt returned his attention to the first slice of pizza, still going through the trash compactor of Joe\u2019s mouth. From Matt\u2019s standpoint he couldn\u2019t imagine what it was like inside of those lips, but it was a place Matt wanted to avoid in its entirety. Soon after, the chewing stopped and Joe\u2019s office building sized tongue moved the food to be swallowed. A sickening gulp followed and Joe\u2019s mouth was empty once more for new entrants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was absolutely horrified. As the giant\u2019s mouth opened, Matt could see the uvula dancing back and forth wildly from the last swallow acting as a guardian of the slimy dark hole below. The ball at the back of the throat looked as if it could easily knock anything down and into the slimy and dark abyss in a simple swing, but Matt would soon find out. Joe, still not satisfied that he has had enough pizza, pushes more pizza into his awaiting mouth and slowly bites into the next part of the slice. The giant incisors came to a rest within a matter of feet to Matt\u2019s perspective. If he was a little higher up from the cheese, he could have reached out and touched the solid white teeth! Much to Matt\u2019s relief, he was not on that bite. Shortly after tearing through Matt\u2019s entire horizon, the remaining pizza was pulled away from the mouth as Joe began the defining and destructive process again. Chewing over and over and finally swallowing, you came face to face with your fate. As Joe\u2019s mouth slowly opened you could hear the stomach accepting the new arrival of pizza with yet another groan. You look into the mouth and find remnants of the last bites still plastered to the molars and saliva running everywhere. Welcomed with a blast of hot air from his breath reeking of pizza, you are slowly pushed forward towards the cavern of doom; where there is no way out you can possibly escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe was finally ready for the next bite. Slowly he brought the remnants of the piece along with you and started to push your new-found world into his vast mouth. No matter how much swimming through the cheese help your situation, you tried anything to get out. Looking out ahead of the piece, you could see the tongue dancing waiting for your arrival. As you looked up, you could see the bleached white incisors passing over you like massive icicles in a frozen cave.  Now fully enveloped inside Joe\u2019s mouth, you felt a cushioned thud as the pizza finally rested upon his tongue. Realizing that there was no way you could possibly escape, you turned around to view the outside world. Looking out towards the shining light beaming in from the small holes in Joe\u2019s mouth you noticed it was closing quickly. This could only mean one thing. Matt braces for the worst as he knew that Joe was about ready to chew.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A lack of light from the outside world made it hard to see inside the fleshy walls, but you didn\u2019t need sight to remind you where you\u2019re at.  Still trapped inside the piece, you found yourself inside a prison of teeth and hot human flesh. Before you knew it, Joe started to slide you and your piece towards the car compacter like teeth. Devoid of hesitation, Joe started chewing the piece into a pulp like any other piece of food. On the first bite, he nearly missed you by a matter of inches, but the second one you were not so lucky. With the help from saliva and the loosened material from the first bite, you were dislodged from your place among the cheese. As Joe was shifting the food, a quick flick from his tongue assisted you to land on top of unrecognizable chewed remains stuck between one of his molars. Unfortunately for you, Joe had no plans on slowing down his deadly chewing machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an even faster bite, you were left with no time to react as the set of deadly teeth from above came crashing down on you. Pressing you hard between the molar above and the pizza remnants below caused you to break nearly every bone in your body causing you to temporarily lose consciousness. It was a good thing too, as Joe continued to chew without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon waking from the blow, you find yourself compacted into a pancake of pizza mostly dislodged from the tooth. Seeing the oceans of grease and seas of saliva lead you to look for the remains of the food. You thought they were already on their way to the stomach, but on a second glance the pulverized remains of the pizza were resting on the back side of his fleshy tongue. His slithering monstrous red tongue started to traverse the double set of sterling whites for any traces of food in Joe\u2019s mouth. It swirled around the dark cavern and eventually the wet fleshy pad quickly found your pitiful life. Like a magnet, the saliva assisted to lift you from the tooth. Within seconds, the pizza and your bloody carcass were carelessly tossed towards the rest of the remains in the back of the slimly throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding in the pulp, Matt\u2019s body left an impression which was similar to one found at a crime scene. Matt, barely being able to turn his head, looked out from the mushy mess and saw a horrifying sight. What was terrifying him as he was lying outside the mouth, was dancing above only a matter of feet from Matt\u2019s head dripping hot, smelly saliva onto his entire body. But Matt\u2019s realization had to be subsided as other worries came into mind as he saw the remaining light be cut off by the tongue. Lifting from the front first, the massive muscle twitched with joy as it jarringly tipped you and the rest of the pizza into a position to be easily swallowed. No matter the effort, with every bone in your body broken you had no way to even protest your situation. Accepting your final fate, you look upwards to see the fleshy walls of the throat close up on you and drag you downwards. An amplified and wet \u201cGulp\u201d echoed throughout the expansive chamber, as you travel down towards the rugged and putrid stomach.<br>\r\nWhat felt like an eternity, you heard the same stomach noises you heard earlier but this time they were louder. A tremendous rumble and vibration from that growl echoed through your piece as you arrived at the point of no return, the rugged muscle of the stomach sphincter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short free fall caused you to drop into the stomach landing on the partially digested remains from the first bite. Inside of the dimly lit chasm the stench of stomach acid provided a deadly mixture of breathable but rancid and stale air. You saw the fleshly walls around you churning and dripping the slimy and potent stomach acid onto its new guests with ease. Matt couldn\u2019t believe it. After all of the work down in his lab to finish a working shrinking potion, he never thought he would end up like this. He still couldn\u2019t believe his eyes, or ears, or nose. He was actually inside of a healthy, fit, and athletic teenager whose body won\u2019t make the distinction between him and any other piece of meat! Matt, encompassed by a loud noise from below caused him to pause his train of thought.<br>\r\nWith more rumbling, he felt whatever it was in a waving motion as it passed by. It was gradually getting quitter until it made a turn for what you assumed to be Joe\u2019s backdoor. What rattled Matt\u2019s world was quite simply a gas bubble moving around in Joe\u2019s large intestine which was only a sign of healthy digestion. Matt already knew there was no way out of this hell hole but he did not need to be reminded that he would most likely end up as hot air, or a skid mark on those Calvin Klein boxers. With a tingling sensation in Matt\u2019s skin getting stronger and stronger, he knew that the putrid stomach acid was looking for him! But thankfully before Matt would go through his own digestion, Matt heard another gulp which was most likely a new slice of pizza was on its way down. Without being able to move, Matt was laying right below the trap door as the new slice slithered in from the fleshy tube above. Dropping right where Matt was laying, he was immediately buried, smothered, and crushed by the load which proved to be the final blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every piece, Joe added on excessive amounts of cheese literally emptying the container by the last slice. Every slice continued the same pattern and traveled through the same dark hole.  Eventually the teens plowed through the remains of the pizza leaving no crumb behind.   Andy followed the last slice of pizza passing through his brother\u2019s mouth. He knew that somewhere at some time, Matt had lost his battle staying alive and got a one way ticket to a full digestive tour. After Joe swallowed the last bit of pizza, he gave his lean teen stomach a good rub as he looked at Andy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn! I think they added a little bit more meat to these pizzas! I\u2019d wish they would add more cheese too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy smirked at the irony of the joke; after all he was quite pleased with himself. Although neither Andy nor Joe would have any idea what Matt went through, a solitary digestion awaited. Even though Joe was unaware of Matt\u2019s presence it didn\u2019t matter. To Joe\u2019s chiseled body, he was simply more meat and fuel for a high calorie demanding machine. The deed was done, and that was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Andy and Joe popped the tab open on their colas and clinked them together in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheers\u201d, they both said before they both chased the eaten pizza (and friend) with a satisfying drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE END!!!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Andy leaving the kitchen provided a great and unparalleled view of the room.  When you looked across the kitchen you noticed many things that were already out. Although you were too far away to read any of the labels on the containers, you could tell that he had already pulled out the bag of chips along with the ingredients for the tomato salsa. A large steel knife lay on top of an even larger wooden cooking board, waiting to slice through the layers of the ripe, delicate, and delicious tomatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could inspect any further the door from the garage swung open. Andy walked back in carrying a cola in each hand and walked over towards you. As if on autopilot (and without thinking), Andy started to lower the cans of cola as if he was aiming for you!  From his viewpoint, this was just an empty counter with nothing more than an empty wrapper. With a complete disregard for Matt\u2019s safety, he dropped them on the counter not lightly, but with much force. Screaming to Andy not to crush you, you realized that he couldn\u2019t hear you no matter how much you tried. Running as frantically to the side of the tile as you could, you didn\u2019t make the safety of the grout A large dark shadow formed on the ground below you as the metal tin can came down to crush your very existence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cANDY YOU IDIOT!!! DON\u2019T CRUSH ME!!!  NOOOO!!!\u201d You say, bracing for the worst as the can came crashing down. The shear force from when it hit the counter caused your whole world to vibrate furiously. You were immediately lifted off from the tiled counter, and hurled around in the air like a rag doll striking the can and tile several times. After the bouncing slowed, you find yourself alive but trapped under the concave structure of the can! Andy\u2019s spared your live from a bloody end by a matter of millimeters but how is it even possible that he could forget that you were there?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you ears stopped ringing, you tried to get your bearings. Looking at the world around you, you can see very little. A few imperfections in the tile allowed some light trying to find its way in; barely enough to see the structure you laid under and the surrounding area, but not large enough for you to escape through. Matt can hear the sloshing of the carbonated drink above you smacking against the sides of the can. You lean back against one of the walls, but you are immediately hit with the temperature of the container. The can itself is very cold, not frozen, but just the temperature anyone would want on a hot summer\u2019s day.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith the cold can in the hot humid interior room, it started to sweat pure drinkable water. Since you were shrunk, this ordeal has been quite physically taxing on you. Looking at the water droplets forming on the underside of the can, they prove to be a great temptation to drink. However, from your science studies, you remember that water can get little creatures stuck in droplets. Based upon your current circumstances, this opportunity might be your last good drink of water for a while, but it could end up killing you. Do you take the risk or play it safe? After all, Andy might realize what he\u2019s done and come back looking for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice is yours!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly pushing himself up from the tile, Matt stands up and gradually works his way over to the side of the can that has more light. Looking upwards at the polished metal celling, you see a variety of droplets forming. Some of these water droplets ranged from the size of a small suburban, to the size of your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping in mind your goal of staying away from the bigger droplets, you move around as far away from them as you can. Starting with the smallest of drops, you planted your face into the drop and started to suck in all you could. Before you were allowed to satisfy your thirsty body, the drop burst and separated into a fine mist like a pressurized water balloon. Obviously, Matt was not contented with the amount he drank so he went back for more. Reaching over to the next pure water droplet, he repeated the same method until every droplet he drank burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough a lot of work, Matt was becoming quite full with water. His stomach felt bloated, but something from the metal container provided a sweat taste in the water which caused Matt go back for more. As the can continued to sweat more and more, many large droplets began to overwhelm the smaller droplets. Matt still sucking away at the sweet drink never saw the monstrous drop of water above him. Quietly it made its way down the can, traversing the smooth slope and eventually it merged with Matt's drink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the world turned its gravity off, Matt suddenly was lifted off of his feet and found himself inside his very drink! Submerged inside the drop like a kid in a bubble, Matt worked furiously to punch through the walls so he could breathe. Scrambling to the metal surface, he planted his tennis shoes on the polished side and pushed as hard as he could against it. Fortunately for Matt, this was enough effort to penetrate through the surface tension in the water. Finding that he could now breathe, he tried to lift his arms, but found them pinned to his body below the surface. He couldn't move, but at least he could survive ' for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even being able recover from this most recent ordeal, Matt felt his whole world shake again. This time, it was not from the water itself, but from the whole can. The metal flexing under the new stress, you felt and heard the can pop and crinkle as it was lifted away from the counter. A blinding light entered your room as you were lifted several hundred feet in the air above the counter. Without hesitation, you along with the can were moved to the kitchen table where the mixed chip dip, bottles of water, and chips laid. But even further down from the table were a pair of shorts, legs and somewhat familiar Nike shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but notice how high you were from the table. If you were your normal size, it easily could have been a good two or three feet, but currently it looked as if you could get altitude sickness! A fall from here to anywhere below would most likely be fatal. With another glance at the floor, something sparked in your mind as you made the connection of the shoes below to be those of Andy. Unfortunately for you, it seems as if your friend has your life in his complete control! Without even a pause in Andy's step, Matt suddenly heard the metal groaning and for some reason hissing. A violent shake of the can, which could only be the can opening, startled your world. The sheer force from the shake removed you from the water droplet on the side of the can which sent you hurling about through the air. As Matt spun around midair, you were able to just catch a glance of Andy lifting the opened can to his lips to enjoy his drink. Although it is always nice to see Andy enjoying a satisfying cola, you had much bigger problems to deal with. With one final turn, your heart just about stops when you look below and find yourself on a collision course with'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Spinning violently through the air, Matt was on a quick decent to the dip bowl below. Horrified of his future, Matt tried to recreate the same motions as the sky divers to get away. Slowly Matt drifted away from the container, but the effort was not good enough to keep him out of the dip of doom. Matt was on a collision course with the onion dip below and there was nothing he could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing for impact, Matt tried to position his arms and legs so they wouldn\u2019t land like a kid doing a belly flop at the local pool. Landing with a \u201cthuck\u201d in the messy blend below, Matt swam back to the surface to get to breathable air. When his head stopped spinning in circles, Matt was surprised to find his extremities to be so heavy to lift. After eliminating as much as he could off of his eyes, Matt opened his eyes and realized the severity of his situation. He was literally covered in the thick and creamy white onion dip from head to toe.  Being concealed completely in goo, there was little to no distinction between him and some of the other non-crushed portions of the homemade dip. Seeing that the only way out was by swimming through the onion flavored pool, Matt immediately got to work cleaning as much off of his clothes but ran into a major issue. As Matt struggled to remove the dip from his clothes his worst fears came true. His premium cargo shorts, brand name green shirt, and even his plaid boxer briefs were all stained to the same milky color as the dip. Although stress from knowing you were in a dip bowl was bad enough, Matt was horrified know that he was well blended into the background. Before you even had time to move from where you were casually thrown, suddenly your whole world shifted. Matt looked up to see if Andy had set something on the table, but he was some distance off and was looking into the living room. Whatever it was, or whoever it was, you didn\u2019t care. Dismissing such distractions will only work to your benefit. After all, you had a job to do, and that\u2019s to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your limited options, you figured that swimming to the outside of the glass rimmed bowl would help you to get out. From your perspective it did not look to be the easiest swim. After all, the closest glass wall looked to be well over a mile away, and each side of the container extended upwards by a mile or more. Starting your desperate swim, you sluggishly toil your way through the thick concoction trying your hardest to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time passes, Matt made it about a quarter of the way before he heard and felt several large footsteps approaching. The timing could not be any worse. You looked up, and saw Joe\u2019s grinning face looming over the glass walls like some sort of god. With his stomach and mind already set on devouring the chips and dip, he happily lifts you from the table. Rocking your world back and forth, you find that each wave like motion from the rhythmic footsteps inhibits any measurable progress. During that whole time, Matt continued the fight for his life until he became exhausted from the strenuous workout through the sludge. Matt decides to take a quick breather before he gives himself a hernia; he sits upright looking around the container. Matt quickly tries to figure out where Joe is planning on going with you and the food. Fortunately for Matt, he was able to recognize the wallpaper on the walls and identify each room as they passed through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden stop from Joe, Matt slid around like tar on an ice rink before finally slowing to a stop. Wondering what Joe\u2019s thinking, another figure comes into view a distance off. Andy\u2019s upper torso gracefully passes by your view as he opens up the basement doors. Accompanied by the sound of footsteps on the rickety wooden stairs, you could tell that Andy was heading down to the movie room to watch another one of his action films. Joe on the other hand was looking at the stair case going upwards towards his bedroom. He could join Andy with the movie downstairs, but that would mean sharing the chips and dip. However a more selfish and satisfying approach would be to pig out on these chips within his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even a second later from that thought, a long amplified growl was produced by Joe\u2019s abdomen. So what should Joe do? Carry the chips downstairs and watch the flick, or go on-line on his computer upstairs? Joe looked down at his rumbling belly, rubbed his empty gut, and decided to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe\u2019s stomach won\u2019t wait forever! Pick one quick!</span></div></div>",

Rather than standing around, Joe didn\u2019t think about his decision and decided to follow Andy to the basement. Carrying the chips, dip, and Matt, Joe navigates the stairs being extremely cautious to not drop the delicious and very good food. Upon reaching the cement and open floor at the bottom of the stairs, Joe and Matt make a quick turn towards the left to find Andy\u2019s make shift Movie Theater. Two large reclining chairs, a small coffee table, and a home theater system were systematically placed into the basement full of boxes. By the time Joe had reached the bottom of the stairs, Andy had already loaded the movie by this point and was already quite comfortable in the soft blue chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe sat down in the other chair after placing the snack on the coffee table between the chairs. Upon leaning back in the chair, this shift helped his abdomen to let out another tremendous and hungry groan. Matt heard the rumbling chasm just beyond the layers of muscle on a built body. Matt was still trapped inside the dip working as hard to get out of the mess.  Even though Matt still had a long way to go, his muscles felt like they were already on fire. Nonetheless, Matt knew that he needed to get out of this mess as soon as possible before chips start removing oceans of dip and possibly you. Without any warning, Matt heard the crinkling of chips behind and above him. Disturbed by this noise, Matt knew that it could only mean one thing. The hungry teens have started to eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt now making a frantic swim for his life made another quick glance upwards to find a horrifying discovery. A skyscraper sized, and delicious looking chip was starting to descend into the dip bowl. Without any hesitation, the colossal chip crashed beneath the calm ocean of onion dip. With a quick and fluid motion, the chip was then slowly lifted into the sky with what must be acres of the very stuff Matt\u2019s in! Due to the shape of the bowl, Matt couldn\u2019t see where the chip went after it left, and whose stomach it started to fill. Soon after the first chip cleared the skies, another re-appeared to only go through the same steam shovel like process literally removing what looks like seas of dip. Matt now realized that reaching freedom was now a full-fledged obstacle course. Dozens of chips came raining down one right after another. With the chips falling all around, there was simply no way he could predict where the next chip would crash down next. Doing his best to dodge each one as they fell, Matt was narrowly missed being scooped up several times and spared again and again from the hungry teen\u2019s stomachs. Matt knew that this could not last forever. Eventually they would run out of dip, and he would be on the last scoop, if not the last lick of the bowl. As more and more dip was pulled out of the bowl, the walls surrounding him went from a climbable one, to one that was impossible without mountain climbing gear. Realizing his dwindling opportunity for his own self-salvation, all he could do now was to prolong his stay in the bowl as long as possible before an inevitable digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teens each cleared the bowls, they gradually worked their way towards Matt. Matt looked upwards and saw one of the biggest chips yet to come into the bowl. With a scoop below the waves of onion dip, Matt thought he would be in the clear, but was horribly mistaken. From under his feet, the world was suddenly lifted like anyone in an elevator. Slowly the heavily loaded chip was lifted clear of the bowl. Hovering slightly above the remains in the bowl itself, some of the contents were starting to slide off. The only logical thing Matt could calculate was one of the teens was waiting for the remnants to stop dripping into the bowl.  Matt was close enough to fall off but the dip held his body firm. He would need a little help from someone else; otherwise he might not be able to slide back down to \u201csafety\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few moments are critical to Matt\u2019s future!

If he was to have not swum around in the bowl as much as he did, he would have easily been with the falling dip. Unfortunately for Matt, getting out of this predicament was becoming close to impossible. Dip all around created for Matt some interesting and deadly challenges. All Matt knew was that someone already had him scooped up on a chip, and he was on his way to a pulverizing set of sterling whites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panicked swim through soup, chunks of onions that were not crushed laid all around. The blend of the material almost made it like swimming through wet concrete. The endless sea of dip was encompassed within the confines of the chip. Matt knew he needed to get off of the chip, but he has no idea how or where to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wavy and textured salsa chip loaded with salt helped the fleshy fingers to literally rock your world. Matt tried to look upwards towards the face of the beholder but he couldn\u2019t make out any features in the dark room. Without warning, a swift and hefty force caused Matt to be suddenly propelled downwards.  After a few milliseconds of thought, Matt finally made the connection. He was being lifted like a high speed elevator towards the head of the teen above!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming in horror, he knew it was a long shot over the explosions, but Matt tried anything that could possibly spare him his life. As the acceleration slowed, you first saw the stubble hair mess on his chin. Unfortunately for Matt, the chin was not his floor as it still rose. Finally stopping, you were presented with a massive set of fleshy and moist lips resting only meters ahead of you. Even though they were still closed, Matt knew what lied beyond those lips, and he didn\u2019t like it. Especially since the pair of pink lips belonged to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Matt couldn\u2019t believe it. The very same person that saved his life is now going to end it in a horrible accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was blankly staring at the lips as they started to part. Slowly allowing the light from the TV to gradually make its way into the slimy mouth, Matt was presented with a cavernous and very dark chamber. Slowly as the mouth stretched open the fleshy and wet tongue extended to form a humid landing pad. As the salty chip, dip, and he were propelled forward towards the abyss, Matt knew this the point of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually picking up speed, Matt along with the chip continued to accelerate until they impacted the cushiony and wet tongue. Doing what he could to leave the horrible situation, Matt in a frantic effort began to swim for his life as the dagger like incisors lied just overhead. For a brief moment, Matt thought he was actually gaining some ground in his haste attempt, but Andy\u2019s stomach had other ideas. Retracting Andy\u2019s tongue, Matt realized that his chances of walking out alive from the horror behind him are pretty slim. The pink and textured muscle was now fully withdrawn into the cavernous mouth as Andy began to close Matt\u2019s only chance of escape. The rectangular glassy glow from the TV was now becoming smaller and more circular as Matt watched the lips finally close right in front of his very eyes for his very last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs suddenly as all this began, the pace didn\u2019t seem to slow at all once Matt was in the crushing machine of Andy\u2019s Mouth. At first, Matt thought that he would get destroyed in the first chew, but \u201cluck\u201d spared him, from a quick and bloody end. Initially crushing the chip between his tongue and the roof of his mouth, Andy shifted many of the remnants to each tooth for further destruction. Matt fortunately was a piece that was spared from the crushing as the defacing process continued all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill encompassed in the dip, Matt remained as stationary as he could to prevent being cut in half from one of the teeth. Pieces of the chip were reduced to an unrecognizable pulp almost instantly by the solid white teen molars. With a limited amount of material to work with, Andy\u2019s own stomach growls helped to remind him to swallow. Collecting the remnants plastered in each tooth, Matt was unfortunately mixed into the pulp. The slithering tongue started to rise to dump everything into the back part of Andy\u2019s mouth. Matt, still shell shocked from even being in a situation like this remained paralyzed as he along with the food flowed in the saliva streams to the menacing and even darker hole below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should have been a single swing act in the process of swallowing was interrupted by something. Andy\u2019s tongue still continued to wiggle, but overall the massive mouth was a peaceful still. As the dark chasm was suddenly filled with blinding light, the lips opened once again. Matt paralyzed with fear had just enough energy to turn his head around to see\u2026.</span></div></div>",

Holding your hands in front of your face to shield the light, you noticed in the glare a blurred object was rapidly approaching and entering into your view. As Matt\u2019s Eyes finally adjusted to the light he was horrified when he realized it was the sight of an approaching chip. Similar to the one he rode on, the wavy chip that was covered in delicious dip was slowly being brought into the damp, dark, and destructive cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs part of the chip passed the first set of teeth, Andy\u2019s solid teeth came crashing down. Noticing nothing odd about the previous chip, Andy took the opportunity of a closed set of to swallow the previous entrants. Matt along with the already chewed remains was carelessly rolled around the by the tongue and positioned to be swallowed. Matt was hysterical, crying to his friend he veraciously beat upon the fleshy tongue trying anything to grab his attention. Instead of getting the response he so desperately needed, Andy being none the wiser, closed up the walls around Matt and swallowed. Matt as he fell down to the churning mess below he continued to scream as loud as he could. Although the nearby thumbing noises from the heart were overpowering his own cry, Matt continued to try anything he could. The lubricated and nearby tubular walls were impossible to climb, and impossible to grab onto.  Covered in gunk, spit and chip pulp, Matt looked around at his surroundings and realized that it really didn\u2019t matter at this point. Andy\u2019s energy demanding teen body viewed him as nothing more than a couple of extra calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescending further and further, Matt rode the top of the partially digested mess on its way down Andy\u2019s throat. Suddenly, the walls began to tighten up and it became very hard to move around. Pushing with another audible and distracting growl from the acid bath below, Andy unknowingly opened his stomach sphincter and Matt and the chip started to descend faster and faster. With the limited amount of light Matt had, he had noticed Andy\u2019s stomach ring passing overhead. As quickly as the pressure was applied, Matt transitioned from the tight confines of the throat, to a cavity of great expanse. Smacking the floor of the stomach with a dulled and cushioned thud, Matt was welcomed to the interior of a healthy and powerful digestive tract. The smell was horrendous. From the trace smell of vomit, to the overwhelming stench of saliva and chips, all were confined in the dingy air and almost untreatable air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the dark and churning chasm, Matt really couldn\u2019t see more than his hands in front of his face. Being the nerd that Matt was, he never left the house without a flashlight. Matt quickly wiped off the sloshy mix from his arms and dug into his pocket. Searching through the cargo shorts, Matt eventually found the small flashlight. After scrambling to find the switch, he turned it on to help illuminate this unbearable interior. When the light was first cast upon the stomach walls, Matt abruptly wished he never turned it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking upwards towards the ceiling above, the weak light was barely strong enough to show Matt the horrendous sight of healthy teen digestion. The flexing and rugged walls of the stomach were already churning and oozing and glistening by the stomach acid. Following the moving ripples in the ceiling with his flashlight, Matt looked on and saw what must be tons of partially digested food already starting to leave. With the muscle closing up around the entrance to the intestines, the soupy chyme was expelled from this horrendous place. With a few more seconds passing, the tight knot of muscles quickly re opened with another loud growl allowing Matt to see that all the food has left. Matt himself was standing upon the chewed up remains of the first chips that laid upon the stomach floor. Looking around the pile, Matt could see fissures starting to form in the material as the acid began to break the food down. Although Matt could study Andy\u2019s internal anatomy all day long, a familiar groaning noise from above interrupted his thought. <br>\r\nLooking up at the stomach sphincter flexing above, Matt knew that this meant that more food was on its way. Luckily for Matt, he was able to briskly move through the sludge and get out of the way of the newly arrived entrants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt continued to stare at the opening, the next chip dropped in with a splatter. The new slosh was added to the building pyramid of chips and dip making it slightly taller. Matt witnessing the construction, hoped that he would continue to eat more chips so he could climb up the fleshy tube to freedom.  The pile continued to increase in size until Matt heard a distinct \u201cthuck\u201d from somewhere outside the body. Before Matt could figure out what it was, he suddenly heard several gulping sounds above him. As the material traveled closer and closer to the stomach, it sounded like a bubbling waterfall. The sphincter opened and in came a torrent of some sort of drink! Matt forgot about the cola!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwirling around inside of the now flooded interior, Matt held on for dear life to the clotted fat raft that was keeping him out of the acid bath. The cola levitated the gunky mess and also helped to condense the void. There was only one problem with that. Matt\u2019s raft did not take kindly to the presence of the carbonated drinks. The fat all around him slowly was melting away as it was diluted in the chyme. The smallest collision with the stomach walls, or another piece of food would certainly destroy the dying life raft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUUUUUUUUUUURP!\u201d Said Andy. He proudly rubbed his full and built stomach, boasting about how delicious the dip was today. \u201cThat dip was excellent! I could actually feel some sort of tingeing on my tongue on a few of the chips. Whatever I added this time, I gotta try to do it again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the stomach it was a different story. As Matt predicted, the raft did not hold, and was immediately disintegrated. Literally swimming in acid, Matt\u2019s skin, eyes and lungs started to burn. There was nothing he could do. The quick swipe of cola destroyed everything that could be used as a platform. There was nothing to stand on, or to use to help float. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Andy was looking to the TV when he heard his stomach growl yet again. At the same time, Matt\u2019s acid burned and digested corpse was flexed and squeezed into the small intestine joining the rest of the food. Andy looked down at his perfect stomach and with a smirk, rubbed his belly and burped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup\u2026 That was goooooood.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Peach fuzz covered his upper lip, nearly unnoticeable at normal size; the small blond hairs vaguely resembled an unruly lawn at Matt\u2019s size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoe, help me!\u201d he cries out waving his arms. The plump lips part and a deafening gale rips past Matt. Joe is laughing.  As his sour, humid breath blows around him, Matt couldn\u2019t help but feel humiliated. Although undoubtedly laughing at something on the show, it feels as if he\u2019s laughing at Matt\u2019s pathetic situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt coughs as he inhales Joe\u2019s bad breath and feels momentarily grateful when Joe stops laughing. He shakes his head to clear the ringing. However a new problem presents itself as he feels the chip below him move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it probably only lasted a single second at the most, Matt experienced the next thing in excruciating slow motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe\u2019s lips parted once more, slower than before. As they did the tip of his massive tongue appeared. It was like watching a monster emerging from a cave. As more and more appeared from the darkness Matt could see the bits and pieces of chewed chips spread across it. A large, soggy pile of yellow and white mush rested just to the left of the center. Strands of saliva stretched from the tongue to the upper molars before snapping as the tongue extended further. A chunk of compacted chip fell from one of Joe\u2019s molars and landed on the side of the tongue. Matt couldn\u2019t believe how long and wide it was, even at normal size Joe\u2019s tongue was huge, now it was almost incomprehensible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it slowed to a stop Matt felt himself and the chip moving towards this horrible scene. \u201cNOOOOOOO!!!!\u201d he wailed but the giant still noticed nothing, Matt\u2019s screams were completely drowned out by the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe\u2019s perfect white teeth glinted, reflecting the light from the TV off the saliva coating them. As he entered the mouth he could see the uvula swaying gently over the dark throat, a sliver of chip stuck to the top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed suddenly choking on the stale air. The stench of onions from the dip was overwhelming. As the chip lowered the tongue retracted into the mouth and Matt stared in fascination as the surface slid below him, the chewed food a blur as it returned into Joe\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with a splat only Matt heard the chip landed on the tongue. He looked up to see the ridged, pink roof coated in slimy saliva. He imagined Joe\u2019s eyes up there, but he was completely unseen to this giant. The strong white teeth framed his peripheral vision as well as the soggy crumbs clinging to the inside of Joe\u2019s cheeks. Matt struggled to look behind him as Joe\u2019s fingers pulled away and his lips started to close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt let out a wordless scream of desperation as the sharp teeth came closer together and finally the lips shut leaving him in a world of darkness. He whimpered in the complete calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the tongue pushed up, shoving the chip against the roof of the mouth to crack it in half. Joe wasn\u2019t conscious of his method of chewing, by now he unconsciously obliterated each chip pretty similarly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, all dignity forgotten, screamed loudly in absolute fear. The tongue shifted each half to their respective side of the mouth to be mashed between the molars. Matt, blind in the darkness, had no way or time to do a single thing to help himself. Luckily he brushes against the side of a molar as it sinks downward, splintering the chip. This action wedges Matt into the space between Joe\u2019s upper teeth, with a layer off chip mush sealing him in place. Below him he can hear the crunches that quickly become squishes as Joe destroys the chip. He doesn\u2019t bother to scream over the din.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few seconds it stops and he hears squelches and slithering as the majority of the food is maneuvered away. Matt knows what is coming. His eyes adjusted to the darkness, Matt barely makes out the pile of chewed food as it\u2019s dumped into the throat and with a deafening gulp is thoughtlessly swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shudders at his barely avoided and probably inevitable fate.</span></div></div>",

Joe\u2019s lips are parting and again Matt can see the bits and piles of chewed chips which have shifted and changed. He can see that the piles get thicker the closer they are to the gaping throat. The tongue moves out of the mouth and Matt can see the piles of food, previously out of sight in Joe\u2019s gullet now in front of him, unable to leave the mouth. \u2018How can Joe be so oblivious to all of this?\u2019 Matt wonders in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tongue pulls back and the piles of food return into the dark abyss, Matt sees a new arrival. The dip covered chip looks tasty now, but soon it will just be soggy bits with most of it gone down Joe\u2019s greedy esophagus. As the light wanes Matt wonders if his moving has actually placed him in more danger\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joe annihilates this new chip  Matt is pelted by the bits of chewed food and feels himself beginning to fall with each movement. He screams as he drops for a second before landing in something gooey and feeling himself shift sideways. He gags as he feels his body merge with a soggy pile and everything stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe has decided that he has chewed enough and Matt struggles to free himself as the pile he is trapped is forced backwards. As he finds himself unceremoniously dumped into Joe\u2019s throat his only thought is: \u201cThis can\u2019t be!\u201d With that, the pressure around him increases one hundred fold as Joe swallows. As he descends the esophagus with the chip Matt begins chanting \u201cno\u201d under his breath, each time getting louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops at the sphincter leading into the stomach and shudders, still chanting. As it opens to welcome the new arrivals Matt\u2019s adjusted eyes make it out the horrible interior of Joe\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink wrinkly walls move slightly around the growing pile of soggy, yellow, chewed chips. A puddle of saliva and the beginning of stomach acid surround the mountain like a small moat. As Matt and the chewed food fall onto the mound of food he begins screaming his chant. His mind is shutting down from the stress of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt simply cannot believe he will die inside his best friend\u2019s younger brother. His body will become just more energy for the growing, muscular young man. Whatever is deemed waste will exit the handsome boy during his morning dump. And never will Joe know the significance of his snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe continues to eat, unconscious of the bits and piles of chewed food that glint in the light for a moment as he takes a bite. He doesn\u2019t give any thought to the soggy food descending his throat. He doesn\u2019t feel it drop with a splat in his stomach, smothering Matt. He is unaware of the violent process that is about to start in his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he jumps suddenly because of a sudden death in the movie, he doesn\u2019t feel the mountain of chewed food level itself inside his stomach. As the credits roll an hour later he doesn\u2019t notice the gurgles emitting from his stomach as it begins to digest his chips. Instead he decides to head upstairs to half-heartedly start his homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he leaves he turns to Andy. \u201cDude this dip was epic, you gotta make it like this everytime\u201d he says with a smile, his perfect teeth glinting in the light as he smacks his comfortably full stomach. Andy grins at the compliment and both boys are completely unaware of the extra passenger already lost to Joe\u2019s powerful digestion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just barely missing the edge of the table, you zip past the bowl of dip without contact as you continue your fall towards the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt braces for the worst in the last few seconds before meeting his demise. With a massive jolt to Matt\u2019s world, he opened his eyes and was shocked to see that he was still in one piece. The droplet encasing his entire torso and body, helped to act as an airbag when the droplet of water exploded upon impact. Although it was nice to still be alive, Matt found himself in a whole new world of danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Andy proves to be a bad idea. Just as you fell off of the can, many other droplets soon followed. Large drops began to fall all around Matt like mortar shells in a war zone. First came a few, but as Andy tried to drink the last drop of Cola, he shook the sugary drink violently. Matt seeing thousands of droplets being cast in of the sky caused him realize that he needed to get somewhere safe. But much to his avail, a hardwood floor provided no suitable shelter within running distance. Matt franticly tried to run towards the closest thing in sight which just so happened to be Andy\u2019s Nike shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Unfortunately for Matt, he could have made it to the shelter of soft rubber if he had more time. With rain droplets the size of homes finally crashing down upon Matt\u2019s world, his options were completely cut off.  Unable to reach the soft rubber soles of the shoes, frantically looked around for anything else that could be a shelter. Just as he was about to give up, he spotted a carved wooden groove in the floorboards lying right next to him. Diving into the seam, he stayed prone until he couldn\u2019t hear anymore drops hitting the floorboards. With silence in the surrounding terrain, Matt sat up and climbed out of the groove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Andy, he could see your friend\u2019s finally reaching the last delicious drops in his drink and swallowing them.  Andy\u2019s long teen body looked extremely satisfied with the last few drops of cola. A smile came across his face when he removed the metal lip on the can away from his mouth. His eyes were not fixated on the floor where you laid, but rather something in front of him. As you looked down towards the massive set of shoes, his toes were twitching in joy. You hoped that this was a reaction to the sugary drink, and not the temptation to move. Without further warning from Andy, the immense shoes started to rise hundreds of feet into the air without hesitation. Matt\u2019s eyes were glued to his foot motions. Noticing that he was not lifting his foot to turn around, but rather step forward, you soon found a new world of trouble. The lifted Nike shoe was slowly starting to accelerate as it moved towards your place of existence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly looking at your options again, you realized that the notch in the wood was too small to protect you from the foot, so you started to run. In a frenzied dash, you ran faster than you ever did before as a dark shadow started to form over your head. Obviously this shadow can be quite distracting, so you looked upwards at the underside of the shoe. By the looks of it, it was a newer style of tennis shoe, but it was filthy. From being outside, there were clumps of dirt, small rocks, the smallest of twigs, and anything else you could imagine from all the outdoor yard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, by studying the details you forgot about the treacherous terrain ahead of your path. Your ankle twisted as you accidently stepped into one of the cracks. Being thrown down towards the already blackened ground, you looked up in horror as Andy\u2019s foot enveloped your entire sky. With nowhere to run, you realized your hopeless fate, allowing the foot to come crashing down, ending your life by crushing your body into a bloody pulp. Nothing recognizable from your body remained intact as it was hopelessly squeezed into the shoe with the rest of the remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy on the other hand, went about his day never questioning where you were. Joe came down from his shower, and they both feasted on the chips and dip clearing both bowls. The thought never came up in Andy\u2019s mind that you were still in his house or for that matter, shrunk. Matt very existence that day was simply forgotten and lost to the grains of time.</span></div></div>",

You pound of the fleshy walls around you. Andy approaches the open bathroom door, looking inside to see the water running in the tub. Joe was in his room waiting for the water to heat up. Andy sneaks into the bathroom and moves directly to the tub. Opening his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T THINK YOU'LL SURVIVE THIS LITTLE MAN, YOU'LL EITHER BE SWEPT DOWN THE DRAIN OR CRUSHED BY MY LITTLE BROTHER. IF THERE WAS A WAY TO BRING YOU BACK I WOULD, BUT THERE ISN'T. AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE WATCHING OUT FOR YOU FOREVER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy's hand slowly begins to tilt, sliding along his warm skin. You make a tiny splash in the waiting waters below. Surfacing you peer up to see Andy smile down before leaving your view. You tread the vast empty waters as they continue to rise.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In an instinctive choice, Matt dove inside one of Joe's socks. Worst decision ever, because the smell was even worse than outside. But it was now too late for Matt to come out, because Joe's huge hand was coming down to get his sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe extended it and Matt fell to the toe area. Then, from this point of view, he saw an immense stinky foot coming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to crush me!\", Matt yelled. But that didn't happened. Matt just got stuck between Joe's toes, where he could find sweat and dirt and not enough clean air to breathe. He could already feel the humidity and heat starting to rise in there, and the rank odor filled his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Andy had a mischievous grin on his face by thinking about Matt and his situation. Joe didn't know that he was drowning his brother's \"best friend\" in his foot sweat. He put his (also smelly) shoes on and left the house, heading downtown to meet some friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe arrived to find his friends, who decided it would be a good idea to play soccer. Inside the sock, Matt felt the intense movement and started to feel nauseated (if he hadn't yet because of the smell).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get out of here, but how? I can't...move...\", Matt said. He tried to escape from Joe's toes but it was impossible. They were pressing him too much. While he was there, some sweat drops from Joe's foot rolled down and fell on Matt's body, some even landing on his face and mouth. Matt couldn't feel more insignificant and humilliated. He eventually fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe got home a little late, but no one was expecting him to arrive early so it wasn't important. He was, however, tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, my feet hurt!\", Joe said after a very intense soccer game, running from one side of the field to another chasing and kicking a ball. He went upstairs and, once in his bedroom, he took his shoes and socks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, do my feet really smell that bad?\", he wondered but didn't care much. While laying on his bed, he noticed something strange on his foot. A kind of bug was there. He reached up with his hand and took it. He held it closer to his eyes to see it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. NO...WAY!\" Joe thought that \"bug\" actually looked like a person. \"Is it dead? No one's going to believe this.\" He poked Matt with his finger expecting him to move, to ensure he wasn't dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt woke up and the first thing he saw was the stunned, yet amused, face of his best buddy's younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAY!\", Joe yelled. \"You are alive! You really are a little person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but HELP ME! I'm Matt!, Matt screamed. \"I can't hear you! I guess that means that you're mine now. I found you, I OWN you\", Joe said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please don't hurt me!\", Matt pleaded, but it was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So darn cool! I'm going to tell my friends and we are going to have fun. But I'll wait 'til tomorrow. For now, we have the whole night to have FUN, just the two of us.\" Joe said in a tone which Matt didn't like. \"And I guess Andy can't know about this, he would take you and never give you back to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, little human. My feet hurt. You can massage them and lick them clean; or you can have even more fun inside my briefs. I guess, since you can't say anything, I'll choose. You're going to...\"</span></div></div>",

Had she been wearing her usual high heeled boots he would be dead for sure under its flat sole. Instead she wore a pair of sneakers with ridges on the bottom. With a look skyward he found a place where he could curl up and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not wait long as no sooner had he gotten into position then foot struck the ground with a force that would have reduced him to a smear in short order. Luck, and his good judge of distance, was on his side in this instance as the shoe slammed down around him, casting him into a void of darkness. Looking around he found he could see nothing, though his sense of smell told him that Sam really needed to clean off the bottom of her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he realized that he could use his new position to his advantage, and so stretched out his arms, jamming himself into place. When the shoe lifted up again so that Sam could check her handiwork she found a clean, well of Matt guts anyway, floor. Looking down she decided that the dot hadn't been a bug like she'd though. It must have been a trick of the light or a dust mote. She never did check the bottom of her shoe, where she would have found a very tiny passenger hanging on for his life as she brought it down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Matt found out that his great idea wasn't so great, as the force of Sam's footfalls nearly ripped his arms out of their sockets, but he wasn't about to abandon the idea, after all he needed help, and though the antidote was in the lab, he doubted he could get it without help. Steeling himself against the pain in his shoulders Matt hung on for his life as Sam continued to walk through the lab following Kellie. He couldn't really make ut what they were saying because his attention was focused on holding on, but he thought he heard his name a few times, and then something that sounded like pouring liquid.</span></div></div>",

He was unsure if she could be trusted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie moved towards a bug she spotted on the ground. \"For such a smart guy I can't believe you were dumb enough to test your formula on yourself. Let alone by yourself.\" She said with a slight mocking tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Julie knew he was shrunk somehow made her seem even more gigantic. Matt watched as Julie lifted her flip flop clad foot into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie smirked as she lifted her foot. \"What exactly was your plan once your were tiny ? It's almost like you wanted to get squashed like a bug\" She said, suddenly bringing her foot down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barely audible crunch under her foot widened Julie's smile. \"Uh-oh, I think I accidentally stepped in a bug.\" She said twisting her foot back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was in complete shock. Standing, frozen in fear Matt couldn't take his eyes off Julie's enormous foot. With no effort she squashed a bug that was several times larger than Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt ? Was that you ?\" Julie asked giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her foot and inspected the bug's crushed remains on the sole of her flip flop. \"Huh, guess not.\" She said a disappointed tone in her voice. \"Maybe you were that bug Samantha stomped on before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was so terrified that his brain refused to make a decision. He couldn't decide if she should run, or stay still. Either was the consequence was Julie noticing the minuscule teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Samantha stepped on him, he had been able to think quickly. He was decisive in the moment, and it saved his life. Now, as Julie scanned the ground for him Matt was overwhelmed with fear. His legs were shaking, his heart racing out of control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening!\" Matt screamed as he fought to force down his fear. \"She wouldn't really step on me on purpose! This is just a bad prank.\" His attempts to convince himself slowed the trembling of his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ha! There you are!\"Julie said, eyes locked on the tiny teen. \"Wow, you're so teeny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's fight or flight instincts finally kicked in. He bolted across the floor as quickly as his legs could take him. Sanctuary was just ahead under a heavy cabinet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove Julie watched with a smirk as the speck made barely any progress. From her perspective Matt had covered approximately 6 inches. She let him run for a moment more before stepping into his path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was knocked backwards as the foot dropped down in front of him. Julie had effortlessly blocked his path. He knew instantly that there was no escaping the giantess teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you almost got away.\" Julie said rolling her eyes. \"But, since you didn't, it's time.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking around for a moment he comes to the quick conclusion that this is not one of the girl's houses, and that he has made a serious error. A quick glance at a glowing panel set just above him reveals that he was correct. He wasn't in one of the girls' houses, instead he was in the Wendy's just across from the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man. This has got to be the worst day of my life,\" he tells himself, looking after the forms of the girls, which are already miles away, well really probably only a few feet if that, but to him it seemed like miles. He feels ready to just break down and cry. It wasn't supposed to be this way. All he was supposed to do was see if the formula worked, and then grow back and find some kind of market for it. Now here he was, less than an inch tall sitting on the floor of a fast food restaurant with nothing to look forward to but getting stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" he cried, rallying his courage against the world. He wasn't just some bug, he was a genius. He invented something that was theoretically impossible, and he wasn't about to just lay down and die. That's not the kind of man, well boy he was. He would get noticed, or die trying. More than likely the latter, but at least he can say when he got to where ever it was dead people went that he at least tried to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill looking around he realized how hard a task this was going to be. To those above him he was little more than a dot, smaller than a bug really. Yet he couldn't give up. There was always hope, even in the darkest of times. Looking around he saw the girls make their way to a table almost right next to where he was standing. He thought for a moment, and realized he might be better off trying to get in touch with a stranger than his sister or her friends. He was about an equal distance from the counter.

Never would either them, the police, or your family know that Sam had just ended your life.</span></div></div>",

Unable to change his course, or do anything else for that matter, Matt was forced to watch as the pink fleshy wall of Sam's throat grew closer, before slamming into it, and then dropping as Sam's swallowing reflex kicked in. Sam, feeling something tickle the back of her throat, nearly choked as she swallowed it and what was in her mouth down whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, are you okay?\" asked Kellie as Sam began coughing. After the fit subsided and Sam leaned back in her chair she looked at her friend and nodded weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. I guess I ate to fast,\" she said, and Kellie laughed at her in a friendly way. Sam smiled, if still somewhat weakly, and the two returned to eating. Inside Sam's belly you really wish the two girls would question what just happened more, but neither do, and as you begin to lose consciousness due to a lack of air you can't help but think that this is all just so wrong. A moment later Sam let's out a terrific belch that causes every eye in the restaurant to turn to her. Laughing in embarrassment Sam took another bite of her burger an silently swore to herself to throughly chew her food before swallowing. She lives up to that promise for the rest of her life, and she provides your sister with some much needed emotional support after the police report you as a missing person, and finally as presumed dead.</span></div></div>",

Kellie's friend had become some skyscraper-like being to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY MATT? ARE YOU DOWN HERE?

Those impossibly huge shoes were coming right at him! They could crush him flat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie, wait, no! Don't step on me!\" Matt squeaked. Julie's Vans stomped down on either side of him and she stopped. Matt looked up, miles up, to Julie's face. High above him in the heavens like some distant planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MATT?\" She called again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie, I'm right here! Here, at your feet!\" Matt cried. But even he knew it was useless. His tiny voice would never reach her ears from all the way down here.

Just as he thought, his tiny appendages were too small to grab hold of the metal leg at an eighth of an inch tall. But, to his surprise, his hands and feet had an impressive grip of the tower, not unlike a spider. <br>\r\n\"Huh, I need to write this down.\" He thought to himself. Apparently, being the size of an ant also gives you the climbing abilities of an ant. Using this new found skill, Matt shuffles his way up the desk leg. <br>\r\nNow at the top, he reads the note: \"Dear Matt, I've never had the courage to tell you until now, but I want you to know that I really like you. Wanna go on a date sometime? Signed, Julie~\" Matt was shocked. Always indulged in his science experiments and research, Matt had never really taken notice to girls. He didn't really have the time. After reading the love note, Matt felt butterflies in his stomach. Now he was thinking about Julie, and started to think about just how beautiful she was. Her shoulder-length, wavy brown hair. Her oceanic light-blue eyes. Her perfect curvy body. Her pale, creamy soles. The freckles on her cute nos- wait a minute, her soles? Why was he thinking about her feet? Snapping out of his trance, he decided he needed to go find her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of trotting through the long carpet fibers, Matt finally made it to the hallway. He heard noise in the living room, and figured someone was watching TV. \"It could be Julie\" Matt thought. It didn't take as long to reach the living room, because the hallway had a hard, wooden floor. As you made it to the couch striding through the carpet fibers of the living room, you saw...</span></div></div>",

You cared for your sister the same way, despite her being your step-mother's daughter. Deciding your mom was the better choice, you made your way to her bare feet. When you stopped at her feet, you took a minute to appreciate them. You took notice to her round toes, her cherry red nail polish, and how not a single vein was visible. You admired them for almost an hour. Your trance finally broke when your mom stood up, stretched, and landed a loving kiss on your step-sister's forehead. Your step-mother worked as a waitress at a restaurant and was scheduled for closing, so she needed to get ready for work. You re-entered your trance as she lifted her foot, ready to take a step towards her room. \"wow, her soles look amazing t-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your step-mom's building-sized foot swiftly pressed you into the carpeted living room floor with its full weight, something occurred to you: You were invincible! You forgot that the shrinking process compresses your molecules, leaving you with the density of normal you. If you were stepped on, it would feel like the force of someone someone standing on your chest, but evenly spread out across your whole body, so you felt no pain at all! Oddly enough, you actually enjoyed it. Being stepped on had a strange, yet very strong appeal to it. Your new fascination with feet was interesting, to say the least. You decided you might do some research if you ever get to return to your normal size. As your mother lifted her foot again, you came with it. Her foot then proceeded to rhythmically smash you into the floor. You thought you were getting used to it, that is, until she reached the hallway. As she stepped down onto the hard wood, your body was pressed deeper into her sole. Now you're really stuck, and thought that if she kept this up you'd eventually be flattened. As she reached her room, she grabbed her waitress outfit and started to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter throwing on her blouse, skirt, and hat, all she had to do was put on her nylons and high heels, so she sat on the bed and crossed her left leg over her right. After pulling on her left nylon, she rested her right foot on her left knee. Before she pulls the remaining nylon onto her foot, she takes a glance at her sole.</span></div></div>",

I guess I better put it out of its misery.\" That said, she stands up, lifts her foot high off the ground at gives the 'ant' a good stomp. After her foot connects with the carpeted bed room floor, she lifts her heel and starts twisting her foot side to side, grinding you into the floor like a cigarette. After a solid minute of twisting and grinding, your mom turns her foot so her sole is facing upwards to check on her little bug. \"What? How are you still alive? I guess I'll just have to try harder.\" After a few more attempts of grinding her little bug into paste, she finally gives up and says \"Well, if you won't die by being stomped on, then I guess you'll accompany me on my shift. The smell might kill you!\" She says this with a laugh, and pulls on her other nylon before sliding into her stiletto heels. Your mom really did have have smelly feet, regardless if you enjoyed it or not (you definitely did). This made you think about the foot rub you gave her once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a year ago, your mother had just got home after a late shift, and decided it was a good idea to drink a couple glasses of wine (it was a bad shift) before sitting next to you on the couch. As you were watching a movie, she kicked off her heels, crossed her feet on your lap, wiggled her toes, and asked \"Matthew? Would you mind rubbing my feet for me, please? It's been a really long day, and my feet are KILLING me.\" This was probably your first foot fetish experience. You said of course, and started rubbing. You noticed the smell as soon as she kicked off her heels, and it was strong, but when she put her feet in your lap, it really hit you. They smelled REALLY bad, but to you, they smelled like heaven. You never thought much of it until she stepped on you. After you rubbed your mom's feet for about 20 minutes, she decided to put her foot on your face and asked \"Hey honey, do my feet stink?\" Taken aback, you weren't given much time to think of an answer, so you blurted out \"N- Not at all! They actually smell great!\" Too drunk to care, she said \"Well, if you like the smell so much, you can smell them for the rest of the night.\" Then she put both feet on your face, crossed her arms behind her head, and laid back with her eyes closed and a satisfied smile on her face. So just like she said, you breathed in her foot scent for the rest of the night, and never even bothered removing her feet from your face. You woke up the next morning still kneeling on the floor with your head resting on the couch and your mom's feet in your face. Luckily, you woke up before her, and she didn't remember anything due to being drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom is now walking to her car, repeatedly stepping on you and smothering you with her perfect feet. <br>\r\nIt was a hot day at work, and your mom smothered and crushed you with her hot and sweaty soles for six hours without a break. At the end of the day, it was finally time to go home. Your mom drove back home, kicked off her shoes, and fell asleep on the couch. Do you...</span></div></div>",

He gave a great heave, and threw himself over the edge onto the top of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt made a quick dive at the shoelaces, taking hold as Julie's foot sailed into the air. He found the going far more difficult up here. The wind from Julie's steps threatened to toss him from the shoe. Mercifully, it was over quickly as Julie entered Kellie's room and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, WHERE IS HE?\" Kellie boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEA, YOU KNOW, THIS PROJECT IS DUE IN TWO DAYS!\" Andrea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up at the giant girls.

He had to get to higher ground if he wanted any shot at getting one of the girls to notice him. He figured his best option would be to climb Julie's body. If she could reach her ear, she'd have to hear him! Matt looked up and gulped. Starting at the bottom of her jeans, it would take a long time and a lot of effort. But he was determined. He started for her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, BEST JUST START WORKING NOW AND GET A HEAD START BEFORE MATT GETS HOME.\" Kellie boomed, taking a seat on the floor. Her friends started to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was nearly to his destination when everything changed. As Julie went to sit down, she lost her balance. Her leg went kicking wildly into the air. Matt, caught totally unaware, was flung skyward, up and off the gigantic shoe. He sailed upward, and actually passed very close to Andrea's face. Matt's stomach lurched as he hit the peak of his flight and the inevitable descent started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed in terror, flipping end over end, tumbling through the air before finally coming to a landing...</span></div></div>",

He wanted it to be over quickly. No pain from his sudden impact with the floor. He closed his eyes and braced himself for the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Matt landed with a cold, tiny splash. Plunging beneath the surface, it took Matt a second to regain function, and he kicked his legs furiously, trying to reach the surface. He broke it, sputtering and clearing his eyes. It was water. Matt looked around at his new surroundings. He was treading water in a vast pool. But that couldn't be right! There were no pools in his house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paddled over to the side of the pool and was met with a wall of glass. The level of the water was far below the top of the wall. It all dawned on Matt quickly. He was in a glass of water. Frightened beyond belief, he tried to climb the side of the glass, but he only succeeded in making it a few feet, but his wet body slipped off the glass and dropped back into the water. He pounded on the glass, but couldn't see through the thick, distorted wall of glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paddled back into the middle of the pool. He looked down and saw that there were several hundred feet of water below him. He looked up and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody help me! I'm in this glass of water!\" He cried. He looked in the distance and saw a huge hand opening up. It pressed against the glass and wrapped around it. Then Matt's entire world shook as the hand lifted the glass into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, KELLIE.\" Andrea said as she lifted her glass of water to take a sip. \"MATT SHOULD BE HERE TO HELP US!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up as he heard Andrea's voice. Her gigantic face now filled his entire field of vision as he realized the water glass he was trapped in belonged to her. Andrea had never like Matt much, in fact, most of the time she refused to even take notice of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt now needed her to notice him more than ever before. He knew if she didn't see him, she would swallow him. She looked right at him, her huge eyes flashing over him briefly. But she failed to notice the the tiny speck floating in her glass of water. He waved his arms and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea, stop!\" Matt screamed. \"Please don't drink me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glass pressed to her lips and she tilted it forward. A current formed, taking hold of Matty's tiny form. He started to drift towards the open top of the glass and Andrea's open, waiting mouth. Matt turned and started to paddle away. But it was useless, and he was now seconds away from being washed over her teeth and into her mouth.</span></div></div>",

And he had shrunk out of his clothes until he now stood, very small, in his own boxer briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom ran toward the wall. He began to grab with his fists at the fabric, determined to hoist himself out of the enormous boxers.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMatt had failed to take into account that his formula would have no effect on the drinker's clothing.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter Tom escaped the boxer briefs, he saw more articles of clothing.

Stepping into the light, he found himself without any clothes. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe took a look around the lab. Were his eyes tricking him? He looked like he had been transported to some weird alien city. Towering structures surrounded him. \u201cWait!\u201d He rubbed his eyes. \u201cThose aren\u2019t buildings.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe formula! It must have worked. He had shrunk!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Tom! Are you alright?\" Matt asked his shrunken uncle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMatt saw Tom's huge clothing on the floor. His jeans looked like a range of rolling brown leather hills. He realized that he had crawled from beneath the sleeve of his own shirt to find himself lost in this strange gigantic world.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cEverything looks so big!\u201d Tom looked down at the hardwood floor. The cracks between floorboards looked as wide as he was tall.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen Matt explaied eerything about the formula, Tom realized that he and his nephew were now 1 eighth of an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" exclaimed Tom, his colossal surroundings swallowing up his tiny voice. \"I'm the same size as my nephew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all Matt wanted was the antidote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d His voice carried a hint of panic. He titled his head back and gazed toward the distant jar with the pale blue liquid, the antidote to his shrinking formula. The jar far, far out of reach on surface of the skycraper-sized table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
