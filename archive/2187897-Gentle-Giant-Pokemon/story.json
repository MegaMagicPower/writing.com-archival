You recently moved to an out there town to get away from the city life for a while, out of the noisy streets and more into the wavy plains of the wilderness. The place you decided to call home is a bit far from civilization, and there is a some amount of wild Pokemon that show up here, but they are so low leveled that an attack from them feels more like they're playing with you than being aggressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take your morning walk, you notice a weird red glowing material on the ground. Huh, this thing looks very funky, doesn't it. You cautiously pick it up, as it does.... nothing. You inspect it some more, and find it not that interesting other than its pulsing red light, so you toss it behind you and continue on your walk. As you walk, you glance back behind you to see a wild Wooloo that likes to hang out near your house inspecting the rock you just threw. From the times that you actually encountered the Wooloo, you figured out that they're a girl, and that when you approached her, she rolled away. Then you notice that the Wooloo then too started to glow red like the rock, but she also starts to.... grow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it was a small growth, noticeable, but small, until she then started to escalate in size, having you crane your head just to see her head. The Wooloo looks very confused as well, backing up a little and looking around the place for help. Soon she stops growing, and the red glow also faded away. If you had to guess, she was about 200 ft tall, or maybe even more. You are probably half the size of the Wooloo's leg at the present minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woolooo?\" The Wooloo calls out confused. She's probably confused on how big she is. Though you don't want to really deal with a giant sheep, you do feel bad for throwing the rock in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Down here!\" You try to get the attention of the Wooloo, which works, as she looks down at you. You see her legs fold, as she lays down in front of you. Wow, that is a whole lot of wool. Her face then covers your vision, you just barely reaching above her heart shaped nose. Her gray dreadlocks on the side of her face now both lay on the ground, making it so that you are kinda walled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wo?\" The Wooloo peeps, inspecting you. You reach out your hand toward the Wooloo to pet her, as she...</span></div></div>",
