Looking to his left, he sees something red sticking out from under the sheets. Poking the red object, it moans at his touch. Grabbing the covers, he throws them off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth opens wide as he looks down at a sleeping girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why is there a girl in my bed?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to stir. Looking up at him, and smiles. \"Good morning\", she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...good morning?\". She leans towards him and kisses him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Karen! Thats cheap! Trying to get ahead of everyone else!\". Another girl had just entered his room and pulls Karen off of him. Kyle finally gets a good look at both of them. He rubs his eyes, thinking that he was seeing double before he realized that the 2 girls had to be twins. The only difference he could tell was that one had long hair and the other short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time that he was figuring this out, the long haired girl was yelling at the short haired one, who was still 1/2 asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\", the girl lets go of her sister who falls to the ground. She sits next to Kyle and places a hand on his leg. \"Sorry about that. I'm, Katherine. And that idiot there is my twin sister Karen\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren jumps to her feet. \"Idiot? Did you just call me an idiot?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! Of course I did! And you are an idiot! We all agreed to leave him alone his first night here!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your calling ME an idot? Of course I didn't mean that!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle uses this chance to get up. He quietly opens his suitcase and grabs a fresh set of clothes. \"Ok.....well, nice meeting you 2, I'm going to take a shower now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both look at him and in unison \"Wait!\", but he is already gone.</span></div></div>",

This doesn't make sense!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it does\", a familiar voice says. The twins from this morning were still in his room and sitting on his bed.

She had somehow become the stuffed dog that he had giver her earlier. She screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmnnn. Shut up Katherine! I was trying to sleep\".

Kyle places one his hands on her hips and slowly enters her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey go at it for a while, Kyle even picks her up and they keep it up while he holds her up. Back on the bed, he starts to pick up speed. And with one powerful thrust, he cums in her then pulls out, spraying her on the inside and onto her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them exhausted, Karen lays there and Kyle sits down next to her. She smiles, \"that was amazing!\".<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was\".<br>\r\n\"Um, was that your first time?\".<br>\r\n\".....Yes\".<br>\r\nHer smile gets bigger, \"I'm glad\".<br>\r\n\"?\".<br>\r\n\"It was mine too\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at her body, coverd in sweat and his cum, and gets an idea. \"We need to clean you off. I'm so glad I have this ring\". The ring starts to glow and both of their bodies, the bed, and their clothes are cleaned. He helps Karen up and she puts on her bra and panties and Kyle gets dressed. Karen then hugs him, \"that was fun, we have to do that again!\". They sneak back over to Karen's room and Katherine is still asleep.....</span></div></div>",

Don't you have to leave soon?\".<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? Damn! I forgot about practice! I'm going to be late!\". She gets dressed right in front of them, grabs a few things and bolts for the door. She pauses and looks back, but looking at a clock, she dashes out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was watching the door when he suddenly hears Katherine giggle. He can hear her walking up to him and as he looks back, she gives him a surprise kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? How was she?\".<br>\r\n\"What?\".<br>\r\n\"Come on~. You cant fool me. I was asleep, you 2 were alone, and there is suddenly a new door between our rooms\".<br>\r\n\"Uhhh\".<br>\r\n\"I accidently fall asleep and she jumps you\". She gets in front of him and pushes him onto her bed. \"But, its my turn now and she wont be back for at least an hour\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes off his jeans and boxers. \"Karen didn't do this, did she?\".<br>\r\n\"Do what?\".<br>\r\n\"This\", she reaches between his legs and grabs his dick. After stroking and rubbing it, she gets on her knees and bends down. She starts to lick it along the shaft and tip before she covers it with her mouth. He releases into her mouth and she swallows it. Standing up, \"w-well? Did she do that?\".<br>\r\n\"No. She didn't\".<br>\r\n\"Good. Theres a point for me. Now, um, the next part\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off her bra and panties, she stands there, naked, in front of him, blushing and partially covering herself. Kyle tries to stand up, but Katherine puts a hand on his shoulder and asks him not to get up. She sits on his legs, facing him, his fully recovered dick pressing against her pussy as they both look at each other. Katherine takes off his shirt and they embrace. Eventually letting go of each other, she reaches between them and starts to gently stroke his member once more as he starts to play/suck on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had enough, and deciding that she was ready, Katherine slightly lifts her hips up. Positioning herself, she glides his dick inside her and begins to mover herself along his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs her hips and helps her. He then forces her all the way down as he shoots his load deep inside her as she screams, then collapses onto him, trying to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle puts his arms around her and starts to pet her head. She responds by pressing her head against his chest. \"Are you ok?\".<br>\r\n\"Yes. Just a little tired\".<br>\r\n\"Alright\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of resting. Katherine gets up and Kyle gets a good look at her. She looked happy, as cum was still dripping out of her and down his dick, which was still in her, and starts to get turned on again. A lets out a surprised sound as his dick stiffens inside her. \"Y-your still hard?....I I guess we can go again. But, lets try a different position. They get off of the bed and Katherine gets on her hands and knees. Kyle lifts her ass up and puts his cock back in her. They go at it again and its not long until Kyle unloads into her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle picks up the exhausted Katherine and lays her on her back. He spreads her legs and penetrates her again, with no complaints from her. He cums in her 5 more times before he is satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine was completely covered in cum. \"Man, I love this thing\", Kyle says as he looks at his ring. He then uses it to clean Katherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had fallen asleep. He puts her in her bed and thinks of what he should do next....</span></div></div>",

This was gonna be one heck of a year. Glancing at the ring, he slipped it on his hand again, feeling it tighten slightly as it slipped into place, as if it knew it belonged there. Thinking about the school, the ring glowed slightly, and in a blink Kyle was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeleporting back into bed, Kyle landed squarely between the twins, an arm wrapped and both of their still sleeping, and still naked.

Licking Kyle's juices from her fingers, she licks her lips then puts her head between Kyle's legs. She sniffs Kyle's pussy, taking in her scent, then starts to lick it. Kyle has her first orgasm and Tiffany doesnt stop licking. Eventually, she lifts her ass up and begins to lick her other hole. \"Not my ass\".

You, leave now. She's ours\".<br>\r\nKyle: \"No\".<br>\r\n\"Fine, we did warn you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them grabs him and raises his fist. But Kyle was a step ahead. Quickly, he grabs the guy's arm then knees him in his gut. With his opponent momentarily stunned, he grabs him, gives him several hits to his face, then throws him. The 2nd guy hits Kyle in the face from the side, he quickly recovers, avoids the next attack then kicks him away. Unfortunately, the 3rd guy managed to sneak his way behind Kyle and grab him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, huh? You would of won if there wasn't 3 of us!\".<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't of interfered! Now you'll pay for it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy he sent flying gets to his feet. He wipes some blood from the side of his face as well as spits some to the floor. \"Wait, I go first. He needs to pay for what he did to me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes his time walking over to him, then with a smirk, starts to hit him in his stomach over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle!\", Ellie yells, tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"What are you still doing here? Run away!\".<br>\r\n\"B-but!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's face gets hit. \"That should shut him up!\".<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how sweet. You should of run, girl\".<br>\r\n\"It's too late now. Your still coming with us!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way these 3 had treated her, and seeing Kyle getting beaten up was too much for Ellie. As one of the guys approached her, \"We're going to have a lot of fun with.....you.....\". His sentence and he himself freeze in place as he stares at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tears streaming down her face and with a look of pure anger on her face, she yells, \"LET GO OF HIM NOW!!!!!\", as an intense purple glow surrounds her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man backs up and the other 2 panic. Kyle just stares at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID LET GO OF HIM!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh course\", he says, releasing Kyle. \"No need to get so angry, just calm down\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late, whatever happened to her, she could no longer control it. Beams of the purple energy leapt from her body and strikes the 3 men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy covers their entire body and they begin to feel a strange sensation overcome them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one that was closest to her, he was first. He falls to the ground, clutching his chest. 2 lumps appear on them and expand. His hair lengthens as his ass gets bigger and he shrinks and slims down. With a confused look on her face, she looks up at Ellie, her clothes loosely on her. But that wasn't it. She tried to get up, but couldn't. Her feet had turned gray and she couldn't move them. Her entire body turned gray as she turned to stone, he clothes still loosely hanging onto her now petrified feminized body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2nd guy. It was quick. He was hit, vanished, and a bikini fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3rd and final guy, the one that was hitting him. As the beam hit and covered his body, he too was turned into a girl. Looking over her new body, he noticed something odd about her hand. There was a lot of hair, too much hair on it. The same thing was happening to the rest of his body as he felt a weird pain above her ass. A long bushy tail suddenly shoots out as he starts to shrink. Her hands and feet start to change shape as she is forced on all fours. Her ears get longer and softer as her mouth juts out and teeth sharpen. It finishes. Something was moving in the pile of clothes on the ground. A small yellow puppy emerges from the clothes and doesnt move, confused about what happened and what she should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow around Ellie fades and she rushes over to Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up at her, \"What did you just do? What was that?\".</span></div></div>",

They stare at each other, and Kyle reaches for her. She falls backwards and he picks her up. He lifts her up to his face, \"I guess this is more of your magic, huh? What were you trying to do? Sneak into my bed?\". She blushes and looks away. He smiles, \"you were.....All you had to do was ask\". Placing her back onto the bed, \"aren't you going to change back?\".<br>\r\n\".....Yeah\".

You know, about the hooded man and the drink\".<br>\r\n\"You know about that!\", she says, as she almost tackles Sarah\".<br>\r\nSarah: \"Of course I know, I went through the same thing\", she looks around and points at something, \"Over there, then I'll explain everything\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah leads Karen to a secluded area and they sit at a table with 2 benches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, tell me, who was that man and what was with that drink?\".<br>\r\nSarah: \"Lets see, where to start........I guess with that man, I have no idea who he is. All I know is that he did the exact same thing to me. About a month ago, he appeared, asked me my name, then game me the drink. Then, like you, I was.....compelled.....to drink it, then passed out and woke up. Same as you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would he do that? Is the drink suppose to do something?\".<br>\r\nSarah: \"Yes, it is. That drink gave me, and you, powers\".<br>\r\n\".....What?\".<br>\r\nSarah: \"I know, but thats what it does, I dont know why he does it, or how many hes given the drink to, I just dont know. But I guess a demonstration is in order\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah: \"Even though its late, I had to make sure to find a place where we wouldn't be disturbed. Time for some fun\". She puts a hand on the table, and it vanishes. Karen falls backwards, and Sarah stands over her. \"See? And this is only a small demonstration of what we're capable of!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah squats over Karen, then with a snap of her fingers, has Karen's and her clothes vanish. Karen tries to get up, but Sarah is stronger than she looks. Holding Karen down with one hand, she presses the other into Karen's breasts. Then, Sarah's tongue stretches out of her mouth and licks Karen's face. \"I'm going to enjoy this.....\".</span></div></div>",

A bulge presses out from Karen's stomach as Sarah presses against the inside with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she is doing this, her hands have been busy.

(I think I should leave.....).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome distance from the disturbance, she finds herself alone as she walks past a few stores.

Another snap, and he too freezes in place, then starts to scream. The others look at him, except for the leader and the guy he is currently attacking. The man begins to change. His skin turns a bright red as a pair of horns, black wings, and a tail appear on him. He then starts to shrink as his ass juts out and he grows a pair of huge breasts. The demon girl goes over to her \"mistress\" and asks what is it that she wants her to do. Her mistress replies, \"have fun\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon grabs 1 of her former comrades and swallows him whole. The remaining men flee in terror, but are stopped when Sarah erects a barrier around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah: You aren't going anywhere. You started this, and I'm going to finish it\". She then turns to Karen, \"you don't have to just stand there. Join in on the fun! These bastards deserve it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren nervously takes aim at 1 of the men, (w-what do I do?). She focuses on the 1st thing that she can think and \"fires\". The invisible attack hits the man and he starts transforming. His hair turns yellow and forms curls as it grows out. His body then starts to shrink as his arms and legs turn to stubs as a bow and blue and white dress appear on him. Karen had changed him into a doll.<br>\r\n\"W-what have I done!?\"<br>\r\nSarah places a hand on her shoulder, \"don't worry about it. These people are bad men. Who knows what else they have done over their lives before they ran into us\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and the demon girl finish off the rest of the men by transforming and devouring them. Sarah lifts the barrier. Grabbing 1 of Karen's hands, she leads her away from the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't leave them like that, can we??<br>\r\nSarah: I've already considered that. In a few hours it'll be like nothing happened. They'll change back, even yours, and turn themselves over to the police. I may take my fun a little farther than I should, but I fix it in the end.<br>\r\n\".....Really?\".<br>\r\nSarah: ....Yeah, why?<br>\r\n\"We didn't clean up that place we were at before\".<br>\r\nSarah: .....oops, well, no harm done there.
