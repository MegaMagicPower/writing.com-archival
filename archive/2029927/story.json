            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> This Fantasy Adventure Interactive will have five various races that I have chosen carefully to fill which ever desired race you wish to be.  The First choice is that of the Human race which will be generally the most adaptable of the four remaining races. They will have no particular talent in that unless specified in such. Such as Warriors having greater physical strength and knowledge in weaponry, if you choose them to have a specific weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The Second race  I chose for this interactive are Giants. The Giants are usually about One hundred feet tall and excel in physical activity. Although the Giants have little capacity to learn magic they still are able to learn it. Unfortunately there are other races that I have chosen that are much better at learning magic than them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The Third race for this race is one that excels in Magic, but lacks physical strength mostly due to there lack of size. They are known as Fairies whom are smaller than humans and are no bigger then four inches tall.  Due to there small stature stealing is easy for them, they're one of race to have the most effective magic.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Fourth race for the Interactive are the Orcs. According to most races Orcs are seen as savage and stupid creatures who don't know the difference of right and wrong and willing to do anything just to get an extra kill.  Although that is what is believed it is not actually true as Some Orcs can be as cunning as most humans or fairies. They're occasional impaired speech is usually due to them not understanding the human language very well.  They do however have greater physical strength  when compared to a human.  An Orc's capacity to learn magic however is somewhat less than that of a humans.  Which leads us finally to the final choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The fifth and final choice I have chosen for this interactive are Mermaids.  A Mermaid is a bit more unique when compared to other races as there abilities tend to reflect there nature and personality. One of their unique abilities is one that none of the mermaids under the water were even aware of which is the ability to have legs when they are completely dried up.  Although they do gain legs when completely dried up. However they wouldn't know how to walk or stand with them as they never had them before. Unless of course they are a mermaid who discovered this ability early on.  When a mermaid is in water they are one of the strongest and toughest to beat. A mermaid will also have greater magic abilities in water, however the further away from water and on land they are the weaker there magic and physical strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \tI hope you understand the differences between the five races that I have chosen. Now before you set off on your Fantasy Adventure Interactive which race will you be? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is there something that's bothering you?\" Loraine asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Yes, your father never mentioned what the witch wanted in return for the cure.

However something seemed off. Sure judging by his girth he started bulking up early, but he seemed a bit too fat for this time of year. Dragons normally spend a few months during the fall gaining as much weight as they can to prepare for hibernation. During that time they enter an annual growth spurt. Once spring comes dragons are usually five to ten feet taller and may have some excess flab to work off or sell to practitioners of magic. You then glance at the sleeping Princess Loraine. The effects of the Slumber Flower must be reversed as soon as possible. If this dragon can help then maybe you wouldn't need Esmerelda's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Lionshield! I'm glad I found you!\" the dragon roared as he made a heavy landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What seems to be the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A warlock who calls himself the White Wolf has just placed a curse on this land!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of curse?\" Shalla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A curse that affects the weather. Just look up in the sky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your party, minus Loraine who's out like a light, notice a dark cloud that blotted out the sun. It then starts snowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winter not for months. Why White Wolf change weather?\" Torque inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspect he's trying to force my species to gain so much weight that we give him a life time supply of Dragon Lard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cruel, but smart for making money. Dragon Lard isn't common during the summer or spring season or even early fall. The only time there's an abundance is during the winter season or late fall.\" Gilda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Disturbing the balance of nature like this will only cause chaos. My mate is trying to keep her fellow dragons from giving in to the weather induced hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lionshield, the Witch of the Forest that you, Shalla, and Torque know, wouldn't she be able to reverse a curse like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She would if she wasn't in Gimunga. She and her comrades made a deal with Prince Goliath. So she'll be teaching giants how to use magic for a week or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case can you wake up our friend? She was recently put under a sleeping curse via Slumber Flower Pollen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asked the right dragon. Dragon magic is one of the most powerful forms of magic; it is only rivaled by fairy magic. However, breaking sleeping curses is what dragons do best. You see each race has their own specified magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn, I don't even know my own kind's magic. I only know orc magic.\" Shalla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A water fairy like yourself should be able to learn fairy magic easily. Each form of magic has different incantations. Trust me, we dragons spend lifetimes learning every race's magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then place Loraine before the dragon. The dragon appears to be ready to breath fire, but you notice that instead of flames it's dragon phermones. You remember your younger twin sister telling you that even dragon pheromones are magical and probably every aspect of a dragon considering how the pelts they shed make great armor, which yet again only occurs during spring. Once doused in pheromones you notice Loraine starting to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... Rey... Reymond? What happened to your father and who are these people. Also what's up with the snow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The snow is the result of a warlock. Unfortunately that Cyrone character and the maid were you know who and her minion. Yet he said something about his inner demon within him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's just cryptic, but first we must return the weather to normal. I may know just the spell, but first we have to deal with the warlock. Thanks Gildorum for breaking that curse that I was under.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you princess.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You then see a tall and fat monk standing over you. Judging by his size and robe you assume that he's from the Terranova Order. You heard that the clergy of this order live in the mountains and dedicate their time tending to nature, the needs of travellers, and strengthen their bodies and minds through rigorous training. The rumors of the Terranova Order having hefty clergymen didn't come as a surprise for you and your mentor, Melvin Marvin, often traverse the mountains when traveling to other towns. You then realize the tower that you and your mentor were exploring was near a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, you were passed out when you were brought to the lodge. I heard that you were attacked by a succubus when you were exploring the tower. How did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the creation of an evil mirror. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are talking about the Mirror of Fear. They say that the Mirror of Fear was by a sisterhood of witches and a brotherhood of warlocks.  Infact the Dark Circle as they were called created several more like it upon other dangerous artifacts. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there are six more like it?\" You gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That should be correct. In the past the Church worked with the Seven Star Guild. Unfortunately after the Demon was defeated the Church quickly became corrupt. To make matters worse the Queen wanted the Church destroyed. The Church was wiped out along with the Seven Star Guild, but from the Church's demise came the Orders of the Living One. Each of the Orders were composed of clergymen and mage from the guild. By forming these orders we were able to preserve ancient spells both arcane and divine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you used an ancient blessing to revive me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct.  The blessing I used consists of using water in a mountain side river. After drawing water we clergymen sprinkle the water over the near dying victim.  The blessed water evaporates into a Divine energy that restores a person's life force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I have to find my mentor. We have to go back to the tower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately he's in therapy.  That monster that resembled a mob merged at every way possible has been giving him nightmares. Everyone he sees a full market place he sees every person merge together to create the monster. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll Marvin wasn't much of a people person, but I had no idea that he was afraid of large crowds. Yet when it came to company he only could handle ten visitors at a time. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because he's afraid that people would think that he's insane.  On a semi related note, are you afraid of women or just succubi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Both unfortunately.  I was abused by my mother when I was a child. Every night she would return home drunk and harm me with her weapons. One night my parents killed each other. My father was protecting me from drunken mother. In the end they both pierced each other through the stomach. That night I became an orphan. The following day as I set off to find some sort of work I was mugged by a group of homeless girls.  They took everything I had and left me naked. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That's horrible! How did you survive? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I was taken in by a charasmatic man. He was good looking and popular with the ladies. He also had a daughter, but I can't recall her name. It was that instance that I met Marvin. At the time Marvin was visiting his family, the man and daughter that I mentioned previously . Yet when it came between the Warlock of the Forest's daughter and myself we didn't see eye to eye. For starters I was terrified of her. Despite her kindness and popularity among boys she scared the living daylights out of me when she practiced magic. I was afraid that she would say an incantation incorrectly or cast a curse on me for revenge. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must mean the Witch of the Forest. She's popular with men, but she keeps getting thrown in jail by jealous women. Hopefully she can find a guy that understands her without acting like a perv. The last rumor I heard was that she was almost tortured by men who wanted to fulfill their perverted desires. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That reminds me of the Warlock of the Forest's death four years ago. I was 16 at the time and training under Marvin. It was out of the blue that Marvin's son was being molested by women who couldn't resist his good looks. The women demanded that he take off his clothes for them, but he refused. It was at that time that the men of the town burned Marvin's son alive. Soon afterward the men who murdered Marvin's son started hitting on his granddaughter and the women were trying to do unto her what the men did to her father. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is strange. Normally natural carisma shouldn't cause that. Sounds like a family curse. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a curse. It's just genetic. Marvin's wife's side of the family was known for aging gracefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I see.  I now know why you're afraid of women.  So much of the tragedy of your life involved women.  I'll help you over come gynophobia. The priestess seeing your mentor should be able to help as you explore the rest of the tower. I think I see her now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings brother Samson, I see the young wizard has finally awoken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct sister Gracia. How goes your patient?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's getting better. I gave him some herbs to help with nightmares. I may have to make some medicine to cure him of his hallucinations. Whenever 12 or more people are in a room he starts freaking out. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister, we should accompany the wizard and his mentor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure brother? He looks like he's about to pass out. He didn't start sweating until I came over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was  recently attacked by a succubus created from one of the Mirrors of Fear. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So I'm scaring him? I'm so sorry mister, but I wish you no harm. I'll do all in my power to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracia then curtsies and walks away.</span></div></div>",

It began with the Head Magi of the Seven Star Guild, someone who already had passed talking to his disciples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Greetings, I have some grave news for you all today, soon the great Demon will awaken and we will need to prepare for it.  However  we need to weaken it before we seal it, otherwise it will breakthrough.\"  The Head Magi Said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" How will we do that? We don't have the physical strength to deal with it.\" One of his disciples asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I know that, but fortunately I have found that when lands unite together for a common cause our strength can be much greater than that of the Great Demon, but first we need a Giant to hold back the Demon's great strength, An Orc Warrior to Keep it distracted From us, A Mermaid for the Magic of the Moon, and A fairy to blindside it.

At some point you expected this to be some sort of trap or something, but thankfully it wasn't.  Fortunately with Leanne guiding you towards the giant finding her turned out to be easier then you thought. You went and looked at this massive giant and saw that for now she was still asleep. Apparently even she managed to get some sleep last night, which in turn helped the fairies rest as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" She's asleep let's wake her up.\" You suggested but both Leanne and Gracia were against that idea. \" NO! Let her sleep for a bit. To a fairy she's incredibly huge, but towards a normal human being she's just a child of a giant.\"  You looked at the giant woman knowing your fear and saw that Leanne was right, a normal giant would be at least one hundred feet tall, much taller than this one who appears to be only thirty five feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" How did a child of a giant end up here?\" You ask.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I am not sure but I'm sure once she's awake we can ask her. For now let's examine her while she's asleep.\" Gracia answered. Leanne, Gracia and you then begin examining the sleeping giant. It was when she started moving her leg that you noticed the actual problem. Apparently this young child had broken her leg, and the pain and agony of that broken leg was what was  causing her to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Her leg is broken, we need to fix it soon. Fortunately we may have enough herbs to fix it.\" Leanne said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Wouldn't it be easier to just use magic on her? You know like a healing spell or something?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"NO! Although we have magic and can help many of our kind with it the main problem still remains, aside form that even though she isn't as big as other giants it would take too much energy for a person of our size to completely heal a broken leg of this size, so practical methods would be much better.\"  Gracia answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The young giant girl was soon to wake up but unfortunately Leanne and Gracia were not yet done treating her leg. You quickly went to the girl to were her face was lying and decided to tell her to stay still. \" Hello There, Listen I need you to stay still for a bit I know you just woke up but try to stay still okay?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The young giant girl yawns kind of surprised to see someone next to her. Fortunately you being by her side like this you are able to keep her calm enough from crying. \" My name is Estelle, what are you doing in Gimonga?\" The Giant girl ask.  From what you can tell she still thinks she's in Gimonga which could be a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" This isn't Gimonga Estelle. This is the fairy forest do you remember how you got here?\" You ask her hopeful that she will not be upset by the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" The trees do look smaller, and I do remember some kind of bet with my friend, he dared me to climb down the beanstalk but I think it was chopped down when I was almost down to the ground and then I hit my leg on something and it hurt a lot! Yet I don't feel that much pain while I'm resting here but I'm sure once I get up I will feel it again.\"  Estelle told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Fortunately by now Leanne and Gracia were done with bandaging her leg, and even had a specially made walking stick for the young giant. From what you could tell Estelle seemed to be around three to seven years old you haven't yet asked, when you heard an explosion come off from the far distance!

So your talking about the Witch of Weslone, Marlani Jadestone aka the Black Swan. We Lords of darkness have no ties for her, but i9f the ancient demon was released it would make accomplishing our goals much easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What goals?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To spread corruption. Evil has been the natural course this world has been heading towards. Unleashing every possible evil will help speed up the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just vile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but it is what sounds vile that brings the most joy. Do you know who caused the fire at the monastery? Did they tell you who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I guess it was Marlani.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only partially correct. Another dark fairy who goes by the name name Sakara enjoys destruction and bloodshed. Among us dark fairies Sakara once killed an army of ogres by herself because she was bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but unlike Sakara I enjoy seeing heroes turn dark. Whether a through a curse, hypnotism, or merely greed. Heroes are a thing of the past. They are only clogs that disrupt the natural flow of darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heroes are needed without them slavery will be rampant, demons will roam the earth, and the world would be left to anarchy and bloodshed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then this next question shall be easy for you to answer human. Will you let your mentor die? Is his knowledge truly needed? There are so many magicians who already wrote down everything he studied. Why let an old man like that live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mentor's son took me in while I was a child! The warlock of the Forest may be dead, but I will not betray his kindness by letting his daughters' grandfather and his father die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is out of loyalty,\" Morgan said as he removed his spell from Gracia. \"You disgust me. Concepts like love and loyalty are weakness. Only those who serve themselves are truly strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shrinks down to his original size. He then flings you and Gracia against the beanstalk with his dark magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were strong you would have been able to with stand my attack. As much as I would like to kill pathetic heroes such as yourselves I have better things to do. Farewell wretched humans and live your miserable lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan then flies off and towards the fairy city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Estelle is safe, but that was most disturbing.\" Gracia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy was trying to attack what I believe in. He was trying to corrupt me. Unfortunately fairies have one of the world's strongest magics. Ranking behind them is dragon magic.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to continue on our quest.

You still have a job to do, but first you have to make sure you can lose the dragon. Once dragons wake up and someone stole from them they can keen on hunting the thief down. This would set you back by two days, but if you can steal a horse you can make up for lost time. Also knowing dragons, it doesn't take them long to fly to most places due to their impressive speed, but you have to make sure not to talk to people wearing the color scheme of the dragon. Sometimes dragons would transform into a human form to find out info or to track their prey and you know lying would never work since dragons are extremely smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then head in the opposite direction of Marina and make sure that you take cover in the forest. You intended to head to a town in the mountains. Fortunately you can take a shortcut to get there. As a child you remember that underground there were portals that linked any nearby town.

She apparently collapsed after meeting the wicked witch Marlani who was infamously nicknamed the Black Swan due to her youthful beauty and cunning seduction of any man who crossed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong ma'am?\" Michael asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dream is already coming true! We must stop the Black Swan before it is too late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't the Black Swan reside in Weslone?\" Michael asked still puzzled by what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct but we must gather the ingredients to make a cure. Going to Weslone is too dangerous. Every man that goes there starts worshiping the ground she walks on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the same thing happen to you? Wait a second, it sounds like some of the men from the village are raiding your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? No man besides you has seen the inside of my humble abode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear a crash of a metal vase and rumbling coming from your bedroom. You go to look and see five men raiding your undergarments. Your face flushes red as you feel rather embarrassed that the men would stoop so low. You begin sweating as they look at you in a perverted way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys it's the Witch of the Forest. Why don't we tie her up and torture her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then scream as then lunge at you. Your so frightened that you couldn't concentrate to use a spell to tie them up with plants. Just as it seemed hopeless you see Michael punch each of them in the jaw. They then retreat and drop your undergarments. You begin sobbing violently into Michael's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay now. Let's just focus on stopping the Black Swan by curing the Queen. How long do think it will take to make the cure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill upset at what almost happened you continue to cry. Michael seeing at how tragic something like that could be started preparing some tea for you. An hour later the tea is ready along with some freshly cooked deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go. You need to eat..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin sipping the tea and eating the plate of deer meat. You begin regaining your senses and wait until you are done with your meal to talk to your hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will take a three or four weeks to find the ingredients and to make the medicine. The recipe is from my father. My father was a great magician, but he was killed by an angry mob of men who were jealous of his good looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.

We need a pure one because it amplifies the potency of the recipe.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Sounds simple, enough. I don't think we will have any trouble getting that.\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Most people think so, but finding a pure one is harder than some people think, after all just cause a crystal is clear doesn't mean it's a pure one. Not only that but the cave has some goblins in it, and I don't think they will just let us in to find the Crystal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You and Michael continued down your path towards the Crystal Caverns. As you traveled along your path about an hour away from the cave you ran into what you saw to be a fairy on an Orc's shoulder! This was a bit confusing to you, As you traversed this path many times and knew that both the Orc and the fairy weren't native to this particular area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Of course it wasn't much of a surprise when they stopped you either. \"  You!\" The Orc yelled. \"Return My Fathers Soul to his grave now!\" The Orc demanded, but not from you, instead from Michael.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Did you do something to this Orc Michael?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of Course not, I have no idea what he's talking about.\"  Michael replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" We didn't take your father's soul Orc!\" You yelled to him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Lies! You humans came and eliminated our tribe forcing us to be exiled, then you stole this poor Orc's  Father sword from his grave! Now his soul can't rest in peace until we find that sword!\" The fairy yelled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Defeat me! Prove Words True.\" The Orc said as he was pointing towards Michael. Apparently from what you could figure out there would be no way to settle this without a fight. Of course it seemed that the Orc was only interested in battling with Michael and had no quarrel with you. The fairy on the other hand would probably use magic to fight you if you interfered with there fight, that is if Michael accepts the Orcs challenge. Does he?</span></div></div>",

His was more defensive and what was even more amazing, was that he hadn't even moved an inch from when he started!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    When Michael was finally tired and worn out, the Orc struck Michael's sword after that and pointed his at his neck. You were about to intervene, when the Orc just simply put his sword away after he had won the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Weren't you trying to kill me?\" Michael asked, bewildered by the Orc's actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You fight honest, Not thief who took father's soul.\" The Orc said.  The Orc then looked at you and moved towards you. He then simply asked you a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Will you Release Shalla now? I show mercy, you do same?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   From what you knew from history books you read, Orcs usually enslaved Fairies, yet this one seem to treat it as a friend. You could easily kill the fairy. However since he showed mercy to your companion, there was no reason not to do the same to his. You then quickly release Shalla from the bottle you had trapped her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Thanks, Torque I'm glad to be out of that place!\" Shalla said excitedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Guess we will be going our separate paths' now right?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Torque the Orc, thought about for a moment, \" Idea, We help you, You help us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" How can you help us?\"  Michael asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Teach Fight Better for you!\" Torque said as he pointed towards Michael.

Of course, we wont just go and attack people blindly like we have been doing for the past week, but before that The Human and Torque need to shake hands now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Why is that?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"To End there duel! Your Michael lost but his duel wont be finished until he accepts it ended by shaking his hand.\" Shalla explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      With that explanation out of the way, Michael went and shook Torque's hand. It was here  that  you saw that Michael felt a  sensation, that was almost like a premonition from what he could tell.  It was there he saw a strange figure standing next to a Black Swan, with a great Sword encrusted with a strange bluish green jewel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Michael Are you alright?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm okay, it's just I had a strange daydream, about a Black Swan, and  a strange figure standing there next to it with  a strange bluish green jewel embedded into this sword.\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That's Father's Soul!\" Torque said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Could this Black swan also of been responsible for what happened in Torque's home, if so why?

The dragon thrashes around wildly for a  bit and you continue to hold your barrier.

If your going to stop the person who's caused all this I will let you have it, but don't take anything else!\" The dragon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I understand will take only the crystal.\" You said. You and Michael ventured towards where the dragon said to go, luckily it was a rather easy trip with little resistance, mostly due to the fact the blood lust spell was no longer there. As you saw the crystal, \" This is it, the one We've been looking for and just like the dragon said it isn't tainted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" How did the person who tainted the crystal's miss this one?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"They didn't miss it, they just didn't know it existed, finally got one of the ingredients, only four more to go.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \" What exactly are the ingredient's for this spell?\" Michael asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" The First ingredient is a clear and pure crystal, the second is a Mermaid's tear,  then we will need the toenail of a giant. As for the final ingredient, well I'll tell you that when we have the remaining two ingredient's.\" You said. Michael then nodded, you continued and exited the Crystal caverns, thankfully none of the other goblins attacked, but now you had to decide, to go to the Land of the Giants and get the toenail, or towards the sea where you can find a Mermaid's tear. The tear of a Mermaid is a difficult one to get, mostly cause the mermaids hardly ever come out of the ocean, which means that you would need the help of someone who's actually seen a Mermaid. Going to get the giant's toenail on the other hand requires going to the land of giants, which is somewhat close to Weslone, in fact there's a town two day's from Weslone that you'd have to travel to in order to get there.

Apparently from what you could tell they had just recently returned from what looked like a brutal battle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You see that, It's him the Legendary Lion Warrior!\" A peasant exclaimed.  Many of the peasants came and turned to just gather and gain the attention of the Warrior. You however weren't interested and glad that the attention wasn't on you for a change. Michael on the other hand was very excited and rushed towards to meet with the Lion Warrior himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"MIchael, What are you doing?\" You asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I am going to see the great Lion Warrior! What else perhaps he'll even listen to us.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You then quickly gave him a bop on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ow! What did you do that for?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" There's no reason to bother them yet, we have a goal to accomplish.\" You told him. Of course from your experiences you highly doubt they would believe you even if you told them of the danger. In fact from your experiences you know the warrior types usually take it as a threat, rather than a warning. Much to your surprise however Reymond Lionshield was approaching you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Good Evening My Lady, How are you doing today?\" Reymond asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I am doing fine, if you don't mind though, I have business to go to in Marina.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Marina I remember that town!  There holding the Golden Sword Challenge there, this year. In fact me and my father are heading that way ourselves. Care if we tag a long for the ride?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Michael managed to reach you through the crowd, he couldn't help but notice Reymond speaking to you. He himself tried not to show it, but when you saw him you knew he was trying to hide his jealousy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Michael, Reymond  wants to travel to Marina with us, You alright with that?\" You asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Michael quickly responded by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

At least for now you'll have some temporary travelling companions to Marina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to be able to travel alongside you. You don't have to tell us your quest right now.

Speaking of Mom I believe she's off selling the weapons that you and her made.\" Reymond said to his father in a rebuking manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please forgive my father milady, but he is still suffering from some personal issues. One day he'll be put in his place when a princess draws a sword on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Reymond. I just hope that Michael doesn't get himself into trouble.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I completely understand.

Now behave yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reymond, sometimes you're too polite for your own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see his jealousy that he has. I have no intentions of stepping in between their romance. I was just trying to be a friend. I hope that the famous Witch of the Forest can talk some common sense into him.

She is quick to respond. \" Not long she just recently got them and once she had them she just had to try them out on every one. You are bringing her to justice for her crimes and she does deserve it, but then why ask me about her magic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" The Power I sensed from her when I first met her seemed familiar to me, but yet somehow not quite hers yet.\" You then continued. \" That felt a little off to me so I suspect there may be more to this then I thought, besides she kind of reminds me of my sister. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I think I get it now, you think when she first got her magic that she became enthralled with her own power and now it' s controlling her, instead. Is that really even possible?\" The woman asks.  You nod indicating that it is possible you aren't exactly sure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      During your chat Reymond began to take care of the snipers, at first they were staying hidden and out of his sight. It was one of the more annoying battles he had. He didn't want to take there live's simply cause they were enchanted to follow Lady Constance's commands.  The first of the snipers was the easiest as he kept aiming his arrows from the same position which lead to Reymond using his shield and bashing the Sniper until he was knocked out. The second was a bit more harder as he moved, but he had made one big mistake and that was wearing lot's of metal as he moved from place to place, allowing Reymond to find his location and knock him out as well.  Now the third sniper wore lighter armor and was harder to hear, but fortunately he was able to be found only because this sniper was impatient and eager to get on with it.  With that there was only one more sniper to go and he would be the most difficult to find as he was both patient and calculating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Reymond fortunately had an idea on how to find him. He came back to you and said. \" I found them, all three of them. You can lower your magic barrier now.\"  You didn't know what his plan was but from the look on Reymond's face and the gesture of his hands you could tell he had some sort of plan to take out the last sniper. But you weren't exactly sure if his plan would even work. Deciding to trust his judgement you let down your magic barrier, but will the final sniper take the bait?</span></div></div>",

During this time your father had sent for someone to tutor you and your sister in the ways of magic. His name was Melvin and he had an odd thing to always give you riddles as homework, which were sometimes fun but also annoying if you weren't able to figure them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Sis, let's drink that potion, I\"m sure it'll be fun.\" Your sister said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I don't know, it's Melvin's potion and he did say that we shouldn't touch any of his stuff, even if we just see it lying around our house.\" You told her but despite that she grabbed the potion anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I'm sure it will be fine, maybe it's something to make us even more powerful and he wants us to drink it? He always gives us riddles so I\"m sure it'll be fine..Look he even labeled it with some sort of riddle.\" Your sister said.  You looked at the label and she was right it was a riddle label. Although you still couldn't help feel that you shouldn't drink it. Despite that you read the label first before drinking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Even after reading the riddle you didn't exactly understood what it meant, but when the potions effects began as you walked outside you realized that it was a potion that made both you and your sister small, small enough for a frog to eat. Fortunately when Melvin finally returned to teach you some more, he saved both you and your sister from being eaten by a giant frog or at least it was to you. You finally hear the words of Reymond as you begin to stop daydreaming about the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Hey, Are you alright?\" Reymond asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Yeah, I'm fine but could you take care of that thing? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I have no problem about slaying it, but why are you so afraid?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Part of you wants to tell him, but another part of you kind of wants to keep that part of you private eventually while he's talking to you  decide to...</span></div></div>",

You remember reading several textbooks on the Seven Star Guild, but never imagined encountering such a dangerous artifact. If you remember correctly there were six sister mirrors with the same name. The mirror of fear takes a person's worst fear(s) and uses them to destroy all who dark gaze at it. Very few people survive after looking into the mirror.

You were stuck to the ground due to some toad mucus which completely grossed you out. Despite all that going against you, you were determined not to let the mirror win as you concentrated the last ounce of your magic power towards the mirror of fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The Mirror shattered resulting in a massive shock wave to the area causing all of the windows to break! Any one under a spell was suddenly free, and the Incubus and the giant frog dissipated. You can't help but remember the final words of the incubus as the spell went away. \" I'll be back for you, Sooner than you think!\"  The incubus then vanished from your sight giving you a slightly irritating wink. With all the spells undone Lady Constance was exhausted from so many spells on the town that it caused her to feint. Those who were loyal to her tried to protect her, but with the spells gone those who wished for justice finally got the upper hand.  It was soon known that Lady Constance was arrested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It took about a day of rest for you to be fully healed and all the four of you were back together once again. It was a tough and tiring battle and it was finally over, fortunately Michael had something to tell you that happened shortly after you destroyed the mirror. \" Michael you said you have something to tell me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Yes, Remember the Dragon we helped earlier? While you were asleep he came by and told us someone stole a magic bean from him.

Come with me and I'll show you a little fun in the exotic room.\" The pirate said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Exotic room? What do you take me for someone who does what ever YOU want?\" You ask him. As you look over to him and see that grin on his face. He is obviously trying to do exactly that. Shortly after you were just about to cast another spell, Michael comes and punches the guy in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ow! That hurt! Your going to pay for that!\" The pirates begin to start attacking both you and Michael, not concerned about who they hurt or even if any one is in there way. Thankfully the beach was already empty with just pirates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" It better hurt! I'm protecting this woman and you'll have to go through me to get to her!\" Michael proclaimed, of course he had to give the pirates the idea that if they got through him they would be able to get to her, which was a nice romantic gesture but not the smartest thing to say to a pirate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Where's the Other two?\" You asked Michael wondering about the Lionshield warriors that you were traveling with. He was thankfully quickly to answer while avoiding being hit from the pirates. You could obviously tell that Michael's skill with the sword did indeed improve but he still wasn't as strong as the other two you had with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" They went to mine some ore, to make themselves new swords. I don't see what's so wrong with buying the one's at the shop though.\" Michael answered.  Michael was getting tired and worn out from fighting. You decided to use some of your magic to help. You cast a few spells knocking a few pirates out. It was then the pirate's started to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That woman she's a witch! Run for the ship!\" One pirate yells, the rest follow but thankfully one of them you manage to capture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Alright you, What is this Exotic Room I've heard about?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I'll tell, I'll tell just don't turn me into anything I'll speak.\" He says, you nod and then he begins to continue. \" Long ago we pirates discovered proof that there were mermaids and that there tears were highly valuable in the black market, so we began selling some to the thieves guild here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n What are you talking about there is no Thieves Guild in this town.\" Michael interrupted the captured pirate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Ha! Shows what you know! The Adventurer's Guild is actually a false name, that's where the thieves all plan who they rob and stuff! If the Princess knew that she'd be tearing it down herself, but thankfully no one has the guts to do that.\"   You could tell Michael that he was angry and upset about that, especially after all the tales in Thistle town that tell of how great this Adventurer's Guild is, only to find it a fake must have hurt him quite bad. You couldn't let him continue to interrupt though as you do have a mission to complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Do you sell the Mermaids or the tears?\" You ask him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" The Mermaids of course they would rather have that so they can get them to farm the tears, rather than continuous pay. Of course sometimes an accident happens and they need replenishment. So we go out and hunt for more.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You thought Thistle Town was bad when you were near it. So far this town has made Thistle town look like a decent place to live despite it's shortcomings. From what the pirate told you was that they were selling Mermaids which technically belonged to there won nation and the pirate activities could trigger a war between Mermaids and Humans. It was then that you made a decision to help this town as much as possible. Only problem was that you knew it wasn't going to be easy since the Thieves control practically everything around here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Can I go now? I've told you all that I know.\" The pirate asks. You then reluctantly let him go. As much as you wanted to attack him earlier for attacking you. You knew that you couldn't just stoop to his level. The pirate then ran from you as quickly as he can. It was then Micheal told you something quite remarkable he said..</span></div></div>",

You could tell that being a town guard himself he was quite disappointed in that guards actions. He was so disappointed that he started to go up to the guard and speaking to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Hey! Your are a guard your suppose to protect the people! Not Extort them!\" He said to the guard. The guard just took one look at him and then said. \" You are under Arrest for Extortion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" But I didn't do..\" The guard then interrupted Michael. \" Silence!

In the dream you were sixteen during that time. You and your father, Romarro were walking in the forest. Your father was in his mid 40s, but he looked like he was only in his late 20s or early 30s.

You abandoned your post.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I didn't abandon my post..I was..\" It was then that Michael was interrupted by a woman who looked strangely somewhat familiar to him, yet somehow wasn't the same person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" They wont listen to any of your pleas, but I can get you out of here, of course all you'd have to do is abandon everything else.\" The woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Abandon everything else? That doesn't seem like a good deal, who are you anyways?\"  Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I'm the cause of everything, well maybe not everything but quite a few certain events.\" The woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was then that Michael realized that he was talking to none other than the Black Swan herself! It was quite unusual for her to appear out of the forest. It was even more unusual for her to appear in a city such as this, but as you could see from the guards ignoring everything, they did indeed fear this woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" But before  I even try to free you, I need you to strip off all your clothing.\" The Black Swan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" My friend was already asked this question, Why do you think I would do that for you?\" Michael ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" You ignorant fool! I'm not asking you to do it for my pleasure. I need to see if you have the Demon's Mark!\" The Black Swan replied. \" Why else would that woman continue to travel with a bodyguard that is somewhat incompetent. You must have it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I don't know what your talking about. What mark? Which woman?\"  Michael asked completely oblivious to what the Black Swan was talking about. It didn't take the Black Swan long to figure out that her so called sister has told him very little about the legend of the great demon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" It seems you really don't know, and she's told you very little, but no matter you still wish to escape here don't you. Pledge your loyalty to me and I assure you it will be rewarding. I'll leave you so you can think about it. \" The Black Swan said and within seconds she vanished from Michael's sights leaving him some time to think about her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You and your group had arrived at the entrance towards the Golden Sword tournament and just as you did you were fortunate to spot...</span></div></div>",

After saying that you began to silently as possible cast a sleep spell that would put all the pirates guarding the door asleep. Once the incantation was finished you threw the energy of the spell towards the area of the pirates and by some form of luck they all fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  '\" That's one fight we don't have to fight now, just make sure not to wake them when you take the key's from them.\" You told the group.

Our next preliminary match is sure to bring some excitement. Put your hands together for the man of the hour. It's none other than The Nefarious and Unruly Captain Crossblade himself! Fighting off against what appears to be an Elf an unusual person to be in this region or area even in this tournament. \" The announcer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd goes wild as Captain Crossblade flexes. Michael noticed that he was the type of man any woman would flirt with. Tall, musclebound, and brave. Michael was curious about how an elf would show up in this country. From the books he's read they live on a secluded island and that many unfortunate sailors never find it or they lose their lives once they hear a mermaid's song via shipwreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think will win?\" Mathis asked Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the elf will win. I've never seen one, but legends say that they're known for their agility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I bet Captain Crossblade will win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm certain the elf's gonna win. I bet all the gold I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I make the same bet as well. You'll be sorry once you lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile You, Gareth, Naphtali, Bartus, Erin, and Percy were searching for the mermaids and mermen. As you approach the center of the guild you spot Captain Crossblade's first mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what we got here. So you're here for the mermaids and mermen. You'll have to get through me first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shouldn't be a problem. Our friend already put your captain and the rest of his crew under a sleeping spell.\" Naphtali replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad our captain isn't here. He's competing in the Golden Sword Tournament as we speak. The man your sorceress put to sleep was an imposter, a man merely paid by the captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can still take you on!\" Percy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be true if I was alone. You see many at the Thieves' Guild are pirates, notorious thieves or highly trained assassins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dagger comes flying at you. Luckily, your magic barrier deflects the dagger. You then spot a woman in skimpy attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlotte! You're an assassin as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I am a talented thief besides starting recently. You see I have no choice in this matter. The thing that Mathis said he was here for was to see his cousin. Who would of thought that he would be related to Killian Crossblade. Apparently the two have a strong family bond and a strong friendly rivalry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your allies prepare to face off against the thieves, assassins, and Killian's first mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at the Golden Sword Tournament the match, the duel between Captain Crossblade and the elf was intense. At every turn they met blow for blow, but as time went on it looked obvious that the elf was tiring out and that Michael was quickly losing his bet. Finally at the climax of the match the elf attempts to strike Captain Crossblade only to be countered. Then with one quick thrust Captain Crossblade knocks the elf's sword out of his hand and out of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The match is over! Captain Crossblade wins!\" the announcer shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers wildly as Captain Crossblade flexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I thought the elf would win. You knew this would outcome would happen!\" Michael said angrily at Mathis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't lie, but yes I did. I already took the liberty of collecting up on that wager though. You see Captain Crossblade and I are cousins if you didn't notice the strong resemblance in how most ladies can't resist him. I would love to chat, but the next match coming up is starring yours truly and I hate not to put on a show for my adoring public. Farewell my fine simpleton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMathis then disappears through the crowd as the announcer announces Mathis's name and the name of someone else. Michael then walks through the crowd grumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First I get thrown in jail only to be freed and conned by a thief into betting all the gold I own. At least I can try to find Esmerelda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael? How did you get out of jail?\" Reymond asked after noticing Michael in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was bailed out by a thief only to lose a bet against said thief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be talking about Mathis. We already know he's here competing in the tournament. Now a can finally get my payback. I'll make him pay for stealing my necklace!\" Alyssa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reymond who's this girl and where is your father and Esmerelda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Alyssa Bronze. Your friend went to take down the Adventurer's Guild with Bartus. They were planning on rescuing you, but it seems Mathis freed you because you looked like an easy victim to con. He tends to do that men. I've heard that in a game of cards he always cheats and in tournaments like these he knows how to read opponents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do? Esmerelda may be in danger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Mike. I'm sure she's in good hands.\" Reymond said in order to calm the love stricken Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

However they forgot a few things and severely underestimated you and your friends. The First of which they forgot was that Bartus Lionshield an experienced warrior was with you. You were confident he could defeat most of these thieve's and assassins with ease and your faith him was well rewarded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \" Is that the best you can do? Or did you forget who you are up against?\" Bartus said. They kept attacking and you kept moving forward. Of course it wasn't just Bartus that they underestimated but the two Royal Guards as well. As you saw in the fight between the two groups these two guards weren't just chosen randomly, In fact if the Princess did send them here, it was because she knew they were the best to take on  a den of thieve's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Don't Underestimate the Royal Guard, We protect and Serve our Kingdom!\" The two Royal guards had said. Then there was you. You were taught by one of the best Magic user's your father.  Using your magic you were able to defeat the thieve's and move on to the next area but you still had another thing blocking your path and you decided that the best way to do this would be to let Bartus handle the first mate while you and the other's go and save the mermaids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Bartus, we can't risk them using the mermaids as hostage's will leave the rest up to you.\" You tell him. He only gives you a small smile, it seems that's what he wants as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You think I'd let you reach them! No Way!\" Killian yells and prepare's to attack you. Fortunately Bartus defends you allowing you and the remaining in your group to reach the Mermaids.  Lady Charlotte was in agreement and was about to run after you when you said something that grabbed her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I think these people are keeping a truth from you.\" You tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" No that can't be! I trust them.\" She yelled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" But do they trust you, enough to look at there documents. How about a wager I wager that their's a secret they are keeping from you that they don't want you to find out in the Captain's quarters why don't you go there instead of following us instead.\" You suggested little did Lady Charlotte know was that you cast a spell of uncertainty on her with those words, she then rushed off and abandon her post uncertain of what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I'm your opponent! Your attention should be on me!\" Bartus says. Killian doesn't like it, but it seems has no choice. You and your companions eventually reach the exotic room and see all the merman and mermaids there are in bad shape. Erin was so horrified by what she saw that she wanted to look away but before she could Percy spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Don't turn away Erin, remember this so you can see what those bad humans would do to us if we were caught again. Perhaps when all this is over we can come to an agreement of some sorts that would be beneficial to Humans and our kin.\" Percy said. Maybe he was right and that day would come but for now you had to free the mermaids and get them out of there fast the only question is how?</span></div></div>",

With that you, Erin and Percy began casting the spells making an ice connection from where the mermaids our to directly towards the ocean.  Fortunately Erin's plan works far better then you imagined. But you knew there were still two more mermaids that had to return now, mostly so that they can deal with the Mermaid queen herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Erin, Percy it's your turn now you have to deal with the queen and make sure all the others get to safety. \" You tell them. They both nod and understand what you are saying after all this was part of the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Goodbye will see you again once all this is over.\" Erin says and Percy nods, the two Royal guards with you also give there Goodbye to Percy. With that Erin and Percy and the rest of the mermaids are finally safe. It looked like tonight was almost over when you saw a dark fairy! For some reason however you recognized this Dark Fairies magic as the one who caused the Bloodlust spell when you and Michael were in the Crystal Cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" So what If the mermaids all got away you all are going to die anyways! \" The Dark Fairy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You! You're the one that cast the Bloodlust Spell on the Dragon!\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" You knew that was me? Wow my master told me you were good but I didn't think you were that good. Guess I'll have to have you bleed completely dry! And your comrades will do it for me! Call me Sakara if you live.\"  Sakara said as she casted the same bloodlust spell on the guards and then began to attack you! But did her spell work?</span></div></div>",

This no doubt put a huge damper on this Dark fairies plans she had in store.  \" NO Fair! You can't resist!\" Sakara yelled. \" If you are going to be that way then just bleed and die!\"  You could tell that she was disappointed it didn't work but you were relieved that it didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I'm glad you two were able to resist her magic, I'd hate to have to take you on as well.\" You tell the two Royal Guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" You don't worry miss, the mission's about finished anyways. All we have to do is get out of here and will be home free.\"   One of the Royal guards said.  You began your fight with the Dark fairy Sakara she tried to attack you with every bit of dark magic she could have and make you bleed. Fortunately you were able to hold her off quite easily. Unfortunately the two guards were having a hard time when that gentleman thief arrived. However he seemed to ignore you and went right up to Sakara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" What do you think you are doing?\" He asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Trying to kill, now move your in the way!\" Sakara replied quickly resuming her attacks on you and the guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Not in here! You'll ruin everything!\" He spoke back to Sakara it didn't take too long to realize that these two were partners and they were recently having a quarrel as Sakara wasn't even supposed to of been defending the place from what you gathered from the rest of there conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" You go and free some guy you expect to have some kind of mark, and then have all the fun with a tournament where people want other people to bleed and for me not to be there? I think not! In fact I'm going to go all out!\" Sakara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Don't do that! IF you do that this whole place will catch on...\" But it was too late as she decided she would make some one die today by any means necessary as she cast a spell that caused the entire place to be on fire. Worst yet is knowing her she would probably set the entire city on fire. A disaster of that size however would practically bankrupt all the thieves in this town though, it would be the only good thing to come out of Sakara's desire for blood, death and destruction.  </span></div></div>",

However due to the fact that most of it was burned to cinders it would be a long while before the guild whether it stays as a thieves guild or becomes a proper adventurer guild, all influence it previously had was now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Greetings to you all, As you may already expect I am the mermaid queen.

Don't worry I'll still be competing in the tournament.\" Alyssa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I understand it's a shame to lose your father heard he was quite the warrior when he lead the Royal Knights.\" Bartus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" My father lead the Royal Knights? Is that the same thing as the Royal Guard? And how did you know of such a thing my father never told me anything about it?\" Alyssa asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" It's obvious from your swordsmanship that he's of the Royal Knights, the rankings of the caste can be kind of confusing to people who visit for the first time, but basically it goes from Royal Guards to the Royal Elite Guards, and then to Royal Knight.  There's only one knight in the kingdom who is above Royal Knight status and that is the Royal Knight Commander. \" Bartus told Alyssa.  It wasn't long after that when everyone went there separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The Queen of the seas returned with Erin and Percy, Bartus went ahead to go home while the Royal guard had finally delivered there message to him and Reymond.

You were a bit jealous of all that attention but at the same time you did understand that at that time Michael needed to be by her side.  The Two Royal guards Gareth and Naphtali left to report to the princess. As you and Michael prepared for your next leg of your journey which would be just you and Michael  heading towards Magus Town.

Michael took some time to think about this question and realized that if he had told her his sister was the black swan he probably wouldn't of paid your bond to get out of jail and you would still be there.

Unfortunately a few other travelers were hit by the pollen. By looking at the travelers you could see they were lost in the forest for at least three days.

Your first stop the Adventurer's Guild, You were very familiar with the guild and also wished to join at some point, You even asked the guild master directly once. You still remember his words to this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"This Guild is for Adventurer's not women, quit asking stupid questions and just do your job.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It infuriated you every time you went there, Once you were done delivering the Adventurer's Guild supplies. You headed to the local weapon shop. The man there sold a bunch of your father's weapons. Your father always told you to be careful of him as he has a habit of trying to haggle the price down to ridiculous amount, then sells them to the unsuspecting person for nearly triple of what he paid. Thankfully your father taught you how to haggle as well, at least just to ensure you can get a good price on it. Thankfully today the shop owner of the weapon shop wasn't to be found, instead it was his son who was running it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It took another two hours until you were finished doing your deliveries.With your deliveries done you could now focus on your dream of going on your first adventure. First you have to create your own sword however, which meant going to the mines. Thankfully your father was smart enough to give you equipment so you can head to the mines with safety.

The Thugs then looked your way and spit on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" You don't tell us what to do! Were men we get to do what ever we want!

The thugs however were unimpressed with your bravado and were just going to ignore you! You couldn't let that slide so you unsheathed the sword your father gave you and pointed it towards them. They didn't back down but now there attention was all on you. They obviously weren't going to let you get away with drawing a sword on them. Of course  you weren't expecting to go easy on them either, especially after what you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Prepare to die Girl!\" The thug said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Despite his words you didn't back down and thanks to your training you easily defeated these two thugs. Looked like they only recently got there swords. You having been around swords all your life being the daughter of blacksmith certainly helped you. You go and approach the young naked girl. As you come closer to her you notice that she seems to be around your age, with red hair and deep ocean blue eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It's alright I won't hurt you, in fact allow me to help you by getting you some clothes, can't stay naked all the way to town after all.\" You offered extending your hand to reach hers. She grabbed it and you gave her some time to put on some of your spare clothes. They didn't exactly fit her perfectly, but they were at least well enough for her to be decent now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So these are clothes?\" The girl asked. It was an odd question and you had no idea the reason why she would ask such a thing. Her stomach began to rumble too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Here I have some bread let me get it for you and we cane eat, but before we do allow me to introduce myself I'm Alyssa Bronze.\" You said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm Erin, so this is bread it's light and fluffy yet hard at the same time, do you ever try using it to rest your head?\" Erin asked. Her questions were definitely weird and you often looked a bit confused from each of the question. It made you wonder what kind of life she has lived until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No it wouldn't be able to support our heads, we have pillows for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Pillows? What are these pillows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" They're soft and fluffy as well but not edible. Might I ask where do you live Erin.\" You asked not sure of what to expect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"In the sea.\" Erin said.  Her answer caused you to have more questions, but for now you decided to put that aside. You still had ore to collect for the sword you were going to make after all. Her answer could of meant many things and at the time you just thought that meant she was the daughter of a sailor. You didn't even suspect the possibility that she could be a Mermaid, of course the fact that she had legs removed that answer from your train of thoughts. Now you continue heading towards the mines. Does anything happen on the way to the mines?</span></div></div>",

As you made your way you spot two warriors and a guard from Thistle Town. You hear them talk about how their friend Esmerelda turned a man into a rat for try to strip her clothes off in public. The second incident must of been when she was insulted by a man. Regardless you are thankful for a woman sticking up for herself. If you were ever to find a man that you wanted to marry the last place to look for one is here in your hometown. It would ironic that if you won the Golden Sword Challenge that all the women in town will start invading the Adventurer's Guild. Yet such would be the justice those sexist brutes deserve for the poor treatment of women in this town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the mines you ready your pickax and start mining for valuable metals. As you work you notice the two warriors with mining equipment as well. By that time you almost had more than enough materials to forge yourself a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get some materials so we can forge some new swords. Father, did you bring any smithing equipment with you?\" The younger warrior asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your mother is using mine on her adventure to sell our family made weapons across the kingdom. Reymond, you should really buy your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem father. We just have to find a blacksmith and ask to use his facility to forge our own weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tournament is within a week or so and it took us that long from our last stop to get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the two warriors talk perked your interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father owns a smithry. I'm sure as long as you pay him he'll let you use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger warrior turns around to answer you. You notice that he's 6'8\" tall with red hair and green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you little girl for the information. May I ask why why a child such as yourself is doing here in the mines?\" the man named Reymond asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start fuming with anger at his remark. If you weren't insulted for your gender people would resort to calling you a kid, despite being an adult, due to you being short for a woman your age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say something wrong?\" Reymond asked with a confused look on his face as you reached for your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a child!\" you yelled as you unsheath your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am dreadfully sorry if I have offended you. There is no need for you to draw your sword.\" Reymond said as he apologized to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calm down and resheath your sword. There was no point in exacting vengeance now. You could do so at the tournament, but this warrior's kindness threw you off guard. It's like he wanted to treat you as a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Reymond Lionshield and that man over there is my father Bartus Lionshield. What's your name milady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Alyssa Bronze.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you.\" Reymond said as he extended a strong hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then shake Reymond's hand before resuming your work. You could never have enough material and the more material you got the more options you would have when crafting your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of mining...</span></div></div>",

What did it do to you?\" She asked. The Two warriors couldn't help but laugh at over hearing the question. Erin was confused at the laughter and somewhat insulted but she kept her manners and didn't outright say anything awaiting for your answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It's called mining, It is what we do to find metals to build our swords, axes and other metal stuff. Don't worry see those wooden beams around the cave. They support the mine and help prevent it from collapsing.\" You explained to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Who's your friend there?\" Reymond asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's Erin, I just met her, So I don't know much about her.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" She's quite curious. Do you know where she lived before?\" Bartus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, not exactly, Over seas I think.\" You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Erin would you like to give mining a try?\" You asked Erin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I'll try.\"  Erin said. She attempted to pick up a pick-ax but could barely even hold it. It was like it was taking almost all of her strength just to lift it. Erin only managed to hit the rock about three more times before she was completely exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once Erin was finished you quickly began to resume your mining. This lasted for a couple of hours before you were done. Now you and the two warriors were heading back towards home with about three cart loads of ore. When once again you ran into those thugs you easily thwarted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There she is boss!\"  One of the thug says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" You tellin' me that you two are losers that lost to a woman! Imbeciles! I ought slice your neck right here and now!\" The other thug said. He apparently wasn't with the previous thugs, but just by his stance you could tell this man knew how to wield a sword. At least when compared to the other two. Tired and exhausted from all the mining did you didn't have the energy to fight them off again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You girls wont be getting away this time! My swordsmanship is better than Reymond Lionshield\" The Head thug boasts. Seeing that you and Erin are tired and exhausted the thug wasn't even given a thought to the other two men walking with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Coward! You are attacking us right after we mined! What kind of thug are you?\" You asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" A Smart one.\" He quickly replies. It was then that...</span></div></div>",

Back when I was a youth there were pirates who would capture mermaids and mermen for their tears. They would often pose as drowning victims. Once rescued and on land they carry off the mermaids who had no idea how to walk. From there they would make them cry for their tears. The Exotic Room is where the pirates would torture the mermaids and mermen. They used any method possible, but for mermaid they would actually sexually harass them. After that they would sell them to lowlife nobles and thieves. These thieves and nobles would in turn force the mermaids to cry. Any mermaid or merman who failed to shed tears where killed before their peers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How they this practice returned is unknown, but this could end badly. Look at those clouds and the waves. War is on the horizon and when it comes it will not be pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then spot Erin crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...

You just look so young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furrow your brow at the thief. While you and the others weren't looking the woman puts a vile up to Erin's cheeks to catch her tears.

The Golden sword tournament starts today and you knew your dad wouldn't let you go out on your own until you've proven yourself by winning that tournament. There was also the matter of the Thieves to deal with, however this big tournament would surely attract a lot of outsiders for these thieves to steal.

However this plan required you split up which could be troublesome later on. On the other hand it would be your biggest chance to prove to the town how efficient you are in both weapon making and Sword fighting. Unfortunately you wouldn't be able to save Esmeralda's friend until the tournament and dealing with the thieves was done with though, but will they go through with this plan?</span></div></div>",

Any luck on finding those thieves yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately I haven't much luck. I'm sure that Mathis is here for the prize. We should probably watch the preliminaries. Mathis may be entered as a contestant. A Thief such as himself is a skilled deceiver. He'll tell a person one thing while he robs them blind. He can also manipulate women as you have witnessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing his manipulation has no affect on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen!

Fighting off against what appears to be an Elf an unusual person to be in this region or area even with this tournament. \" The announcer said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You knew he was right though, Elves didn't live anywhere on this country from what you had heard. Not only that but it would take an extremely long time to get here from there lands. In fact Elvish Lands were notoriously hard to reach without a guide. You've heard stories of it before but mostly from traveler's who dared to venture there. They often talked about rough storms, whirlpools, creatures appearing out of the water for no apparent reason. Finally there was talk of a very thin strait that a large ship wouldn't be able to get through. Those that had went that far though usually gave up by then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You carefully look at the two contestants and observe them both each. You notice that the Captain Crossblade is a duel wielder and uses two swords instead of one. The elf however is using a rather thin sword, it looks like a rapier to you, however he isn't using any type of shielding from this you could easily guess that the Elf is probably used to dodging and attacking swiftly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Reymond who do you think will win this one?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" This could be anyone's win, we'll just have to wait and see.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The battle then began with the Captain using his right arm to swing down his blade diagonally. The Elf manages dodge his first blow by going in the opposite direction of the blade which in turn makes the Captain incapable of attacking with his left. The Elf then begin's to strike the Captain thrusting his sword forward, the Captain however blocks by using both his blades. So far Reymond was right this battle could go any way, and even you weren't sure who would win but you did learn quite a bit about the two from their first attacks. The Captain uses his blades as both offensive and defensive, and the elf was a smart enough to evade to where it would be the most inconvenient for the Captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Looks like we got an even match here folks, So let's see how it continues.\" The announcer said. The two once again begin exchanging blow. Each blow show's a bit more of their strength and skill. However you begin to notice something as the match continues. You see that the elf is slowly getting tired and that Captain Crossblade's seems to now be an advantage. From what you could tell it looks like the match has finally went to it's climax. The only question now is who would win?</span></div></div>",

Even to the crowd it was no surprise the elf had tried valiantly but had ultimately failed. You looked in disgusts as you can see several woman wooing over this Captain. Considering your age however it was far too young for you to like him at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" The Winner is Captain Crossblades! What a match that was people, but let's hope the next one is even better!\" The announcer announces. With that you begin to wait for the next match to start when Reymond spots someone you had never seen before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Michael you're out of prison? How did this happen?\" Reymond asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" A thief broke me out and then I made a bet with him and lost, I think he's going on next.\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Reymond who is this person? How do you two know each other? \" You asks. Reymond was quick to respond to your question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" He's Esmeralda's friend, we were going to free him after this, but looks like we don't have to know, that thief must of been Mathis he sometimes does that with men.\" Reymond replies. With Introduction's out of the way you had notice something particular although the thief had robbed Michael of most of his things, he still left his weapons and shield not only that but you recognized that weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Michael, where did you get that sword?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Oh I bought this from a merchant, surprise the thief didn't steal it though I paid six thousand gold for it though at the weapons shop.\" Michael replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" YOU IDIOT! That sword is only worth sixty gold! You were scammed no wonder I didn't find the weapon shop owner there when I went to deliver more weapons.\" You yelled at him, needless to say he was quite surprised and somewhat disappointed when he realized he was yet again cheated but at least now you know why the thief didn't take your sword.  It was then time for the next match to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Ladies and Gentlemen we give you our next match Mathis versus a man who chose to remain anonymous! We don't know much about this guy, but will wish him the best of luck! Let the match begin.\" The announcer said.  As you watched the match there was a clear difference in power and technique this time. Although the one fighting against Mathis used scimitar's hinting that he came from the desert he was easily outmatched by Mathis, who for some reason you couldn't figure out what his next mover would be. Within minutes it was over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" What a quick match that was! The Winner is Mathis! Now our next we will have a guard from Thistle Town and you'll never guess who his opponent is going to be.\" The announcer said. Michael was surprised to hear that he too had somehow been entered in the tournament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I'm in the tournament too?! That's just great. \" Michael said sarcastically, it seemed as though ever since he went to this town he had gotten no lucky breaks. Of course earlier he had heard of what Esmeralda was doing, he wanted to help, but he was kind of stuck here at the moment. When the announcer finally came back he announced Michael's opponent to be...</span></div></div>",

She had brown hair and brown eyes and stood at 5'11\". She was wearing what appeared to be dragon scale armor which hinted at a few possibilities. One she bought the armor after a dragon had shed it after the hibernation period, two she killed a dragon for it, or she's not even human at all which would violate the whole rule on not using magic, since changing one's form is in fact magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there sweetie. Don't fall for me now. If you do you may not live to see tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Michael was too distracted by the red dragon scale armor to pay attention to Julia's threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she just threaten to kill Michael?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like it. Julia O'Parley is a skilled mercenary. She was once hired by an evil dragon to kill the Lord of Ruskbaugh. Rumors have it that she wears Ruskbaugh's scales as a trophy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this Lord of Ruskbaugh was a dragon as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was. In the eastern part of the country where there are larger dragon populations dragons are known to form clans, which are similar to the different nations of races in our country. Once Ruskbaugh died his clan moved west. It won't take long for new dragon clans to get started in the west. Once a dragon selects a mate for life it is easy to build a clan with the patriarch and matriarch dragons, their offspring, and their friends. Dragons even intermarry into different clans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know so much about dragons?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My twin sister is an expert on dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you and Reymond were finishing your conversation. Michael was trying to focus on fighting Julia. It seemed like they were evenly matched, but Julia was giving Michael a false confidence boast before you goes in for her finishing move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fight well for a rookie, but I'm afraid I'll have to end this match. You just aren't worthy like some of the men I've seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye Julia breaks Michael's sword and stabs him in the chest. Fortunately his shield took the brunt of the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How lucky. Most amateurs don't survive this finishing move. You'll live to see another day darling. My client hired me to kill you, but apparently you're too stubborn to die. She already paid me in advance so I have no worries. Now to talk to that young and charming Killian Crossblade. A man that macho is worth talking too.\" Julia whispered into Michael's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers wildly at the sight of blood. Apparently they've been longing for since the start of the tournament. You notice mages come to the arena and heal Michael of his wound. He was unconscious, but alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That folks concludes day one of the Golden Sword Tournament! There's three more days left before the final match. The winner from the next two days will have the chance to face off against Reymond Lionshield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReymond picks up Michael and throws him over his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He fought well. With more practice he;ll eventually be able to parry swords with Julia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that she almost killed him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't surprise me. As a mercenary she's hired to do all sorts of questionable things. Out of everyone here she's probably the deadliest swordswoman that I've seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get Michael to a bed.

Right now he convinced a fellow thief into staying behind in the guild. I doubt that woman will stay for long. Something about her indicates that she cares more about revenge which is adorable coming from a woman. By the time we get to the guild I wouldn't be surprised that the merpeople have escaped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rising tides. The guild may have an exotic room like my previous ship, but the waves have been crashing harshly against the docks. I'm pretty sure that the Queen of the Sea will be upon us very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't we have a quick drink before you show the guild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see Julia kiss Killian on the cheek.

However fortunately he did leave you a note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Dear Alyssa,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        After hearing of some of your friends hard work, I've decided to give them a little helping hand that would prove beneficial and still allow you to compete in the Golden Sword Tournament. Do not worry about me I can take care of myself, In fact I am proud that you made it into the tournament and you are forging your own path. However do not forget that I will not let you go that easily and since there is trouble elsewhere I decided to take care of the troublesome guild myself. Consider it my way of protecting you.

As you get closer and closer to the guild you notice that it looks like it has been set on fire and there was some sort of Ice bridge connecting the guild to the sea.

It would be great to test my blade against his to see who the best swordsman or swordswoman is. Unfortunately it starts within a week and my parents will be having their anniversary three days from now.

You knew from various experience in the past that no one in the council chamber may sit before your father, it was one of the most important laws in Gimunga. Your father began walking towards his chair and then promptly sat. The Rest of the council including you then followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"When you are ready speak your concerns, and then we will discuss them.\" Your father said. All council members were here for this meeting which was an unusual thing, usually there was one who was doing some other task that was needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" First order of business, our trade recently has hit a setback and most of the people who I govern haven't been able to pay there required taxes, do you have any suggestions?\" An elderly giant asked. You remembered him from the first time you met him. He was about  eighty five feet tall had gray hair and brown eyes. He was one of the most prominent nobles in Gimunga and had a good relationship with the giant commoners. He had the title of Lord, and his name is Adrian. Many people however addressed him as Lord Adrian out of respect, if anything were to happen to all members of the Royal Family you were sure he would take the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Taxes? Again I don't see why this is necessary if they can't pay the taxes you should just take there homes away it's that simple.\"  Another giant responded to Lord Baron. You also recognized him, though your meetings with him were never pleasant. He was always lecturing other giants on how over the years of peace they have become too soft and gentle and need to harden there resolves. He stood about ninety five feet tall had light blond hair and blue eyes, with a very muscular build to him. This was no surprise as he was the Commander of the Army after all. His full name is Thane Ward. But many call him Commander Ward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" This isn't a combat situation, If we don't solve this matter peacefully it could lead to revolts.\"  A woman giant said. You recognized her as Lady Gemfire. She and her husband have been close to your family for years, and even more to the point she was also closer to your age compared to the rest of the council. Her bright red hair and green eyes sometimes were quite attractive to you. If it wasn't for the fact that she was already married, you might of thought about going out with her yourself.  Within the council she was often the voice of reason despite her young age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I actually believe I have a solution to our trade problem that can help Lord Adrian out.\" Lady Gemfire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Really? I would like to hear this solution.\" Lord Adrian said.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  \"What kind of Stupid solution have you got for us now Girl?\" Commander Ward Asked in a harsh manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Commander Ward you will treat Lady Gemfire with respect and call her by her title is that clear? \" Your father spoke to Ward.  Ward just scoffed it off and didn't make any response back. You knew from experience though that meant he was going to do as your father said despite his own reluctance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" We'll if we left our magic ban and begin trading with human magicians.

If the populace agrees during the second voting process then the ban will be lifted.

On the ballot you must write 'Yes' or 'No'. Once you have voted please drop the ballot into the ballot box. Once the last ballot has been cast. Any questions?\" Lord Adrian asked as he calmly scanned the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one questioned the elderly giant for they were quite familiar with the process. \"Very well, we shall proceed to the voting process.\" Your father said as he placed the ballot box on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of everyone in the room you knew that you and Lady Gemfire would vote to lift the ban. Commander Ward would obviously vote no. He just had a habit of rejecting every idea that did not relate to war tactics and military training and he viewed the idea of magic as a coward's crutch. Now your father and Lord Adrian were the wild cards. Lord Adrian might reject since he holds traditional values and would only agree to change if he felt like the times warranted the change as a necessary evil. Your father may reject the idea since the painful memories of your mother's death still lingers on his mind. As everyone was writing on their ballot you felt a great tension in the council room. Everyone put their ballots into the ballot box. You were the last to drop your ballot into the box since seeing Commander Ward gave you the chills despite you obviously being taller with the stern commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the votes have been cast.

After training you spot the young man from before. He was with a woman dressed in you presumed was religious garb. He then notices you looming over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there big guy. Judging by your expression you have a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. I'm just curious how each of us could learn a different type of magic. Do you know what enables one to master certain types of magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an easy question to answer. You see when it comes to learning magic it is easier to master types of magic that suit your personality first or as my master would say, 'There is only one person who knows himself. He only sees this person a few times a day and yet this person is always with him.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the mage in confusion. You could tell that he had just told you a riddle. After thinking it over a bit you finally figure out the riddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only person who knows himself is the person himself. When ever a person looks into a reflective surface is the only time he sees himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right. Only a person knows their own personality. They may hide it from others but they can never hide it from themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for clearing that up\", you then notice all the people gathered in the middle of the village. \"What's going on Sergio? Who's that human woman dressed in black?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the Witch of Weslone or better known as the Black Swan. She's vain and wicked. She manipulates anyone for her own gain. She is also the evil twin of the Witch of the Forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if she's evil then, that Esmerelda that you mentioned yesterday is good. I'm starting to think that human culture isn't too different then giant culture. In Gimunga we usually banish criminals to your country for punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain why giants have been planting beanstalks and taking victims with them, but now is not the time to talk about foreign policy. Can you see what Marlani the Black Swan is doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look back over to the center of the camp. You see another woman with the Black Swan. Judging by how small the other woman is you can tell that she's a fairy. You then observe the most horrific sight imaginable. You see the fairy kill ten innocent bystanders out of cold blood, but that's not all. You notice that the fairy took pleasure in seeing her victims die. Her bloodlust was comparable to that of a rogue dragon or criminal from your country. Who could imagine that such darkness could lie within such a small creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Black Swan's henchwoman just killed innocent people. That's just sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing we can do. The Black Swan would vaporize you in mere seconds and Sakara the dark fairy is the world's deadliest dark fairy. Sakara often kills her victims to fulfill her bloodlust fetish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the only way. I also love to hurt and maim people. Making people suffer brings me great joy.\" Sakara said as she was preparing a spear to poke you with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then use your newly learned earth magic to break the dark fairy's spear. You and your comrades try to go to the bean stalk except it has been cut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't run away.

What brings you here?  We recently had to discipline one of your kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I am Gildorum.

I  haven't found them yet, but I do know that it is relevant to your kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was stolen from you?\" Lady Gemfire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They stole a magic bean. With that bean they'll probably invade your country and rob you clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know this how, Gildorum?\" Maximilian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a hatchling when it happened. My mother was returning  from a dragon council meeting when she saw a man chopping  down the beanstalk. The man man was then praised for his \"heroics\" and they built a city in his name. My father was outraged that by this fact. It was during that time that the queen of the Giants entrusted my family with that bean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize that the dragon was telling you the fairy tale, or what seems to be the history that started your country's isolationist views. Yet here you are, the first soon to be king of giants to mark the era where you can trade freely with the lower world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should definitely be helpful. Do you know where we can find this person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I don't know. I was asleep when it was stolen from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I see. Why not let us help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already tried asking a human woman. I believe she is searching, but having more eyes should help, and it's hard to search when I have to find a dragoness to mate with or that I have to bulk up. Once winter comes I have to be have enough girth until spring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see Sergio and his friend walk up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure the villagers won't mind you staying for a day. There's a mountain pass that has a large dragon population, yet the time for hibernation preparation isn't for another two weeks yet you look like you're start to fill out a bit.\" Sergio said to Gildorum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The winters are harsh from where I'm from. Winter starts early in the Western region.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So you're on your own. You're probably trying to start your own clan, aren't you. There aren't many dragons in the west.\" The woman with Sergio replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I want to start my own clan or what you humanoids might call a nation. We dragons just want to live in peace with your peoples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's noble. I believe that in Gimunga dragons actually live side by side with giants. They are one of the races we ally ourselves with the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see the people burying the dead and weeping. You sigh as you notice the damage caused by the Black Swan. You couldn't understand why someone would just do that. You then turn back and and notice Gildorum's nose twitch and back at the captured dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's another dragon on their way.

You probably didn't know that dragon lard is used for various magical remedies either. Before hibernation my kind usually bulks up a lot and when winter hits we don't wake up until spring. During hibernation our excess weight is used to full our annual growth. Any flab not used up for growth is removed through exercise or magic. Normally magicians magically remove our lard and sell it to be used for potions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember reading about it in the Warlock of the Forest's book. Dragon Lard is a key ingredient I need, but unfortunately no dragons are flabby enough to provide it. My mentor is extremely sick. He recovered from one illness, but cursed with another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has to suck. With the few humans I've met I'm sure they'll catch that thief. The other day I gave the Witch of the Forest a heads up before heading back in this direction. You know kid I could take you to that dragon colony you mentioned. The scent is still fresh from the elder. You may be able to extract Dragon Lard from a fat dragon in the colony. Some dragons never lose weight after hibernating and thus are happy to give their lard away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the heads up Gildorum.\" Sergio replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then help the villages clean up their village.

She should be in Celestia City by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Wolf then disappears in a puff of white smoke. You then look at your friends for advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we trust that man?

Yet despite your efforts you have never really been one of those who struck it rich.  The King and queen of your land have hardly ever heard of you, and  you live upon the outskirts of town. Most of your kin notice you because of your lack of expensive clothing. Many of the farmers of the past have met and sold their land to their king making themselves richer than your average farmer. Despite the many who have done this, you would never do such a thing as your land is all you have ever known. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It is where you met your wife who supports you and your endeavors. As a giant your wife is someone who is a great warrior once, but she retired from that profession the moment you and her married. Despite her being a warrior it had never brought her happiness. At least not the kind of happiness that comes with having a family. You also have two kids both of them are still growing but you love everyone in your family. While you can't afford even most of the toys around town it doesn't stop you from making a few of your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You continued to till the soil and plant the fields as well as keep your land. Recently however the buying out of the farmers land was suspicious to you. Not only because they gave up their land to the king, but also because recently you heard  some disturbing rumors. The rumors suggest that the king has become enchanted and wasn't acting like himself. You never knew the king, but from what you have heard he was a good man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   There are many stories in the land below the giants of King and even queens becoming enchanted, or worst put in to some kind of dark curse. You didn't know much of these stories though and have always thought of them as just stories. A man with a uniform bearing the king's seal approaches you as you work the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I hear you have yet to sell your lands, despite the rewards of doing so I humbly ask that you please do so and you will be set for life. So please sell your land to king  understood?\" The man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I will not. It is my land with my wife Sarah, and my two children Christina and Jack. We will continue to live off this land as well as own it.\" You replied to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" What a fool you are! You could have a good and easy life and yet you choose rags over riches, I heard the story about you refusing to sell your land. But to think you were this much of a fool. I came to offer you once last chance, however it appears I have just wasted my time. I am feeling a bit generous so let me put it in another way, you will sell your land or you will be charged for treason.\" The man demanded. Yet you couldn't understand why someone would want your land so badly, after all it wasn't the most fertile of crops and certainly not the richest. You couldn't figure out but despite that you wouldn't let someone bully you off your land not even if it meant being marked for treason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" A shame you would misuse the law just to get your way. However if that is what you desire then I will refuse to sell the land even more. For I am not guilty of treason and you have no proof of such accusations.\" You said firmly as you watched the man as he finally realizes that you were right about that. He can't just accuse you of that just because you refused to sell your land however you also feared that he may do something drastic to make it come true. For now you watched as he reluctantly left the field and gave you a look that told you that this was not over. </span></div></div>",

Several years ago before you were born Orcs invaded the kingdom and enslaved many of your kind. Your kind however did nothing to stop them. It was only until the recent troubles with the Human kingdom that the Orcs offered a peace treaty to the fairies. The treaty basically said that the Orcs would leave the rest of the fairies alone and in exchange they wouldn't allow any humans to set up for an invasion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The Fairy queen herself signed the treaty and ever since then it has been total boredom for you. Even playing or frolicking with your friends didn't get rid of your boredom. You had at least two friends who were male fairies, and three that were female. The first of your friends was Ember. She was a fairy who had the ability to control fire magic extremely well. As it was indicated by her reddish wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Ember, come on let's do something fun!\" You suggested to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Not now, I can't lose control of my power.\" She said as she sat there with her legs crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You are just sitting there doing nothing!\" You exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" That's not true! I'm meditating.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Since Ember was busy with her meditation thing, you decided to go see your next friend, Trim. Trim was one of the few male fairies and he was usual seen Trimming the branches, flowers and all sorts of plant stuff with his magic. Unfortunately  he was just as busy as Ember, Well at least he looked busy unlike Ember.  The Next you went to see was Shard. Shard was the other male fairy beside Trim. Fortunately he wasn't busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Hello, Shard want to have some fun?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Oh..Uh...well...maybe...ask the others first?\" He said, You secretly knew that Shard had a crush on you, and it was always fun to see him flustered over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Alright I will Shard, and then I'll come back just so you know though I already asked Ember and Trim, they're both busy as usual.\" You said.  \" I think I'll ask Emmy and  Regalia next!\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You were excited about seeing Emmy and Regalia. Emmy is a nature fairy who specialized and all things involving nature and Regalia was a Light fairy. Who specialized in Healing and Divinations, at first some would think of a light fairy as someone who would avoid a good prank, but Regalia was a prank mastermind at least in your book.  As you fly towards them in your City you then spot something unusual. Your curiosity and desire to get rid of your boredom get's the best of you and you look only find....</span></div></div>",

The area where nature fairies reside can be rather complicated to navigate usually, but oddly enough you were able to speed right through with out any interruptions. There you finally found Emmy although there was something unusual about her this time. The air around her was sad and depressing. Despite this you called her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Emmy, are you alright?\" You asked. As Emmy began to look at you, you felt a chill down your spine, you slowly became more and more worried about Emmy. You looked to Regalia to see if she had answers it was then she pointed to a seedling.  Ordinarily a seedling would be tended by nature fairies but as you looked at this seedling you realized what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" There's a Darkness, Seedling planted  here. This must be what's causing her to act how she is, careful she might attack us if we attack the seedling.\" Regalia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I'm not going to have her turned into a Dark fairy! I'll save her.\"  You tell Regalia as you fly towards the seedling. Just as she predicted Emmy tries to protect the seedling. Seeing you give it your all Regalia does her best and uses her magic to stop Emmy. So far you both have had very little knowledge in dealing with a Seedling of Darkness, so neither of you know what happens to the fairy who tries to remove it.  You go as swiftly as possible and you begin to remove the Seedling of Darkness from it's root's. As you do this you notice that your friend Emmy collapses and is no longer under it's control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Unfortunately just as you remove it the seedling goes to another place...</span></div></div>",

This is quite unexpected as you were expecting it to change you, but for some reason or another the Seed of Darkness didn't effect you. Regalia was shocked by the turn of events but was glad it was over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Emmy are you okay?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I'm fine, what about you that seed went inside you are you sure you'll be alright?\" Emmy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I think I am fine, but it's kind of strange feeling inside me.\" You tell her. It was a strange feeling once the seed was inside you. From what you knew from Regalia these seeds of Darkness were made by Dark fairies long ago to convert other fairies into Fairies of Darkness, yet somehow it wasn't effecting you. Before anything else happens you secretly decided to talk to that Dark fairy that was in the fairy clinic. You did this once you were away from Regalia as she didn't seem to want you to ever go near her again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <i>\" I wonder if that Dark Fairy caused this, before I found her.\"</i> You thought to yourself as you began to approach the fairy clinic. You went inside and then watched and waited a few hours until finally the Dark Fairy was at last awake. You carefully thought of what you would say as you didn't exactly want her to go off on a rampage. Hopefully she would have some kind of self control though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Hello, I recently got this seed thing inside me that could potentially be your doing. Strangely enough it doesn't affect me.\" You tell the Dark Fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I don't know if your quite brave or just ready to die, but I don't do those Seeds of Darkness, not enough bloodshed for me with those. As for why it's not affecting you it's because you have strong magic in you. Even I can sense that strong magic inside of you.\" The Dark Fairy said, she was surprisingly being quite civil towards you. You could guess that she was only doing this because of the strong magic inside you, but you didn't even know what kind of fairy you were at the time, So how could you know how to use some of the stronger magic? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I don't think my magic's strong I only know basic fairy spells I haven't even been classified as a certain type yet.\" You tell the Dark Fairy. The Dark fairy gives you a strange smile and suggest a thought that you would of never guessed. \" Perhaps you are a Dark Fairy yourself, but just don't know it.\" She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" No that can't be! I can't be a Dark Fairy.\" You tell her a bit worried and unsure of yourself. However the Dark Fairy then whispers in your ear a spell that only a Dark fairy would know. You were curious to find out what type of fairy you were and the learning of the spell did want you to use it, but it could also become your worst fear that you were actually a Dark Fairy and that no one ever told you.

Even when Sakara killed the fairy queen your thoughts weren't like the others. You at the time when she killed the queen were just mad at getting tricked and wanted pay Sakara back for tricking you. Eventually you slowly began to realize what kind of Dark Fairy you were. You were the type of Dark fairy that struggles between light and Darkness, you want to do good but at times you end up doing more evil then good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Something wrong?\" Ember asked.

Ember's talk however did let a few worries you had free. With that you began searching the forest where you look for any signs of the one who put the seed there. So far there hasn't been any sign of them.  Just as you were about to give up you spot a cave with a warning sign. You then read the sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" Warning! This Cave has been magically Sealed to prevent an Imp Invasion! Do Not Break the Seal under any Circumstance!\"  The sign read.

A Few nights later the previous orc King sent out his men and learned that the Dark fairy queen had been killed. I believe that would be your mother.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Are you telling me that my mother was the queen of Dark fairies?\" You asked. The Orc king simply nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Indeed, and as her child only you can use her book of spells as it can only be opened by one who is within their rights to do so. A dark fairy doesn't have to be evil. But instead must consistently face the evil within themselves. Lucky for you she knew one day you would discover what type of fairy you are and then instructed us to give you this when you were ready.\"  The Orc King says as he hands over what appears to be a fairies book of spells. You quickly discover that it was your mothers spell book and contained many spells that were specifically for Dark Fairies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"However you must not reveal to anyone not even your friends that you are the Dark Fairy queens daughter. For if you do they would be in greater danger than ever thought possible. Their will be a time when you can reveal that, but only when you officially gained the crown.\" The Orc King told you. You understood what he meant and decided that for now you would keep this secret from your friends at least until the timing was right. It was then you left the Orc King's chambers and ran to the place where your friends were fighting the imps, only surprised to find....</span></div></div>",

Unlike other orcs you were from one of the three mysterious tribes. No one in orc society knows the name of your tribe or the other two besides your tribe, the Legendary Orc King, and the other two tribes. The name of your tribe is known as the Adventure Breaker Tribe. Unlike the other tribes your tribe is usually sent out by the Legendary Orc King to learn more about the other races. The other two tribes are the Assassin Breaker Tribe, which is the Legendary Orc King's secret task force that covertly spies on any invaders or war parties from the shadows, and the War Breaker Tribe, a tribe dedicated to declaring war on those who invade your home. You and some of your tribesmen returned from an adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Warchief had put you on guard duty. All of your tribesmen go through a rotation where if an orc goes on an adventure they are put on guard duty for a while. It was no surprise that every able orc has went on at least one adventure. It was uncommon for female orcs to go on adventures as long as they prove themselves before the Chief that is. As you quietly wait you have a sense of dread. From around the corner you here maniacal laughter. The voice to who the laughter belonged to was definitely high-pitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so much fun! I just love spilling blood. It makes me feel so alive!\" The high-pitched voice echoed through the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakara, remember we are only creating a diversion. The thief that Lady Marlani hired should be have a clear path to the sword that she desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Leron. Just turn into a werelion and help me kill these orcs. I don't want you to spoil my fun! If you do so I'll make you into my personal sparing partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever Sakara. You know your bloodlust will eventually cost you your own life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the conversation you can tell that these two intruders have a thief among their ranks and they plan on stealing a sword. You remember that the warchief from the Defense Breaker tribe died gloriously in battle. His son Torque would naturally be a consideration as the next warchief, not because of blood, but due to his spirit. However, he befriended a fairy slave, a water fairy named Shalla. You weren't against the idea since you seen fairies work alongside humans from time to time, but  unfortunately against you and some of your tribe members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly take cover behind a boulder as you hear some footsteps. You glance from the boulder as you see a lion man and what appears to be a dark fairy. You are tempted to strike, but you watch from the boulder as some members from the other tribes rush the attackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have to see if I can pinpoint there weaknesses. Rushing in without knowing what the enemy can do would only result in pointless deaths. By knowing the enemy I can know how to beat them. Even the Legendary Orc King himself would advise such an approach. He did hail from our tribe after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your fellow orcs charge at the lion man and dark fairy you observe that the lion man is extremely fast and strong and that the dark fairy uses here magic to instantly kill all who oppose her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun! Let's kill some more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your eyes. These two individuals killed that many orcs. Your fellow orcs did kill a few humans, but those two would definitely outclass you. The only tribe that could take these intruders were the Fear-Giver Tribe or the Assassin Breaker Tribe since they had superior stealth despite their burly builds.

Let me kill him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Sakara, let him live. He may fetch some reinforcements. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a smart idea. It would get boring if I killed him and no one else was around.

I need to warn the chief and the Legendary Orc King. I don't mind dying in battle, but there is no honor in dying for the sake of revenge. I may not know why humans invade our home, but I'm beginning to understand why. They really view our race creatures to be killed and looted. Even while adventuring I never known why humans look at us with disgust, but seeing a fairy who kills for her own amusement makes it pretty clear. There should be a secret passage by this boulder that the Assassin Breaker Tribe uses. If I can reach the chief and the Legendary Orc King we can formulate a plan to stop those murderers.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel around the wall and try to find the passage.

I was at my post when two terribly strong intruders came in. They were a dark fairy and a lion man. They mentioned something about a thief being hired to steal the former chief of the Defense Breaker Tribe's soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is most worry some. The thief probably already made their clean getaway by now. I'll have to send Torque to recover his father's sword. Having ones own tribe's former chief's sword stolen while on duty greatly tarnished the tribe's honor. Since Torque was the Warchief's son it will be his responsibility. Earth forbid what those miscreants will do with the word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the report. Standby until we can organize a militia with the other two secret tribes.\" Your Warchief's said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Warchief Axel. I think I may require a new advisor. The tournament is about to begin and you and I know that all Warchiefs and the title for king are up for grabs. All we can do is send Torque and his fairy friend  out on an important quest and pick a new advisor that serve me or the next orc king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with you my liege. I have already been doing some studying on who would replace the Councilor Bane. My orcs have noticed an exceptional shamaness who is more than qualified for the job.\" The Assassin Breaker Tribe Warchief said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work Warchief Shadomire. Fetch the shamaness during the tournament. That way we can bring her up to speed.

If I to pass my torch to another you would be my first pick. Please help the other tribe's rebuild and repair the settlements. After that prepare for the tournament.

Torque and his friends were given a quest to return the former Defense Breaker Warchief's soul, though rumors of banishment were spread among gossipers. You knew that was far from the truth. Other orcs outside of the three tribe's barely know the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your experiences with adventuring leaving home for a quest makes one stronger. Every day you trained diligently. You were excited that the Legendary Orc King, someone who is from your kin, is competing. With your knowledge and experience you believe you will become a great orc king as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew by becoming the next orc king you will be challenged on certain issues, but you were one of the top fighters from your clan. Only your cousin and current Warchief  have proven stronger. Yet you also know that the Legendary Orc King's children are competing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of his children are strong orcish women. In the tournament both men and women are able to compete. As you focus on clearing out a caved in cavern you hear a creepy female voice call out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings a strong orc from the hidden tribe's hear? Shouldn't you be with the orc king deary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and see the most menacing orc that you laid your eyes on. She had black hair and purple skin. Many skull earrings hung from her ears. Her scarlet eyes made all who looked into them tremble. Despite having a good looking and beautiful appearance when it came to her face she wore the creepiest battle armor in history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armor was made from the hide of dragons and decorated with teeth from various species that she had slain. The orc was the leader of the Fear-Givers, Warchieftess Scarletta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here on his orders to help clean up before the tournament.\" You replied trying not to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How thoughtful deary. You know you may be speaking to the next queen of the orcs. I plan on smiting the Legendary Orc King in the tournament. Farewell deary and don't die of fright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Warchieftess cackles in a disturbing manner. You can't help but feel your teeth chatter momentarily. The last thing you wanted was for the orc king to die. He was part of your tribe and intend on letting him regardless of becoming the new orc king or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were even attracted to his eldest daughter. Surely after the tournament if you win or lose you could at least become part of his family. Yet in order for that to happen you would have to defeat his daughter in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheshara refuses to marry an orc who can't prove himself to her and knowing her a battle against her was the only way to claim her heart. You finish your work with two hours left. You spend that time training and preparing for the tournament.</span></div></div>",

The tribe that you belong to is known as The Spell Breaker Tribe and has gained a significant reputation in defeating many high powered Sorcerers and other magic users.  Thus earning them a place in the main Orc's Underground Capital City known as  Dark Haven.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Dark Haven is the capital of the Orc tribes and the resident where the Legendary Orc King resides, The King wasn't born into the position that is not the way of the Orcs. The Orcs earn the positions in battle and skills throughout the land. Being a magic user and a female Orc you earned your position by keeping the warriors of your tribe alive and healthy when things got rough, as well as having enough intelligence to be able to help them turn the tide of the battle. Thankfully the battles your tripe had were mostly small.  Your Tribe the Spell Breaker Tribe is actually one of eight of the other tribes that reside in Dark Haven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The other tribes that live in Dark Haven, have just as much importance as your own. The first of which is the Sword Breaking Tribe. They are known for easily defeating warriors who invade there territory by breaking there swords and crushing there spirits. There leader who answers only to the Legendary Orc King himself is known as Gnash Apart, he is considered to be a Warchief.  There are  Seven other Warchief's and they all only answer to the king and are the reigning leaders of the tribes that reside in Dark Haven.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The Third Tribe is known as The Fear-Giver's Tribe. It is unknown to you what exactly this tribe did to earn there name, but strangely enough, very few humans had ever tried to attack this tribe on account of they usually end up running away. Unfortunately you never met there warchief so you don't exactly know who he is or even how he was able to make humans run away from his tribe entirely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The Fourth tribe is known as The Defense Breaker Tribe. This tribe often uses method that breaks an opponents defense through a fierce onslaught of offensive attacks, which eventually break the defense of there opponents they are quite the opposite of the fifth tribe which is known as The Barrier Tribe, who often call there Orc's who defend them Defenders. You knew of a strange Orc in this tribe by the name of Torque the quirk. He was quite nice and talkative but the rumors of him being banish did make you worry about him a bit. After all compared to all the other tribes many consider the Barrier Tribe to be the weakest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The Sixth, Seventh and Eighth tribe were one's of complete mystery as you had no idea of there names or there accomplishment's. All you knew about them is the only The Legendary Orc King knows there tribe and no one else is allowed to. So they were often referred to as the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth tribe. With all tribes gathered in Dark Haven there is more often battles between the tribes and tournaments held where many Orcs would battle to prove that they were worthy of a better position. Many dreams were realized or broken in this battle, however something was different about the coming tournament. This was because...</span></div></div>",

You knew your duty and watched the Tournament's Opening Ceremony were the King himself spoke.  \" Today is the day of the Succession Tournament Where we will compete with each other for top ranks. I myself will be participating so any Warrior strong and smart enough to defeat me can take my throne. Be warned though I am no easy opponent to defeat. I remember in the days of Old where Humans and Orcs were fighting constantly this tournament is a celebration of both our victories and our losses. No Orc shall die here today! But we will fight to prove that  we are great leaders in combat, strategy and heart! I'll now let the announcer take over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The Orcs cheered the King and his speech ensuring that the tournament was going to be a success. Some of the Orcs however didn't exactly see eye to eye with the King's speech. It was hard to tell what part they didn't understand but even when he was done they still cheered him on. The Tournament announcer then began to speak. \" This year there are thirty-two openings for the tournament each Orc who makes it to the top eight will have a chance to take on the King. The current Orc King is already decided to be in the Fourth block and last match of the main tournament. The rest of you will have to prove yourselves in your tribe's preliminaries. Good luck to you all. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It was then that the tournament preliminaries would now begin, part of you felt this way was barbaric. Another part of you however understood the necessity of this tournament. Unfortunately some Orcs saw this tournament as an opportunity to kill the King, yet strangely enough for some reason poisons or magics have never worked on the Orc King. It was like he was smart enough to know there would some would stoop that low and made himself immune to those effects. Which meant the only way one could defeat the Orc King would be if they were a greater fighter than him. You also knew of the tale of your current King where he took on a Lionshield Warrior when he was a mere Chief and outmaneuvered him completely. According to the rumors years later they became quite good friends but never actually actively invading each others territory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As the preliminaries of your tribe the Spell Breaker tribe began. There were three Orc's that You believed could make it to the finals. The First of them was Tee Bones a male warrior of your tribe and you thought of him quite attractive. He often used Halberds as his choice of a weapon. You did also know his weakness however and that was that he was a show off. Despite having a large weapon he rather show off his skills rather than fight seriously. The next was your best friend  Tali Cur, She was a bit more grounded and often was way too serious at times, but she always seemed to laugh at bad puns for some reason. She uses a typical Sword and Shield style and tries to wait for the right moment to attack, unfortunately it doesn't always work out though. The Third of  your tribe that you believed had a chance to prove himself was a rather young warrior for your tribe simply known as Tarvic the quick. He was one of the quickest warriors of your tribe has ever have, while he does manage to be quick that unfortunately can also be his weakness. As he often doesn't think of the consequences of his attack. As the preliminaries of your tribe continued the three that you believe could make it to the main tournament..</span></div></div>",

She looks at you and smiles at you. You and Tali have always been close sort of best friends she was a bit disappointed when you first discovered your magic abilities. Fortunately she eventually got over it.  Thanks, but it's not over yet the main event has yet to come.\" Tali said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I showed you ALL! I told you I'm the best and now we have proof! I'm going all the way to the top!\" Tee Bones yelled from afar. Similar to Tali, Tee Bones has been a friend of yours since you were just a young Orc. The only problem was that even back then he was quite a show off. You always feared that one day his show off and brag all about his victories attitude may one day get the best of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Tee! This is the resting area be QUIET!\" Tali yelled while fiercely glaring at Tee Bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Alright I will.\" Tee Bones said while muttering under his breath.

His words had you curious as form what you had figured was that Tali was in the third block of the main tournament and Tee Bones was in the Second part.

The fight was long and difficult yet Tarvic continued to persist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You were right it looks like he could win!\" Tali says. All the other Orcs around the arena were watching the match with great interest. You believed that Tarvic can win and so far that belief has been paying off, but you knew it would take more than believing he could win to defeat Gnash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You didn't tell Tarvic but you knew that Gnash and his clan had a particular weakness, it was one that was similar to your clans own weakness.  Your clan's weakness was that they enjoyed countering the spells of other enemies at every turn, while the Sword Breaker tribe had the habit of breaking swords. It was effective against an inexperienced warrior but to an experienced one if they never realized this weakness then they would of never corrected that weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" You are going to lose Gnash.\" Tarvic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" OH! I highly doubt that! I am a Warchief and you are merely a pebble!\" Gnash responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Gnash fiercely attacks Tarvic confident that he could win, yet despite this Tarvic evades every blow whether he swung his sword vertically, horizontally or even diagonally he manages to evade.  Tarvic then begins his counterattack and much to the Orc's surprise in a mere instant Tarvic's spear knocks Gnash's sword out of his hand! Gnash goes and makes a run for the Sword. Tarvic however  quickly uses his spears long reach and aims at the side of the neck. It was then that the fight was over and Tarvic had won!  The Orc's cheer his achievement all except Gnash who doesn't take his losing to Tarvic to kindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" NO! I can't Lose! I'm a Warchief! I can't Lose!\" Gnash yelled furiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Yelling about it now, wont change what happened! Instead of yelling why don't you try and figure out why you lost.\" Tarvic replied. Much to everyone's surprise the Warchief silently agreed that he would find out why he lost one day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      With that Tarvic and your friends celebrated a victory, the next two matches that were both Tali's and Tee's they had won. making them go up to the top sixteen of the tournament the day was finally over. It would be time toe rest up now or so you thought as a strange Orc you had never seen before came to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You are a shaman of the Spell Breakers correct?\" He asked.  Who ever he was he didn't look like any Orc you have seen before nor did you recognize any of the tribes markings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I am, but why would you need me? You are from one of the Hidden Tribes correct?\" You ask him back. Curious of what someone from the Hidden tribes would need with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Normally, we would use such a shaman, but this is a request by the Legendary Orc King himself. I cannot divulge the details any further.\" He answered. Of Course that lead you to another question what could the Orc King want with you? And more importantly why you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>       You said goodbye to your friends as you departed with the man from one of the tribes you didn't know about to meet with the Orc King himself. For many Orcs it was a great honor to meet with the king. In fact very few orcs ever disrespected him and those who did or even tried to assassinate him were dealt with swiftly and never heard from again.  You even remember the reason as to why the Orc's never say the Legendary Orc King's name. It is basically an idea that as long as the name of the Legendary Orc King is never spoken he will always live on forever, however if they were to give him a name then his reign would be limited thus according to Orc legend it is a very bad taboo for an Orc to speak the name of the Legendary Orc King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you came to the throne room it was the first time  you had seen such lavished decorations. There was quite a bit of gold and silver as well as a few trophy heads but most of them were of animals. You even saw some of the fairies who were enslaved by the Orc's long ago working to constantly keep it clean. Although the practice of capturing fairy slaves had ended, many Orcs still had fairies breed with each other forming captive fairies who now nothing of their heritage or freedom itself.  The only one who had been an exception to that was Torque and right now he was out looking for his father's sword.  You see the Orc King in his throne waiting patiently as possible you knew he was going to be in the tournament but from what you watched and seen over the years he still looked like the most Impressive person you have ever met.  You quickly bend down on one knee and begin to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Greetings Legendary Orc king how may I be of service to you?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You may rise, I need you to pay attention closely to what I am about to tell you.\" The Legendary Orc King replies. You then rise and look towards his face as he begins to tell you what he has in mind for you.  \" In previous era's whenever humans started attacking Orcs it would end up hurting us badly leading to burned village's, young one's losing there parents in war and more complete hatred of our kind. However if this were to happen again and they were to find Dark Haven our chances of survival could be far slimmer then we could ever hope for. Therefore I have decided to grant you the position of Ambassador of the Orc's.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You wish for me to be an ambassador my king? But the only thing I've done is healed many orcs every time a tournament has came around. What good would me being an ambassador do? Don't get me wrong I am honored, but at the same time I'm uncertain many say such roles would be that of your wife? Would it not?\" You ask the Legendary Orc King. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Indeed in old times the wife of the king would handle outside matters, however I am not looking for another wife. I simply think that you are the best suited for this position. I am not asking you to be an ambassador of Internal matters. I have other kin who can do that. What I am asking of you is to help with external disputes.\"  He replied.  You finally realized that the King was worried about the Orc being wiped from existence and was asking you to help deal with long term grudges and disputes that have been going on for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I Understand and Accept the position.\"  You tell the Legendary Orc King. At first you were just going to reject it but you decided against that since it meant you would be allowed to go to the surface and it would allow you to meet with Torque again eventually. You were curious whether his journey to find his father sword would have made him any stronger or change him somehow. Thankfully now you had a way to see him if you could ever find him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That is excellent news, in fact I have two jobs lined up for you already fill free to pick one. The First is the age old dispute between the Mage Town and Orcs I need you to go and help the Orcs there find peace. I forget the name of the town but I hear rumors that things are getting pretty bad over there. The Second job I need you to do is investigate an old Orcish Burial Tomb that old dead Orcs are rising from, this one you may want to wait awhile for it, or at least get some help for this one. If the reports I received from this one are true then expect heavy resistance. We can't have our dead be defiled under any one.\"  The Legendary Orc King told you. You now had two choices to deal with the mage town issues or the Burial grounds. The only down side was you weren't sure if he wanted you to do these before the end of the tournament or after, however you trust your friends would do well. Given the wisdom of your own and the Legendary Orc King you decided it would be best to start off with...</span></div></div>",

He couldn't help but laugh at it. \" No that is not the case, if anything has swallowed the city it's the blackness of people's hearts.\" Edward replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" But a heart has no blackness.\" Star quickly responded. Which revealed to Edward how little of the world of Humanity she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I don't mean a physical blackness, I mean many have chosen paths that would only benefit themselves, rather then all of humanity.

These beautiful maidens who came out of nowhere must be many of the missing mermaids. Of course at this point there was no telling if it were true or not. Yet it was also an excuse to see more of the so called city life. However she had two choices. To leave Edward their and tell the Queen of Mermaids about this.

Like this you could barely move on land and when your tail dried and turned back into legs your groin would be exposed again and you don't need to be told how embarrassing that would be. You were already kidnapped by pirates a day ago. You can't even get the horrible torture that they made you endure. Your now start to believe that this weather could be a sign that your mother is preparing the royal army. As you were being carried in Naphtali's big muscular arms you noticed that the seas were awfully rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This could be one of two things. One the sea warlock is has gotten his tentacles into some evil or mother is really ticked off and has declared war on the surface world.

It didn't take too long for their ship to be swallowed by the waves. You then notice what appears to be Captain Crossblade cursing at the sea while standing at the doorway to the guild. Fortunately 20 merpeople were saved from more abuse, however many of them were now relocated to the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mother is so going to destroy this place. There are a few nice humans here, but knowing mother she'll want them all dead. Especially since I was kidnapped. If I can find Erin and warn her of the coming war, then we may be able to negotiate with my mother. Unfortunately mermaids have more say than mermen, even if they are royalty. That's also counting that the male to female ratio is almost even.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty minutes of running through blinding rain the royal human guards reach the inn and head to their room. Your tail is immediately dried off and a sheet is thrown over your body as they transform back into feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay there. Once this accursed rain stops I'll fetch a few more pairs of clothes for you. Usually there's no rain before the Golden Sword Tournament. Some people believe that if it rains before the Golden Sword Tournament bad things are bound to happen.\" Naphtali said as he stripped off his wet clothes and put on dry clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't until two hours later that the rain stops. It didn't take long for Naphtali to purchase you two pairs of new clothes and an extra pair of pants. You immediately slip on the pants. Afterwards your comrades take you to the inn's tavern. Once there you spot the same man and women who were in front of the Thieves' Guild this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed Charlotte. You seemed to have outdone yourself deary. Not only did you get that mermaid's tears but you also robbed the Lion Warrior and his father. I have never pulled off such a feat like that.  Most people I can rob, but you are truly gifted.\" The man said to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had tons of practice while trying to come here. I even stole this box from a sleeping dragon. It could've gone smoother if my old cloak didn't tear. Unfortunately they two day diversion I had to elude the dragon. The bad thing is I think he's still looking for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can only evade a dragon for so long. Those blowhards can even take on a human form.\" The man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. There was a man that I briefly passed by wearing armor that was similar to the dragon's scales when I was in the town in the mountains. Fortunately I had replaced my cloak at the time and the streets were full of people. Yet one glance at his eyes and it was easy to tell that he was a dragon. Yet he seemed to be concerned with a few other things as well and didn't look concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because it's close to mating season and hibernation, but you should never look a dragon directly in the eyes. They can easily read your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was a myth, Mathis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not, but enough of that Charlotte. I think we may have to run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two thieves realize that you and the guards with you were eavesdropping on their entire conversation. You and the guards approach the thieves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Charlotte  Everbloom? What are you doing with scum like him?\" Gareth asked the thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't know do you. My parents were murdered by thieves and I had no choice but to become one myself! Those thieves stole everything from me! I'm only doing this for revenge on those parasites!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the man named Mathis turn pale as a ghost. Apparently he has a secret concerning this woman's parents. It doesn't take long for the woman to figure out that the man played a part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were using me! We're supposed to be working together. Forget it. Explain it later. We gotta run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast. You two are wanted for multiple acts of theft. If you resist us then by royal decree by the king and queen we will have no choice but to give pursuit.\" Gareth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thieves make a quick getaway, but not without dropping a few of their stolen money sacks, a necklace, and the box. You were about to give chase when you notice that it is raining. By then they are long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat! They escaped!\" Naphtali yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that Lady Everbloom would turn to a life of crime. I feel sorry for her, but that does not excuse her actions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then pick up the ornate box and open it. To your surprise it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever was in the box is gone. I'm certain that no one would keep an empty box on their person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGareth quickly looks at the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Percy. It looks like it was supposed to have a magic bean inside that leads to the land of the giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Land of the what now? Don't we have to apprehend those thieves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally yes, but not tonight. It started to rain again. Let's just enjoy our meal.\" Naphtali said as he pulled out his own coin pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gareth, we'll have to find Reymond Lionshield and give him this stuff. I'm pretty sure he and whoever owns this necklace will be looking for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were enjoying dinner the two thieves were by the Thieve's Guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to wear this stupid outfit. I look like a prostitute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it looks so lovely on you my dear Charlotte.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever Mathis, but you owe me. Luckily I held onto this bean. After not selling it I may as well rob the land of the giants next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I come along. I've actually been to Gimunga before with my sister Gilda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I get a 90% of everything we steal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No deal deary. I have what I came for and it is time that we part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way mister. Are you really that much of a pervert to even thinking of touching my boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually That's not what I was sent to do, but we'll talk later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.</span></div></div>",

The last time I was at the castle was fifteen years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how can we be sure that they'll help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your rescuers hoping that they'll respond to the woman's concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bartus, last night when we were in the tavern we came across two thieves. One was the infamous Gentleman Thief Mathis and the other was Charlotte Everbloom. We tried to apprehend them last night, but they got away. Fortunately we were able to recover the things they stole,\" Gareth said as he pulled out the necklace, ornate box, and three sacks of gold. \"We believe one of these sacks of gold belongs to you and your son. Do you know whose necklace and sack of gold this is? We don't know the woman who he conned it off of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGareth hands Bartus the sacks of gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That necklace and sack of gold belongs to a young woman named Alyssa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where we can find her?\" Naphtali asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's competing in the Golden Sword Tournament.\" Bartus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, two years ago the princess competed and won the tournament. Last year she competed in the Volvasa Battle Tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean little Loraine? The last time I saw her she was having tea parties and picking flowers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but what about that box?\" The woman in green interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard Charlotte claim that she stole it from a dragon. We checked to see if there was something inside, but she must have taken the contents out. We believe that she may have this so called bean on her person.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the woman look at the box with curiosity. She remained calm and determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just going to have to track down this Charlotte Everbloom.\" The woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we ask you guys for help what are your names. Just because someone gives back your stolen goods doesn't mean they're trustworthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I am Gareth Kamenswartz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am Naphtali Noir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the man named Bartus recognizes the last names of your rescuers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were those boys who used to play with the princess. You two have grown into fine men. So which one of you commands the king's army?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither of us do. You wouldn't believe this if we told, but...\" Naphtali is cut off by the woman in the green robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have time for casual conversation. We need to expose the corruption in this town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that the woman has a point. \"She's right. We don't have time for this. Erin, stay close to me. If it gets too dangerous head back to Pearl Clam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Percy! Do you even know how to fight on land?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter. I spared against Reef using swordfish before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you a kid like I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now Erin. I'm sixteen. I'm pretty sure that makes me a man by now. I even had to suffer in that terrible Exotic Room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but I wanna help too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh at Erin. She's only a month away from turning fifteen and still she's as persistent as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your allies travel to the Thieve's Guild.

The only reason you were able to recognize them however was because they were the one's who captured you in the first place. This still didn't change much of your plans with rescuing your kin. Of course you were more eager for blood for this crew as you knew how cruel these pirate's can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Looks like we got some pirates on guard here.\" Gareth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Still doesn't change what we have to do? So are we going to rush them or what?\" Naphtali asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No, we don't rush and these pirates don't look too smart to me, so I'll handle this with a little bit of magic.\" Esmeralda replied to the two Royal Guards. After saying that she began to silently as possible cast a sleep spell that would put all the pirates guarding the door asleep. Once the incantation was finished she threw the energy of the spell towards the area of the pirates and by some form of luck they all fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\" That's one fight we don't have to fight now, just make sure not to wake them when you take the key's from them.\" Esmeralda told the group. Bartus, Naphtali, and Gareth then all went and carefully searched the sleeping pirates for the keys. Fortunately Gareth managed to find them on one of the guards sleeping at the entrance. Once inside you only thought of getting your vengeance but so far Esmeralda had taken the lead you could tell that Bartus was quietly judging her from the way he looked at her. Even you were judging her a bit, still you decided to test her a bit and pretend to be blinded by your own rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Once the mermaids and mermen are safe will begin attacking, it will be Erin and Percy's job to make sure they get out of here safely.\" Esmeralda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You mean I will be helping as well, but why not fight with you?\" Erin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I agree with Erin we should be just attacking right now not all this stuff.\" You responded testing Esmeralda's wisdom to see how much she has really thought through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" If we fight now Erin they could use the other Mermaids and Mermen as a hostage and hinder are progress at stopping this operation as a whole! Also I doubt your people would trust us that much after being held captive by these others. Otherwise you would be with Alyssa at the tournament. \" Esmeralda explained to them You and Erin both nodded and had seem to understand Esmeralda's reasoning. The mermen and Mermaids were first priority taking down the guild and gathering up all the contraband was second. At least that's what it was to the human's your Second priority after your people were safe is to have Erin calm your mother down. This was especially important as you didn't want her to drown a whole bunch of innocent humans. </span></div></div>",

For awhile it looked like all your efforts and attempts to free your kin would fail. Fortunately that wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Your not going to free the prisoners that easily!\" The First mate said confident that he could take you all on. Including Esmeralda despite her magical prowess.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I think you are forgetting something, that we happen to have the greatest hero of all on our side the Legendary Lion Warrior!\" Esmeralda exclaimed to the first mate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" She's right so I think I ought to play the part correctly! You guys go on ahead with me I'll keep this guy busy so you can free them!\" Bartus told the rest of you. It was then you had a fortunate chance to escape and free the mermaids. Although you would like to battle this guy you knew very well that wasn't your top priority right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Bartus interference allowed you to find the rest of the mermaids which kind shocked Erin, it was her first time seeing such a scene and if It were up to you she would never have to see a scene like this again. \" Don't turn your head away from this Erin, remember this so you can always be aware of what malicious people are capable of.\" you told Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Erin agreed and didn't turn her back from the horrors that she saw. \" I'd never imagine it would be like this, but still we have to save them.\" She said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" But how will we free them?  We can't just keep fighting the thieves all night?\" Gareth asked. This you had no idea of how the mermaids would be free. Fortunately however Erin had an idea. \" I have an idea but it requires us to use magic and maybe Esmeralda can help too.\" Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She then explained there idea Erin remembered when she was young she took a peak at the surface on a continent that was filled with ice and saw many creatures moving on the bellies and into the water.  She even thought if she ever had legs she would try it once. It was then that it came to her that this idea could be used as a way for the mermaids to escape. Esmeralda liked the idea as well but the idea required them to find a place they can use to lead them straight to the ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Esmeralda quickly found one and now it was time to get the prisoners out as fast as possible. You, Erin and Esmeralda cast your magic and prepared this ice bridge and made it all the way to the ocean! It was amazing you were able to do such a feat, but now the next part had come. The Mermaids were free and now you had to go to meet with your mother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Goodbye, Friends hopefully we can put an end to all this.\" You tell them. You wave goodbye and Erin says her goodbyes as well before leaving with you on the slide.  It wasn't long when you both went back into the ocean along with several missing mermaids. Unfortunately you couldn't account for the ones that we're dead, but at least you managed to save the majority of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As you and Erin swim in hopes of finding your mother and convincing her to stop her attack, you run into....</span></div></div>",

Not sure what to make of it you decided to investigate it. The only problem was that it was in an area where a lot of human ships had come in. You had to investigate it though, cause it was strange seeing this type of structure underwater. It looked like there were many rooms and one building going up and up further and further. However as far as you can see there seem to be no entry way but plenty of holes for smaller fish to go through in and out with ease, and yet no fish came near this strange building.

You heard tales of mermaids having legs when they were completely dry, but this was the first time you saw it.
