Not many people were in the Starbucks that she was in, or as a matter of fact, the mall as a whole wasn't very populated either. There still was a fair amount of people within the shopping mall, but since it was four o'clock, many people were starting to head home. <br>\r\nSasha took a bite out of her cinnamon bun and looked in front of her. There was an additional chair facing Sasha, but it was empty. Sasha was waiting for her friend, Mia. Mia knew about Sasha's unorthodox obsession with fattening someone up. Being a good best friend, Mia chose to stick with Sasha and keep her company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia then walked into the coffeehouse. Mia had long, brown, and curly hair, big lips, and a rather plump frame. She was a bit shorter, and bit meatier than Sasha.<br>\r\nWhile Sasha wore lighter, looser clothes, Mia wore tighter clothes that hugged her shapely body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late!\" Eclaimed Mia. \"Did you get my Frap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, here it is.\" Sasha pointed to the oppisite side of the two person table. Mia nodded and lowered her generous frame into the chair and started consuming the sweet drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where are we headed after this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... Let me finish my snack first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sash, how can you afford to go to the mall everyday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you a trillion times, Mia! My family's filthy rich. You can use their credit card to buy a time-machine and they wouldn't notice! Plus they're never around, so I can go wherever want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister sticks around the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please...\" Sasha rolled her eyes. \"Don't remind me.\" Sasha's 11 year old sister is without a drivers license, so she usually stays home and watches TV all day. She desperately tries to get Sasha's attention and approval, but only comes off as a nuisance in Sasha's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few minutes of idle chitchat between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you find this kind of thing sexy? Asked Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know. I just think its hot...\" Sasha awkwardly stated while looking at an obese woman at the opposite end of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you almost done, princess?\" Mia asked. Sasha covered her mouth and giggled. Sasha both hated and adored that nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, almost.\" Sasha took a few large bites out of her roll and sucked the last drops of caffeinated liquid in her cup and let out a quiet belch. The pair giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright; where to princess?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOptions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"Let's head to the boutiques and look for some rich, spoiled teens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"Let's go to the comic book store and hunt for some dorks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"Let's head to the toy store and look for some tubby kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. \"Let's go to the food court and hunt ourselves some fatties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. \"Actually Mia, you look a bit peckish yourself! Lets get you something to eat; I'm buying!\"</span></div></div>",

The pair of overfed beauties headed over to the Fos (Fortress of Solitude) Comic store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the Fos, which was conveniently close to the Starbucks, they saw a limited amount of people. Despite the currently low population of the store, the pair of friends saw a variety of people like hipsters and pseudo-hipsters/nerds.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the corner of the shop, where no one was around, Sasha spied a teen boy who was around 14 years of age with a moderately tight shirt on and burying himself into a graphic novel; obviously trying to avoid social contact with everyone and anyone around him. The boy definitely had a bit of a belly and very small moobs. A wide, devilish smile grew upon Sasha's rounded face. Sasha used her index finger to lower the book and have herself in the boy's line of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" Sasha said whist bending forward, trying to maximize cleavage exposure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh- h-hi...\" The boy awkwardly blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name, hot stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... P-people call me Alex. W-why do you wanna know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just wondering is all!\" Sasha said with a smile. \"Say, 'Alex', watcha reading there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Batman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's cool, I think a saw a movie about him some time ago. What's his power again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-he's a billionaire...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A billionaire eh? Not much of a power in my opinion... Say, do you come here often, Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I come here a few times every week.\" Alex said, starting to get a handle on the conversation. \"Oh no!\" Alex thought to himself. \"Now she'll think I'm a total dud...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few times every week? That's kind of cool. You don't see tons of actual comic book hype nowadays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sighed with relief. \"Yeah, usually the comics and novels are actually better than the movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's interesting. So, Alex, what else are you into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh*, A pretty girl like you wouldn't wanna know what I Like...\" Alex said, scratching the back of his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, I kind of like video-games...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Super Mario and Pac-Man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily; more like Warcraft, and Starcraft, and Minecraft, and a few other 'crafts'.\" The two chubby teens talked for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe! Your funny!\" Sasha giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks. Also, I didn't get your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Sasha, or Sash, or whatever you feel like calling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I like Sasha, it sounds pretty.\" \"Oh shoot!\" Alex thought. \"That sounded creepy! And dumb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... That was nice of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex let out another sigh of relief. \"You're welcome, 'Sasha'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha giggled again. \"Listen Alex, my friend and I are going to lunch in the mall; wanna come with?\" Asked Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Alex thought. \"A girl? Asked me? On a date?!\" \"What's the catch?\" Alex said aloud with a half-smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no 'catch', silly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case, it sounds good!\" He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Sasha held Alex's hand and led him to the store entrance. \"Mia! Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right over here!\" Mia called out\" The short, plump teen stood up from an armrest. \"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three overfed teens made their way over to the restaurant part of the mall. They walked until they made their way to an eatery by the name of \"Burger Tower\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about this place! It's the extra-large burger joint!\" Mia exclaimed. \"Do you like food like this, hun?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex nervously smiled and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked in and got a booth in the corner of the eatery. They all sat on one side with Alex sitting in between the two girls. Their generous thighs were brushing against Alex's.<br>\r\nThe waitress approached the table, who was an overweight Asian girl by the name of Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! What can I get you guys?\" Asked Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha turned towards here friends and said, \"Don't worry guys, I'll order for all of us.\" Sasha turned to Yumi. \"We'll get this, this, this... This, that, and this, and lastly that with some of those and lots and lots of that... And an extra-extra-extra large that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi was quickly scribbling down the rather large order on her little notebook. \"Wow, that sure is a lot of food for just the three of you guys!\" She said jokingly. \"Did you guys loose a bet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we just like eating!\" Sasha replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we all.\" Yumi said while smiling. She took the menus and walked away with the monster of an order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sasha, what exactly did you order us?\" Asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just a little bit of this and a little bit of that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround half an hour later, the plump waitress returned with an army of fatty foods and drinks. She placed all the platters and glasses in front of the hungry teens and left them with their food. <br>\r\nAll sorts of burgers, fries, and milkshakes were present. The burger population reached two-dozen, the fries had a dozen small trays, and the milkshakes had nine tall glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well everyone, dig in!\" Sasha said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through everyone's feast, there were some changes to the party. Mia was happily gorging away on her part of the meal, still keeping a consistent pace. Sasha was still going strong despite her bulging belly's protest but some of her attention was focused on Alex. The boy in question was slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex leaned back and rested his hands on his full belly. \"Sasha, I don't think I can eat anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you still look famished! Here, let Sashie help you...\" Sasha grabbed a milkshake glass and poured it into Alex's open mouth. Sasha got up close to Alex and whispered, \"Isn't it great?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's so good! I can't stop here, it'll disappoint Sasha!\" Alex thought to himself. He leaned forward and started feasting on an oversized burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it... A boy needs to clean his plate...\" Sasha lightly rubbed the side of Alex's belly without him noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did they know that someone was watching the three with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feast was nearing its end. With Mia finished all of her food and Sasha drinking the last drops of her milkshake, all eyes turned to Alex who had a few bites of a burger and some fries remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, you can finish it!\" Mia cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex simply shook his head and let out a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls looked at each other and smiled. Mia picked up the fries and dropped them into his mouth. Sasha picked up the remainder of the burger and put it into his mouth. She then wrapped her unoccupied arm around Alex's hip, scooched clse to him, and whispered, \"C'mon, a strong boy like you can finish it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex swallowed the fried food fed to him. \"Yay!\" Both girls cheered and pecked Alex on the cheeks at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio waddled out of the restaurant, holdeing their overtaxed bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was sooo good!\" Mia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? What did you think of it, Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was, *burp*, filling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked at each other and giggled. \"Hey Mia, why don't you start heading to the south parking lot? We'll catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister is picking me up in the north one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright. See ya later, Alex!\" Mia started for the oppisite end of the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha looked at Alex and smiled. \"You are soo cute! I've gotta have your number!\" Alex have the chubby teen his number and she punched it into her pink-clad iPhone. \"Do you think we can have lunch again, tomarrow? I'll pay again like I did today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel right making the girl pay for the meal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, my family's rich. Besides, I'm treating you like you deserve to be treated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if you insist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha ran up to Alex and gave him a casual hug. \"See you tomarrow, cutie!\" She ran into the mall to catch up to Mia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex scratched the back of his head and started for the nearby door? \"Cutie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was walking until she heard some slow, heavy footsteps coming her way. She turned around to see Sasha stopping out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*pant* *pant*, hold on, I need a minute!\" Sasha said as she sat on a nearby bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Mia walked over to a vending machine next to the bench. \"I'm getting a coke, want one?\" Mia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. Im parched!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia started putting money into the despener. \"So you think that this guy is the one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally! He's really docile and he's kind of charming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I come with you guys to your sessions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind if you come along, but I thought that you weren't into this kind of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I might be; I think Alex is Kinda cute, plus,  I AM into free food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha giggled. \"Alright, you're free to come along!\"</span></div></div>",

He waddled over and hopped in shotgun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" He said to his sister, Holly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was a semi-tomboy in her early twenties, having long and curly brown hair and fine skin, she usually wore punkish clothes. For example, today she was wearing a leather jacket, sunglasses, and acid washed jeans. She was a fairly skinny girl up until some recent developments allowed her to have a bit of pudge on her belly and thicker thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how were the comics?\" Holly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't know. Five minutes after reading, I was asked out on a date by not one, but two girls.\" Alex replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, what did I tell you about telling tall tales?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm serious! Look, one of them, Sasha, exchanged numbers.\" Alex whipped out his phone and showed Holly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! I bet you just made up that number!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly, go over to the other parking lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if you insist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly cruised over to the opposite parking lot. Alex peered out the car window on arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, that's them!\" Alex pointed to the cubby girls talking in front of the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Holly looked over to Alex. \"Prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex rolled down his window and shouted out, \"Sasha! Mia! See you guys tomorrow! Upon hearing the source of the shouting, the girls playfully blew kisses his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no shit... You really did go on a date! Unless you paid them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't pay them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, whatever you say. Hey, up for some ice cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I kinda just had lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you pay for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, but-\" Holly slapped him in the arm. \"Ow! What was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make the girls pay for your broke ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She insisted on paying! Besides, there was no way I could have afforded a feast that big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly how big was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We each had eight burgers and three milkshakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Can you really eat that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still up for ice-cream? Holly started to get on the main road into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon live a little! Besides, I could sure go for some!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was full beyond belief, but he couldn't say no to treats. \"Fine, lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Holly drove to the ice cream shop in town. \"You can stay here; I know what you like.\" Holly ran into the parlor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later Holly came out with the sundaes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are way larger than I remember...\" Alex said, examining his sugary treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The XL sundaes are discounted on Fridays.\" Holly said whilst sticking the spoon into her equally large sundae. \"Well, dig in!\" Holly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! I'm home from the mall!\" Mia cried out upon entering through the garage door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Did you get enough to eat?\" Mia's mom yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was Sasha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was hungry, as usual!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's good to hear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia's family were immigrants from the old country; somewhere in Eastern Europe. After the war, her family moved to the States following her homeland's mass starvation. Her mother was raised on the value that a fed child was a healthy child. Mia's mother was attentive at making sure that her only child was well-fed, which explains Mia's excess weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia went up to her room and closed her door. She had an idea. \"I probably shouldn't do this...\" Mia took of her shirt and her pants, revealing her fleshy and soft physique.<br>\r\n\"... But it's too good to resist!\" Mia pulled a sack from underneath her bed and emptied its contents on top of it. Candy. Lots, and lots, and lots of candy. Mia hopped on top of her mound and started violently unwrapping the plastic to obtain the sweet substance within.<br>\r\n\"I'm such a naughty girl!\" She whispered to herself. This is Mia's sole guilty pleasure. It's not a new one by any means, since she only started these sessions only a month or two ago. Mia gained extreme pleasure out of doing this, but she wasn't sure why. All Mia knew was that the more she suffed herself and the more frequently she did it, the more aroused she became. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate like a beast for an hour until she fell asleep, surrounded by plastic wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha opened the front door of her family's large house and walked inside. \"Anyone home?\" Sasha called out as she walked deeper into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" A little voice said. Sasha walked into the kitchen and saw her nine year old sister, Kimmy. Kimmy had black hair, green eyes, and a pudgy little belly. Sasha rolled her eyes at the sight of Kimmy. Kimmy frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing now? Sasha asked with little interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drawing pictures, do you want to see them? Sasha shook her head. \"Oh, that's ok...\" Kimmy said dishearteningly. Kimmy constantly tried to earn her big sister's approval, but to no avail. Kimmy saw that Sasha was browsing thought the contents of the pantry. \"Can you pass me the chocolate cake?\" Kimmy asked Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Sasha said without putting much thought into her action as she gave the store-bought chocolate pound cake to her sister. Kimmy wondered off with the large treat. Sasha pulled out some brownies and retreated to her room with the goodies in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Kimmy held her swollen little tummy. \"Oh, that was so good! I should do that more!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was 4:00 O'clock on Saturday, and Sasha was sipping on her iced-tea and eating her muffin. A usual habit on arrival to the mall. As usual, Sasha was waiting for Mia who was fashionably late quite often. Mia soon came in, wearing another one of her figure-hugging outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get my Frap?\" Mia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha pointed at the chocolate beverage across from her as she was drinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia sat down in front of the drink and asked, \"What's the plan for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're going to be meeting Alex by the food court. I told him to come at 4:15 so we could come here first and talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food court sounds good.\" Mia said as she rubbed her growling belly in anticipation. \"Why exactly do we come here later in the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few reasons. First off, there are less people buzzing around the mass with their prying eyes. Second, if we get lunch late, Alex will probably be hungrier and eat way more. Finally, I personally like to sleep of my feasts and wake up to dinner.\" Sasha explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense...\" Mia agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Sasha looked at her phone's clock. \"We should start heading over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia nodded and the duo lifted themselves out of the comfy chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was sitting in one of the benches near the entrance of the food court. He was a bit early, arriving at 4:10. Alex was anticipating the arrival of the buxom babes; mostly, he had a bit of a crush on the two, partially, because he was eager to see what food they'll be getting. While painful for his middle, Alex found some strange satisfaction in being totally stuffed. <br>\r\nSuddenly, he noticed the girls approaching him. Also, he couldn't resist the temptations of any good food which explains his rather chubby frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiii!\" Sasha cried out as she leaned in for a hug. \"You look starving! Lets get you some food before you rot away!\" Sasha held Alex's hand and led him into the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha got a table in a rather secluded section of the court. The table was tucked in in the corner of the court and behind a low wall, but still had easy access to the food. Mia and Alex sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get your lunches, guys. I'll be right back.\" Sasha said as she went off to hunt for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence between the rounded youngsters as Mia was text-messaging someone and Alex was twittiling his thumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where do you guys live?\" Alex asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia looked up from her phone and said, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked about where you guys live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I live by the high school and Sasha lives in the rich neighborhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, I live by the high school as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump pair made idle conversation until Sasha arrived with the food, which took a few trips. There was a variety of food on the table this time around. The food ranged from hotdogs, to fried chicken, to cakes and pies. Fatty and sugary food blanketed the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a bit of everything again.\" Sasha said as she sat next to Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything looks so good!\" Mia said as she got herself some cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha grabbed some tacos and started chowing down. Meanwhile, Alex looked hesitant about what he sould take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha got a bucket of fried chicken, put a wing in his mouth, and gently said, \"Eat up, babe. You don't want to waste away, now would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex bit into the fried meat and took the entire bucket for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the feast neared its end, the trio got an unexpected spectator.<br>\r\nYumi, the plump Asian waitress from burger tower was off her shift and doing some shopping when she saw a familiar sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia crammed a taco into her mouth. \"Oh, these are soo good! You have to try some, Alex!\" Mia placed a taco in front of Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex picked one up and took a large bite. \"Oh, that is good.\" Alex said as her took two more from the stockpile of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha picked up a small pound cake drizzled with chocolate and placed it in front of the stuffed boy. \"You should *urp* try this, cutie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex picked up the cake with his bare hands and took massive bites out of it while the buxom beauties watched with intense lust. After consuming most of the cake, Alex set it down, leaned back, and rubbed his belly whilst moaning. Both girls giggled immensely and playfully groped their prized piggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your soooo adorable!\" Mia moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't rest for long; you've still a lot food left, handsome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi watched from a distance as the overfed trio stuffed themselves and each other. Yumi didn't know why, but she couldn't look away! It was kind of arousing for her. She found a table far enough away so she could observe the stuffing, but far enough away so she couldn't be caught watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha leaned back and poured Ramen down her gullet. \"*burp*, oh, that was good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the table was finally devoid of food, the teens leaned back and nursed their sodas while rubbing their overworked tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really good!\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it, babe!\" Sasha replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so *urp* full!\" Mia said, patting her gut. She leaned back further back in her chair until\u2013 \"Aahh!\" Mia's chair fell backwards and left her on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two quickly sat up from their lazy positions. <br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Are you ok?\" Sasha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia lifted her shirt up, jiggled her belly and giggled immensely while still on the ground. Sasha and Alex sighed in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lifting Mia to her feet the trio made for the exit with Yumi tailing behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, my sister can't pick me up today.\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok, we can drive you home!\" Replied Sasha<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I don't want to be any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Alex!\" Mia said. \"Princess here loves me to chauffeur people around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile grew on Sasha's face and she playfully shoved the largest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls held Alex's hands as they walked out the mall doors to the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi stood still as she watched the bloated three leave the mall. She was undeniably fascinated and pleased with their gluttony. She giggled as she turned around and started for the opposite parking lot where her car was located. \"I wonder if they'll be back tomorrow...\" She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teens walked out into the parking lot towards Sasha's car. Her car was a rather pricey large red luxury SUV. The interior was roomy and looked exceedingly comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Sasha! Your car is beautiful!\" Alex exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Mia got into the driver seat while Sasha rode shotgun and Alex sat in the back. As Mia backed out of the parking space, Sasha said, \"By the way, there are treats in the cooler under your seat. You should totally try some!\"<br>\r\nAlex pulled out the somewhat heavy cooler to find it containing all sorts of candy bars and snack cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, These are all my favorites! I hardly ever get to have them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have as many as you like, babe!\" Sasha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex started shoveling handfuls of sugary junkfood into his maw. Sasha and Mia looked at each other and grined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout Alex noticing, Mia took a few detours to lengthen the ride home until Alex emptied the entire cooler by the time the group parked next to Alex's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I ate *urrp* all your snacks, Sasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Giggle*, It's ok, cutie! I can always buy more! Also would you like to have lunch again tomarrow? Asked Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! See you tomarrow, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiled as he walked out of the car and entered his house. The girls speeded away when he disappeared into his domain. When Alex walked into the foyer, he saw his mom, an auburn woman with a tinsy bit of excess weight, sitting on a nearby chair whilst reading a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, baby. How was your date?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good.\" He said while heading towards his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm making macaroni and cheese pizza for dinner, does that sound ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex licked his lips. \"That sounds great!\" He said approvingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Alex, his mom saw that he didn't eat much of his dinner the previous night and thought he wasn't eating because of being nervous towards girls. To counteract this, she planned to make thick, hearty meals each night to assure he didn't waste away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia pulled in front of her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, same thing tomarrow?\" Mia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha smiled. \"You know it! We'll just rinse and repeat until...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll just have to find out, now won't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked at each other and giggled naughtily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was 11 o'clock in the morning. Alex's room was completely silent with no traces of life out in the open. Just then, a slight breeze brought in a light scent of pancakes and bacon. This caused one rather lethargic teen to awake from his slumber. He stood up with eyes half-closed and took slow steps to his bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flicked on the light, splashed water in his own face, and looked at himself. The week of gorging, pampering, spoiling, and more gorging has brought some changes to the already chubby boy's body. He had a softer looking belly with a much deeper navel to go along with it. There were some more changes, such as his arms, which definitely packed more meat on them, and his moobs which were much, much more well-defined and started to hang a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! Your breakfast is ready!\" His mom called out from downstairs.<br>\r\nAlex threw on a particularly tight teeshirt and some rather constrictive shorts and hurried downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stepped into the warm kitchen, Alex saw his mom putting chocolate-chip pancakes onto a serving plate already piled high with an excessive amount of fattening flapjacks. There was also a large platter stacked with thick strips of juicy bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Alex. Let me serve you some-\"<br>\r\nBefore his mom could finish her sentence, Alex grabbed both serving plates and headed straight for the dining table. She smiled and giggled a bit, comfortably knowing that her sweet little boy wouldn't starve away into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry today?\" She asked. Alex gave an unexcited grunt in response. \"Would you like some whipped cream?\" She said while holding out a large can of the calorie cream. Alex quickly snatched it and set it down near his plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex ferociously sliced the giant monolith into bite-sized chunks and stuffed them into his maw, occasionally throwing in some bacon or spraying a lengthy stream of cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's mom watched as her boy hunched over his plate and absorbed the fatty breakfast like it was his first meal in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought, \"That boy sure has a- 'healthy' appetite.\" The mother was aware that her son has put on a comfortable amount of poundage, but unsure of what to do. She ultimately decided to continue indulging him in his newfound passion for different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mostly thought that what Alex was going through is natural for teens, and she should nurture for the increased demand for nutrients. She also believed that a hungry teen is a happy teen. And finally, she was curious of how much more growth Alex would go through before he plateaued. She didn't assume much more expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can you make some more?\" Alex asked. The ample teen completely demolished every pancake, licked the plate dry of any remaining syrup deposits, and vacuumed every single crumb of bacon from the vicinity. An average boy of his age could have probably only gotton through a third of what Alex just ate before passing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Oh, and how does potato skins and fried chicken sound for dinner?\" She asked while taking his empty plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything sounds fine.\" He said while rubbing his plush tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" She cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unsure of how much longer she would keep doing this until she eventually would pull the plug. Although, having Alex in this state does have some benefits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, Alex is much more submissive and easygoing than before, saving her much stress. She also loves cooking, making feeding Alex more of a hobby than a chore. Finally, she's grown kind of fond of the teen's new plump figure. She would probably pay more attention, do more favors, and spend more time with a plush and tubby Alex than a scrawny one.<br>\r\nBeing with this new Alex and doing things for the growing boy made her much happier than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, she would keep doing what she's doing, but she told herself, that she might have stop this later. However, for the time being, Alex's mom could give in to her urges and indulge her increasingly lazy son.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At Mia's home, things were going a bit differently. Mia struggled to pull her sweatpants over her increasingly plump posterior. \"Hmph... this could be getting out of hand,\" she muttered, as she puffed and sucked in until it slid past her bountiful booty. Mia looked at herself in the mirror. This week of almost constant gorging had actually significantly impacted her waistline, leading to her previously mention backside straining her already curve-hugging pants, and her slightly noticeable paunch becoming a fairly noticeable paunch that pressed against the front of her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked sadly at the parts of her that hadn't been affected by this recent gain- her boobs, which had maintained their C-cup size, not even threatening her bra. She was glad that her face didn't reflect her new poundage, however. Her angular face, single chin, and dimples all maintained their form, not looking even slightly different. In fact, had someone given you a head shot of Mia pre- and post- gain, you might've even thought that she had lost a few pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly didn't help things that Sasha had been getting her to stop at various fast food restaurants on their way home, regardless of if Alex was with them or not. And a further blow to her caloric consumption came from Sasha coming over to her house after the mall the past few days and pushing her well past her junk food eating limits 3 days in a row. <i>\"Any more of this, and I might pop,\"</i> though Mia to herself. <i>\"If I didn't know any better, I'd say Sasha was trying to fatten ME up as well, but she wouldn't do that, I'm her best friend.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile, across town...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha watched TV as she contentedly laid on her couch and thought about the last week. She had used stuffing Alex as an excuse to feed anything in sight to the peak of fullness, including Mia. Mia had actually gained a surprising amount of weight in the last week, and just the thought of her tight sweat pants trying to hold back the sea of ass flesh brought a moan to Sasha's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha tried to think of more ways to get Mia and Alex to gain weight, but couldn't really think of anything. After such brilliant ideas as fast food stops on the way home and essentially force-feeding Mia junk food until she could barely breathe, Sasha didn't really know what else to do. She shrugged and went back to her show. She'd think of something eventually, and until then, no waistline was safe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>5 hours later...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 4 pm, and just as usual, Mia strolled into the Starbucks. \"Did you get my Frap?\" she asked in her traditional phrase of greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did. But there was a deal today, so I got a buy-one-get-one-free Venti, so two for you,\" replied Sasha slyly, even though she knew there was no such deal in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, why didn't you have one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, you know that I don't like fraps. I just like my Grande chai tea, I don't need anything fancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" replied Mia, as she took a gulp from her first frap. \"Well, you ready to go find Alex, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for that. I told him to meet us here in 20. Take your time, girl.\"</span></div></div>",

Marie stepped inside for a drink of cold water when she heard the sound of guns, rockets, and grunting. Cocking an eyebrow, Marie investigated her daughter's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie creaked open the door to see the state of her daughter's man- er, \"woman-cave\". The room was almost pitch-black if it wasn't for her daughter's computer and a shred of light bleeding through the window curtains. The floor was caked with old clothes and her bed was unmade with its sheets in a pile. Finally, her underwear-clad daughter was one-hundred percent focused on her desktop computer. Marie walked over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlotte?\" Marie asked in an attempt to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Charlotte replied with little interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing without your clothes on?\" Marie asked with a slightly more aggressive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half-Life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlotte, please, we've talked about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" Charlotte hit escape on her keyboard and turned her chair around. \"What?\" She said. Charlotte's pale body really showed at this position. While she definitely wouldn't be classified as an anorexic girl or even scrawny, she really didn't have much meat on her bones. Though she was very untoned, giving Charlotte a tinsy-tiny potbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright if you want to spend most of your summer relaxing, but your going against our agreement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\" Charlotte avoided making eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one where you go out and socialize and try and make friends while in return, I'll be less reluctant to giving you money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah...\" Charlotte said, scratching her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Charlotte, I don't ask much from you, and the things I do expect from you will only benefit yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, mom.\" Charlotte rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie took thirty dollars out of her wallet and gave them and her car keys to Charlotte. \"C'mon and spend some money, make some friends, and come home happy.\" She said, trying to be encouraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'll go out, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! That makes me very happy.\" Marie gave Charlotte a kiss on the forehead and left her cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh*, guess I gotta get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte quickly through on black jeans and a tight black T-shirt with some pale makeup. She ran out to the garage and took her mom's SUV to the mall.<br>\r\nCharlotte didn't visit the Colony mall very much; especially when compared with most of her peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte entered the Colony mall at 4:00 pm; where does she go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thirty dollars was a pretty inconvenient amount of money.   You couldn't buy any really decent clothes with it, and she had enough cheap stuff.   It wasn't enough to buy any of the games she was interested in, either, and who paid for anime anymore when there was Youtube, the Pirate Bay, and about a hundred shady Chinese websites to get it from?  Besides, if she came back with more stuff to do in her room, her mom would probably pitch a fit.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked a butter-soaked, salt-encrusted pretzel from What a Twist and plopped down at empty table to eat it.  She could see families, couples, groups of friends--how the hell was she supposed to make friends, anyway?  It wasn't like she was a jerk to people, but somehow the weird social dance that everyone else was so good at always ended with her flat on her face.  Why couldn't her mom just let her stay in her room where she was comfortable? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay.  I'll finish this pretzel, then I'll talk to someone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd say what?   What was she supposed to do, just insert herself into one of the groups of girls?  She'd just make them uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished the pretzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn.  Well.   Maybe I'll have some ice cream first.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate it as slowly as possible, allowing it to almost fully melt by the time she was licking the last drops of it off her hand.  Okay.  Now she was going to go talk to someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway towards a smaller group, one of the girls looked up and met her eye.  Charlotte stared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit!  I'm staring.  I can't sit down there now, she'll think I'm a freak.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swerved into the line at the burger stand and nailed her gaze to the menu, hoping her blush wasn't visible though the powder on her face.  <i>I'll just people-watch a little more.  Can't hurt, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit.  I wonder if it's possible to blow through thirty bucks just at the food court.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't, as it turned out, but it took her a double cheeseburger meal, three tacos, and a slice of pizza to find out.   Charlotte's stomach raised the white flag with a ten dollar bill to spare.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chucked the latest wad of napkins and wax paper into the trash.   <i>This is it</i>, she resolved, picking out another group of girls. <i> I'm going to go sit with them if it kills me.  I'll just... be myself.  Okay, here I go.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway to the table, she realized something.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWait.   They're all eating.  I can't just sit down without any food.  How weird would that be?   I mean, why would I even be doing it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned.   <i>Fuuuuuck.</i>   If she sat down without food, she'd look like some socially awkward chick who was trying and failing to make friends.  Which was exactly what she was, but she didn't want them to <i>know </i>it.   <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nMaybe I could grab another slice or something?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought made her slightly queasy.   She was already uncomfortably full, thanks to all that procrastination-inspired snacking.   The last thing she needed was more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if she could just make one friend, her mom would be so happy.  And a happy mom translated into big money and way less nagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Suck it up, Charlotte</i>, she resolved, buying another slice and heading over to the table of teenage girls.  She tugged her t-shirt down over the crescent of pale flesh peeking out at her midriff.  <i> Time to... to... shit, just don't screw it up, okay?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all shrugged.<br>\r\n\"No, we don't mind if you sit here.\" One of the girls said. Charlotte smiled and nodded with acknowledgement. She sat her bony tush in the small seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe natives of the table soon took their attention off of Charlotte and continued the conversation that they were having earlier. The conversation was petty as all hell. Gossip and celebrity news was all white noise to Charlotte, since she mostly cared about foreign affairs and the like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Charlotte tried to avoid eye contact with any of the girls and focused on her pizza. It brought her back to many of the group projects she was assigned in school. Like the projects, she was dead silent for most of its duration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Charlotte's pizza disappeared into her overtaxed gut, she was forced to lift her head up and look at the girls. Though they all had many subtle differences they shared one noticeable attribute: they were all very quite fat and surrounded by food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a redhead, who seemed to be doing most of the talking, a brunette with straight hair, who had very tight clothes and might have recently gained weight, and a brunette girl with curly hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latter girl was definitely the most interesting for a few reasons. For one, she was the fattest of the bunch by far; possibly outweighing the pair of auxiliary fat girls by at least 30 pounds. Second, she was stunningly attractive. Charlotte was bi, but was never really into fat babes. Despite this, Charlotte couldn't stop staring at her. Finally, she definitely took an interest to Charlotte. The goth couldn't place her finger on how, but it was clear that the overfed brunette wanted to pull her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the plush girls polished off their fatty food, the redhead and the smaller brunette stood up. The largest girl remained stationary<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you coming with us?\" Asked the redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no. I'll catch up with you guys later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls extended their goodbyes and separated.<br>\r\nCharlotte and the husky teen exchanged glances.<br>\r\n\"So, what's your name\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlotte.\" The goth squeezed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a cool name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I got it for my birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Charlotte asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like eating?\" Asked the big Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell I do!\" Exclaimed Charlotte. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, this may sound kind of sudden and a little weird, but you should come over tomorrow to my house so we can hang out. That is if you're free, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've barely said a few sentences to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll get to know each other, then.\" She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You won.\" Charlotte said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette whipped out a small piece of paper and a half pencil from her handbag. She scribbled down he address and phone number. Her arms jiggled as she did so.<br>\r\nBecca handed her the paper and waved goodbye. Charlotte watched her fat ass jiggle in her constrictive leggings as she slowly disappeared into the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuuck, she's hot.\" She thought.</span></div></div>",

He was good at it, he was only cast as either a supporting role or other in these movies.  That was until now, when he received a call up to be part of a movie, as a lead character for the first time!  He couldn\u2019t believe he worked so hard for this and couldn\u2019t wait to see himself on the big screen, especially on the poster he could treasured this so much for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that\u2019s when he told by a director named Simon, who unveiled his plans to make up a new movie.  What is about is a kid who would play as, goes to the shopping mall and aims to eat as much as he can, this getting fatter in the process as time goes on.  It seems fine in all, but it had said they\u2019re making Lewis really fat for real, which made himself feeling concerned for his part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis main worry is that how would he feel about being so fat in front of cameras if it means of eating loads at the mall as much as the director wants it, and also how would the people react to not only this film but towards himself in particular?  He was having a no win-win situation and knowing that withdrawing from a film would cost himself a career as an actor for his age.  So he sighed and reluctantly agreed to take on a role as much as he wants to save his career and hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days came on, so does the first day on set, when Lewis was there at the mall with cameras and crew all over.  He was looking nervous and anxious about his weight gain thing he can only think of, but he would try and calm himself down when he saw a director named Simon coming over and giving out some advice to a youngster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright kid!  I know you aren\u2019t sure about this whole thing, but feel free to roam all over the mall and eat as many as you can.  And remember, always have fun and enjoy while you\u2019ll even notice you\u2019ll be getting fatter to amaze the viewers, okay?\u201d  Simon\u2019s advice may be simple when he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try my best as much as I can, sir!\u201d  Lewis nodded with a shiver tone, but takes deep breaths and gets to his confident model to get himself ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cameras are rolling and the action is called, and so Lewis gets a part when he acts by walking around the mall and says to himself, looking as if he\u2019s admiring all the food stuff they all have in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... I can\u2019t wait to feed the whole food to myself.  But where should I head to first I wonder?\u201d  Lewis asked in a curious thoughts, whilst acting his role at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can also remember that the director gives him free choice wherever he goes, as long as it involves food and gain some weight at the same time.  Of course the shopping mall is so huge, he could try and figure so many things, but can do this one of at the time.  Which is why Lewis makes a decision and heads to where to get something to eat first, while the cameras are still rolling?</span></div></div>",

With all the burger joints, the Italian establishments, the pretzel stands, and more, what a tasty, and callorie-filled, pantry that'll be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreate any character you want but keep him/her around junior high to high school and collage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to explore Porto proper, but keep the real stuffing and gaining within the Colony itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease hold your barrage of short, pointless chapters and fabricate a single longer piece instead (unless you plan a following up a short chapter with a longer chapter).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease try and use proper grammar and spelling as best as you can!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease title your lengthier chapters chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease try and use descriptive language to the best of your ability (Show, not tell).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease, please, please write a chapter if you enjoy the premise of this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic or ray guns<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weight gain darts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReliance on weight gain powder/pills, liquid lard, or other fattening agents like these (try and keep weight gain natural and stretched out over time).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInflation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGender swap<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtreme hight growth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderage sex<br>\r\n<br>\r\nALLOWED:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGay and Bi relationships<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex and nudity (not in extreme depth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForce-feeding<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipping clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecret fattening<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSUMMERY AND FINAL WORD:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease write quality chapters that adds to the story alongside the weight gain. Chapters that go against the simple rules can and WILL be removed. Authors that contribute care and effort-filled chapters will be graciously appreciated for their limited time and patronage spent on this story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonally, this will be a learning experience to bump up my game to produce more chapters that not only have more substance, but quality as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you can, send an on-site email with suggestions on how I can improve and refine my style of writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for reading,<br>\r\nPolish Warchief</td>",
