The final day was about to come. Zant has been defeated, but the real villain behind it all was still waiting for them, cowardly hiding behind that giant shield he created around Hyrule Castle. Link sighed again. What chance would he and Midna have against a creature that could create something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, 'hero'. Worried about tomorrow?\" She gave him a fanged grin. \"You're not going to chicken out on your 'destiny' now, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noo, of course not...\" Link replied, managing to smile a little bit at least. Somehow, she always managed to cheer him up, even tho her remarks where as bold as always. But... He kinda liked it. She was bossy, sure, but there was more to her, that much he learned on his travels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was jerked out of his thoughts by a light slap on the back of his head. For such a little creature, she was really strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then stop being a worrywart.\" She replied with another fanged grin. Link managed to smile a bit. Maybe she was right, maybe it'd all come differently than expected.</span></div></div>",

The moon was high on the sky and it's white light illuminated the castle in the distance. The little imp yawned. Why was she awake at this time. She blinked up into the sky, where the moon loomed. Huh. Back home, there was never really a moon visible that clearly... It was always twilight, after all. It was strange... Made her feel... Quite good actually. She always felt a little more powerful at night, but this was different. This was... A lot more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little imp licked her lips. She liked this feeling, quite a bit. Maybe it was the Twili in her that was lusting for power, but... They had to defeat Ganon, right? Maybe there was a way to find out how to harness this power that seemed to be present during the night. She glanced over to Link. Fast asleep, drooling a little. Typical. First playing the worried guy, then being out cold like that. Oh well...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Yep! It's a Midna growth story. The basic premise is that it's the night before the final fight - the final confrontation with Ganon, and Midna and Link rest outside Hyrule in the fields to be ready for the battle to come. In essence, it's supposed to give us a different ending to the game - after all, who didn't want to see Midna grow at the end and beat Ganon herself? And there are a lot of opportunities, too! Maybe a royal spell, only applied to a princess when she's born will kick into effect? Maybe the absorption of some things will trigger growth, like draining Ganon's Magic, the Magic in the Triforce of power or even drawing growth from certain, more kinky substances or feelings? It's all up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm putting this out with a GC rating, to set the writers free, not to limit them. So, while you're free to go all kinky on this, it's not a requirement. A safe story line that's E or PG would be fun, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before we start, some rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to focus on Midna as a character, Link would be nice, but he's optional. Wolf and Normal Link are both fair game. Please also use imp Midna only. Feel free to crossover the characters of the Zelda games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLesbian/Gay lines are allowed, but since the focus is on Midna, a gay story would probably not make much sense, so keep that in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo scat or watersports please. Also please no weight gain. Some morphes are fine, tho, BE, bigger hips, maybe a little belly, all okay.<br>\r\nNo overly gory or bloody scenes, keep them to a minimum<br>\r\nNo vore of people, please. Maybe animals, but also no hardvore in that case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease also try to not do \"one-line\" paragraphs and try to write in a correct grammer without too many typos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will delete and/or correct chapters that break those rules, but I'm always open for discussion and not too harsh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood additions (meaning those that obey the rules and have some length will be rewarded with GP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly, have fun! :D</td>",
