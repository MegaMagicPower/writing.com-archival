Your swim trunks were on fine, your body feels fine too. But then you noticed the rocks. The rocks looked like small buildings! Suddenly, the ground shook like mad as you saw two giant sized human women heading towards you! They sat down in the sand nearby and you finally recognized them, they were Rangiku and Orihime from the Bleach anime! In bathing suits! You thought for sure this was a dream, but when you fell and hit your head on one of the giant rocks by accident, you quickly realized it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the small amount of panic, you had to make a decision! Will you approach these giant beauties, or will you attempt to sneak past them?<br>\r\nOrihime doesn't seem like she'd hurt you or anything, but Rangiku is another story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I forgot to get a bucket again!\" Orihime pouted as you got ever closer to the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember what I taught you last time? We can just use our boobs again!\" Rangiku gleamed as she searched the sand for a good source of water. You stopped dead in your tracks when her eyes rested on you and you saw them go wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Rangiku?\" Orihime asked as she looked in the direction that Rangiku's eyes were locked. \"Hey, is that some sort of crab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRangiku shook her head with her eyes still locked on you. \"No. It's a human, and a regular human at that. I can't sense anything special about him.\" Orihimi gasped at this, \"But that can't be a human, it's so tiny!\" You feel as though this is the perfect opportunity to jump up and down and wave, shocking both of the girls. You shout up at them that you don't know how you were shrunk, and that you could use some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bikini-clad giantesses look at each other, then back at you...</span></div></div>",

We can have our own little toy man to play with if we catch him!\" Orihime objected to this idea though. \"He's asking for our help! We should take him back to the others and see what they can do.\" Rangiku however, tried harder to convince her. \"Wouldn't you like to see what it's like to have a little man though? Maybe if we play around enough with this one, you can find out how to get Ichigo at that size eh?\" Rangiku winked as Orihime blushed. \"D-do you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRangiku simply gave her another wink and said \"We won't know until we try. But let's keep it a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there, shifting nervously. This didn't look good. If girls are whispering about you, that means they might want to do something bad to you. Rangiku and Orihime turned around again, and Rangiku got to her knees and struck a pose, making sure to bounce her chest. \"Hey little guy~ Come over here and we'll really help you!\" Rangiku said in a seductive tone, with Orihime just sitting next to her blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a sign that they weren't going to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, you took off running in the other direction, catching Rangiku off guard a bit. \"He's running away!\" Orihime said as Rangiku shifted a bit. \"Mmm not to worry Orihime, it's time for Booby Buckets to get a new purpose!\" Rangiku said as she dove at you. \"New technique! Booby Trap!\" Rangiku shouted as she dove at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran as fast as you could, looking behind you to see Rangiku's massive chest barreling towards you, ready to swallow you up when it caught up with you.

Her eyes widen as she begins to speak to you. \"Where did you come from little one?\" You stare up at Isane and decide it's best to respond, \"I was just walking on the beach when some weird black cloud drifted over me. I came over here to try and get help from one of you.\" Isane smiled warmly at you, although you aren't sure if that was a good sign or a bad one. \"I would be more then happy to help you!\" You sighed in relief as Isane began to look around. \"Although, I don't think it would be a good idea to expose you here. As much as I don't want to admit it, some of the girls here would probably...abuse you.\" Isane began pondering what to do with you. \"I don't have any pockets to hide you... what could I possibly do...\" While Isane was pondering, you couldn't help look down at her swimsuit clad body. She was wearing the same brownish tan swimsuit from the swimsuit festival last year. Isane looked as if inspiration struck as she blushed a bit. \"I-I'm sorry about having to do this, but I'm going to have to hide you for now. I apologize if this gets uncomfortable, but I can't risk anyone else finding you...\" Isane said in a nervous tone as her hand slowly brought you to her collosal chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously struggled a bit and you were pushed between the two massive mounds, prompting a few giggles from Isane. \"P-please stop, that tickles!\" Isane says as she pushes her breasts lightly together to make sure you stay in place. Isane then turns to rejoin the group of ladies who are preparing to judge their sand sculptures, you lodged deep into her cleavage and hidden from sight. The warmth and rhythm of Isane walking slowly luls you to sleep, her heartbeat sounding like a lullaby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day slowly begins passing by, Isane is constantly thinking about you lodged in her cleavage.

It seems as though you've been shrunk, and right in the middle of the Shinigami Women's Association's second annual sand art contest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, will you try and get help from these giant beauties? Or will you perhaps try to get off the beach with your life? Will any of these women actually help you if they find you? Or will they use you as their own personal little toy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it's women only, so no male characters aside from yourself.<br>\r\nYou cannot grow, the women cannot shrink.<br>\r\nYachiru is to be left out of this, sorry, she's just too young looking.<br>\r\nPlease type in english to the best of your abilities.<br>\r\nPlease keep things in third person (I.E. You climb up the rock for a better view)<br>\r\nWomen can leave the beach with you at any time, you can keep things unaware or go for aware.<br>\r\nTry to go a bit into the story before any death.<br>\r\nKeep things like vore and insertion to light. Nothing hardcore.<br>\r\nNo scat or major gore. (Keep it to bloodstains, broken bones and such if you're crushed.)<br>\r\nAnd finally, try to keep the girls personality when writing, although feel free to have them also embrace their dark sides too.
