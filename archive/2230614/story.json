            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.6;\">You run through an alley, from turn to turn. Sweats flowing down your face along with the wind gushing on its skin. <br>\r\nAll the running starting to sore your feet a bit, the thing about running against Jack was you need to be twice faster than him. This took you back to what happened earlier\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour before, you were packing your stuff to be brought home as usual. Today is your birthday, your family was planning a fancy dinner at a restaurant in town. It's one of those fulfilling moments you could really eat something besides those cheap canteen foods with your cheap allowance. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Alex!\u201d towards the loud boyish call, you turned and saw Josh stood across the hall. He was wearing a light blue shirt with short baggy pants underneath. But his attire will be changed as he\u2019s attending Cassie\u2019s vocal situation.<br>\r\n\u201cDude, c\u2019mon you can\u2019t bail on this.\u201d Josh said, he really needs his bro (meaning you) for this. Yep, Cassie, also your best friend and always with something she had to say from her mind. Today she managed to gather some students, the goths, for a strike after school. Principal Angela published a new rule, which bans the use of gothic makeup because it opposes the school spirit. It's been a trend at your school lately and it felt consistent with your negative mood. <br>\r\nOther than Cassie\u2019s urgent request, you also had a promise from your mom to be kept. It\u2019s the birthday dinner and to have less disciplinary meetings in a year, obviously you need to avoid any means to get detention. Your lengthy explanation didn\u2019t upset Josh even a bit though, but Cassie won\u2019t hold her urge to debate your mom\u2019s decency mindset after all this. <br>\r\nWhile stumbling upon anyone in need and rejecting them felt a bit harsh on you, it was replied unwantedly when you entered the parking area. You heard a bicker from a group of bulked students between yours and your motorcycle\u2019s lane. Shit!<br>\r\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s the guy we're looking for.\u201d Jack called you out of his group, the others then also turned to see you. Your feet quickly started jumping away back and through the downhill garden where the school\u2019s logo remained seated. <br>\r\nShit, shit, shit, that really had to happen?! You thought, its still the mid-semester with no football sparring between school games played and lost yet. What sort of excusable reason did they have against you now?<br>\r\nBack to the struggling run. You\u2019ve passed around 10 blocks and your hip is getting soar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t run forever Alex!\u201d Jack\u2019s scream blared along the tight alley. You don\u2019t want to believe that but his tiny brain finally had some sense with something.<br>\r\nThe only option now is to quickly pull out your phone from the shaking pocket and call Josh. <br>\r\n\u201cHuh-huh-huh\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat hap-, don\u2019t tell me its\u2026 ?\u201d This is Josh, your long-time best friend <br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 \u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSo you could?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cShoot, apparently, not\u2026\u201d Josh mumbled\u2026 wait, not now<br>\r\n\u201cHold on Alex, we\u2019re starting a parley with Angela\u2026\u201d That low-pitched feminine voice meant its Cassie<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Principal Angela, then we\u2019ll pick you up!\u201d <br>\r\n<i>Welp, guess things worked on their end. </i><br>\r\nThat\u2019s Cassie, best friend since middle school. Today she and Josh managed to gather some students for a strike. Principal Angela published a new rule, which bans the use of Gothic makeup because it opposes the school happy spirit campaign. It's been a trend at your school lately, and to be honest you wanted to try since it felt consistent with your pessimistic mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve been running for more than 10 blocks now. Can't really count but you feel that its more than that since there's none of that weird 'Merle' at the end of the alleys you're passing through. <br>\r\nAt this rate, Jack will become more smarter and start branching off his buddy group and blocking your next turns.<br>\r\n\u201cLeft? Right? Left\u201d <br>\r\nYou went with your instinct and chose left, where there\u2019s a stair going downwards. A good moment to speed up along the inconspicuous dark pitched black wall surrounding you. <br>\r\n\u201cHuh, never been here before\u2026\u201d The stairs further went downwards, where your hand desperately tried to reach the sewer tunnel behind the gaped bars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I could just slip in</i> Halfway through... Shaky, sweaty and breathing fast, just one slip through the particular bar gap and you're safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't\" A quick pull just sent you back fully to the danger end of the bar. Your body then had its back pushed against the coarse metal with a huge palm locking you in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlonde mohawk haircut with a sharp gray eyed gaze and taunting smile from a rugged, cream-toned, squared faced guy.<br>\r\nIn other words, thats Jack. Behind him there's several of the football kids lined up covering your exit. <br>\r\nHis huge arm is slowly raising, forming a knuckle sandwich after some finger stretch and snaps. <br>\r\n\"Well you win, again Jack, with his buddies' help, get on with it.\"  <br>\r\n\"Oh that's your last quips?... Let me add something to that.\" <br>\r\nA nudge on your head should dodge one, right... <i>Dinggggg</i> A rough skin slightly crash your ear then the metal trembles from the collision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see Jack's eyes wowed open and mouth owwed at his missed punch and reacting to his bloody fist. <br>\r\n\"Lock that little neck man!\" Said one of the lined seniors. <br>\r\nWhich he drag that heavy push from your chest and put it on to your slender neck, wrapping it tight. <br>\r\nThe air to your throat and the swallowing saliva become an effort now. His gloating face become serious with that grit of the teeth and the sinister stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, sweet dreams.\" The knuckle sandwich takes off from its folded stance and rockets toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and nudge your head down, hoping it to not collide your pointy nose. <br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nThen nothing... your pitch black view still feel the same. <br>\r\nYou're waiting for the knock back on your head, but it still don't come. <br>\r\n\"Uh Jack?\" Your neck was still wrapped, but there's no choke to it. Wondering of what Jack had in his tiny brain this time, you're curious to see. What you saw was rather surprising as his fist was still back near his ears. <br>\r\nYou then study his stern face, which rather he's like sort of trapped on that expression and the gnawing open mouth. <br>\r\nNot to mention the lined jocks, no yell-yells or words. Just stiff as a statue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome?!\" an old voice echoed from the tunnels, which let a scream out of your mouth. <br>\r\n\"And that means no one heard of me yet, until you.\" <br>\r\n\"What-re you...\" <br>\r\n\"Just something that you couldn't comprehend and understand.\" <br>\r\nWhat he said really intrigued you. Speaking like he's the higher being from those Doctor What Star Trek movies, but when you reach your best view to the back all you see is nothing but dark pitch tunnel with sewer water beneath. <br>\r\n\"And with that here's my intention of revealing myself... entertainment.\" <br>\r\n\"Entertainment?!... Wha-what's your...\" What you saw behind you was just walls with the effort of twisting your head back. The possibility of prank still jumped onto your mind, possibly a dream after being knocked out that quick and hard by a big guy like Jack. <br>\r\n<b>\"Anyway you seem like an interesting guy, you know, little guys, many problems, and many wants with that too...\" <br>\r\n</b>\"So I'm going to warp this 'amulet' to your neck and grant you one wish...\" The bottom down your nose glows and with that there's really an amulet, hard metal and twisting hi-definition red smoke confirmed that its authentic. <br>\r\n\"You could wish for powers to since that amulet is yours now so...\" <i>Cool, but only one wish or powers?! Come on...</i><br>\r\n<b>\"Iwishforomnipotence!\" You have to test that<br>\r\n\"BLASHPEMY!... No! Even I had a weakness.\"</b> Brick hard voice shouts through the tunnels<br>\r\n<i>Shit Shit Shit </i> You get the feeling that your neck is being squashed again, turning to the front and saw Jack's knuckle-sandwich slowly travel towards your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of weakness...\" The voice remarks<br>\r\n\"...Use that interesting mind of yours to come up with one, inexplicable wish for you to claim permanently.\" Then further encourage you to 'wish' for something, but only permit the one thing that you really want. <br>\r\nWell you had plenty of wants from sorts of fiction and non-fiction references so....<br>\r\n<b>\"Uh-Uh-Wish for three more wi...\"<br>\r\n\"No! Don't you dare attempt to be my equal... As soon as that fist crash onto your pointy nose, your chance is gone.\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, now its back to being tense. Your educated brain don't really help in calming down, instead giving you more streams of crazy ideas. <br>\r\nThat huge fist is not ever going further, it feels faster than the exam's time period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... What's your wish?\" The voice asks again</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You did have several moments of brilliance, but it's not enough to raise above average. <br>\r\nYou like to act cool off from others's business, but with your slim and small figure the seniors seemed to favor the jokes right on you. <br>\r\nWhereas in life, you just want to be yourself; go with the flow and think hard when you're under a pinch, like now for instance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Today's your 16th birthday by the way, will things finally lighten up???<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Characters you frequently met: <br>\r\n</font></span><br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">The Flanders<br>\r\n</font><b>You (Alex Flanders)</b> - 16 years old first-year high school student, short, thin, auburn thin hair, blue eyes.
