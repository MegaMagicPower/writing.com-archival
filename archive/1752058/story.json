You opened your eyes and smiled up at the dark blue furred face of Princess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t wanna,\u201d you complained as you pulled the covers over your head to block out the offensive sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna frowned a moment. \u201cDost thou dare to refuse an order of the Princess of the Night!?\u201d She spoke in the royal Canterlot voice, practically blowing you out of your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your ears stopped ringing, you looked up to get your bearings. Standing across from you was the lovely, 8 foot alicorn Princess Luna. She was in her usual royal gown which gave generous focus to her ample bosom. She smirked down at you as you pulled yourself up. \"Do you have to do that every time?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only whenst thou refuses to awaken on command.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're worse than any alarm clock I've ever owned.\" You complain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall take that as a compliment. Now get dressed. Today promises to be most eventful,\" Luna commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once, my princess,\" you say half-heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a month since you had mysteriously appeared in Luna's chambers. After the understandable initial awkwardness, the two of you began to talk and she was quite taken with you. Now you lived at the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the royal bed chambers of princess Luna. The carpet, drapes, and even furniture were all various shades of purple to match the owner\u2019s preferences. Aside from the usual furniture and trinkets one would expect a princess to own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia had offered warning about how it would look to allow a strange boy to sleep in the same room as a princess. However, Luna dismissed these concerns on the grounds that she had declared you were her...</span></div></div>",

The boss was absolutely amazing and always attended to your needs. The hours were a bit random since \u2018the mood\u2019 could strike Luna at any moment and you were expected to be on constant standby, but the pay wasn\u2019t anything to scoff at either. The only thing you couldn\u2019t really comment on were your coworkers, since you didn\u2019t really have any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only been a few months since Princess Luna had been freed from Nightmare Moon. In that time, Celestia had been working close with her sister to restore her house to proper order. The first matter of importance was Luna\u2019s house guard, which filled out quite quickly thanks to a few brave volunteers. From there, various castle servants were reassigned to Luna\u2019s wing of the castle as her personal staff. She had everything from maids, to private chefs, and even a cute unicorn mare for a secretary named Attentive Eye. Luna even got to pick out all their uniforms so everyone would be able to distinguish between them and Celestia\u2019s staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t until you came along; neither sister realized that they had both overlooked one of the princess\u2019 most important needs. It was a failure you were made most aware of every day as the princess used your body to quench a lust that hadn\u2019t been properly sated in a thousand years, though thankfully she was beginning to slow down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you now held the honorable position of Senior Concubine in Princess Luna\u2019s royal harem. Your uniform, which oddly you were required to wear at all hours except when actually working, was a cloth cod piece emblazoned with Luna\u2019s cutie mark on the front. According to Sun Dancer, Celestia\u2019s Senior Concubine, the uniform was meant to show the world that everything within it was the property of the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your peer, you often went to Sun Dancer for advice. An older Pegasus mare, she\u2019d been in service to Princess Celestia for over fifty years, yet amazingly her body looked like it was just pushing thirty. Apparently life as a royal concubine had other benefits in the long term. You hadn't gotten to know the rest of Celestia's concubines, but they were still polite. There were eighteen mares, seven stallions, a male and female diamond dog, a male minotaur, a female gryphon, and a few more members you\u2019d never actually seen but were assured existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough reminiscing. What does Luna want?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With much effort, Thomas eventually managed to pull himself out of bed, though his nudity did make him hesitate before fully removing the covers. It wasn\u2019t like Luna hadn\u2019t been exploring his body thoroughly for a few weeks now, and the maids weren\u2019t seeing anything new, but the young human man still couldn\u2019t help but feel embarrassed about exposing himself. It didn\u2019t help that, as far as his new sleep schedule was concerned, this was technically morning, meaning he was standing at full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDose something trouble thee, my little human?\u201d Luna asked as she loomed overhead and cast a shadow over her servant. Somehow in the time it took to walk around her royal bed, the Princess had managed to completely straighten her mane so that she no longer looked like Medusa. Her standing at full height gave Thomas a full view of her exceptional hour glass figure that looked like it was sculpted by the gods themselves. She had curves in all the right places, though not so much as her elder sister who had a fondness for sweets that went straight to her plot, as the ponies say. Her tail waved majestically behind her, just above her own wonderful plot. Luna\u2019s body was much more athletic than her sisters, made obvious by her well-toned abs. She grinned playfully when she saw the source of the dilemma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Thomas could say a word, Luna bent over to close the distance between them and pressed her lips against his. The human returned his Princess\u2019 affection, tasting the lemony flavor of her lips. Thomas asked why Luna\u2019s lips tasted like his favorite flavor, but she dismissed the question. The kiss ended almost as quickly as it began, leaving the human to let out a short complaining whine as his lover fluttered her eyelids teasingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you want them to watch?\u201d Thomas asked as he turned his attention to the three maids by the window, still standing and awaiting orders, but giggling like school fillies as they stared. The three mares were Midnight Chain the dark blue unicorn, Starry Sky the light blue pegasus, and Lunar Stone the dark purple earth pony. They were Princess Luna\u2019s personal attendants and had been in her service since the beginning. Like him, they were among those lucky enough to be considered Luna\u2019s friends, though they tended to be much more professional about it. He\u2019d asked them if they thought it curious that all their names had something to do with the night and they ended up in service to a Princess who\u2019d been banished since before they were born, but they brushed it off as an amusing coincidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was moments like these that left Thomas wondering if he had an exceptional level of perception compared to other ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Luna asked mischievously. \u201cArst thou embarrassed?\u201d Luna knew that Thomas was easily embarrassed, especially regarding things like nudity or letting other ponies in on what he and Luna did. Let it never be said that Luna is not a generous lover, but she also has her sadistic side. One of her favorite pass times would be to put her little human in compromising situations and watch him squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little,\u201d Thomas confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPay them no mind, my little human. This is strictly between thee and we.\u201d Luna\u2019s sensual voice erased the outside world and left her as the only thing for Thomas to focus on. He didn\u2019t even notice that Luna had waved the mares away so they could have a bit of privacy. The moon Princess was bent at a near perfect 90 degree angle with her bare plot exposed for the entire world to see. As a Princess, Luna usually wore a fair amount of clothing, making this a rare sight to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna lowered herself to her knees while placing her soft hands upon his legs and parted them gently. Thomas stared in silent awe as the large mare leaned in close and began nuzzling his manhood affectionately, teasing it with the occasional lick. Thomas glanced over at yesterday\u2019s uniform on the night stand and remembered what the moon on the front symbolized. His junk, and by extension the rest of his body, was the property of Princess Luna. The thought of being property, even if only figuratively, always left him feeling a little uneasy, but the loving attention Luna was currently paying her property melted all discomfort away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna arched her back and instinctively bobbed her bottom up in the air as she continued to tease her boy toy. She assaulted Thomas\u2019 member with wave after wave of teasing kisses, forcing him to let out a grunt in frustration. Her left hand moved up to gently massage his testicles while her right hand disappeared somewhere between her own legs. Finally she pulled back. Her mouth hung open longingly as she glanced up at her concubine. His expression pleaded for her not to stop. She smiled at the power she held over her servant, and not just because she was his boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, Celestia would confess to Thomas that it was actually her idea to make him Luna\u2019s first concubine in a thousand years. Luna had been so timid in those early days that she had completely forgotten that she had been one of the most desired mares in all of Equestria, perhaps even more so than her sister. And as expected, her time with Thomas had reminded her of who she was and done wonders for her self-esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the moon Princess lowered her mouth onto the main event. Thomas let out a gasp of surprise and joy as he felt his shaft enter the familiar confines of Luna\u2019s maw. Her tongue danced expertly across his shaft each time it entered its domain. It took all his strength not to put his hands on her head and just let the expert do her work. The moon Princess\u2019 practice was paying off as she made her little human moan. He looked down to see she was still smirking between bobs. The vibrations of her mouth as she moaned only intensified the bolts of pleasure running through Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarmth spread through Thomas\u2019 whole body as he began to feel a pressure build in his loins. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m gonna\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the warning Luna needed as she began to double and then triple her pace, furiously attacking her concubine\u2019s cock with her tongue and lips. There was a hungry look in her eyes as she pumped him for all he was worth while not forgetting to attend her own burning loins. This thing in her mouth belonged to her and she was going to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAghhh!\u201d Thomas exclaimed as he thrust forward while arching his back in the bed and came in the Princess\u2019 mouth. Though his vision was blurred and mind still hazy from delight, he heard Luna give an audible gulp followed by a satisfied sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to speak ill of tea,\u201d Luna began, \u201cbut thine seed is a most excellent wakeup treat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways happy to be\u2026 of service,\u201d Thomas said between breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Luna said skeptically as she poked gently at her lover\u2019s glistening yet flaccid penis. \u201cA pity,\u201d she frowned in disappointment. \u201cIt appears that while ye might be happy, thine little soldier is unable to meet his Princess\u2019 call to action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas looked down in horror to see that he was in fact limp as a piece of wet spaghetti. \u201cIn my defense,\u201d Thomas insisted after such a jab to his pride, \u201cyou worked the little guy half to death yesterday.\u201d The concubine pointed to the mattress behind him, particularly the stains of sweat and other fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna stood to her full height and followed Thomas\u2019 finger. \u201cSo it is,\u201d she smiled in satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s not that little,\u201d Thomas added defensively. \u201cBut if you\u2019d like, maybe we could have a bath together, I could wash your fur, and we\u2019d just see what happens,\u201d he finished leadingly. \u201cI mean, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be anything kinky. I could just wash your back like in the old days, maybe give you a little massage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Luna respond?</span></div></div>",

Why anypony wore pajamas or sleepwear of any sort in a clothing-optional society was a mystery the human had yet to crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince nopony came to help him, Thomas casually walked over to the dresser with his spare uniforms. He caught the maids sneaking glances at his manhood, but the afterglow from Luna\u2019s wake up ritual had left him unable to care. \u201cSo what exactly counts as eventful for the night court?\u201d Thomas asked as he slipped on what was little more than a banana hammock. \u201cI know you don\u2019t get this excited for regular meetings with the nobles and I\u2019m pretty sure there aren\u2019t any dignitaries or parties any time soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dost thou know of our schedule?\u201d Luna inquired as stepped into her personal bathroom. She motioned for the maids to follow her inside, though they left the door open. Thomas walked across the room and leaned leisurely in the door way and watched as his Princess stepped into the tub and begin her shower. The maids quickly stripped off their frilly maid uniforms to reveal bathing suits beneath, another mystery, and followed her in; because obviously a Princess wasn\u2019t expected to bathe herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas didn\u2019t answer right away; instead taking the time to just stare at the moon Princess as drops of water came crashing down against her beautiful body. Each of the maids in bathing suits grabbed sponges and wash-cloths and began scrubbing the Princess\u2019 body. The concubine smirked as he saw the mares try sneaking glances of Luna\u2019s body while she pretended not to notice. Of course she noticed. She knew she was attractive and attention like this was to be expected. However, while the maids did not shy away from Luna\u2019s more sensitive areas, they maintained their professionalism and avoided giving them any undue sensitive attention. After all, that wasn\u2019t their job, it was his. \u201cAttentive Eye gave me a copy of the schedule. She says I have to report to her every week to get the updated copy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Luna said flatly as the pegasus mare opened the alicorn\u2019s left wing and began gently dabbing the feathers with a sponge. \u201cAnd why did our secretary see fit to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember that incident a couple weeks ago with the emissaries from Prance,\u201d Thomas said as more of a statement than a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe recall,\u201d the moon Princess averted her gaze in embarrassment. Of course she remembered. There was no way anypony would forget that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I heard about that,\u201d Midnight Chain spoke up. \u201cWasn\u2019t that where the two of you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem.\u201d A subtle cough from Luna quickly silenced the unicorn mare. \u201cPray tell, dearest Midnight, where didst thou hear of such things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn shifted her eyes suspiciously. \u201cJust\u2026 around. You know how rumors get,\u201d she offered assuredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was this about the Prench emissaries?\u201d Starry Skies inquired. \u201cI never heard any rumors. Was it something juicy? Oh, nopony ever tells me any-ow.\u201d The pegasus flinched as Midnight chain gave her ears a firm smack. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight Chain tilted her head up to indicate Luna\u2019s disapproval while Starry Skies\u2019 eyes widened in realization. The Princess in question merely rolled her eyes in annoyance, Lunar Stone giggled at the silliness of it all, and Thomas just shook his head in amusement of the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think they want to know,\u201d Thomas suggested teasingly. This was revenge for all the times Luna embarrassed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna took a breath to compose herself before speaking in a calm and regal manner. \u201cAs Midnight Chain has alluded, rumors can be wild and uncontrollable. It would be a futile effort to try and quell them and tis likely that even the truth won\u2019t be believed. As such, we neither confirm nor deny any such rumors thou might have heard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was totally sitting on him the whole time,\u201d Lunar Stone whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway!\u201d Luna barked to try and get matters back on track. \u201cThomas, thou hast been working most diligently for fifteen days straight,\u201d the Princess recounted. \u201cThe event of which we speak is that thou hast earned a day off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Thomas respond?</span></div></div>",

So we have passed a decree that our concubines are to have two days off every week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you really need to pass a decree for that?\u201d Thomas cringed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDearest, Thomas,\u201d Luna tilted her head curiously. \u201cArst thou embarrassed of thine royal duties to serve thine Princess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Of course not,\u201d Thomas insisted. \u201cIt just seems a little unnecessary to go through the trouble of making a decree over what I\u2019m pretty sure can be solved in a scheduling memo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smirked as she stepped out of the tub with the maids in swimwear following close behind. \u201cThine words are taken directly for the lips Lady Attentive.\u201d She said coyly as she walked passed her little human to the middle of the room where the maids began dressing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019d you do?\u201d Thomas asked as he watched the maids formed something akin to a supply line between Luna and the closet with her royal gowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe stood gallantly in our office, our hand extended in awe inspiring glory,\u201d Luna held out her hand for emphasis,\u201d and we made the decree anyway because that sort of thing is fun.\u201d The moon Princess spoke with such proud authority that she nearly slipped into the royal Canterlot voice, much to the amusement of her current audience. \u201cAnd then Lady Attentive wrote a memo and had her assistants amend it to the schedule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas smiled up at his princess. \u201cI love the way you can take something as dull as a schedule change and make it sound so grand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiled back at Thomas and affectionately cupped his cheek in her hand. \u201cAnd we love the way you love our endeavors to ameliorate dull tasks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA friendly laugh was shared all around. Luna tended to be rather quiet around strangers that it felt heartwarming to see her open up. This was especially true between her and Thomas as they had engaged in much pillow talk after his \u2018work sessions\u2019. If the Princess hadn\u2019t been reminded of the fact that she\u2019d been sex starved for a millennium, she might have adopted him as her nephew or something. But never mind that awkward line of thinking. Life was good as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut tell us, dearest Thomas,\u201d Luna continued. \u201cThou hast said that thee has received a schedule from Lady Attentive already, so how didst thou not know about thine day off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas puzzled at this question. \u201cIt was actually one of her assistants who gave me the schedule. I think it was that earth mare, Silver Specs. The schedule she gave me was actually yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna raised an eyebrow at this. \u201cAnd thou did not find this suspicious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas shrugged. \u201cI figured that since you pretty much have me follow you around all day anyway, that giving me a separate schedule wasn\u2019t worth the paper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna scowled at this. \u201cWe suspect Lady Attentive will have words for this Silver Specs for such a grievous misstep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt most certainly was,\u201d Midnight Chain asserted. \u201cIt is basic procedure that all members of the castle staff are to only receive their own schedules, but none are more important than the Princesses\u2019. What if Luna\u2019s daily routine were to fall in the wrong hands, like the paparazzi, an assassin, or worst yet, a fan-mare?\u201d The three mare maids shivered in terror at such a frightening thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d Thomas nodded understandingly. He understood that this was one of those things where he\u2019d best just smile and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more,\u201d Luna added. \u201cIt doth seem strange that Attentive\u2019s words would find themselves so precisely upon thine lips. Could it be that thine lips have wandered to the visage of our faithful secretary?\u201d she asked suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Thomas a moment to piece together what she had said. \u201cNope,\u201d he shook his head firmly, denying the accusation of kissing somepony other than the Princess. \u201cNo wandering lips here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna\u2019s ears drooped a bit. \u201cWe see,\u201d she said disappointedly. \u201cPity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that a pity?\u201d Thomas asked. \u201cI mean, shouldn\u2019t it be expected that I only be loyal to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d Luna said with a level of offense nopony was expecting. \u201cThou are not our slave. Thou art our faithful servant and a citizen of Equestria. The guards are our loyal protectors and would give their lives in our defense, but they are allowed friends and family with whom they also share loyalties.\u201d Their work completed, the maids stepped away from the Princess who was now wearing a regal black and violet gown with transparent starry trim. The whole thing was very form fitting and did wonderfully to accentuate her curves. She was also wearing her crown, the necklace engraved with her cutie mark, and a pair of golden earrings. Luna then walked over to Thomas and put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cTis unhealthy to devote thineself to the attentions of a single pony. On that, you can trust us, Thomas. Dost thou understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Thomas nodded, realizing that the way she spoke his name meant she was being serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiled as she looked down at him. \u201cWonderful. So, on thine day off, thou art expected to go forth and have a life outside of work. Perhaps even ask if Lady Attentive might be interested in dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be up for it,\u201d Lunar Stone offered. \u201cI hear her barn door don\u2019t swing that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d Luna nodded. \u201cShe is, as you ponies say today, a filly fooler?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar Stone nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPonies, these days,\u201d Luna rolled her eyes. \u201cIn any case, it is as thou said earlier, my little human. Thou art to begin thine first day of life in Canterlot away from our side. We wish thee the best of luck,\u201d she nodded and left the room with her maids in tow, each giving a friendly goodbye smile while Lunar Stone gave a wink. Before the door closed, there were rapid hoof steps as Luna poked her head back in the room. \u201cAnd try not to do anything too extraneous. We want ye fully recharged when thou returns to our service.\u201d And with that, the door closed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Uncertain of exactly what to do, Thomas stood alone in Princess Luna\u2019s chamber for a few minutes. The only routine he\u2019d had for the last month had been following Luna around like a lost puppy, always on standby for whatever she wanted whenever she wanted, which was pretty much every free moment she had between meetings. Otherwise he\u2019d just sit off in the corner and read until he was needed. For the moment, he took the time to examine his current surroundings. The carpet, drapes, and even furniture were all various shades of purple to match the owner\u2019s preferences. Aside from the usual furniture and trinkets one would expect a Princess to own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, simply looking at Luna\u2019s possessions reminded Thomas that he had no possessions of his own outside of his spare uniforms. And if he did, he didn\u2019t have his own room to store them. He didn\u2019t even have his own bed. At Luna\u2019s command, he\u2019d always shared hers. Even before his formal job assignment, he\u2019d acted as her personal teddy bear and just snuggle her in the night. The more the thought about it, he actually hadn\u2019t been anywhere or done anything without being escorted by Luna or some other pony. Simply being alone in this exceptionally large room left him feeling quite small and naked; and considering what he usually wore and who he usually wore it around, that was saying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Thomas said quietly to himself. \u201cLuna\u2019s right. I can\u2019t live my whole life as some co-dependent little child. I need to go out there and live for myself,\u201d he said as he stared at the large doors in front of him. \u201cJust step out these doors and\u2026 do\u2026 something.\u201d A growl from his stomach set the little human on his first task of the day. After another minute of demanding the door open under the power of his gaze alone, Thomas gave up and just pushed the thing open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after living here for so long, the grand halls of the castle never failed to impress. Thomas always felt so small, even with all the amazonian ponies looming over him. This wing was dedicated to Luna, so the walls were decorated with tapestries depicting her cutie mark and even the guards wore the Princess\u2019 colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas nodded respectfully at the guards standing outside Luna\u2019s room and they returned the gesture. He  still felt awkward around the guards, so stoic and intimidating. They were shorter than the Princess, but that still left them towering over him. Matters weren\u2019t helped by the fact that they all probably weighed at least twice as much as he did from sheer muscle mass alone. On the plus side, they were some of the only ponies who saw fit to cover their private parts, which made sense on account of they had to wear armor to protect themselves. Though their armor did leave their cutie marks exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquestria was a clothing optional society with most ponies, and other creatures, preferring to go around naked. The nobility who frequented the castle often wore some fabrics. However, while the mares tended to wear full body dresses, the stallions typically only wore vests, meaning Thomas got to see a lot of pony junk flopping around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough about that. Thomas was hungry and it was way past time for some breakfast so he headed down to the dining hall. As he did, he couldn\u2019t help but notice the clopping of hoof steps behind him. He stopped, and so did they. Turning around, he jumped at the sight of one of Luna\u2019s guards standing a mere three steps behind him. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare nodded. \u201cI am Private First Class Midnight Shield. I have been assigned as your body guard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas stared at her curiously. \u201cSince when do I need a body guard? I mean, I\u2019m just a concubine,\u201d he tried to say without sounding embarrassed. It was one thing when Luna called him as such, but the title still made him feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are Senior Concubine to Princess Luna,\u201d Midnight Shield responded. \u201cYour station has always been assigned a personal guard because of your value to the Princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas studied the guard carefully. Midnight Shield was a unicorn mare with dark orange fur, a few inches taller than him, blue eyes, lean muscle, and a silver shield with the moon at its center on her exposed hip. She spoke his title with a fair amount of respect and reverence, not unlike how one might refer to a pop star they liked. As Thomas\u2019 gaze crawled along her body he eventually noticeed that she has repeatedly averted her gaze from him, specifically from looking down below his navel at his loincloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t I ever seen you before?\u201d He ask suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonlight Shield hesitated for a moment. \u201cI\u2026 I can assure you I have not been in dereliction of duty,\u201d she insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s just that every time before now when you\u2019ve left Princess Luna\u2019s room, it has always been in the company of the Princess. And just as her personal guards follow her around, I have followed you. You probably never noticed me among the other guards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes sense, I guess,\u201d Thomas conceded, only for his stomach to remind him what he was doing earlier. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to follow me to breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is where you\u2019re heading, then yes I am,\u201d she nodded a bit more confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Thomas nodded. \u201cI was just heading to the dining hall for some breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Moonlight recommend?</span></div></div>",

We\u2019re going to chow hall anyway, so you might as well have something too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonlight looked like she wanted to argue, but another protest from her stomach made her see there was no point in resisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked on for a couple minutes before Thomas grew bored of the silence. \u201cWhy are you walking behind me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA guard\u2019s place is one step to the left and three steps back,\u201d Moonlight explained. \u201cThis position is ideal for guarding our VIPs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas rolled his eyes. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not comfortable with all this procedure in stuff. So do you think you could walk beside me so we can talk like normal people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you meant to say \u2018ponies\u2019, there, sir,\u201d she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas fumed at the guard for catching his slip. \u201cJust walk beside me, will ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonlight nodded and quickly stepped up to his side. \u201cSo, what did you want to talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor one thing,\u201d Thomas began. \u201cWhy do you say ponies instead of people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Moonlight shrugged. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because we\u2019re all ponies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not,\u201d Thomas insisted. \u201cI haven\u2019t been here that long, but I\u2019ve seen donkeys, mules, zebras, griffons, and there was that little dragon a week ago.\u201d Thomas said referring to Spike\u2019s recent visit. He knew the little dragon by name, but had refrained from divulging that information. Upon learning that he had knowledge of a world similar to theirs, Celestia had ordered him to keep such information a secret to all but the Princesses. In fact, Thomas was certain that this knowledge was the real reason he was assigned his own guard since he\u2019d never noticed one with Sun Dancer. \u201cAnyway, there are a bunch of non-ponies around here, but they all say stuff like \u2018everypony\u2019 even when referring to themselves. What\u2019s the deal with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say sir,\u201d Moonlight conceded. \u201cI never studied the history of language. I\u2019m just here to guard your body,\u201d she said with a half-smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what an interesting body you have to guard,\" says... who?</span></div></div>",

He turned around to see a white unicorn stallion wearing nothing but a bowtie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrince Blueblood,\u201d Thomas forced a smile and bowed his head cordially. Moonlight mirrored the gesture. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to see you at this time of night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well\u2026\u201d Blueblood began while starring at his finger nails. \u201cI had just gotten back from one of my many, many dates,\u201d he said braggingly. \u201cWhen who should I run into but Luna\u2019s pet monkey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas did his best not to flinch at that word. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your highness, but I\u2019m a human, not a monkey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPotato, potato,\u201d Blueblood spoke the second word differently. \u201cYou\u2019re still my auntie\u2019s cute little butt slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas stomach turned. He couldn\u2019t figure out if he was more insulted at Blueblood calling him a butt slave, or cute. The latter certainly left him queasier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Thomas is Princess Luna\u2019s Senior Concubine,\u201d Moonlight Shield stepped forward defensively, much to the human\u2019s gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed he is,\u201d Blueblood trailed off. \u201cWhich I can\u2019t help but find quite odd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst his better judgement, Thomas asked \u201cWhat\u2019s so odd about that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides the fact that you\u2019re a tiny hairless ape,\u201d Blueblood continued, it is most puzzling that Luna is allowed a concubine while Auntie Celestia has formally disbanded my own harem. So unfair,\u201d he whined. \u201cLuna hasn\u2019t even been here a month and yet she\u2019s allowed privileges that have been denied me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumor had it that Blueblood\u2019s old harem had made so many complaints to the pony rights department that Celestia decided that he needed to learn proper respect before he could be allowed a harem. The Prince, to the surprise of nopony, instead started dating a series of mares from Canterlot and learned absolutely nothing. Regardless, there seemed no point in pointing out why Luna should have more privileges than the stuck up snob of a Prince. It\u2019d likely go in one ear and come out the other anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas cringed as he felt the Prince\u2019s eyes crawl over his body, while he did his best not to look at the admittedly large stallionhood dangling between his legs. \u201cIs there something I can do for you, my Prince?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Blueblood pondered before smiling as an idea came to him. \u201cYou can meet me in my chambers in, let\u2019s say, half an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon?\u201d Thomas said, taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d the Prince groaned. \u201cMust I truly repeat myself? I said that you are to meet me in my chambers in half an hour. You are quite the exotic specimen and I am curious what Auntie Luna sees in you,\u201d he said as he began walking off. \u201cRemember, half an hour. Do not be late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Prince finally disappeared from sight, Thomas remained flabbergasted. \u201cDid that just happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you mean the Prince soliciting you for sex, then it would seem so,\u201d Moonlight Shield said in an equally stunned voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan he even do that? I mean,\u201d Thomas indicated his loincloth, \u201cdon\u2019t I sorta belong to Princess Luna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically it is your day off,\u201d Moonlight shrugged uncomfortably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you seriously suggesting I go get plowed by that\u2026\u201d Thomas stopped himself at seeing some nearby maids and butlers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStuck up snot of a Prince with a silver spoon shoved so far up his flank that he couldn\u2019t possibly relate to anypony ever?\u201d Moonlight suggested, eliciting snickers from the nearby staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas stood stunned for a moment. \u201cDid you just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone in the castle knows who Blueblood is,\u201d she answered plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas smiled approvingly. \u201cWell that\u2019s nice and all, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the Prince just asked me to his chambers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Moonlight pondered. \u201cYou are Luna\u2019s concubine, so I\u2019m pretty sure you need to ask her permission for this sort of thing. But on the other hoof, he is a Prince and that did sound like an order. If you don\u2019t show up, he\u2019ll definitely be angry with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Thomas nodded. \u201cBut what exactly can he do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re part of Princess Luna\u2019s staff, so probably nothing directly,\u201d Moonlight explained. \u201cThough I have heard stories of the rather eccentric steps he\u2019s taken to get back at ponies who\u2019ve snubbed him. I guess it\u2019s up to you. Besides, you don\u2019t necessarily know if he wants you for sex. He could just want to talk.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Prince or not, there\u2019s no way in Tartarus that I\u2019d ever sleep with that prick.\u201d Though angry, Thomas couldn\u2019t help congratulating himself on how well he\u2019d adjusted to Equestrian dialect. \u201cCan we please talk about something else?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s been a while since I picked up a copy of the Equestria Daily. Anything happen in recent news?\u201d<br>\r\nMoonlight thought a moment. \u201cI heard this little town called Ponyville was nearly destroyed by an infestation of parasprites. That was a thing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally,\u201d Thomas said in fake surprise while a smile touched his lips. <br>\r\n\u201cIs something funny?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really.\u201d The truth was that this was one of the incidents he\u2019d warned Celestia and Luna about. But based on his description, she seemed satisfied that the Element of Laughter would handle the situation and felt that her student needed to learn the lesson, though she had secretly sent in agents around the town\u2019s outskirts just in case things got too out of control. \u201cSo what all happened?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere are these little bugs called parasprites that inhabit the Everfree Forest. All they do is eat and spit up copies of themselves. Normally the local predators keep their numbers in check, but one wandered into town and things got out of control really quickly. It seems Princess Celestia\u2019s student tried a spell to stop them from eating all the food, because naturally the disaster would have to happen on the very day the Princess was due to visit the town, but the little buggers started literally eating the town instead. All seemed lost until the Element of Laughter slapped some instruments together and led them back to the Everfree in a parade. Oh, and it looks like we\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\nThomas pushed open the doors to chow hall. Row after row of tables were lined up across the cafeteria with a line to the immediate right to the entrance. With his guard close behind, Thomas took his place in the short line and looked over what the chefs had to offer. A wide assortment of fruits and vegies was nice, but he needed some protein. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have any\u2026 meat, would you?\u201d To Thomas\u2019 relief, the chef didn\u2019t grimace at the question and pointed further up the line. There he found the relatively tiny section devoted to the meat eaters of the castle staff. Thomas grabbed himself some sausage, eggs, and a few orange slices. Moonlight Shield got some hay bacon, a couple apples, and a bowl of oats.<br>\r\nThe pair then set out to find some seats. The hall was relatively empty due to the fact that Luna\u2019s night court was still being built and thus so much smaller than Celestia\u2019s day court. Even though virtually everyone present was in Luna\u2019s colors, be they guard, maid, or butler, Thomas still didn\u2019t feel comfortable sitting with strangers. However, Thomas did catch a few ponies staring him, or rather his uniform. The stallions nodded in what was most likely a congratulatory \u201clucky bastard\u201d sort of way, while the mares ate him up with their gaze, obviously curious what made him so appealing to the Princess. Thomas quickly reassured himself that what he did wasn\u2019t anything to be embarrassed by, but he still quickly motioned towards one of the empty seats in the corner to escape the stares as quickly as possible. Moonlight followed silently. However, just as the pair were about to sit down, Thomas heard a thud and turned to see that Moonlight had been knocked to the floor. Before he could react, a pair of arms wrapped around his small frame and pulled him into a warm feathery embrace.<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, chimp,\u201d a gravely yet feminine voice greeted as Thomas was squeezed tighter in the embrace, his face being buried into a pair of small, furry breasts.<br>\r\n\u201cTalon?\u201d Thomas asked as he struggled to look up. Sure enough, he was greeted by the friendly visage of Talon, Celestia\u2019s griffon consort. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you just call me?\u201d The griffon raised an eyebrow indignantly.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Tali,\u201d Thomas smiled.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better. How\u2019s it hanging, chimp.\u201d Talon let Thomas\u2019 feet touch the ground, but still held him in her claw-like hands as she smiled down at him. The griffon had crimson fur from her torso down, white feathers around her head had somehow pulled back into a pony tail (possibly to be ironic), yellow claws for hands, lion paws for feet instead of hooves, and dark red wings. Her relatively small breasts, which were just at eye level with Thomas, betrayed the fact that she most likely found the night air cold, or that she was happy to see him. Beneath her well-toned six-pack and above her child-bearing hips was a loincloth just like Thomas\u2019, but emblazoned with Celestia\u2019s sun instead of Luna\u2019s moon.<br>\r\n\u201cUnhand him you cur!\u201d Moonlight Shield threatened as she stood in an aggressive stance with clenched fists and lit her horn in preparation for a spell.<br>\r\n\u201cEase up, guard pony,\u201d Talon waved dismissively and pulled Thomas close to her side. \u201cMe and chimp here go way back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other for like eight weeks,\u201d Thomas pointed out.<br>\r\nMoonlight began to relax, but her horn remained lit.<br>\r\n\u201cSo? You\u2019ve only been in Equestria a few months and somehow managed to worm your way into Princess Luna\u2019s bed,\u201d Talon teased. \u201cIt is not the quantity of time we spend together, but the quality. Besides, we carnivores have to stick together.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a carnivore and neither are you. I\u2019ve seen you eat apples,\u201d Thomas explained for what he felt must have been the twentieth time. Then he turned his attention back to his guard. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Moonlight. Tali here\u2019s cool.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCool?\u201d the griffon raised an eyebrow. \u201cWho are you calling cool, pipsqueak? I\u2019m the hottest griffon in all Equestria,\u201d she said as she stepped away from Thomas and struck a heroic pose. \u201cHow do ya think I made it into Celestia\u2019s bed?\u201d<br>\r\nWith that, Moonlight looked down and realized Talon was a member of Celestia\u2019s harem and extinguished her horn, though she kept her eye firmly on the griffon. \u201cForgive my earlier threat. I did not know that the two of you were friends.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Thomas instructed before looking back at the still posing Talon. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have shoved her like that,\u201d he scolded.<br>\r\n\u201cMeh,\u201d Talon shrugged. \u201cNo big. What\u2019s this little pony going to do to me anyway?\u201d She asked as she stepped up to Moonlight, pressing her bare breasts against the guard\u2019s breast plate as she stared down at the shorter pony. <br>\r\n\u201cLittle?\u201d Moonlight snarled as she straightened her back, but it did little to close the gap between their heights. The tension was palpable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey. Hey. Whoa,\u201d Thomas coaxed as he moved himself between the large women, internally scolding himself for deliberately getting into a position where people could knock him out just by falling on him. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to start anything here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d came a complaint from somewhere out in the cafeteria. Most ponies stuck to their own conversations, but a few of the nearby tables were watching events unfold with great curiosity.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just calm down and shake hands as friends?\u201d Thomas suggested hopefully.<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds of glaring, Talon broke out into a giggle. \u201cNot bad, pony,\u201d she complimented. \u201cMost of you guards back down when I stare down at you like that, but you held your own. You\u2019re alright in my book,\u201d she held out her claw. \u201cName\u2019s Talon, concubine in Princess Celestia\u2019s harem and former Sergeant in the Royal Griffon Reserves.\u201d<br>\r\nThe unicorn offered a respectful grin and took the griffon\u2019s claw and gave it a friendly shake. \u201cPrivate First Class, Moonlight Shield. I\u2019m currently assigned as guard to Luna\u2019s Senior Concubine.\u201d<br>\r\nNo matter how often anyone said \u2018concubine\u2019, the word never ceased to sound weird to Thomas. Regardless, he was grateful this hadn\u2019t turned into a catfight, or whatever you\u2019d call a fight between females of different species where one actually was half cat. The three took their seats at the table and began to eat. Thomas had somehow found himself in the middle of the two larger women with the armored mare to his left and the soft yet muscled griffon to his right.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what were you two talking about before I stepped in and improved the scenery?\u201d Talon asked, taking deep slow breaths to draw attention to her breasts.<br>\r\n\u201cThe parasprite invasion in Ponyville,\u201d Thomas answered. <br>\r\n\u201cAh. How did that mess even start to begin with?\u201d Talon inquired. \u201cI mean, the way I hear it, that pink pony was the first to identify the parasprites and then she spent the next few hours gathering instruments for the parade while her friends bumbled around. Shouldn\u2019t they have listened to her from the start and saved themselves a whole mess of trouble?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she wasn\u2019t very direct about it,\u201d Thomas suggested. \u201cI hear she can be a little silly so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut she was their friend,\u201d Talon defended. \u201cPlus she\u2019s one of the freaking Elements of Harmony. Shouldn\u2019t that mean something?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Thomas chose his next words carefully so as not to reveal too much. \u201cFrom what I hear, the Elements bonded to them because of their personalities and she\u2019s the Element of Laughter. Just because they have certain personality types, doesn\u2019t necessarily make them authority figures.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I think Talon\u2019s got a point,\u201d Moonlight added. \u201cThe Elements of Harmony are a magic that predates Equestria. Power like that isn\u2019t given out to just anypony. Those six were deemed worthy by an ancient and arcane magic and then used that magic to vanquish\u2026 er\u2026 free Princess Luna.\u201d It was an unspoken rule among the night court to avoid mentioning Nightmare Moon. \u201cThis is probably an appeal to authority fallacy, but I can\u2019t help but think that that at least means their opinions should be heard.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Talon threw up her hands in exasperation. \u201cYou\u2019re the first pony I\u2019ve talked to who actually agrees with me on this. If the Elements had bonded with griffons, we\u2019d have handled matters a lot differently.\u201d<br>\r\nMoonlight waved her hand encouraging Talon to go on.<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d the griffon continued, \u201cfirst thing we\u2019d do is immediately conscript them into the RGR and give them all training, in self-defense if nothing else. A weapon like that needs to be protected. Second, we\u2019d move them to the capitol where they\u2019d be in a central position that could easily be deployed wherever needed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe first part, maybe, but I\u2019m not so sure on the second part,\u201d Moonlight argued. \u201cThe Elements of Harmony aren\u2019t an ordinary weapon that you use to just blast anything in your path. I\u2019m not sure if I can explain this properly, but a lot of advanced magic has this philosophical and emotional aspect to it. You\u2019d want to keep the Elements\u2019 operators happy and harmonious so that they can still use the Elements. If their personalities change, like if they went through boot camp, then you run the risk of compromising their compatibility with the magic.\u201d<br>\r\nTalon stroked the bottom of her beak ponderously. \u201cWell, what would you do miss smarty-corn?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think we need to reassign a few soldiers from the army to Ponyville. Since that\u2019s where the operators live, the best way to keep the harmony is to let them live where they want with their friends and family. The soldiers would spend most of their time patrolling the town, since I hear it\u2019s sorely lacking any kind of police force anyway. But they\u2019d also spend a few days a week training the Elements\u2019 operators and be on standby to offer their support whenever there was some sort of emergency. That way, even if Thomas is right and the Element of Laughter is a little silly, then at least there would have been some trained professionals nearby who could recognize that she knew what those things were and then help her deal with them.\u201d<br>\r\nThomas smirked at Moonlight\u2019s words. Not only was he happy that she\u2019d begun to open up, but he had made that very suggestion to Celestia. She refused because she thought it would be too much of an intrusion in their lives and the peace of the quaint little town. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About a month ago, you had been stripped from your world and ended up in Equestria of all places, Princess Luna's bed chambers to be specific. After a very awkward and terrifying interrogation, the Princesses decided that you were not a threat. However, when you described how it was you came to be here, they said that they knew of no way to locate your world amongst the infinite multi-verse, and so allowed you to stay at the palace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemarkably, you and Luna hit things off pretty well. It didn't hurt that you had been a fan of the show for some time and were convinced that she was best princess. After some time passed and the two of you grew closer, Luna decided to formally adopt you as her nephew in much the same way Celestia had adopted Cadence and Blue Blood. And so here you were, Prince Thomas of Equestria, being nagged by your new aunt to get your butt out of bed so you could start the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, the princess got her way. You picked out a nice, casual suit for the day and got dressed in the bathroom, right after fighting Luna's attempts to 'help' you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ponies of this world didn't have a nudity taboo, which had lead to many an awkward moment. Thankfully the princesses were usually well dressed since royalty was held to certain standards and the guards were always in full armor. However, most ponies outside the palace were content to walk around the city in little more than a hat, if that. The nobles who frequented the palace usually wore clothes though. While the mares often wore gowns similar to the princesses, the stallions saw nothing wrong with wearing a fancy vest and nothing else. To make matters worse, or better depending on how you look at it, the maids wore frilly French maid uniforms with skirts that only barely covered the pelvic region, meaning that the slightest breezed or tilt of the body would leave their nethers exposed for the world to see. You weren't sure, and were to embarrassed to ask, if ponies didn't have a concept of underwear, or if they just saw no reason to wear it. Worse yet, word had gotten around the castle about your discomfort, meaning that there were more than a few mischievous maids who liked to tease you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Luna,\" you call from the bathroom. \"What exactly is supposed to make today so eventful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You've forgotten already? Today is...\"</span></div></div>",

Now, follow me to the throne room. Tis best we begin early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Early?\" You ask as you match your pace to hers. \"Looks like you lowered the moon only an hour ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two, actually,\" Luna corrected. \"Consider this part of your lesson. The duties of royalty can be taxing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You say that, but the thing that comes immediately to mind is you keeping me up all night to play some new board game...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall have you know,\" Luna cut you off, \"that we were astral projecting into the dreams of ponies, as is our duty, while also crushing you at Maropoly. We were preforming our duties to the kingdom, as well as spending some quality time with our dear nephew. Multitasking is another skill you shall become acquainted with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I guess you got me there,\" you relent. \"But what about Blue Blood? I don't think I've ever seen him do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's expression became sour. \"You would do well not to look at him as a role model... in anything. Not as a prince, not as a stallion, and under no circumstances are you to ever ask him for dating advice.\" She was especially insistent on that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually reminds me of something I've been meaning to ask. Aunt Celestia adopted both Cadence and Blue Blood as her niece and nephew, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" Luna nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get Cadence. She was an alicorn which means she's was destined for big things from an early age. Adopting her and giving her princess training was an obvious move. But what's the deal with Blue Blood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have asked our sister the very same thing. Apparently she was very close to Blue Blood's parents and made him a prince as a favor to them when they died. He was very young when this happened and has known no other life. Unfortunately, Equestia was going through political turbulence with the griffon kingdom, and so she could not be as attentive as she had wished. So on the few occasions she was able to be with him, she gave him whatever he asked for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's how he became a spoiled brat?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less,\" Luna nodded. \"Thankfully, we have learned from the mistakes of our sister and will not be spoiling you.\" Without warning the Princess of the Night suddenly turned around and pulled you into a powerful embrace. \"Except with hugs. Nopony can ever have too many hugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to pull yourself free from your aunt's vice-like grip, trying to ignore the fact that your face was planted firmly between her breasts. However, a stern look from her is all you need to remember Luna's rule. When somepony shows you affection, you'd best return it or face the consequences. So you hugged her back, much to her delight. When she is satisfied and lets you go, who do you meet on the way to the throne room?</span></div></div>",

Mares consist of 80% of the population, while stallions are only 20%. At the rate things are going, monogamous marriages will eventually lead to no males left to reproduce further. In response to this, Celestia and I passed into law that once males come of age, they are required to form a harem of their own. Now it is time for you to make yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Aunt Luna, I'm a human, aren't I... incompatible with Equestrian women?\" Luna lets out a chuckle at your embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not, a few years ago, a mare moved out into the Dragon Lands. She fell in love with a drake during her time there and the two... consummated the relationship. Months later she gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Perhaps you can do the same.\" This was all making sense, but you were nervous about having to take care of an entire harem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how would I go about making this harem anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the easy part. As a prince, you get access to the cream of the crop. Tia and I will send invitations to as many eligible mares' homes as possible. They will come here, and you will choose several among them. The ones you choose will come and love in the palace with you and be treated like royalty, while their families will get compensated greatly from the royal treasury.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the ones that I don't pick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will be sent away and given a small sum for their troubles. So, shall I have Tia send the notices? Or perhaps you already have a few mares on you mind? Keep in mind that myself and Tia are unavailable, and you cannot uproot another's marriage.\"</span></div></div>",

Standing across from your bed were human sized horse women. From the bottom up they had hooves instead of feet, long bare legs, no underwear or clothing of any sort (which made you blush a bit), hands, muzzles instead of noses, rather large eyes, and each was a different color. From left to right they are colored orange with blonde hair and a cowboy hat, pink with pinker hair, white with violet hair, yellow with pink hair, cyan with rainbow hair, and lavender with purple hair and a pink stripe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a fan of the show, you recognize them instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppleJack was the first to speak. \u201cSo this here is the critter that dun appeared out of nowhere.\u201d Her accent was unmistakable as she leaned in closer. You noticed that she had a well-toned body and even a nice six pack, which made sense given she was a farmer. However, that combined with her sudden proximity did nothing to make her look less intimidating. \u201cSure seems an odd sort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Ohohohohohoh!\u201d Pinkie Pie proclaimed giddily as she jumped up and down in excitement. Now on the show, a pouncing little horse was cute. It was a whole other matter with a naked horse woman whose breasts continued to flop around in ways you were pretty certain defied the laws of physics. \u201cIt\u2019s super odd. It\u2019s the oddest odd thing in the history of oddness. Why, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie\u2019s ramblings were cut off when Rarity grabbed her muzzle to silence her. She took a moment to breath, her rather voluptuous breasts rising and falling, encouraging her pink friend to regain her composure. \u201cNow now, darling. It would simply not do to obsess over this creature\u2019s oddness. He might be sensitive about that sort of thing. Um, it is a he, isn\u2019t it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-he\u2019s got a small muzzle,\u201d Fluttershy stuttered as she poked her head out from behind Rarity. She\u2019d been hiding behind her white friend the whole time, but her bent over position accentuated her excessive breasts and buttocks rather nicely. She was easily the most well-endowed of the six. Then she pointed a yellow finger at you. \u201cHe\u2019s probably male, b-based on how his body is reacting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her line of sight until you\u2019re looking down at your body beneath the sheets, specifically at the sudden hill within the sheets. Your cheeks turn bright red as you reach down beneath the covers to try and cover yourself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rarity giggled. \u201cIt seems we have a shy one. Twilight, darling. Are you sure this thing is dangerous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course he\u2019s dangerous!\u201d RainbowDash butted in as she hovered closer, her small breasts hanging low as she held her butt up in the air. \u201cTwi said he just appeared out of nowhere in a flash of light. Nice ponies don\u2019t do that, so he\u2019s obviously not a nice pony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he ain\u2019t even a pony,\u201d AppleJack pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbowDash rolled her eyes and turned to face her orange friend, inadvertently giving you a full view of her rump propped up in the air and doing nothing to alieve the anxiety in your pants. \u201cThat just means we can\u2019t let our guard down. We don\u2019t know what he is, so he could be up to anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on, everypony.\u201d Twilight stepped up, trying to serve as the voice of reason. \u201cRainbowDash is right that we shouldn\u2019t let our guard down, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should assume the worst.\u201d You were rather annoyed at the way they were all talking about you as if you weren\u2019t even in the room. \u201cMaybe we should just ask him who he is and what he\u2019s doing here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes fell on you.

I can't even remember the last thing I was doing before I suddenly ended up here. I remember everything else except how I got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you don't remember how you got here, how do you know that you're from another world and not just from another country, silly?\" Pinkie asked with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because walking, talking ponies don't exist where I'm from,\" you answered. \"In my world, your world is a fictional place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know about Equestria?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you know?\" Rainbow interjected, only for AJ to reel her in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to tell them that you knew about all their adventures on the show. That wouldn't be a smart move. They could possibly see you as a threat if they know how much knowledge you had, especially regarding the princesses and the pivotal battles of Equestrian history. \"The most I know is the four different pony races, the differences between hem, and where some of the major cities and villages are. Ponyville, Canterlot, the Crystal Empire, Manehattan, it's all just basic knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, pretty much no more than an average schoolfilly's history textbook?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly a little less. I know enough to stay out of the Everfree Forest, though.\" you say, attempting to make a joke, and you earn a few chuckles from Rarity, Twilight, and Applejack. Rainbow was still suspicious of you, Fluttershy shivered at the thought of the dreaded place, and Pinkie Pie didn't count because she's always laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harmless, <i>and</i> he has a sense of humor,\" Rarity smiled. \"Are you still convinced that he's a threat, Rainbow Dash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet your flank, I am!\" she grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it helps, I can't fly, I can't do magic, and my physical strength leaves a little to be desired... a lot, actually,\" you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, from what you've told us, I don't think you're a bad pony,\" Twilight said. \"Well, if I can even call you a pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human,\" you correct her, \"but if saying 'pony' is comfortable for you, I'm cool with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. In any case, though, you'll need a place to stay while I contact Princess Celestia and Luna. Ideally, you'll need to stay with somepony that works from home and can keep a regular eye on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Me! Mememememe!\" Pinkie said, bouncing up and down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to work in the bakery, Pinkie Pie,\" the purple mare reminded her. \"You'll be too busy.

Rainbow Dash has weather patrol, and even if she didn't, I don't think Thomas can even stand in her place, Flutershy'll be busy with her animals, so that leaves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me, darling,\" Rarity finished for her. \"Sweetie Belle is at our parents' house this week, and I can keep an eye on him while I work on my designs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then. Thomas can stay with one of us while we wait for a response from the princesses,\" Twilight said with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps he'd like to have a say in the matter,\" Rarity suggested before turning to you. \"Who do you want to stay with, darling?\"</span></div></div>",

I really appreciate it.\" <i>Storage? I remember she had a basement, but did Twilight have a whole room set aside for storage in the show?</i> You think. <i>No. I don't think so.

Just thinking about some... stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you probably shouldn't,\" Twilight suggested as she opened the door, revealing a room full of old scrolls, quills, and carpets. \"You're still tired from the ordeal of traveling to a new world. Whatever stuff you might be thinking about, you won't be able to accomplish anything if you're too tired to think straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust her on this one,\" Spike suggested sardonically. \"She speaks from experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gave the little dragon a scowl while he began whistling innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed at the exchange. <i>At least these two seem pretty much the same.</i> \"You're right, Twilight. I'll sleep on it for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded in approval and the three of you began the task of cleaning out the room. Twilight levitated the supplies out of the room. You couldn't help but stare in awe as all the materials, glowing with the unicorn's violet magic, casually flew over head and set themselves neatly in the corner. While you were distracted, Spike fetched a broom for you to begin sweeping. Meanwhile, he had dawned an immaculately frilly apron and began dusting the supplies. You held in a chuckle at how silly he looked as you began your relatively simple task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce clean and empty, the room wasn't much bigger than a matchbox apartment, more than you had expected.

You and Rarity nodded your heads, giving her the go-ahead, and she fired a beam of charged magic at you, instantly teleporting you to Rarity\u2019s home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was expecting that to hurt a little,\u201d you said, clutching your stomach out of instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s always scary the first time, Thomas,\u201d the unicorn giggled. \u201cBy the way, welcome to Carousel Boutique!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWow\u2026 It\u2019s nicer than I imagined.\u201d</i> you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let me show you to your room, darling,\u201d Rarity said, leading you up the stairs and down the hall to the guest room. \u201cThe bathroom is at the end of the hall, and my room is right here across the hall, so if you ever need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to ask, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \u201cOkay.

With no real options, for some reason, you got the urge to just pick a direction and start walking. And walking. And walking. You walked for days, until finally you couldn\u2019t walk anymore, and passed out in the dirt. When you woke up, you were in a realm called \u2018Equestria\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for you to integrate into this new society. While the ponies were a bit shocked and confused when you first stumbled into town, they quickly accepted you once they realized you were harmless. You were more shocked by the sight of the ponies then they were by you, in fact. They were similar to humans, but ultimately, they were like nothing you\u2019d ever seen before. Their fur was fine as silk, with each individual strand of fur being almost invisible to the naked eye, giving them the illusion of having perfect, unblemished skin. Their hair seems to ignore the laws of physics, allowing them to pull off any hairstyle they desire with little to no effort. Some could fly effortlessly through the air; some had powers of telekinesis; some had superhuman strength and endurance. Most curiously, however, is the fact that there seems to be no taboo against public nudity in their society. The ponies walk around town in various stages of dress, a large majority of them being half-naked, if not completely so. It made every interaction you had with the strange creatures incredibly uncomfortable, considering some of their distinctly, er\u2026 <i>human</i> features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t really blame them, though, considering you were completely naked yourself. Clothes were considered a luxury in this world, and as such, they were prohibitively expensive for a vagrant like you. But you\u2019ve decided that you were going to change that. You\u2019ve travelled this this town all the way from Baltimare because you\u2019ve heard that the burgeoning town of Ponyville was a land of opportunity. This was the town, you\u2019ve decided, where you would stake your claim and make something out of your life in this magical realm. But first, you needed to get your foot in the door. In a distributist economy like Equestria\u2019s, this would likely mean picking up some odd jobs under craftsmares to save up some bits. However, considering Ponyville is a relatively small town where everyone seemed to know each other, asking around and forging connections would also be beneficial.</span></div></div>",

Other, more enterprising individuals sorted through the waves of immigrants pouring into the town, offering them a place as apprentices. Basically, this was a position of doing menial grunt work under more skilled craftsmares in exchange for lodging and a paltry salary, as well as some secrets of their trade. This was a good opportunity in case you want to take up a particular craft, or join a guild. Interestingly enough, there was also a few wanted posters nailed up to a notice board outside the town hall. While it was dangerous and not the kind of thing you\u2019ve ever done before, they offered exorbitant bounties. If you managed to bring in one of the bandits that had been harassing the locals, you\u2019d be set for life. </span></div></div>",

Apparently one of the workers-- \u2018Big Mac\u2019, you think his name was-- had to take a trip to Appleloosa to settle a family crisis, and the farm needed someone to do their grunt work for a while. Agriculture and construction work seemed to be among the few occupations relegated specifically to the non-unicorn and non-pegasus crowd, who didn\u2019t have all the fancy magical powers. So those careers might be your best bet\u2026 even if you don\u2019t feel particularly keen on moving from one life of menial labor to another. It wasn\u2019t technically an apprenticeship, and it wasn\u2019t even associated with any guild, but it would help you become considered a friend of the Apple family, who collectively own over 90% of Equestria\u2019s farmland. So if you\u2019ve ever wanted to become a farmer, nows your chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if you were interested in more intellectual pursuits, the Guild of the Arcane Arts was offering an apprenticeship in theurgy under one of their master craftsmares, Twilight Sparkle. Theurgy was a form of magic that is performed with ritual and incantation, and doesn\u2019t require a horn. It was one of the most arduous crafts to learn, but if you managed it, you could perform amazing supernatural feats. It was definitely a more exciting prospect than anything you\u2019ve encountered on Earth.</span></div></div>",

Now that you were starting a new life for yourself, this seemed like the perfect opportunity. You found this \u2018Applejack\u2019 running a cart near the edge of the town square, selling apple bushels, apple pies, apple cider, baseball caps with \u2018I \u2764 APPLES\u2019 scribbled on their fronts... anything related to apples, really. She herself was, as you expected, half-naked, wearing nothing but a green vest with an apple logo on the collar and a goofy cowboy hat, but at least it was more than most ponies around here wore. She was quite a few years older than you were-- around 29, you\u2019d estimate-- and was obviously athletic, while not being overly muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhy, if it isn\u2019t the human I\u2019ve heard so much about!\u201d</span> Applejack smiled, as she enthusiastically shook your hand. She apparently didn\u2019t know her own strength, and you felt like she was going to shake your arm right out of its socket. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cPleasure to meet you! I\u2019m Applejack.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThomas,\u201d</b> you return with a curt nod as you rub your now sore shoulder, before looking down at the various apple-themed coffee mugs on sale. <b>\u201cYou sure do seem to like apples.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cYessir!\u201d</span> Applejack nodded. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cSeptember\u2019s right around the corner, so I have to clear out the stockpiles a bit. Anyway, would you like some apples?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019m not here to buy anything.\u201d</b> You shake your head. <b>\u201cI\u2019m actually interested in the apprenticeship.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cOh, wow! And I was starting to think I was going to have to call in family members from out of town.\u201d</span> Applejack remarked, excited. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cPonies \u2018round these parts don\u2019t understand the importance of hard work and concentration. Want everything served up easy to \u2018em, imported from Appleloosa or wherever. It\u2019s good to hear you humans are made of sterner stuff!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh, thanks.\u201d</b> You shrug. <b>\u201cSo you run that huge farm off the outskirts of town, I understand? What made you start taking apprentices?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWe\u2019re a little short-handed down at the farm right now, as you might\u2019ve heard, and Applebucking season\u2019s coming up,\u201d</span> Applejack sighs. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cBesides, I\u2019m at an age where I really should be taking apprentices. Gotta keep the applebucking business alive, you know?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell this \u2018Applejack\u2019 is definitely a kind-hearted and trustworthy woman, though maybe a little overbearing. You continue to chat for almost an hour on the prospect of your apprenticeship, occasionally pausing so she can serve customers, until you finally decide that it\u2019s something you want to do, and she decides that it\u2019s something you\u2019re capable of doing. You end up signing an indenture which binds you as her apprentice for a flexible period of time, basically meaning you are obligated to perform whatever jobs she assigns to you and, in turn, she is responsible for your housing and well-being, as well as educating you in the ways of her craft. By the end of it all, you\u2019ll be a friend of the apple family, a member of Ponyville\u2019s merchant guild, and-- if you go for the full three years-- you'll end up considered a journeyman in agriculture, and be entitled to five acres of arable land. Unfortunately, the salary will be next to nothing, so you\u2019ll pretty much have to rely on Applejack for everything you need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs night falls, the mare wraps up the stall, and you walk with her back to her farm, \u2018Sweet Apple Acres\u2019. Your heart skips a beat as you inadvertently lay eyes on her bare rear swaying hypnotically as she walked, obviously toned by years of athleticism. You were still getting used to the pony society\u2019s tendency to go around basically nude, and tried not to stare, but you couldn\u2019t help but take a few quick glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cMy sister just started with her apprenticeship at the farm, so you\u2019ll be probably working along with her. Might even bring in a third apprentice sometime too. I certainly have the extra room, what with my brother down in Appleloosa,\u201d</span> Applejack said as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you reach the front path of sweet apple acres. The cold night stung your skin and the rocky dirt roads were uncomfortable beneath your feet as you passed by rows and rows of apple trees. From this angle, the apple trees seemed to cover the earth from horizon to horizon like an ocean, stretching as far as the eye could see. <b>\u201cWow,\u201d</b> you gasp. <b>\u201cThat is\u2026 that is a lot of apple trees we\u2019re going to have to harvest.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cYep!\u201d</span> Applejack confirmed, as if it was something she hears a lot. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhy do you think I need extra help with the harvest?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reach the large home in the dead center of the endless apple fields. You immediately breathe a sigh of relief as you step inside, as you felt the heat coming off from the fireplace. It was definitely cozy inside, though the overly flashy exterior made the house look like it was a lot bigger than it actually was. That was typical of pony agriculture, however. Applejack showed you your room-- a humble little room with nothing but a small bed, a drawer, and a window. You don\u2019t even get a lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cI\u2019ll just let you get settled in for tonight. It\u2019s too late to start working now.\u201d</span> Applejack yawned, as she pulled off her hat and vest and hanged them on a rack by the front door, exposing her firm breasts and golden blond hair. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI\u2019ll start training you tomorrow morning, so get some sleep-- you\u2019ll need it!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank her for everything, and she disappears up the stairs, presumably heading to her room. You put what little you own in the drawer, and flop onto the bed. You were already exhausted by the train ride here, so a little rest was all you needed, and you were glad you had already found a comfy place to stay and didn\u2019t have to hop from hotel room to hotel room anymore. With that thought, you slowly drift into a deep sleep.</span></div></div>",

It appeared to be some kind of pie, though ultimately not like any pastry you\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. Whatever it was, it smelled absolutely delicious. <b>\u201cWhat is this? Some kind of apple pie, I presume?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cYou could call it that, but with a bit of a twist.\u201d</span> Applejack chuckled cryptically, before walking up the stairwell. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cEnjoy. I\u2019ll go wake up Applebloom.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the dish for a while, before shrugging and taking a bite. You were immediately blindsided by its flavor! Every bite was like fireworks going off in your mouth. You had heard that there were certain mythical ingredients around Equestria that gave food a literally supernatural flavor-- you assume one of those is the Apple family\u2019s secret ingredient. If this is what their food tastes like, it\u2019s no wonder they\u2019re so renowned. Once you were about halfway done with the pie, you hear a loud <i>thump</i> from upstairs, following by the sound of two mares arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cDo you really have to <i>shove</i> me out of bed!?\u201d</font></span><br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cYou weren\u2019t getting up! Breakfast was going to get cold. Besides, you\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis argument continued for a few moments, until you finally see Applejack returning down the stairs, followed by a younger mare. This mare had light yellow fur and a red mane, and looked to be much closer to your age-- she looked about 19, you\u2019d say. You assume that this is the sister Applejack had been talking about. She looked plainly disgruntled at having to get up so early, before stopping in her tracks once she sees you sitting there having breakfast. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUh\u2026 why is the human sitting at our table?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cThat\u2019s the new apprentice, sugarcube!\u201d</span> Applejack smiled. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cApplebloom, meet Thomas! Thomas, Applebloom.\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger mare looked slightly confused for a moment, before chuckling. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh. So you finally found somepony, huh?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cYes, I did, and we\u2019re going to treat him with respect.\u201d</span> Applejack declared, preemptively. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cSince he\u2019s so kind to help us out at the farm for so little in return.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to meet you, then, Thomas.\u201d</span> The young mare shrugged as she sat down at the dining table across from you. She looked lean, but not nearly as athletic or muscular as Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cNow you two get acquainted.\u201d</span> Applejack demanded, kindly but sternly as she put her cowboy hat on and walked out onto the porch. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cAfter y\u2019all are done with breakfast, we\u2019re going out to teach Thomas here how to work the fields.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two sit for a while, eating your delicious meals, before Applebloom broke the silence. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSo, what brings a human like you here?\u201d</span> She asked, idly. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhen I first heard about you, I figured you would end up in Canterlot or somewhere.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019m trying to start a new life here in Equestria, and Ponyville just seemed like the right place.\u201d</b> You shrug. <b>\u201cBig cities don\u2019t really appeal to me, and rustic small towns like Appleloosa don\u2019t either. This seemed like a happy medium.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh? Guess I can understand that.\u201d</span> She said, in between bites. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing that you weren\u2019t born here-- in Equestria, I mean-- you\u2019re here from some other dimension. Is that\u2026 is that true?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cPretty much,\u201d</b> you sigh. <b>\u201cMaybe not another dimension, but another world, definitely. It was a bit like this pony world, but full of humans like me instead.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHm...\u201d</span> She grunts, as she stares down at her plate, as if pondering your words. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSo\u2026 you had to leave all that behind? Did you know anypony there?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, leaning back in your chair. <b>\u201cI didn\u2019t leave anything behind. Not really,\u201d</b> you frown, reminiscing. <b>\u201cOf course, I miss my old world a lot\u2026 but really, there was nothing for me here. You ponies are an odd bunch, but you\u2019re much better than the people I left behind.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. You can tell she was still curious, and still had questions she wanted to ask, but decided not to press the issue, worried she might ask something too personal. You were fine with that. It wasn\u2019t really the kind of thing you liked to talk about, anyway. You both finished your breakfast quickly, and Applejack led you out into the fields after you all grab a few big woven baskets each. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cFirst off, you\u2019ll have to learn to tell when the apples are ripe, \u2018cause for most of the year you\u2019re going to be picking \u2018em one-by-one,\u201d</span> Applejack instructed as you all walked down the path. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cAfter that, we\u2019ll learn about buckin\u2019 trees. This\u2019ll only come in handy next month, when almost all the apples are ripe, but it\u2019ll definitely save time.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reached a particularly huge apple tree, and Applejack stops the admire it. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cHere we are. The first apple tree in Ponyville, planted by ol\u2019 Granny herself.\u201d</span> Applejack smiles. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cIt\u2019s where I first learned to pick apples, and it\u2019s where you\u2019ll learn, too.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt\u2019s, uh\u2026 huge,\u201d</b> you comment, looking up at the tree. <b>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re not going to reach those branches, unless you brought a ladder.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack laughed at the notion. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cA ladder? We\u2019re going to be hauling around a good couple dozen bushels of apples, sugarcube, I\u2019d hate to have to carry around a cumbersome ladder, too,\u201d</span> Applejack shakes her head. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cNo. You\u2019re just gonna climb up there. Show \u2018im how it\u2019s done, Applebloom.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cMe? Why do I have to do it? He\u2019s <i>you\u2019re</i> apprentice,\u201d</span> Applebloom complained, folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cYeah, well, last time I checked, you\u2019re my apprentice too, and you know what they say-- the best way to learn is to teach,\u201d</span> Applejack says smugly. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cNow hop to it!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react, the young mare rolls her eyes before stepping towards the tree, grabbing a low-hanging branch, and hoisting herself on top of it with surprising strength and flexibility. You guessed you misjudged her athleticism. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYour turn,\u201d</span> she called down from her perch upon the branch. You shrugged, and similarly tried to pull yourself up onto a branch. Gravity seemed to be much weaker in the world of Equestria, which made the lifting easier, but you just weren\u2019t flexible enough. Applebloom giggled a bit as she watched you struggle. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWow! Guess you really are a city boy after all.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cShut it!\u201d</b> You yell as you finally sloppily land yourself on a branch, sitting across from the mare. She laughs, before suddenly twisting an apple of her branch and tossing it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cCatch!\u201d</span> she yells, and you almost fall off your branch as you scramble to catch the apple as it soars towards you. Luckily, you keep your balance, and scowl at the mare as she laughs once again at your sloppiness. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNow tell me\u2026 is it ripe?\u201d</span> You inspect the apple, and see that it was perfectly red-- about as pristine as an apple could be, you guessed. You nod to her. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh? Then take a bite.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a bite from the apple, only to immediately spit it out and start coughing. It was disgusting! Once you recovered, you looked at the bite you took, and noticed that the apple was pure black on the inside. <b>\u201cWhat the hell kind of apples are these?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNo kind of apple you\u2019ve ever seen, that\u2019s for sure. They\u2019re a bit of an Apple family secret,\u201d</span> Applebloom chuckles. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cThey can either be the best thing you\u2019ve ever tasted, or the worst. That\u2019s why you have to learn to pick \u2018em when they\u2019re juuust right.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it! They were using magical ingredients. You look down in disgust and wonderment at the malformed apple in your hand. This was going to be more complicated than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the new hour, Applebloom explains to you the basics of these strange, enchanted apples. Just telling whether one of these apples were ripe was a surprisingly complicated process, and you couldn\u2019t help but be in awe at the level of quality control the apple family put into their produce.Meanwhile, Applejack sat up against the tree beneath the two of you, relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cYou done yet?\u201d</span> Applejack calls. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI\u2019m going to have to start working the fields myself, so if you want to learn how to buck apple trees, you\u2019re going to want to tag along.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI don\u2019t think he fully gets this yet,\u201d</span> Applebloom notes. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNo point in teaching him how to harvest if he can\u2019t even tell if they\u2019re ripe, right?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cI guess the applebucking lesson can wait until tomorrow,\u201d</span> Applejack shrugs. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cOr he can come with me, and you two can wrap <i>this</i> lesson up tomorrow. Whichever way.\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

You completely lose all direction amidst the confusing tangle of apple trees, but apparently Applejack knows the orchard like the back of her hand, and navigates easily even without any apparent landmarks. Eventually, she stops in front of a particularly flimsy tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cHere! This one's perfect.\u201d</span> She decides by whatever criteria, as she pushes her hand against the tree, and it tips over slightly. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cFirst, though, do you have any idea what applebucking is?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNot a clue.\u201d</b> You shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cRight. Well, during the months when you can be pretty sure all the apples are ripe, you can save time by kicking the tree just hard enough to knock down every apple at once.\u201d</span> She explains, while setting down the straw baskets in a circle on the ground around another, larger tree, and slipping on some steel-toed boots. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cLet me demonstrate.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rears up and kicks the tree with a stunning amount of speed and strength, and even the sturdy-looking tree shook violently, looking like it was on the verge of breaking free from its roots. A few dozen apples rain into the baskets below. You whistle. You knew that Earth Ponies naturally had incredible strength and endurance, but this was almost superhuman. She admired her handiwork, before handing you the boots. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cHere, you try.\u201d</span> You approach the thinner tree, nervously. If she could knock every apple out of that massive tree, surely you could accomplish the same with this flimsy one? You try kicking the tree with the same technique she showed, over and over again. No give. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cCome on! You can't buck a single apple tree?\u201d</span> She spurs you on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snort with determination, before bracing yourself against a nearby pole for some more stability, before rearing up and slamming the heel of your boot into the tree with all your might. To your elation, it works this time, and the tree gives way, dropping a barrage of apples onto the ground below. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cThere you go! I knew ya could do it.\u201d</span> She raises a fist. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cYou're no earth pony, but you're still tougher than the unicorns, at least.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUhh... thanks, I guess.\u201d</b> You reply. You continue to practice as the hours tick by, taking whatever pointers Applejack gives you. You get better at the technique, but you still struggle to kick with even half as much power as Applejack manages. You lack the innate magical abilities of most of the races, but it was comforting to know that with some dedication, you may eventually match them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, the sun begins to dip beneath the mountains, and nightfall is upon you. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cLooks like it's about time to wrap this up,\u201d</span> she noted, wiping the dust off her hands. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cLet's head back.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks back towards the house, and you follow her, limping and whimpering as a result of your now aching hamstrings. As you walk, you decide to get to know her a bit. <b>\u201cSo... this farm is struggling, it seems? I figured a farm like this would be too big to fail by now.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cEverypony assumes that, but to be honest, the farm doesn't exactly have the odds stacked in it's favor. The only reason it's still alive is all the hard work the family's put in.\u201d</span> Applejack shrugs. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cBut yeah. The farm is struggling.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cJust not enough hands on deck to cover the workload?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cExactly. The house seems emptier and emptier every year. First it was my folks... then it was granny... now Big Mac's ran off to Appleloosa...\u201d</span> Applejack sighs as she walks. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cOnce she's done with her apprenticeship, Applebloom will likely run off, too, and it'll be just me out here. I don't know how I'll take care of the farm then.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat makes you think Applebloom will leave?\u201d</b> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cSame reason Big Mac left. With all that's possible nowadays, who wants to be cooped up on some farm their whole lives?\u201d</span> Applejack asks, rhetorically. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI won't fault her if she leaves. Not at all. I want her to go and do what makes her happy. I'm just... I'm sorry. I don't mean to complain.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt's fine,\u201d</b> you nod. You could tell she was frustrated, but you didn't know what you should say. The both of you walk back to the house in silence. You step inside and take a seat by the fireplace, warming yourself, as Applejack takes her hat off and hangs it up by the front door. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWell, good job today! You may not be as naturally skilled as earth ponies, but you sure do learn quickly,\u201d</span> Applejack smiles, laying a hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThanks. I did my best,\u201d</b> you shrug with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cNow get some sleep tonight. You'll be getting some real work done tomorrow,\u201d</span> she instructs, and you eventually walk back to your room. You lay down on your bed, which creaks underneath you. You stare at the ceiling for a while, before your eyes center on a small framed photo resting on the drawer next to you. It depicted Applejack, smiling, with her arm slung over the shoulder of a bulky, shy-looking red stallion. <i>I guess that's Big Mac</i>, you think to yourself. It was a bit of a depressing note, given the circumstances, but you push the thought out of your mind to get a good night's sleep.</span></div></div>",

You stumbled idly through the house until you walked into the dining room, and saw Applejack in the kitchen, wearing an adorable apron, cooking something that smelled absolutely delicious. She smiled as she heard you walk in. \u201cWow, you're up late. I was just about to wake you up myself,\u201d she notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cGood morning,\u201d</b> you responded, simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cGood morning,\u201d</span> she nodded, as she set down a slice of apple pie hot out of the oven, among other pastries, on the dining room table in front of you. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cYou're just in time for lunch.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, you didn't have to...\u201d</b> you said, even though internally you were licking your lips at the sight of the delicious meal before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cDon't worry about it, sugarcube,\u201d</span> she smiled warmly, as you lazily sat down one on of the uncomfortable but quaint wooden seats. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI'm more than happy to cook for you and Applebloom while you focus on your apprenticeship. Besides, I've got the best pastry recipes this side of the Grange. It would be selfish to hog 'em all to myself.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to argue with that. You were too busy digging into the delicious plate in front of you. You hated cooking, anyway. Plus, while you figured everything Applejack cooked would be some apple-based recipe or another, there was actually a surprising amount of variety in the humble meal. Applejack ate across from you, with slightly less fervor. <b>\u201cShould Applebloom be here?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cShe's out in the fields right now. She skips lunch, sometimes,\u201d</span> she responded between bites. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cJust wondering. She seems nice.\u201d</b> You shrug. <b>\u201cAnd happy on the farm. Are you sure she wants to leave?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cOf course she seems happy. She isn't the type to complain. Big Mac wasn't, either. But when your family's frustrated, you can just tell,\u201d</span> she sighed, staring at an apple in her hands, idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou really like apples, don't you?\u201d</b> You notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cYeah. I'm always getting that. Everypony always pokes fun of ol' Applejack and her apples. They think I'm just obsessed with 'em,\u201d</span> she chuckled. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cBut there's more to it than that. I don't really have the fancy words to describe it, but... they make me think of family. You know? These apples, this orchard... they've been with me my whole life. They remind me of the good ol' days.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, I get it.\u201d</b> You nod, having finished your plate. <b>\u201cThis farm's important to you, eh?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cOf course! It's important to everypony in town... or at least, it should be. All of Ponyville was built around this humble little farm.\u201d</span> Applejack insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cReally?\u201d</b> You ask as you push in your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cYup! Apple family started this farm a few decades ago, and a whole town sprung up around it.\u201d</span> Applejack recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cA few decades? This town is pretty big. I figured it would be older than that.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cSeems like it, huh? In just a few dozen years, over thirty six hundred ponies made their homes here. Mighty impressive, ain't it?\u201d</span> Applejack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSo what are we doing today, anyway?\u201d</b> You ask as you step to the front door, feeling the sun pouring in and bearing down on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWe still have a few weeks until September, so you have time to get some more training done.\u201d</span> Applejack rubbed her hands before putting on her quaint cowboy hat and emerging from the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you followed her back into the orchard, you have to ask, <b>\u201cSo, uh, I\u2019ve been wondering\u2026 do you have any spare clothes around the farmhouse I could wear?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you an odd look. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhat for? Are you planning on going to the gala or somethin\u2019?\u201d</span> She asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNo,\u201d</b> you sighed, wringing your hands, frustrated that you have to explain this to somepony again. <b>\u201cBack in my world, everyone wore clothes, basically all the time.

Sounds like it would be mighty inconvenient...\u201d</span> She tilts her head, incredulous. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWell, Big Mac owned a nice suit that would probably fit you, but he took it with him when he left. But I do know a boutique in the city. Maybe we could go you somethin\u2019 there on the weekend, custom fitted?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d</b> you smile, before getting to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, you tread back along the dirt road back to the house. You were panting from exhaustion and drenched in sweat, but you felt victorious. You had made good progress in your training, and the earth pony seemed impressed by your adaptability. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cGood job out there today, city boy. You keep this up, and you\u2019ll be buckin\u2019 apples with the best of \u2018em,\u201d</span> The mare in question complimented, placing a hand on your shoulder. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cAnd now\u2019s the time to unwind with a nice shower and a belly full of apple pie. Sound good?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSounds perfect,\u201d</b> you call, as you lay on the dusty, itchy old couch, getting your bearings. Your whole body ached after a hard day\u2019s work at the barn, but you didn\u2019t mind. It felt\u2026 fulfilling, somehow. Like you were finally putting in an honest day\u2019s work. Applejack\u2019s company made it all the sweeter -- she really seemed like an amazing woman. It\u2019s a shame you never met someone like her back on earth, or you would never be in this mess. Later, you couldn\u2019t help but gasp a little bit when you laid eyes on Applejack\u2019s \u201cshower\u201d. You knew the ponies were old-fashioned, but this was ridiculous. The \u201cshower\u201d consisted of nothing but a curtain and a barrel, which was carefully positioned on the ceiling so it could rain water on those below. It looked absolutely medieval. <b>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be showering... together?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWell of course.\u201d</span> She said, nonchalantly. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cDon\u2019t want to waste water, do ya?\u201d</span> She pulled on a crank, which caused water to loudly flow down from the barrel and through a grate, rolling over the mare\u2019s muscular body as she gestures for you to join her. For a brief moment, you thought she might be flirting with you, until you remembered that the ponies have incredibly different social conventions then you\u2019re used to. For her, this might be the most normal thing in the world. Not wanting to seem rude, you join her beneath the \u2018shower\u2019, wincing at how freezing cold the water was. Still, even this wasn\u2019t enough to distract you from the mare standing inches in front of you, the water pressing her fur against her body and further bringing out her curves. You were used to being around the naked ponies by this point, but something about being so close made your heart beat out of your chest. Despite your attempts to remain professional, your body betrayed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder as your hard shaft accidentally brushes against her firm flank. You hold your breath as Applejack turns to you, but upon seeing your predicament, she simply chuckles. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cOh, sorry. You did say you were used to some modesty, didn\u2019t ya?\u201d</span> She chuckled, uncomfortably. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cThis may be a mite awkward, then. Heh!\u201d</span> You guess that in a world where everyone is incredibly attractive and constantly naked, situations like these must not be all that unexpected. She scoots away from you a bit, giving you some room to breathe; but your manhood remains up and at attention, unable to calm yourself while you have such a perfect view of the beautiful woman\u2019s back. A couple minutes later, she turns around again, grimacing when she notices how tense you still are. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cHm. Well, you\u2019re might pent-up, arentcha?\u201d</span> She ponders, and you blush in embarrassment as she looks down curiously at your shaft. \u201cWant me to take of that for you, sugarcube?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-what are you talking about?\u201d</b> You took a step back, shocked at the proposal. She was your boss, and you had assumed she would never be anything more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cHeh, no need to freak out! Nothin\u2019 to be embarrassed about,\u201d</span> she chuckled nonchalantly, as if this was the most normal thing in the world. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cNot like I\u2019m proposing we buck or anything. Just offering to relieve some tension. That\u2019s all.\u201d</span> You stared at the ground, your heart thumping in your chest. You knew ponies were open about such things, but you never knew they were this casual. You had only met the mare a few days ago! You turn around, overcome by your conflicting emotions. On one hand, this level of forwardness -- from your own boss! -- was crazy\u2026 but on the other, you couldn\u2019t deny your piercing desire. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI understand if you\u2019re not so comfortable with that sort of thing,\u201d</span> she frowned, remembering that humans might not be as open with their sexuality\u2026 but hearing the disappointment in her voice was the tipping point for you.</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201c... alright, sugarcube. If you say so,\u201d</span> she said, sounding a little uncertain. You were just about to turn around to face her, when you felt her come to you instead, her impossibly soft breasts pressing up against your back. You shudder as she massages your shoulders with your hands, your shaft begging for her gentle touch. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cJust relax, and tell me if things\u2019re feelin\u2019 thorny, alright?\u201d</span> You nodded, silently, burning with anticipation in the few seconds before the mare\u2019s soft, furry hand grabs hold of your shaft. Despite the incredible attractiveness of most of the mares, you hadn\u2019t actually slept with anyone since you arrived in Equestria. You\u2019d been too busy figuring out your new life to bother forming any personal relations. Applejack kept things simple, of course, trying not to get too intimate; she just slid her hand back and forth along her wet shaft with almost robotic efficiency, as if trying to get it over with. Still, you suddenly realized how much you missed a woman\u2019s touch. <span class=\"corange\">\u201c... this good?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... a little faster?\u201d</b> You whispered, and she obliged, working your shaft with increasing vigor. You could hardly believe this was actually happening. You glanced over your shoulder for a moment, to see just a hint of a smile on the mare\u2019s face; not one of arousal, but of genuine warmness, as if she was just happy to be doing something for a friend. You thrust your hips slightly, despite yourself, moving in tune with the mare\u2019s stroking, as you feel yourself approaching your climax. Out of respect for her, you don\u2019t try to hold back; within only a couple minutes, you let yourself release all over the wooded floors of the \u2018shower\u2019, the water washing your load easily down the drain. Her stroking slowed as you came in steady pumps, finally pulling her hand away when you seemed to be finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cThere, nice and simple. Not so bad, eh?\u201d</span> She smiled, although you were so overcome by the sensation, she had to hold you up to keep you from just falling over. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhoa, there, pardner! Don\u2019t keel over for my sake!\u201d</span> She chuckled as you savored the feeling of closeness for just a few seconds longer, enjoying the feeling of her furry breasts pressed against your back before she finally returned to her spot on the other side of the \u2018shower\u2019. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cNow, let\u2019s get finished up. Don\u2019t want to miss dinner, eh?\u201d</span> With that, the two of you finished scrubbing off the muck and grime of the day\u2019s work in silence, as you quietly contemplated your situation. It was all so much to take in. Everything seemed the same, but\u2026 you felt like your relationship with Applejack was slowly changing.</span></div></div>",

I think I'm just about to figure this whole thing out,\u201d</b> you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Alright. See you tonight,\u201d</span> Applejack snorts, apparently amused, before walking off deeper into the orchard. You began the arduous process of learning how to decipher the ripeness of one of these strange enchanted apples at a glance. It was a confusing and complicated task, but it seemed there really was a science to it, and you were slowly getting better at telling whether one of these apples were ripe at a glance. You and Applebloom managed to make some small talk while you were at it, and you enjoyed her company. She seemed nice enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSee? You're getting the hang of it!\u201d</span> She smiles as you triumphantly toss another ripe apple into the basket below. The sun was on the verge of setting, and the valley of trees grew darker with every passing moment. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI think that's enough training for one day. AJ will be back soon, anyway.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Alright. Should we just head back to the house?\u201d</b> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHmm... actually, nah. Here, there's something cool out here you should see,\u201d</span> she calls, hopping down from the tree. You try to hop down from your branch as gracefully as she did, but end up losing your balance and landing on your arse on the ground. She giggles as you stand up and dust yourself off, before grabbing your hand and excitedly leading you deeper through the weave of trees that made up the vast orchard. Eventually, you were led into a small clearing with a large tree in the middle, with a quaint and frankly impressively large tree house attached. You both walk up the stairs, and pull the small wooden door open, only to be hit in the face by a gust of stale air. The tree house looked like it hadn't been touched in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cThis is my old tree house, from way back when. I almost forgot about this place.\u201d</span> she announces as she takes a look around the room, opening up the single small window to let some fresh air in. You walk in after her, having to duck just to keep your head from hitting the ceiling. You two sit next to each other under the windowsill, staring at the beams of light shining in, listening to the sounds of birds chirping as nightfall approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt's pretty impressive.\u201d</b> You whistle. <b>\u201cDon't think I've ever seen a children's tree house that was this big.\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYeah, Applejack and my brother built it for me when I was little. They have a knack for this kind of thing.\u201d</span> she smiles as she digs through some drawers in the corner, to find some red sheets with emblems crudely stitched onto their sides. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAnd hey! These are capes we used to wear.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c'We'?\u201d</b> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYeah! I used to come up here with my friends all the time when I was a kid.\u201d</span> she reminisces excitedly, as the memories flood back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed she looked a little bit forlorn as she stared at the old sheets. <b>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhat? Oh, no, I'm just getting all nostalgic. I just miss my old friends, you know? But I'm happy for them. They ended up going off and doing all these great things. \u201d</span> Applebloom sighed, staring at the dirty, wrinkled capes-- all that remained of a time long past. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOne went to some fancy college all the way up in Canterlot, and the other joined the Wonderbolt Academy... and I'm still just stuck here, on the same ol' farm.\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou don't like it here?\u201d</b> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNo, I mean, I do. This farm has taken care of me, for all my life,\u201d</span> Applebloom shrugged. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI just figured I'd go on to do something more, you know? I've already been on this farm my whole life, and... to think, in ten, twenty years, I'll probably still be here, is just...\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNo, no, I understand. I used to feel just like that back on Earth. Working a farm like this has always been my true passion, but I was stuck in this boring, dead-end job, and I was too scared to go out and try something different.\u201d</b> you recall wistfully. <b>\u201cSeemed like I couldn't do anything else, yeah? It was all I'd ever done.\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYeah.\u201d</span> Applebloom nodded, understanding. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cBut... you are working at a farm now.\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah. See, eventually, I get fed up with it all. So I just stopped ovethinking everything, and just did what I felt I needed to do... and I ended up here, doing exactly what I always wanted, in a world populated by some of the friendliest people I've ever met,\u201d</b> you explain as you gaze out the small wooden window. <b>\u201cMaybe my story's a bit unusual, but still. You want my advice? Just don't be afraid to follow your gut, and things will get better, one way or another. Trust me.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom sat there, staring down at the tarnished capes, digesting your words. After a moment, the young mare pushed the drawer closed, not wanting to reminisce any longer. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI wish it were that easy,\u201d</span> she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cHey! Are you two up there?\u201d</span> You hear a call. You look outside to see Applejack standing below the treehouse, carrying a lantern and multiple big baskets full of apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh, yeah, yeah, we're up here!\u201d</span> Applebloom called back, poking her head out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cI've been looking for you two!\u201d</span> Applejack folded her arms as she watched the both of you duck out of the tiny door and walk down the stairs. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cJust what were you up in the treehouse for?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWe was just talkin',\u201d</span> Applebloom said as she reached the bottom of the stars, shivering as she emerged into the dark, cold night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cI said not to go up there anymore,\u201d</span> Applejack recalled. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cThat house is falling apart.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d</span> Applebloom muttered. As the chilly autumn months press down on Equestria, you really start to wish clothes weren't considered such a luxury. Applejack gives you both a few baskets each to carry, which were far heavier than they looked, and you all wander back towards the barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cHow did the training go?\u201d</span> Applejack asked as you walked inside and set the baskets down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI think he's got it.\u201d</span> Applebloom informed, ethusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cGood, good.\u201d</span> Applejack nodded, as she hung her hat up by the door and relaxed on a reclining chair by the fireplace. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cNow you should get some rest, Thomas. You're getting up early tomorrow. I'm gonna teach you everything I know about the art of applebucking.\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cGladly,\u201d</b> You yawn. You crash on your bed, curling up in the comfortable blankets once again, as you slowly drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Tempted, you consider your options. She was apparently last seen near the Arimaspi Territory, in the distant south, which sure sounded dangerous, and she certainly looked intimidating. But for some reason, you weren\u2019t concerned. If one thing has been consistent in your travels across Equestrian, you\u2019ve always inevitably run into trouble. Why wait for it to find you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent what little remained of your bits on supplies, some clothes, and a train ticket. That afternoon, you were riding a quaint little train a hundred miles south, past the mountains, while counting up your supplies and trying to determine how long they\u2019d last you. As far as you could tell, you had to wrap this little expedition up in less than two weeks. After determining that, you simply stared at your window and admired the countryside rolling by. By the time the train stopped anywhere near your destination, it was already well into the evening\u2026 and you still had a lot of traveling to do. Slinging your pack of supplies over your shoulder, you take the rest of the journey on foot. Tonight, you decided, you would find a place to set up camp first, and start searching for your bounty target in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou march through the dense, arduous forest environment, and thank your lucky stars that you had managed to buy some comfortable clothing in town. You could see why the bandit mare would be hiding out here -  this place was seemingly empty of life. The dry, skeletal trees swayed in the moonlight, like long fingers reaching up towards the sky. The shrubbery was so dense, you struggled to find a clearing to settle down in. After traveling aimlessly through the darkened woods, you saw an even more ominous sight - a single cabin in the distance, far from civilization. Your immediately immediately assumed that this might be the house of the bandit mare, but, taking a cautious peek through a window, you confirm that it was empty. In fact, it looked like nobody had visited the place in years. You were ecstatic. It was the perfect place to settle down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay out your gear, and take a look around the cabin. It had one bedroom, one restroom, and a small living room consisting of nothing more than a couch, a table, and a window. It was so small, you wonder how anyone couldn\u2019t stood to live in this place long term. There was no electricity, but you did find a generator, so you could probably get lights as well if you could find fuel for it. As you settled down for the night on the couch, munching on one of the sandwiches you brought with you, you heard cracking noises coming from deeper in the woods. Gun shots! That must be the bandit! In your excitement, you had almost forgotten how perilous this area was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step towards the door frame, straining your ears. It sounded as if the bandit was having a firefight of some sort. You weren\u2019t prepared to go after her tonight, but this may be your chance to arrest her while she\u2019s distracted. Then again, you might get shot. Were you willing to risk it?</span></div></div>",

Her coat was light blue, and her mane, you immediately noticed, was all the colors of the rainbow. She wore a brown leather vest with a white undershirt, and jeans. You immediately braced yourself to battle the bandit, but you were disarmed when you saw the look on her face - panicked and desperate. She was gripping at her stomach, and you realized that she had taken a bullet wound to the gut. The last of her strength was fading, as her wound had weakened her, and she obviously didn\u2019t have the energy to run anymore. In her desperation, she looked up at you and issued one last plea, <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHelp,\u201d</span> before collapsing unconscious onto the dirt. Before you could respond to this, you saw figures running towards you in the distance, and you instinctively grabbed the mare and hid the both of you in the bushes, perhaps despite your best judgement. Once you were completely hidden, you peer out cautiously at the ponies that had been attacking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of intimidating-looking bounty hunters crossed the path in front of you, wielding primitive flintlock rifles or magic spells. You held your breath, trying not to attract the attention of the band as they crossed by. Following behind them was an older stallion with a slick grey coat, that appeared to be leading them. <span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cYou can\u2019t hide forever, Rainbow Dash!\u201d</span> He called into the forest, taunting as he searched for the mare. <span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cIt\u2019s over! Just come out with your hands up. It will make things easier for the both of us\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the band had passed, you finally had time to take stock of the situation. You stared at the unconscious mare- \u2018Rainbow Dash\u2019, apparently. She didn\u2019t look like a criminal. In fact, those bounty hunters look a lot more evil than she did. But you couldn\u2019t be sure, could you? Either way, you pick her up in your arms (since she was a pegasus, she was relatively light), and carry her arduously back to your cabin. You push open the door with your shoulder, and lay the unconscious mare on the bed in the cabin\u2019s bedroom. Despite your best judgement, you were forced to pull off the mare\u2019s clothes, which were absolutely ruined and soaked with blood and dirt, and would probably just lead to her wounds getting infected. Of the supplies you had bought in town, you had obtained some first-aid tools specifically for injuries such as this, so you were able to bandage up her wound and prevent her condition from getting any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, you crashed on the couch, considering what had happened over the night. It had certainly been an interesting turn of events. You came here expecting to arrest the highwaymare, and now all you had done is saved her life. But you would get a bigger reward if you brought the bandit in alive than dead, anyway. You resolved that you would ask her what the situation was tommorow. In the meantime, after such an exhausting day, it was about time you got some sleep...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke early the next morning, to the nostalgic sound of chirping birds in the forest outside. You sit up on the couch and stretch, shaking the cobwebs off yourself. After spending so long in the cities full of nosey and overly-social ponies, being able to spend some time in an isolated cabin like this was a breath of fresh air. After relaxing a bit and having a meager breakfast, you remember why you\u2019re here. You find the rainbow-maned mare laying on her side, still in a deep sleep. She should wake up soon, you hoped, unless she was in a coma or something. You couldn\u2019t help but notice how attractive she was. She was sleek and slightly muscular; obviously a pretty serious athlete. Her exposed breasts were smaller than the average mare\u2019s, but still firm and perky. You tried not to stare while you replaced her bloodied bandages with clean ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were fumbling to cook something on the crude iron stove, the noise of your struggles seemed to stir the mare. Her eyes slid open, and she seemed relaxed at first, then suddenly terrified when she realized she didn\u2019t recognize her surroundings. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cW-who\u2026 the hay are you? Where am I!?\u201d</span> she yelled, trying to jump up from the bed, only for her wound to force her to lay back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhoa, whoa, calm down!\u201d</b> You called back, trying to calm her down before she hurt herself. <b>\u201cI rescued you, I rescued you.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid on her back, gripping her bandage wound, still wincing in pain. Realizing that she wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere with an injury like this, she turned her attention to you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWh\u2026 who\u2026 who are you?\u201d</span> she panted quietly, as she waited for the pain in her belly to alleviate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI'm Thomas,\u201d</b> You said, sitting at a chair by her bedside. <b>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? You were running away from those bounty hunters. I helped you.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared you down for a second, her expression indecipherable, before starting to laugh quietly to herself. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHeh\u2026 these games are never going to end, are they?\u201d</span> she whispered, plopping her head on her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</b> You asked, as you walked back to fiddle with the iron oven some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later,\u201d</span> she yawned, rolling around onto her side. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSo\u2026 is there any particular reason I\u2019m naked?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYour clothes were ruined. I don\u2019t have any spares. Sorry.\u201d</b> You explained, sheepishly. Before she could respond, you pulled a wooden bowl from the oven, full of warm oils and broth and chunks of vegetables, and sat by her bed. <b>\u201cI made something to eat, if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh! Uh, wow, thanks,\u201d</span> she said, looking surprise at your hospitality as she took the bowl in her hands. You focused on trying to get the generator working while she ate the soup in silence. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhy are you doing all of this for me?\u201d</span>  She asked suddenly, cutting through the silence. You grimace. You hadn\u2019t thought to prepare for this. How were you going to explain to her that you were a bounty hunter, too? Would she think the only reason you saved her was to claim the bounty?</span></div></div>",

You were surprised to see a mare like her even had a bounty on her head, in fact. But either way, you start walking over to the boutique where she purportedley spends most of her time. After a few hours of asking around Ponyville, you finally find it. You knock on the door, and hear the muffled voice of a mare from inside. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cCome in!\u201d</span> You take a step inside the boutique, and see the mare from the poster come walking down a stairwell to greet you. You had to admit-- she was drop-dead gorgeous in person. Instead of the gawdy dress she had been wearing on the poster, she was instead wearing a more modest black pencil skirt, a purple button-down shirt that matched her mane, and beautiful white gem-encrusted heels. She was definitely dressed with Canterlot sensibilities in mind, and almost looked a bit out-of-place amidst Ponyville ponies, who just dressed in whatever was comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\u201cOh! You must be the human I\u2019ve heard so much about!\u201d</span> She seemed shocked by your appearance for a moment, before smiling apologetically. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me, I\u2019ve never met a human before.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind.

I see my reputation precedes me,\u201d</span> Rarity smiles, almost as if flattered that the globe-trotting outsider would be able to recognize her so quickly. It wasn\u2019t that hard, though, with her face plastered around town. Perhaps she didn\u2019t know she had a bounty on her head? Or maybe she was just playing dumb? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, you are obviously a master of your craft,\u201d</b> You say, looking over the variety of dresses on displays scattered around the boutique. They were all beautiful, beyond anything you\u2019ve seen on Earth. Some even had massive, shiny gems sewn into the fabric. You wondered how the humble Ponyville ponies could even afford outfits like these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\u201cOh, such a gentleman!\u201d</span> She replies, with an indecipherable, almost mocking smirk. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cPlease, have a seat.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down at one of the booths, which was surprisingly soft and comfortable. <b>\u201cSo what exactly is keeping a mare like you in a town like this?\u201d</b> You ask, trying to slowly work up the nerve to apprehend her. <b>\u201cYou look like you\u2019d be more at home in Canterlot.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\u201cCanterlot? Deary, no! I do not mean to talk down on others, but those Canterlot types are much too snobby for my tastes. They\u2019d dismiss me as nouveau riche, anyway,\u201d</span> Rarity remarked, waving her hand dismissively in the air as if she was amused by the very concept. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cBut never mind the small talk! Let\u2019s get down to business. I\u2019ve never worked for a human before. What an amazing opportunity! I could gear you up with a denim jacket, accentuate that athletic physique-- or maybe just a hat would be more within your budget, perhaps? Cover up that mangy \u2018do of yours-- no offence! I have a Panama in the back that would look just <i>perfect</i>-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSo, miss Rarity\u2026 you are aware that there is a bounty on your head around these parts, correct?\u201d</b> You interrupted, and the room suddenly grew very tense and silent. You could hear a pin drop. You weren\u2019t looking, but you heard her drop whatever she was doing immediately. Apparently, you struck a nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\u201cA <i>bounty</i>? Why, what kind of criminal do you take me for? I am a reputable member of this community!\u201d</span> Rarity replied immediately, sounding incredibly defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019m not accusing you of anything. I\u2019m just saying that the guards want me to bring you down to the town hall to ask you some questions,\u201d</b> You reassured her. There was a long, awkward pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\u201cWell\u2026 alright. I\u2019m sure this is just a big misunderstanding. I\u2019ll come with you, and clear things up with the guards,\u201d</span> Rarity sighed, sounding like she\u2019s calmed down. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cBut first, I was just about to have my afternoon tea.

You were feeling incredibly drowsy now, as if you were on the verge of passing out. <b>\u201cUrgh\u2026 what kind of tea is this?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't answer, but she had grown a kind of smug smirk on her face. You've grown increasingly uncomfortable with this situation, and you decided you\u2019ve had enough to drink. You stood up from your seat, only for your legs to give out beneath you.

You sit up grogilly, and take a look at your surroundings, not fully comprehending what you were seeing. It was a beautiful looking living room, but everything looked... gigantic. The fancy closet you were sitting by towered over you like a skyscraper. It was then that you realized you were sitting in a small bird cage that, at your size, was roughly the size of a studio apartment. You sit there for a moment, thinking you must just be hallucinating. But as you take in your surroundings, you realize it was all very, very real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to stay calm. To occupy yourself, you grab the bars and push and pull on them with all your might. No give. You sigh, exasperated, as you sit against the wall of the cage and try to get your bearings. The memories of how you got here slowly came back to you, bit by bit. You curse yourself, silently. You should have never trusted her. Was there something in your tea that made you... shrink? You wouldn't be surprised. In a world of witchcraft and sorcery, you had come to expect things like this. Still, panic began to course through your veins, as it dawned on you how utterly helpless you were now. What did she have planned for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you heard the sound of loud footsteps coming from the hallway, signaling the now massive-seeming mare to emerge into the bedroom. She had apparently just gotten out of the shower. You turn to her, furious, only for your guard to be lowered when she drops her towel and you lay eyes on her now titanic naked body. You thought you would have gotten used to this by now. These anthropomorphic ponies were naturally beautiful beyond belief; even the average, run-of-the-mill pony mare was a supermodel by human standards\u2026 yet Rarity still managed to be something else entirely. Her slick, wet fur pressing against her impeccable hourglass figure and firm breasts made your heart skip a beat. This combined with her size relative to you made her appear like nothing less than some sort of goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat at a fancy purple dressing table and started to volumize and blow dry her mane. You had to clasp your hands over your ears, as the sound was deafening from your perspective. By chance, she glanced over to your cage, and saw you sitting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\u201cOh, you're finally awake! What a relief,\u201d</span> she smiled. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cI was worried you'd never wake up.\u201d</span> She rolls the wheeled chair over, opening up the top of the cage and gently taking you in her hands, before rolling her chair back to her dressing table. She sets you down on the table as she brushes her mane in the mirror- the rest of her fur being too fine to need grooming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat did you do? What is this?\u201d</b> you call, loudly enough for her to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\u201cIt's nothing personal. I just have a good operation going on here, and you ran in trying to mess it all up,\u201d</span> she chuckled. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cSo I needed to get you out of the way.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cGet me out of the way? Are you going to kill me?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\u201cHeavens, no! I'm not going to hurt you! You're just going to be my little pet until I've made enough bits to move to the next hold. It shouldn't be long, at this point.\u201d</span> She reassures you. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cThat is, if you behave. If you don't, I might just keep you at this size. You look cuter this way, anyway.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou can't do this!\u201d</b> You yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\u201cI'm not too happy that it came to this either, dear, but I'm afraid you forced my hand,\u201d</span> she explains, sounding remorseful. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cBut you will be treated well! You will not be considered a prisoner in my household, but a guest. An unwilling one, yes, but still!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer assurances understandably failed to satisfy you, and you grew increasingly frustrated. You didn't like feeling so helpless. But as a vagrant, you've spent your fair share of nights locked up in a cell before. At least this mare seemed a bit more amiable. You take a breath as you calm down, and decide to just roll with the punches. It's not like you had anything better to do, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSo what? You're just going to keep me in that cage over there for a week?\u201d</b> You murmur, pointing to the small bird cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\u201cNo, no! Well, maybe. I can carry you around with me as I work, if you want,\u201d</span> She offers, looking flushed. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cBut no, I can't let you just walk around freely, I'm afraid. You might run off, or get stepped on.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity stands from her seat, before pulling over a massive dresser and putting way too much thought into what she would wear for the day; deciding on an overly flashy dress, embellished with jewels, that only served to accentuate her curves and cleavage. Satisfied, she picked you up like a toy and placed you on her shoulder as she goes about her business for the day. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cI really apologize for all this, dear. Really. I know this is a terrible introduction to Ponyville. I feel awful,\u201d</span> She whispers. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cI just can't let anypony get in my way right now.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt's fine. I just never pegged you as the type of rogue work.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\u201cI'm not. But I need this to work out. I need the bits, not just for myself, but for my little sister,\u201d</span> she insists. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cFor her safety, and her future. I hope you understand.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a pony, she was not only naturally attractive but also naturally adorable. You just couldn't stay mad at that face. Besides, this wouldn't be the first time something like this happened to you. This isn't nearly as bad as that time that that unicorn mage accidentally turned you into a newt for a few hours.

You didn\u2019t know where anything was, or where to even start. Overwhelmed, you decided to start with the basics. You were hungry. You\u2019ve been on the train for a while, and you haven\u2019t eaten anything. You wandered around until you found somewhere to eat-- \u2018Sugarcube Corner\u2019, the sign outside said. You found that it was basically empty inside, save for two mares sitting at one of the booths, and another, older mare standing at the counter, who introduced herself as \u2018Mrs. Cake\u2019. As you were about to walk out of the bakery with a paper bag of fresh pastries, however, someone stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cHey! Are you the human?\u201d</span> You to see one of the mares eating at the restaurant tapping on your shoulder, looking excited upon seeing your face. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cIt is you! Wow! We didn\u2019t know you were going to stop by Ponyville. It\u2019s so good to meet you in person!\u201d</span> The enthusiastic mare said as she grabbed your hand, shaking it wildly, before practically dragging you back to her booth. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cHere, come sit with us!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down at a booth along with the two mares-- the enthusiastic one sitting next to you a mint green unicorn, and the mare sitting across from you a light yellow earth pony. It seems they both had already finished their meals, but were just hanging around the otherwise empty bakery, chatting. They were both topless, but at least they were wearing shorts. The former introduced herself as Lyra, and the latter Bon Bon. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSo how long do you think you\u2019re going to say out here, all the way in our little town of Ponyville?\u201d</span> Bon Bon asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cActually, I think this is the town where I\u2019m going to settle down. I\u2019m getting tired of wandering, y\u2019know?\u201d</b> You said, in between munching down on a donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cReally? Here? Great choice! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like it here,\u201d</span> Bon Bon says. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cDo you have any friends in town? Any place to stay?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI was thinking of just finding a cheap hotel to stay in for a few weeks while I scrounge up enough bits to rent an apartment or something,\u201d</b> You said, in between munching down on a donut. <b>\u201cI still have a few hundred bits from some odd jobs I did in Baltimare.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cYou can stay with us, if you want!\u201d</span> Lyra suggests, enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUmm\u2026 what?\u201d</b> You stutter, not expecting this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYeah, what? We don\u2019t even know him,\u201d</span> Bon Bon raises an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cThink about it! It\u2019d be so cool to have a human stay with us for a while. We could be the first to show him around Ponyville, and tell him about Equestrian society, and in return, he could tell us all about his planet, and his kind\u2019s powers, and we\u2019d be the first to ever know! Before the biologists, before the historians\u2026 this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!\u201d</span> Lyra continues to frantically suggest. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cWe have that one spare bedroom that hasn\u2019t been used in years. It\u2019s only going to be for a couple of weeks, right? While you get on your feet?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh\u2026 yeah, I guess.\u201d</b> You shrug, while Bon Bon continues looking skeptical, before even she just shrugs her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAlright, sure. He can stay at our place for a while. But you\u2019re the one that\u2019s going to keep an eye on him,\u201d</span> Bon Bon shrugs as she relents, knowing that she\u2019ll never hear the end of it if she doesn\u2019t. Lyra\u2019s eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cOh, yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you! This is going to be awesome!\u201d</span> Lyra practically cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNow hold on, hold on. He hasn\u2019t agreed to anything yet,\u201d</span> Bon Bon interrupts her. <span class=\"ctan\">\"So, \u2019Thomas\u2019. What do you think?\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

Quickly you run to the glass and lift it with both hands, which is about the size of a garbage can to you, and gently walk back along her mattress, careful to not spill any, but when you're back with Vinyl you heave its contents all over her face, some of it getting in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat does the trick as she yelps in surprised and shoots up from the bed, coughing loudly. Her blue mane is absolutely soaked, and as she looks about for what the hell that was she looks down at you and the empty glass, frowning angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, what the hay was that for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 8:45! I have a delivery to make in fifteen minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"8:45?\" She looks to her alarm clock, its reading blank, and then looks to the clock on her VCR, which makes her gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, Tom, I'm so sorry!\" She tosses off the blanket and runs to her bathroom, grabbing her shades off the nightstand. \"I'll drop you anywhere off on my way to the club!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me get the box on my van?!\" The box is almost as large as I am, a large sticker stating \"FRAGILE\" on the side. Vinyl walks out of the bathroom with a towel around her mane, still brushing her teeth as she fits the box onto my van's platform and latches it tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you headed?\"</span></div></div>",

She looks surprised before she can head back inside, till she looks down at you ducked on the ground next to a package and bike horn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's an earth pony with a brownish-gray coat and a long, silky black mane that trails down to her belt. You can't help but notice that she had a body very smilar to Vinyl's, with large, heavy breasts and a faint pudge in her hips and thighs, but is dressed in a white dress shirt, red waistcoat and black paints, whereas Vinyl would gladly walk around naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth was that all about?!\" She demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry, Miss!

You look down at your watch again and let out a sigh of relief: 8:59, with only fifteen seconds to spare. She keeps the box and lays the form down for you, sighing sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026I'm very sorry about that. I was just in the midst of practicing and thought you might have been some teenager running the streets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's alright. I was just in a bit of panic after my roommate slept in and couldn't let me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm just glad I didn't hurt you!\" She notes, smiling politely.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Octavia noticed your sad and melancholy expression and grew pensive, searching for any kind of solution that might help assist her new friend. A single idea kept popping to the forefront and no matter how many times she tried to shoo it away it kept reappearing. He would never go for something like that, would he? After all, they had only just met today, and she was a stranger to him. Granted, they had a mutual acquaintance in Vinyl Scratch (she would be loathed to call her a friend at this point), but that was only a tenuous connection at best. One thing was for certain: Octavia could not allow the human to continue cohabiting with Vinyl Scratch, that was a fate she would not wish on her worst enemy, no matter their size or shape. Welp, there's only one way to find out how he feels about it and that's asking him directly. Octavia cleared her throat.<br>\r\n\"(Your name), I've been thinking, how would you like to be my roommate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" You blinked on the sudden question that bought you back to reality. \"What do you mean by roommate? I'm already living with\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" She briskly said, not wanting to hear her name spoken once more. \"But you also mentioned that she was making you pay rent, which, I'm sorry to say it feels like a bit too much, considering your size and overall position doesn't require much to maintain. The fact that you somehow managed a job surprises me, but it puts you are in a position where you're likely to be exploited, which it's what I feel she is doing to you.\" You frowned upon hearing that but were still felt quite curious about what it was she was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet, you're offering me to become your roommate instead,\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, unlike with her, I'm not going to make you pay for living in the same roof.\"<br>\r\nA nice place to stay in the city, and at no charge whatsoever? It sounds like a pretty good deal. Almost too good in fact. Your dear old dad always used to say that everything has a price, and there's no such thing as a free lunch. For all you know, Octavia could be just as bad, if not worse than Vinyl, despite her calm and friendly demeanor. You didn't want your nice new friend to turn out like some psycho killer who likes to cook poor little humans into a tasty stew. \"Okay, what's the catch?\" Octavia blinked. \"Catch?\" You uncomfortably roll your shoulders back and pull your legs into a cross. \"You know, the catch. Why are you doing this? I know that anything good in life doesn't come for free so there must be some kind of angle you're working. So, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There is nothing I want from you other than your company.\" She smiles warmly \"I already have a sizeable income as part of Canterlot Royal Orchestra, so rent and taxes aren't a problem for me, neither yours. This house is big, even for me and I was even considering looking for a roommate before you come here. I have no devious intentions behind my offering other than to help you from that burden...\" She then thought of something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, if you are keen to earn your space, there is something you can help me with.\"<br>\r\n Octavia blushed. She couldn't believe what she was about to say and knew she was taking a big risk. \"I don't require any type of physical payment, and if you offered to pay any rent I would turn it down but... I do get lonely at times, and sometimes wish for a stallion to turn up to dote on. so If you choose to stay here with me, and let me pamper you, I'll take care of any needs you might have while staying here... and maybe a few of my own...\" she said in a not-so-subtle hinting manner.<br>\r\nIs.. she? Is she talking about exchanging sexual favors for rent? Is Octavia looking to become your sugar momma...?<br>\r\nYou blushed, unable to look her in the eyes. You remember Vinyl teasing the moment she accepted you to become her roommate, Of course, she was overtly conscious of her naked body affect on you, however, she was always really 'See and Touch but no action' girl, teasing you with her body but never really going beyond that. she sometimes allowed you to sleep on her tits but for that, she would make you pay extra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there is the thing about Equestria, their gender roles were reversed, meaning that females are the dominant gender here with ethics that are quite similar to the 50s gender's customs, here, Octavia Melody was giving the choice to become a 'Roommate with Benefits' with the only rent being sexual favors with no cost extra or anything of the sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... Well, I... um...\" You don't know how to answer. This was an entirely novel concept. You don't know whether to turn down the prospect on principle or leap at the opportunity. Were you on earth and in the shoes of the other gender this might be seen as an exploitative act and worthy of disgust and revulsion, but you're not a woman, and you are sure as hell not on earth anymore? Octavia seemed to grow worried by your long silence as she quickly amended, \"T-that is if you want to. You can still stay here free of charge, of course, I'm not going to change that. I just thought it would be... nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you respond?</span></div></div>",

Upon his arrival in this world, Jake was almost immediately captured and sent to a pet store. Here, humans were viewed as too weak to look after themselves, and so the ponies had <i>graciously </i>offered to look after them. It was treated as a great kindness, and even viewed that way by most of the native humans who were utterly devoted to their pony masters, not unlike dogs. Jake had been reluctant in the beginning, viewing this treatment as humiliating and dehumanizing. But, with time, has begrudgingly come to accept that ponies are pretty nice to their human pets, at least for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCase in point, after Jake finished musing over his place in the world, he pushed soft covers off of his naked form. Ponies were mostly nudist, only wearing clothes for special occasions, and so saw no reason to dress up their pets; well, except to show off. Jake stretched and made the short trek over to the \u2018wash room\u2019, a closed off area with a fully functioning sink and toilet. With his business done, he returned to the main area of his enclosure. It was a terrarium specially designed for humans with transparent plastic walls, running water, temperature control, an alarm system, and many other amenities for a pet human. At times it was still hard not to view this place as a prison, but at least it was a cozy one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came a stirring as Jake looked out onto the room of his owner and towards their bed. His master was waking up and would no doubt begin the day by greeting their pet. Who is Jake\u2019s owner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone in Ponyville or Canterlot?</span></div></div>",

The passengers of the ship crowd onto the deck, cheering as the great metropolis comes into view. The trip to Baltimare had been long and hard, the passengers having spent weeks confined in tiny cabins, but it was worth it. Baltimare was known as a city of opportunity; where even the least fortunate of ponies can come and eke out a new life for themselves. As the ship landed, many of the town\u2019s citizens came down to the docks to welcome the new arrivals; ponies who may one day be their friends or coworkers. For the poor immigrants from the far south, it was just the kind of paradise they imagined. They came in couples or families, having furniture hauled in by workers and carrying suitcases stuffed with money and clothing. And somewhere, lost among the crowd, was a quiet young mare carrying nothing but a cello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare slipped away from the crowd, not wanting to get caught up in the arrival celebration. She clutches her huge cello case as she winds through the crowd, trying not to make eye contact with the locals. She almost feels unworthy to be among them; embarrassed to be seen in public during the lowest point of her life. She had to get away from her hometown, somehow, before it all ended up killing her. She spent most of her bits buying a boat ticket that would take her as far away as possible. Everything and everyone she ever knew or loved, she had to leave behind. Her cello case was now her only real possession in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Baltimare was a city of opportunity. Thousands of down-on-their-luck ponies like her came here every year, or so the brochure claims. As she steps onto the bustling city streets, she thinks, surely this is her second chance? Surely, this is her chance to finally live the life she\u2019s always dreamed of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. Here\u2019s hoping she doesn\u2019t screw everything up this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***<br>\r\n<i>A few days later\u2026</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat staring at your heels, as water runs down your bare body. You shiver frightfully, clutching yourself futilely in the cold. You sat beneath a shred of cardboard in an alleyway, trying to shield yourself from the rain. Days ago, you had woken up in a strange land called Equestria, a fantasy world with a number of odd quirks. The people looked slightly different than normal, complete with tails, snouts and fur, and called themselves \u2018ponies\u2019. Despite these odd features, they all seem to be preternaturally attractive, the average \u2018mare\u2019 being a supermodel by human standards, which is further exacerbated by their penchant for walking around half-naked. But all of that isn\u2019t even the worst part; when you came to this world, you were shrunken to 4 inches in height! You considered yourself a laid-back kind of guy, but for your first couple of days in Equestria, you had been freaking out non-stop. You had always had a bit of phobia for things that were much larger than yourself, and these \u2018ponies\u2019 were over fifteen times your size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first pony you showed yourself to was a young mare that walked by the alleyway you lived in often. You had overheard her conversations, and found that she sounded nice. Maybe you had been worrying over nothing, you thought to yourself. Maybe these ponies really are nothing to be afraid of. So yesterday, you finally worked up the courage to step out and try to get her attention. But when she laid eyes upon you, she immediately let out a piercing squeal. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cEek! A bug!\u201d</b></span></font> she yelled, immediately pulling her foot up in the air. Before you could even register what was happening, you looked up to see her giant foot descending upon you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNo, no, wait!\u201d</i> You cried, as you jumped out of the way, only narrowly escaping being crushed under the mare\u2019s foot. You quickly ran back to your alleyway and hid, almost hyperventilating. That had been the scariest moment in your entire life! From then on, you had been particularly skittish\u2026 but things weren\u2019t working out very well. Your reduced size resulted in a reduced need for food, but you were still severely malnourished. Your clothes hadn\u2019t shrunk with you, so you had been completely naked in the cold of autumn. You didn\u2019t know how much longer you could go on like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the grey young mare who played the cello walked down the sidewalk in the rain, running an errand for her lord. She had immediately landed a job as a maidservant for a wealthy hierophant, who paid her just enough for her to survive on. The job was a bit soul-rending, especially because her real dream was to make money playing her cello, but she assured herself that it was only temporary. Besides, it felt good to finally feel self-reliant. As she walked, she caught a glimpse of something unusual out of the corner of her eye. She turned, to see a tiny creature squatting in an alleyway. At first, she thought it was some kind of insect, but quickly realized it was unlike any insect she had ever seen. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHm?\u201d</b></span></font> she vocalized, tilting her head curiously. This gets the critter\u2019s attention, and it quickly skitters away and hides. But the mare was too curious to simply let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed the critter curiously down the alleyway, trying to show that she was friendly and meant no harm. Eventually, they reached a dead end, and the mare knelt down and finally got a good look at the strange creature. It was the strangest animal she had ever seen! It looked like some kind of furless pony, about the size of a crayon. She marveled at the strange creature, until she realized that it was obvious afraid. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHey there, little guy,\u201d</b></span></font> she greeted in a calm tone, trying to show that she wasn\u2019t a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this may have been fun from the mare\u2019s perspective, from your point of view, this chase had been terrifying! You had darted down the alleyway as fast as you could when the mare spotted you, but you couldn\u2019t possibly outrun the massive giantess. Eventually, you had run into a dead end, and simply cowered in fear, expecting her to crush you into the ground. To your surprise, instead, the mare only calmly greeted you, in an almost motherly tone of voice. You looked up at her, apprehensively. This was the first time you\u2019ve ever seen a pony up close. She had a coat of grey fur that was as smooth as silk, a silver mane, and wore nothing but a pair of white panties. But the first thing your eyes were brought to were her bare breasts, which hovered inches away from your face. Even from an average perspective, they were large and pillowy; by from your shrunken perspective, they were humongous! They were almost bigger than you were! But you averted your gaze, trying not to anger her. <i>\u201cH-h-hello,\u201d</i> You stutter in response, afraid that any wrong word may be your last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOh! So you can talk? I\u2019ve never seen a critter like you before,\u201d</span></b></font> she smiled. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWhat kind of animal are you?\u201d</b></span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI-I\u2019m a human, I guess?\u201d</i> You say, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWhy, I\u2019ve never heard of 'humans',\u201d</b></span></font> she says, intrigued. She had met other bipedal, talking animals, like cows and horses, but she had never met one that was so tiny. <b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cAre humans native to Baltimare?\u201d</span></font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want to lie to her, but you figured if you told her the truth about where you came from, she might freak out. <i>\u201cUh\u2026 yeah, I was born in Baltimare. In a human village.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWell, that explains it then! Sorry, I\u2019m new to this city,\u201d</b></span></font> she said, standing tall and folding her arms, looking genuinely exciting to be meeting a new creature. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m Octavia. What\u2019s your name, little guy?\u201d</b></span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cUh\u2026 Thomas.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cEnchant\u00e9,\u201d</b></font></span> she greets, but her curiosity continues. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWell, what happened to your village?\u201d</b></span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cSomeone came and stepped on them all,\u201d</i> you make up a fake story on the spot, trying to make her feel sympathy for you. <i>\u201cI was the only one that got away.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile immediately faded, and she reeled back and gasped at your story, startling you. You had expected to garner some sympathy, but you didn\u2019t expect her reaction to be that extreme! <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh! That\u2019s horrible!\u201d</b></span></font> she says, looking heartbroken. <span class=\"clgrey\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cWho could do such a thing? And now you\u2019re just here, alone, in the rain?\u201d</b></font></span> You nod, giving her the saddest look you could manage. You expected that ponies would just try to squish you, but so far, this mare seemed genuinely kind. She thought for a moment, before her warm smile returns. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cTell you what! You can live with me for a little while, until we find you a new human village,\u201d</b></span></font> she offers. <span class=\"clgrey\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cBeats sleeping in the rain, right?\u201d</b></font></span> You were immediately taken aback. You hadn\u2019t anticipated this. You were about to decline, but your grumbling stomach reminded you of your predicament. You didn\u2019t think you could survive much longer on your own at this size. You still didn\u2019t fully trust this mare, but she may be your best bet.</span></div></div>",

Of course, that thought didn't keep him from almost tripped a step or two as he rose his head to took in the ornate rooftops of the country's capital, much like any other person stepping in from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering buildings all around him were all made from varying shades of the purest of marble marble, each one like a miniature castle that was shielded by weathered purple shingles and embroidered with shimmering gold. Even the air felt expensive as he took in a long, relishing breath; it felt filtered, sort of like how bottled water tasted. He took the next step, then kept on going, his head turning every which way as he took in the lore of one of the most expensive cities to ever exist on the planet, the one that he'd be one of the absolute rare few to call his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Looks like something out of a </i>satire... Tom thought wistfully. Something that a poor artists would draw up to poke fun at the upper 1%: just ponies wearing waistcoats, top hats, dresses, and ridiculously pampered hairstyles, all pointing their noses at the sky as they droned on in jargon that he could vaguely tell was about some big business talk or popular socialite affairs. He was quick to feel out of place from all the noble men, having decided on a plaid shirt, black jeans, and a skipped shaving job to get ready for the day, and many of the ponies actually gave a double take as they noticed him sightsee their way, eyeing him like he was a dirty smudge on a marble countertop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, it was probably the size difference. <i>Definitely, </i>to be realistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, like something out of some ridiculous political cartoon, Tom only stood tall enough to stand at eye level with the citizens' waists, providing him with plenty of bare butts to drink in. <i>Tons</i> of them, and literally so, always quaking about as their owners weight sent faint tremors through the ground beneath their hoofsteps, some so welled that they could've plugged up a garage door. No matter where he was, Tom couldn't go ten feet without hearing some rampant chewing nearby, even if he wasn't walking near any of the overstuffed restaurants and cafes infesting the city, with ponies walking around carrying around enough food to serve an entire party a three course meal, eating with forks and napkins like they were at the dining table. They were all clean and well groomed, Tom was quite thankful form, but he found himself pulling his arms in along his sides as he walked between some of the fattest ponies he'd never imagined being as big as they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around him, there wasn't a stomach that didn't reach the ground, hanging in front of its owner like overblown weather balloons that were all plush with fur and paunch, often looking like they were ready to pop with a red burn forming at the front as the pony stuffed him or herself to their absolute limit. Whether it was just a popular sense of fashion, or because there simply wasn't enough cloth in the world left over to completely cover them up, he couldn't tell, but there wasn't a single pony in sight who wore a pair of pants, with most of their semi or bare naked bodies drooping down far enough to effectively censor out their genitals, not that it made Tom's blush soften out any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled to keep his mind focus over the heat burning in his mind, and tapped a mare on the shoulder. \"Excuse me, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" The mare glanced over, then scuttled around to face him, dragging her stomach around over the brick ground and leaning down enough to see him over its massive curve, smiling politely. \"Yes, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled a slip of paper from his pocket, handing it to her. \"Would you happen to know which way I could find this address?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over the area written down, turned her eyes up in thought, then pointed down a nearby street. \"Just go down that way, then turn right down the first block. You should easily see it from there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" He nodded back, hoisting his bags up again and navigating around the bulbous population towards his location, the spot that would represent the rest of his life.</span></div></div>",

The palace of polished white marble and ivory towers went up so high it looked as if it was trying to pierce the sky. Tom smiled and quickened his pace towards the castle proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe road to this new Canterlot life had not been an easy one. Cooking has always been Tom\u2019s number one passion, and paid for his skill and experience with his own sweat and tears. Ever since he was a little kid, he was enamored by the high life of Canterlot, and he dreamed of getting to cook for the Royal Princesses. Top of his class at Culinary School, praised in magazines and newspapers for his innovative recipes and approach to cooking, he had won the attention of not only Canterlot\u2019s high society, but Celestia and Luna themselves. It was them that asked for Tom to be the head chef, and he graciously accepted. His hard work had finally paid off. He had gotten his dream job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom had arrived at the large, wooden doors of the main Castle entrance. Even the ornate, decorated wood looked like it could pay off his student debt. The doors themselves were guarded by two guards to each side, dressed in golden, roman styled armor that made room for their gigantic, bulbous stomachs that grazed onto the ground heavily. He stopped in front of one if the guards, but had to cough to get his attention. The guard looked down past the horizon of his stomach and move back a little to see him better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdentification, please.\u201d The guard ordered in a no nonsense manner, which was to be expected from his line of work. Tom fished out his paperwork and handed it to the guard, who had to squint to read the tiny print properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...wait a second, are you really the new head chef?\u201d The guard looked over the papers again in astonishment, not actually believing the official stamp at the bottom by Celestia herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, thats me! Hehe\u2026\u201d Tom chuckled nervously, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. His forced smile faded as the guard began to glare daggers at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not what I was expecting\u2026\u201d the guard growled in a low voice, almost sounding angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-o-oh\u2026\u201d Tom felt like he shrank under the harsh stare of the Royal Guard. \u201cWere you expecting...is it because I\u2019m a human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The guard\u2019s threatening stare was halted in it\u2019s tracks. \u201cN-no! I just thought that all chefs dressed in those funny white outfits and stuff!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I\u2019m sorry! I just thought that...it doesn't matter, I shouldn't have judged.\u201d Tom felt his initial fear from the guard now swell up with embarrassment. He hadn't even stepped in the castle yet, and things were already starting on a bad foot. He had heard rumors about ponies being extremely bigoted towards human because they felt superior to them in every way. Probably should have left those rumors at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, uh...here\u2019s your papers\u2026\u201d The guard quickly gave Tom\u2019s papers back to him and produced a key practically out of thin air. That armor didn\u2019t look like it had any pockets. The key went into the castle lock and opened the massive doors for Tom. More than eager to leave that awkward scene behind, he race-walked into the castle as the doors shut behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of Canterlot Castle was even more decadent and beautiful than the outside. Beautiful tapestries and stained glass windows lined the walls, while priceless artifacts were placed on top of ornate pedestals. Tom felt that just being in the room brought down the face value of everything by a large margin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom did not exactly know where to go from there as he stranded in the foyer of the Castle. The instructions that was given to him when he got the job was to \u2018head inside and wait\u2019. Tom wondered if someone put a lot of effort into making that message as vague as possible. Soon however, a voice called out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to Canterlot Castle, Thomas Knox~\u201d. He looked up to the top of the foyer stairwell to see who was calling him, to find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thomas \u2018Tom\u2019 Knox expected some sort of greeting from someone when he entered the Canterlot Castle. He had no information on where to go, so it was entirely justified to think that someone might be there to help him find his way around. Yet even though she was his direct employer, he had never thought that he would meet Princess Celestia so soon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they're she was at the top of the foyer staircase, in all her stunning glory and beauty. Like all the other Ponies in Canterlot, she was fat and naked from the waist down, yet compared to them they might as well be considered twigs. Her incredibly hefty upper half was stuffed into a form fitting tube top with matching jacket colored gold and white that did absolutely nothing to cover up her monumental chest, with snow furred cleavage spilling out as her thick arms and meaty shoulders framed it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by no means did it hide her very considerable paunch, like a gelatin filled wrecking ball in swayed back and forth from the slightest movement of her frame. And Tom had noticed, to put it in a more gentle sense, that her bottom half was just as impressive, with hips as possibly even wider and thicker than her substantial bosom, flaring out from her fleshy thighs. And although Tom could not properly see it from the angle he was at, he imagined that her rear end was quite the sight as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it this is your first proper visit to Canterlot?\u201d The solar princess giggled as she noticed the diminutive human ogle at her frame. \u201cMost tourists have the same reaction when I walk outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that he was staring, Tom immediately blushed a deep shade of red and averted his gaze, despite how much room she took up in his peripheral vision. \u201cI-I-I...forgive me, your majesty. Yes, this is the first time I have ever seen...Canterlot.\u201d Tom was about to say \u2018such fat Ponies\u2019, but decided against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, it can be a lot to take in at once.\u201d Celestia began to descend down the stairwell towards her new personal cook. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you have noticed this by now, but the people here... like myself, tend to \u2018go big or go home\u2019, so to speak\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, that certainly seems to be the case\u2026\u201d Tom stutterd as he eyed his employers frame wobble back and forth, back and forth as she continued to climb down the stairs, closing the distance between him and her faster than he would like. \u201cIn any case, I am deeply honored that you have hired me as your new personal chef. I promise you that I will not-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was cut off as Celestia breathe out a heavy sigh, not one out of frustration or annoyance, but genuine contentedness and relaxation. \u201cOh, Tommy. Please, I get enough of that stuffy talk from the nobles. If you want to show your gratitude for your recent hiring, than I would encourage you to stop kissing my butt and talk to me like a normal pony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas was a tad floored. He was expecting their to be a strict no nonsense policy for talking to Celestia in person. To be honest, he had built her image in his head to be a bit different than what he was seeing. He had thought that the Solar Princess would be... more above, him at the very least. Yet here she was, talking to him directly, seeming to have been waiting on him to arrive, into presenting an aura of high class, but rather... maternity and warmth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... I was secretly hoping you would say something like that.\u201d Tom sheepishly admitted as he rubbed the back of his head nervously. \u201cI\u2019m afraid royal etiquette isn't one of my strong suits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI envy you. I happen to be incredibly versed in the rules \u2018royal etiquette\u2019, and I pay the price every single morning when those pompous fools come to tell me how to do my job.\u201d Celestia shook her head disdainfully, but quickly swept it aside. \u201cBut enough about that. Here, let me show you the way to you new room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia hopped off the stairs with a heavy thud that slightly shook the floor, at least for Tom. She made a gesture with her hands for the human to follow her, and began to walk. Tom jumped a little in his shoes and made a quick dash to catch up with her. Even if she was the size and width of most of the buildings from his village, she still walked with a long stride that he struggled to keep up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about yourself, Tommy.\u201d Celestia urged as she and him entered a hallway. Now that she had turned around, Tom could get a good view of her backside. Each cheek on her glorious backside was like a novelty, overstuffed yoga ball, and swayed to and fro like the pendulum of a clock. \u201cI can\u2019t stand talking about myself for very long, and I always enjoy hearing about other people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I suppose there isn't really much to say.\u201d Tom speedwalked as Celestia lazily sauntered. \u201cI grew up in Manburgh, a little town in northern Vanhoover, where my parents taught me how to cook. They reasoned that instead of buying a cake for my birthday, I could make it instead. That way it would taste better because I made it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd did it, in the end?\u201d Celestia inquired, slowing down her pace a little bit so that her cook could keep up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom laughed to himself. \u201cOh good lord, no. It was an utter disaster of a desert. Burnt on some edges, unbaked on the rest. Icing with more wrinkles than a leather coat\u2026But after I was done eating it-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ate that mess?!\u201d Celestia tried to stifle a laugh of her own, but failed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes I know. My parents were and are very frugal when it comes to food in the house. Everything must go in the end. SO after I choked it down, I decided that I could do better. So I tried making another cake, and than another, and so on and so forth, until I finally thought I came up with a cake that would be worthy of my birthday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on.\u201d Celestia stopped in her tracks and turned around to face her cook. \u201cIs this the origin story of your famous \u2018See-thru cakes\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt...may be.\u201d Tom responded with a hint of coyness in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose cakes have caused quite the stir around here in Canterlot you know.\u201d Celestia resumed her walking. \u201cAll the culinary schools and celebrated chefs can\u2019t tell if a cake without frosting on the sides is a stroke of genius or an abomination.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the frosting hides what\u2019s on the inside of the cake!\u201d Tom walked a bit faster to get by her side, which was no easy task since she took up most of the hallway alone. \u201cYou should be able to see all the layers, all the spongy bread. People spend so much time sculpting the icing that they miss out on presenting the actual cake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whatever people think of it, you should know that it was that cake that got you this job.\u201d Celestia turned a corner as she neared Tom\u2019s new room. Me and Luna were sampling pastries at a top notch baking contest a few months back, when the two of us saw your little cake on a sad little table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that would be my parent\u2019s work.\u201d Tom chuckled. \u201cThey went in my place to enter in that silly thing. They love me, but won\u2019t spend more than a hundred bits for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia giggled. \u201cWell, frugality aside, we were floored by your entry and decided to look into you. We actually had a bit of a fight over whose chef you would get to be; mine or Luna\u2019s. Ah, here we are, your new home away from home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia stopped in front of the door to Tom\u2019s room, and opened the doors for you to see inside...</span></div></div>",

To say nothing of the massive, spanning bed in the corner, a spacious fireplace nestled in the corner, and a wide, widescreen tv as slick as a piano\u2019s sheen on the wall, it looked like a room more \u201caverage\u201d for Celestia herself, let alone just the human in charge of her comfort food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsider it your home just as much as the one you were born in.\u201d She decreed in the most kind, welcoming tone she could\u2019ve carried. \u201cWelcome to Camelot, Tom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, I...thank you, thank you!\u201d He wanted to leap up and hug her mostly naked bulk as hard as he could, but the guards that followed her to the room served as a healthy reminder to keep in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Tom, I wouldn\u2019t call myself a fair and just ruler if I knew some of my subjects were enduring any expense that I myself didn\u2019t face. That being said, however...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a glow of her horn, the doors of the rooms slammed. Sealed off from the hardened gaze of her bodyguards, Celestia let her smile become a little more wry, and she squeezed her stomach with both hands, pushing it out more in Tom\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d She lead on. \u201cIt\u2019d be unhealthy if you held it in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom didn\u2019t register her words at first, the extra layer of perfection too much for him to comprehend, but it wasn\u2019t long before he followed with a gleeful squeal and leapt up with impressive height to latch onto her belly, her plush, fuzzy blubber and fragrant-smelling fur all the more comforting as she observed with a cutesy giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nuzzled into her fur with a wavy grin, but his eyes shot open before he leapt off and stood straight giving a salute. \u201cPrincess, you have my word that not an ounce of your kindness won\u2019t be paid back in full. I hereby swear that any bite you take from my kitchen won\u2019t be anything short of the best you\u2019d ever had!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia was scared to speak at the risk of bursting out in laughter, but played along and bowed her head. \u201cAt ease, chef Thomas. Now, go on with your own affairs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye aye, Ma\u2019m!\u201d He returned, spinning one one foot to march off to the other rooms, not breaking formation till he\u2019d shut the door behind him and was out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, man...\u201d Tom moaned, splashing the sink\u2019s water onto his face for the eighth time in a row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d never been in a bathroom for more than an hour before, and outside, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to get caught by a some noble fawning over the clean water like some filthy peasant, but he couldn\u2019t remember touching water that felt so clean with his hands before, nor something as expensive-tasting that wasn\u2019t from a bottle. He was certainly thankful that Celestia was long gone; he couldn\u2019t imagine explaining to her why the toilet was flushed right times in a row, outside of merely telling her that it sounded amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, of course, didn\u2019t make his duties any less important, he reminded himself. After finally shaking his hands dry, wiping them off with the hand towel, and folding it back up as nicely as he could, he straightened out his posture and marched over to the door, stepping back out into the bedroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know, the toilet has a very nice flush to it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and was treated with his majesty herself, her gargantuan, sun-decorated behind sat naked on top of two of the room\u2019s largest tables, bowing beneath her mass as she did her makeup in the room\u2019s beauty mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Princess?\u201d Even if he\u2019d met her not an hour ago, the fact that he was meeting her twice so suddenly seemed...odd. \u201cDid you need forget something, or anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked her eyelids, wearing a ruby-red shade of eyeshadow, and smiled to his reflection. \u201cNot right now. But thank you, Thom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...you\u2019re sure? You didn\u2019t have anything more important to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia finished up her eyeliner, but turned to him, frowning. \u201c...you don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m here, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-oh, <i>no!!!</i>\u201d Tom spat out, hoping he didn\u2019t just throw his life\u2019s work out in less than a day of claiming it. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome here any time, Princess! I was just... well, curious as to why you\u2019re more interested in my room, and not...yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Celeste gave the smile of somebody reaching the punchline to a really good joke. \u201cThis <i>is</i> my room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...heh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia rose off the tables, the ones that Thom only then realized weren\u2019t tables; they were a pair of stools, each one severely undersized in containing her behemothic asscheeks in tandem, but due to soon be overwhelmed in containing just <i>one</i> on each, as well. \u201cCake may not be my main source of sustenance, Tom, but you have to understand that when you have to stave off the nobles of Canterlot for a life as long as mine, you most certainly need it, and at a moment\u2019s notice. You\u2019d agree it makes sense, thus, to have my chef at my hand whenever I\u2019d need him, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe, but...what?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, I suppose I wouldn\u2019t immediately see it at first, either, but no matter.\u201d She pondered, shaking her head before narrowing her eyes on him. She smiled, but it wasn\u2019t the loving kind whenever she mingled with her subjects...then again, it wasn\u2019t particularly intimidating, either. Maybe it was the makeup doing its work, but with what little comprehension Tom had of the scene, it seemed hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess with everything, it takes time.\u201d She surmised, sauntering over to the bed with her tail swishing about more than usual, catching a stray glance at his chin with the tip of one of its locks. Only when she was at the bed did he internally damn itself that it was tailored to somebody of her immensity, but even the bed wasn\u2019t a match for her size when she sat upon the pillows and allowed her paunch to sag naturally, hips pouring over to rest upon the floor and swallow the bed frame from existence, whilst her legs opened up to let her stomach hang outwards as far as possible, its footprint along the floor extending out well over an extra length of the entire bed, totally consuming any trace there even was one in the room to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut enough of that.\u201d She continued. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s best to ease you into your duties, then...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom pinched himself to make sure that he was still in the plane of reality and not some dream. Up until now, the first half of his first day as Princess Celestia\u2019s Chef had gone \u2018according to plan\u2019. He arrived in Canterlot, he made his way into Equestria\u2019s Great Castle, he got to know his new boss, and settled into his room. Now, only half an hour past noon, he found out that he was getting settled into HER room, and her semi-nude body was put on display for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to move his legs, towards or away from Celestia he didn\u2019t know, but found that they were stuck. Try as he might he couldn't will himself to do anything more than stand like a blushing idiot ogling the Solar Princess. Celestia, ever perspective, noticed this and gave out an amused giggle in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear, me. It appears that my little cook has plastered his feet to my floor~.\u201d She gave a low chuckled as his blush intensified a few shades darker. He hanged his head down in shame, not knowing what exactly he was doing wrong, but convinced nonetheless. Before he could think of an apology for...whatever was happening, out of nowhere he began to feel lighter. Tom looked up from where his shoes met each other to see Celestia\u2019s horn glowing...as well as the rest of his body. \u201cAn easy fix\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom tried and failed to stifle a yelp of surprise as he found himself weightless, suspended in midair. Not particularly used to the sensation, he flailed around the air like a rag-doll, much to his princesses entertainment. He found himself moving, but couldn't exactly see where to. It was not until he was safely deposited on the top of Celestia\u2019s white, fuzzy wrecking ball of a stomach that he found out too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I was seriously considering having you make me a few dozen cakes to start off with, test the water a bit. But it would have been too long to wait for.\u201d Celestia smiled to her human cook past the horizon of her cleavage. Meanwhile, Tom was confused, perplexed, and lost about what was going on. Although being confused was a much better alternative to being afraid, and being on top of the most powerful pony in history while she looked at you hungrily would give one plenty to be afraid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-p-p-princess Celestia, what exactly is...happening right now?\u201d Tom stuttered a question out, to which Celestia simply leaned her head back against a pillow and smiled even harder. \u201cAre y-y-you sure you\u2019re not hungry? I think I know my way around the kitchens now, and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhh\u2026\u201d Celestia softly silenced him, rendering Tom mute, yet still fidgety. \u201cThere is nowhere else you should be right now than here, Tommy. What\u2019s happening, you ask? Well...and this is a bit of a state secret\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sat up a little bit to get a better look at Tom, preferably down on him, while she moved her arms behind him to slowly push him by force into an embrace against the fabric of her tube-top, breast fat spilling out like a muffin cooking in an oven. \u201c...I have a \u2018thing\u2019 for humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thing? What does that mean? A thing is an object that takes up space, something you could interact with. A commodity, an article of something that you can hold. But Tom saw no things between him and Celestia\u2019s piercing, smiling gaze. All he could see was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoooooohhhhh\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom went pale as he finally comprehended the painfully obvious fact that he was in the embrace, resting on top of the fuzzy, pillowy stomach, and brushing against the wobbling pair of tits, of the Solar Princess Celestia of Equestria. To see his following reaction made her week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something the matter, Mr. Knox?\u201d Maneuvering her hands and placing them on his, guiding them towards what her tube top couldn't conceal. \u201cAre you not someone I should be having a \u2018thing\u2019 for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to her surprise, Tom wiggled his hands out of her grasp before he could make contact with her chest, and than tried to scoot back away from it as far as he could against her strong arms. \u201cYES! I mean, no! I mean...what I mean is...I think this a honestly a dream come true for me, honest! But...we just met! And--\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you afraid of me, my little human?\u201d Celestia spoke in a quiet and soft voice that shut Tom up immediately. He could offer no response other than shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...oh sweetie\u2026\u201d Celestia angelic voice rang out softly. It made Tom feel warm inside and reminded him of home. Suddenly, he felt the familiar aura from her horn surround him as he went weightless in the air once again. The Princess wanted to change positions to fraternize better with her cook. She placed Tom\u2019s body down just underneath her pillow, unable to move. She than rested her body back, but this time laying on her stomach, trapping him under her whether he wanted it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Tom, it felt both terrifying and amazing to have Celestia\u2019s body pressed up against him so tightly. Despite having difficulty breathing, there was no pain in the squeezing at all. Just...more softness and fuzziness. Her huge and sparkling magenta eyes stared into his as she spoke softly. \u201cWhy are you scared of me, my little chef? Have I been mean in the short time you\u2019ve been here? Have I ever...hit you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No, of course not!\u201d Tom firmly, if not a bit hesitant, stated. \u201cI\u2019ve only been working here for less than a day, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful for letting me be here, to talk to you and be with you! But...you\u2019re Celestia, the Pony so powerful you can control the sun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true. I can also control the moon, make entire armies fall to my will by telekinesis, nullify other ponies magic, and have lived far longer than any other of my species save for my sister. But that doesn't answer my question.\u201d She added, raising an eyebrow at you, genuinely perplexed. \u201cDo you really think I would go out of my way to hurt you? Are you walking on eggshells around me because you don\u2019t want to risk my wrath?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom opted to say nothing, but the eyes are the window to the soul, and his gave all the answers Celestia needed. Her eyes widened in shock at the revelation. \u201cYou poor human...I want you to listen to me close. As long as you are here in this castle, you will not suffer any harm, not from me or anyone else.\u201d She paused and gave the small cook beneath her a lick-kiss, tickling him slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not some out of her mind bored deity that could flip at a moments notice. Look at my eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom worked up the valor to obey and worked his point of view to Celestia\u2019s face, her hungry smile still they're, but mixed with the love and compassion she showed before. Her eyes only showed kindness. \u201cAre you still afraid of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Celestia smirked. \u201cNow...are you ready to praise the sun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nodded his head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As if that one sinful thought was enough to rapture her pure soul from the world, Tom felt the pressure on his chest leap off of his form, his lungs filling back up as he loudly took in a breath of air, only to inhale and coughing on the fibers of Celestia\u2019s tube top as the now-empty shirt flopped onto his body. Startled, confused, and choking for air, Tom scrambled out from the collar and stared at the flattened shirt laid on the bed, jarringly absent of any means of hiding a fat, twenty-foot tall princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just met Princess Celestia, then be wooed by Princess Celestia, and then see her spontaneously disappear when she was laying right on top of him, he found himself doubting her claims that she wasn\u2019t a bored diety looking for fun and daintily opened the collar to her shirt, hoping he\u2019d find some clue to what was going on, that everything would all make perfect, logical sens-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Gotcha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his eyes could adjust to see the source, a skinny pair of white arms snapped out from inside of the shirt and yanked him in by the shoulders, their spindly nature betrayed by their strength as Tom squeaked upon being thrown back-first onto the mattress, a set of hands clamping around his biceps and holding him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something poke at the tip of her nose, but he couldn\u2019t even see what it was until he\u2019d blinked a few times, seeing those kind, soft eyes of Celestia\u2019s but inches away as she touched her muzzle up against his face, a romantic pink glow cast on them by light bleeding through her tube top. Looking down,Tom could see her body was equally famished and a foot or so shorter than his was, giving her a flat chest and gaunt abdomen that supplied everything he couldn\u2019t see before when she was at full size, from her soft pink nipples to the ruby red lips of her vulva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting Tom to reason his way out, Celestia closed the distance between them and nestled on top of his chest, shedding any hope in his mind that the princess only saw him as just a friend or equal when she wormed her arms under his back and kissed him on the lips. Gently at first, a serene, delicate contact that\u2019d be common on a first date, but then she forced her tongue through her lips, spit mixing with spit as Tom merely laid there with his jaw slack and unblinking eyes drying up, unable to move, aside from grazing his arm up and down over her back, acknowledging that Equestria\u2019s immortal, all-loving ruler was on top of him and marking her territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when TOm felt a sudden draft on his back, air rushing in as Celestia worked her arms under his shirt to pull it off that he gagged and pushed her off of him. The princess gave a yelp in response, more out of surprise than pain, but gave Tom enough of a window to escape and leap back out from he shirt\u2019s collar, breathing heavily and delirious as what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Tom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her voice, it gave him the mind to run and escape, to gather up some witnesses to hear what happened, but instead, Tom looked back, and all those urges fled. Instead of seeing anger, lust, or even surprise from Celestia, she looked absolutely terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid...did you not want me to do that?\u201d She whimpered so quietly, and breathing so heavily it was as if she\u2019d forgotten all her years of diplomacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelestia, I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears formed in her eyes, too ashamed to raise her head as she stumbled away, unable to look at him. \u201cTom...I\u2019m so sorry, I promise I won\u2019-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then it was Celestia\u2019s turn to gag when Tom\u2019s mouth impacted hers like a meteor from the heavens. She struggled to keep up with the same vigor and passion she\u2019d been dealing out herself when the lowly assistant she\u2019d try to take paid her with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut TOm quickly remembered just who the strongest was when he was forcibly spun onto his back, Celestia arched over his form whilst breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRule number one of the castle:\u201d She spoke hoarsely. \u201cI am <b><i>NEVER</i></b> the one on the bottom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time around, she didn\u2019t even bother giving him the chance of letting him unclothed himself and tore his shirt from his body, but he eagerly responded by undoing his pants and tossing them and his underwear aside, his member long erect by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping her arms around Tom\u2019s back, her hands grabbing his shoulders, Celestia parted her legs and mounted himself upon his shaft, a throaty hum emanating from her neck that tickled at his skin.

Each pound came heavier than the next, shaking up his bones, but the blood rampaging in his veins gave him a rush of power he\u2019d never expected before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but then his breathing ached, mired by a great pressure on his chest.The tightness moved to his neck, then around his chin, and Tom\u2019s eyes shot open to see Celestia\u2019s face past the cleavage of a returning set of breasts. She was bigger: not her old size, obviously, but her face looked much more full after having grown another few feet, putting her around nine in height, and those once starved mammaries of hers has blossomed into a pair of white yoga-sized orbs resting on his chest with enough pressure that her nipples felt like a set of fist being jabbed into his shoulders, his face wedged in enough cleavage to feel the milk churning around inside through his cheeks. He could feel her stomach resting on his torso as well, much more stout and round, whilst enough thighfat bulged out at either side of her for him to see her cutie marks past her shoulders, her body arched up to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsk me to get bigger...\u201d She panted, sporting a wild smile that almost showed no qualms of continuing if he took back consent. \u201cNo...<i>beg</i> me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...\u201d Tom squeaked with what little air he could take in. \u201cBigger...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...who are you speaking to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy g-goddess...\u201d He obeyed, both playfully and wanting to see how far the rabbit hole went. \u201cPlease, give me <i>more...</i></span></div></div>",

In almost an instant, she grew even larger and more bloated with fat. \u201cBut I\u2019ve already given you so much...are you sure you can take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Tom cried with more volume in his voice than he anticipated, the immense pleasure in his groin wracking his body. The rational part of his brain may have been trying to warn him that no, in fact he could not take it. But even if it were, it would be drowning in a sea of endorphins. \u201cI...I need it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solar princess chuckled dainty and leaned down between her breasts to plant a sloppy lick-kiss on Tom\u2019s red face. \u201cAs you wish, my subject.\u201d With that, the assault continued in earnest. With each thrust each passionate buck of the hips, her form grew taller and wider, fatter and softer. Each hump added more tight pressure on the human\u2019s body, his face moving away from it\u2019s spot underneath as her belly greedily swallowed up his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hurt, there was no doubt about it...but never to the point where he felt he was in danger. Instead, he felt safe, the overwhelming ecstasy running up and down his body being equally countered by his nerve endings relaxing under the numbing pain. It was almost like a hug...if only more passionate. Tom didn't know this, but this was also due to a spell Celestia put on him when he wasn't looking. As her body gained more weight, his body gained more durability, making sure her little cook would be as snug as a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCe...celestiaaaaa!\u201d Tom moaned, fighting off the encroaching flab trying to enter his mouth as he spoke. Tom could feel it building up, his high water mark, and he wasn't sure if he could hang in for much longer. \u201cI\u2019m gonna...I...I\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhh\u2026\u201d Tom\u2019s Goddess silenced the muffled voice underneath her tons of blubber. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, my little human. You\u2019ve been doing so well, don\u2019t stop the show just yet. Five more measly minutes, that\u2019s all...and if you make it that long, I\u2019ll give you a reward~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom obeyed Celestia and bit down on his lower lip hard, almost enough to draw blood. The sensations, the agony, the raw joy was too much to take in. But...It was his first day on the job.Is that how he wanted to put himself forward to his boss, his princess? No, he would grin like the dopey chef he was and keep it in, for his job...and for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five agonizing minutes that felt more like hours of this blue balling, Tom had reached his absolute limit. With total absence of any dignity and/or shame, Tom let out a lion\u2019s roar into fuzzy fat as he released into his Princess. Celestia grinned harder then she had ever done in decades as her human reached his finale. With a contented sigh, she rolled over on her bed, giving Tom some much needed fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my\u2026\u201d Celestia observed Tom\u2019s naked form gasp for breath as he panted in his own sweat. \u201cYou should be proud of yourself, Tom. Not many last that long, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank...you\u2026\u201d Tam wheezed, choosing his words carefully during exhales as he felt the life giving air rush into his rapidly re-inflating lungs. \u201cThat means...a lot...since it...was my first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia eyes widened a little in shock, but her smile didn't diminish in the slightest. \u201cWell, now you\u2019re just showing off.\u201d She giggled, earning a tired chortle from her chef. \u201cNow...I did promise a reward, didn't I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom didn't have the strength to be surprised when he felt Celestia leviatet his body towards her face. She was back to her old height, big enough for his body to be saely perched on the top of her chest. He did, however, have the strength to let out a high pitched squeal as he felt something lukewarm and gooey lap over his tired muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm\u2026\u201d Celestia pured, relishing in the taste. \u201cI wouldn't expect anything less from Equestria\u2019s best cook.\u201d Tom just layed there, arms spread out on either side of him, his body sinking into the milk sloshing orbs as his new boss cleaned him off. All the while he had a smile on his face that made him look like he was the luckiest human in the world, which may just be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia gave Tom one last, teasing lick and let her pink tongue slurp back into her mouth. She gave out an admittedly cute yawn and leaned back into her bed. \u201cWhen you wake up, I expect you to make me a dinner that will blow me away, understand? Not that you haven\u2019t already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nodded, his smile still plastered to his face. With an amused giggle, Celestia effortlessly pushed her human with her right index finger down the impossibly soft crevice of her chest. In an instant he was engulfed in a world of comfort, two milk filled pillows squishing him to sleep on either side of his tired body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t stay awake even if he tried.</span></div></div>",

Snooty teachers chastising him for the most basic of mistakes, angry customers, maybe a few rounds of initiation from his neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom mentally scolded himself for not putting \u2018greeted by the chaos god\u2019 on his list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother mix of fake-French chortling and utterings of \u2018croissant\u2019 and \u2018fromage\u2019 rang out from a multicolored blob from the end of the room past its staircase, spilling from a white chef\u2019s costume that adhered to it\u2019s owners circumference and various rolls akin to how a wetsuit would. It was about twenty-something times as much Discord as Thom expected him to be, history having written him so often as some skinny, agile buffoon who could swim though the air like some eel in water, but here before Thom now, he possessed an immensity that gave his noodle-like form much more definition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefined, that is, by canyon-sized dimples in the elbows of bingo wings hanging off his shoulders with the weight of train cars, a set of bitch-tits that Celestia\u2019s own lardiness would desire to own, capping a mammoth of a belly whose all-encompassing expanse proceeded his entire figure in a spheric landmass of brown engulfing part of the staircase, blemished by copious rolls along its diameter and creases where its mass doubled in on its self, and an outright titan of an ass sagging out from either side of him, one that no sexuality could prevent any gender from staring at for uncomfortable lengths of time. Even his tail was downright fat, springing out from his butt crack in a red, blobby appendage that made wearing pants an impossibility for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord descended the stairway whilst twiddling the end of a fake moustache adhered to his upper lip, footfalls earning a frightening amount of the sounds of flexing metal and bending wood; yet another reminder of how un-Discord his actions and presence were expected. \u201cTu es, as they say, monsier Thomas? Je suis monsier not-Discord, le big-man chef, as your freedom-loving people would say!\u201d He affirmed, pointing to a name tag on his suit with the same moniker written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not even French, and I\u2019m getting really offended right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another chuckle, Discord reached the bottom of the staircase and came up to his side, his nubby fingers grabbing Thom\u2019s shoulder and pulling him into an uncomfortable amount of contact with Discord\u2019s hip, their size difference equating it to being pulled into a bear-hug by one of Canterlot\u2019s biggest residents. \u201cOn-hon-hon, monsier, you can have biggest assurances that the boundaries between my glorious country and yours shall not be any of a hindrance as you are taught to turn yeast and fromage into ART!\u201d He extended an arm and opened a hand to the air. \u201cIn weals, you will have learned to spawn flying cupcakes! Eclairs that do taxes! Cakes with legs, smart enough to legally be your own children! EVERYTHING!\u201d He listed off, conjuring those insane descriptions to materialize onto his palm and traverse down his arm, then march right into their doom as he opened his maw for them to enter and be swallowed whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each little addition of weight to enter his mall, Thom could feel his fleshy captor widen out and absorb more of his scrawny figure, prompting a round of kicking and muffled screaming against his reptilian leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, how you say, we shall start off with le baby steps. To learn the space, as you will. Avec moi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreedom for Thom when Discord\u2019s grip loosened to let him unceremoniously fall to the floor, the draconequus parading for the other room in anticipation. Seeing his big butt jiggle and sway to exit the room, Thom took only three second to abandon his dreams and walked the other way to get a new job and rethink his life...only for turning around to change his entire surroundings without a burst of magic or energy to signal the shift. When his arms were once free, he was bounded by a stretched surface tautly strapping him into something soft...something soft and warm, and mired by a damp layer that saturated into his best clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking backwards, Thom found himself amongst the three to five chins trapped in Discord\u2019s collar, whose mismatched eyes observed his student\u2019s horrified look with fondness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLe scenic view, as they speak.\u201d He assured him. \u201cShall we, as they say, begin?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The curious thing is that Sombra doesn't \u2018force\u2019 people to become slaves to his glory, but instead encourages it by setting down rules and regulations so it seems like a better alternative to freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom signed his first Servitude Contract - which included the duration of his service, the conditions he would work in, and the nature of what was required of him - when he was old enough to be called an adult in the eyes of society. To get a job in the empire, you had to be a slave. If you\u2019re lifelong dream was to become a police officer, a doctor, or a teacher, you had to legally sign away your agency to the administration of King Sombra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra, despite being an absolute monarch who has enslaved generations of untold humans and ponies, was actually not as bad as one would think. Anymore. He\u2019s not as bad anymore. In the past, sure, he showed all the signs of a sinister, evil tyrant who got off watching others under him suffer. But as years went by, the whole evil villain dictator schtick got old, and it turned out that treating the people that served for his rule better made productivity go up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people under Sombra\u2019s rule aren\u2019t stupid, they know that Sombra is a dictator. But it wasn't as if they could just up and leave, the royal guard saw fit to that. And the people in the past that led rebellions against him weren't ever seen from again. The Indentured Servitude Oversight Committee made sure that the people were treated well enough, that productivity was up, and that people aren't getting screwed over in their contracts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas Knox was not taken from his family home, kicking and screaming to the Crystal Place for his new \u2018job\u2019. No, he ASKED for it. Why? Even if it meant being a chew toy for the bored king, fulfilling Sombra\u2019s contract is guaranteed lifelong happiness. With being his slave on your resume, you can haggle every contract for the rest of your life down to nothing. It was like a lottery of sorts, hundreds of people would put in applications every year to get the chance to be Sombra\u2019s servant, and Tom was the first one to win in a very long time. He didn't expect to win, really. He mailed in his application with the confidence of scratching of the winning numbers of a five bit lottery card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when a throng of sharply dressed guards knocked on Tom\u2019s door to escort him in an armored limousine ot the massive spiraling tower in the heart of the kingdom, he was understandably nervous and excited at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c829-L.\u201d A stiff looking guard called for Tom\u2019s attention as he came through the heavy doors. \u201cYour presence is requested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom bristled and adjusted his clothes one last time before following the guard into the throne room. His palms were sweaty, his hair was slick, and his insides had more butterflies than a lepidopterarium, but underneath all of that, he was ready. Or at least he thought he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Tom entered the throne room with the guard, he saw Sombra at the far end of the room sitting on his throne. But it wasn't as if he had to look hard when he took up a quarter of the room with his great, expansive body alone. The dark monarch had certainly filled out since he took over the empire so many years ago, eating whatever and whoever he pleased with a massive appetite for food aplenty. He gained pound after pound, not that he minded one bit mind you. If anything, the gain in blubber in his body, focused on his gargantuan, sloshy belly that crashed into the marble floor and his throne enveloping rump, seemed to make him even more passionate about his consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body wobbled with every breath he took as he snored away, asleep in his own throne. Sombra, content with how he presented himself to his subjects, felt now need to torture his lower body with prisons of cloth, preferring to go nude save for his velvet cape, some mail armor that only barely covered his chest, and a tiny crown perched atop his flowing black mane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d The guard cried with a loud tap of his ceremonial sword on the marble floor. Sombra awoke from his slumber with a loud snort and a jolt, eyes fluttering as he yawned and stretched his bloated arms over his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better have a pretty damn good reason to\u2026\u201d Sombra grumbled darkly, having his sleep rudely stolen from him. He stopped his low mutterings as he laid his gaze on the figity human next to his guard's side, blushing with his head cast to the floor. Tom raised his head to meet his king\u2019s gaze, and was met with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Curiously enough, despite the suffix \u2018dale\u2019 being in the name, the town is not settled in a valley, but nobody ever pays attention to that. Instead, they pay attention to the beautiful Greek style buildings and architecture, with their eye-catching Pegasi motifs and dazzling shades of white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo a lot of people, both Pony and Human alike, Cloudsdale offers an escape. High above the skies and far from Equestria Proper, the city is seen as a second chance at life, an opportunity to begin again. Failed artists whose work was seen as too new or suffering from \u2018an absence of cultivated taste\u2019 would find refuge in airy fields where they work could flourish without hindrance. Pegasi who go about wandering through their lives can find new purpose in the Wonderbolts, where one could find comradery and newfound friendship between squaddies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem is if you\u2019re not a Pegasus, or a Dragon or Griffin, than getting to Cloudsdale can be...expensive. The city rarely ever leaves it\u2019s position in the stratosphere, and will only dock and let others come on if there was a special event happening, or someone pays an ascension fee with a lot of digits in it. But as expensive as it is, people will stay pay, and Cloudsdale stays in the Black,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the story of Tom, a human, who has paid the exorbitant price for Cloudsdale to fly low enough for him to step on. The last couple of years for him have been...tough to say the least. He had been working as a cashier at a fast food joint ever since he was seventeen. But it was supposed to be a temporary gig until he could find work after college. Well, college came and went, but apparently he picked the worst possible degree because nobody would hire him. As of late, he\u2019s become cynical, pessimistic, and kind of insufferable to his coworkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was all going to change. After years of living paycheck to paycheck, thrift shopping, and an admittedly appealing diet of cheap food from where he worked, he had finally made enough money to begin again in Cloudsdale. For the first time in a very, VERY long time...Tom felt a twinge of hope for his future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took his first steps onto the airy, yet still solid ground of the great city, Tom set out with a spring in his step towards...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the way from here to Baltimare, specifically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny first attempt at matching his boss\u2019 actions, currently those of just trying to catch up with her saw him stumbling about and tripping over his own feet in a way that seemed insultingly symbolic. Not that Tom wasn\u2019t eager for the job; anything could fit over flipping burgers at one of the greasiest cities in Equestria, but trying to keep up with the quakes that resounded of his oversized boss made from trundling along the already bouncy cloud-floors seem like part of the job itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the more a reason\u2026no, <i>excuse</i> to stall in giving an answer, scared to choose between pathetic truths or obvious lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe\u2026\u201d He began, thinking at a rate of one word at a time. \u201cThe culture. Yeah, I\u2019ve\u2026been a big\u2026uh\u2026<i>connoseiur</i> of Cloudsdale culture, and\u2026the\u2026the Wonderbolts are at the top of all that. Yeah\u2026you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d She grunted in the tone that just saying \u2018no\u2019 couldn\u2019t match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Tom, standing next to Spitfire and mentally linking her to all the claims of what an acrobatic, flexible, and outright <i>powerful</i> mare was felt akin to standing on one end of a massive canyon whilst scrutinizing a bird perched on the other. Okay, perhaps \u201cpowerful\u201d wasn\u2019t such an absurd claim; somewhere beneath all that buttery exterior, he could sense the ghost of a behemothic framework of muscle comparable in size to a king size mattress, further decorated by thick, bulky thigh muscles still fit enough to run a few miles every morning, throbbing biceps that frequently ballooned in size, even with the most subtle of movements, and, most notably, just an unflinching immunity to her indomitable bulk, her footsteps rattling around the hallway\u2019s walls and innards without making her breathing flex in volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, he didn't have to be creative to see Spitfire crushing his bones or yanking his head off with ease...even if the grand armada of musculature inside of her was shrouded beneath piling layers of digested lard and grease that weren\u2019t under a foot thick in the <i>healthier</i> regions, any semblance of definition in her arms reduced to the vaguest outlines within grossly swollen limbs choked by the sleeves of her work shirt (sleeves already big enough to fit an obese man\u2019s waist,) and roll-ridden balloons of calves supporting thighs that meshed together in a gargantuan, zeppelin-like ass whose berth surpassed that of her looming nine-foot build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of which was barricaded down in front by an eight-foot thick barrier of adipose that consisted her stomach, a gargantuan mass protruding from her torso with only enough paunch and give for it to cascade completely past her legs and weigh down on several feet of floor beyond her hooves, but structured with a dense core of muscle that caused it to pounce outwards in a taut orb, supplying it with a plush, yet rubbery surface that could ricochet any punch or kick without receiving any bruising, probably enough to dislocate the arm of any poor sap who\u2019d try in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026and all of it was naked. Spitfire was at least modest enough to wear panties, but at her size it only covered as much as a line of Sharpie drawn around her hips. Her commander\u2019s jacket carried enough pride that her nipples weren\u2019t open to the air, either, but considering the sheer tonnage that her breasts carried, two severely overgrown orbs strangling the very front buttons while hugging round the lapels like a pair of muffin tops\u2026it didn\u2019t stop Tom from seeing the most yellow he'd ever seen at once in his own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsidering that, however,\u201d She affirmed, not looking aside as the face of her stomach pushed aside the doors to her office, with Tom darting into action to step out of reach from her footfalls. \u201cLets say that tonight\u2026no, after this interview, I said you had a job. What point do you go from, then? Cleaning? Strategy? Grooming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Whatever you\u2019re willing to teach me, miss. What\u2019s available right now, for instance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe issue\u2019s not what\u2019s available, Mister Knox.\u201d She threw back, casting eyes on him that, regardless of the football-sized cheeks hanging on her face, scanned him like the sights of two guns sending beams on his forehead. \u201cThe issue\u2026at least, I <i>hope</i> it\u2019s not an issue, is what\u2019s a place in the Wonderbolts for a human straight out of Baltimare?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-W-Well\u2026I\u2026\u201d It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t expect any judgement on the job\u2026at least, not before the job. \u201cI\u2026I may be a human, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026and Tom became one of the rare people to make Spitfire break face, her eyes widening in realization. \u201cOh! Mister Knox, I didn\u2019t mean that in regards to you being a human! I apologize!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d He exclaimed, his relief masking his embarrassment. \u201cHeh\u2026thank you commander.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I meant in regards to a human in the fast food industry.\u201d She continued, flawlessly transitioning from that last thought. \u201cI\u2019m looking at your employment history, and I can\u2019t help but notice something about you seems a bit too\u2026ambitious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmbitious?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop n\u2019 Burger\u2026\u201d She read from his forms, pointing at the first spot in his record. \u201cSandy\u2019s\u2026The Taco Bowl\u2026\u201d She continued, pointing further down on the list with each name. \u201cFast food\u2026fast food\u2026fast food\u2026\u201d Then her finger passed the bottom of the list, her finger pointing down at her own desk. \u201c\u2026The Wonderbolts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Wonderbolts, some of the most elite, highly trained athletes\u2026no, military in all of Equestria, right after barely an adulthood of part-time work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026I\u2026\u201d Tom could feel ten or so minutes crumble from the interview, and still without a \u2018yes\u2019 in sight. \u201cJust\u2026that next step in life, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so much a step as \u2018launched from a cannon.\u2019\u201d She surmised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if\u2026if I can ask, where could I start here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: \"...try the mess hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: \"...maybe the showers, as the main scrubber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Spitfire pauses, but after casting him a predatory look demands him to take off his pants...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nTom could not tell whether or not his new job in the Wonderbolts was an upgrade or a downgrade. Granted, It was not food related, and he was certainly grateful for that, having spent enough time around greasy, fattening treats to last a lifetime. And he knew that getting a job itself would have been a challenge with his resume, and passing spitfire\u2019s interview was worthy of a pat on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut being assigned as a glorified shower attendant was certainly not what Tom expected when he deposited his entire life savings to Cloudsdale\u2019s treasury just to let him on. It was certainly a step in the right direction towards a potential future in Equestria\u2019s elite military, however, he was just hoping that first step would not require him to swallow his pride like he had been doing in Baltimare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Wonderbolt\u2019s \u2018Main Scrubber\u2019, Tom was in charge of making sure Cloudsdale\u2019s elite were sparkling clean. Mainly, that detailed turning on and off the hot water, making sure that the soap was stocked, cleaning the towels after use, and taking care of the shower cleanliness itself. On paper, his main job was actually very removed from the situation, just making sure that the squadies were able to clean themselves. And if that was the case, he may have been a little less cynical about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but realistically, as explained by Spitfire and Tom\u2019s new boss, despite how athletic and musclebound they were under all of their layers of fat, the Pegasi in the Wonderbolts had \u2018trouble\u2019 getting to their hard to reach areas with all of their blubber in the way, and sometimes they would need help. \u2018Help\u2019 is a phrase in which here means getting a bath sponge with a load of soap on it and scrubbing the dirt and grime from their nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom\u2019s only consolation was that only the male squaddies could request that of him. The ladies had trouble sometimes too, but they had their own scrubbers that were much more comfortable around their feminine anatomy. He sighed heavily as he looked at his reflection in one of the shower mirrors. Having a suit devoid of grease stains provided to him was nice, but did they really have to add salt to the wound by having him wear a bow tie? It didn\u2019t scream formality and professionalism as it did submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Squaddies, that was some real nice flying you did put they're, all of you should be proud of yourselves. Go on, get cleaned up and take a load off for the rest of the day, you earned it!\u201d Tom heard the muffled voice of what he assumed was a regiment commander outside the tiled walls of the room. A lone bead of sweat ran down his neck as he heard their hoof steps waddle towards where he was. The first day, the first shift. He better make a good impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom took his spot at attendant\u2019s post in the middle of the room where he could survey all of the shower. The ponies in their barley fitting uniforms came in like a herd of elephants, but payed him no mind as they walked past his post and immediately began stripping down to wash off. Thankfully, all them appeared to be fully capable of cleaning themselves, and he had already made sure the soap and towels were ready, so all he really had to do was open a hatch, turn a dial, and flip a switch to turn on the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was soon abuz with the Pegasi chatting amongst themselves as they made sure their fur was glossy and clean. The smell of hard earned misled quickly faded away and shampoo and body conditioner took it\u2019s place. Tom allowed himself to smile a tad as he heard the cliched towel whip on someone\u2019s ass and a shout in response. So far, nothing seemed to be going wrong\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut than Tom felt the airy ground beneath him bounce as heavy hoof steps trudged slowly through the building. They were heavy, heavier than Spitfire\u2019s, and Tom had to grasp onto something just to stay upright. After a couple more of those miniature earthquakes, the source revealed itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe regiment\u2019s commander, Soarin as it said in his name tag, came into the shower after momentarily getting stuck in the doorway specifically designed to accommodate his size. He had emerald eyes, a dark blue mane, and a pale cornflower coat, but all Tom could pay attention to was his mountainous dome of a gut that quivered with every step, his thunder thighs that flared out like a rising Phoenix, and barely clothed moobs that could put most women to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin has a Jolly, kind smile as he looked out to his fellow Pegasi, Tom being hidden from his sight under the horizon of his gut. The other ponies gave a cheer and a hearty welcome to their commander as he walked by to one of the showers that was built just for ponies his size. He seemed to be a Father to his men, and more of a friend than a superior to the troops. He stripped out of his uniform that wasent doing anything to hide his fat body from the world in the first place, and began to clean himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Tom had hoped that since Soarin hadn\u2019t noticed him, he wouldn\u2019t have to provide any of his additional \u2018services\u2019. But just when he thought he was in the clear, some idiot ruined it. \u201cHey commander, look! We got a scrubber now!\u201d One Pegasus addressed to Soarin while he pointed to Tom, making him blush under the attention. \u201cGreat news for you, Huh, ya fat piggy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom didn\u2019t want to think it, but the cornflower colored commander truly did have a birth longer than his limbs. His bloated arms only reached halfway down to his gargantuan stomach, and they were having trouble reaching over it\u2019s massive circumference. Soarin looked perplexed, having not seen anyone at the post, but than backed up to see a human hidden in plain sight at the foot of the room\u2019s pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave Tom an awkward smile as a little color rose to his lard-laden cheeks. \u201cUhh...do you mind if...I could get some \u2018help\u2019 over here?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

EVER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly staring up at the obese commander, Tom craned his head down to align his gaze with his stomach, but shut his eyes, then wracked his brain for all his grossest memories of the fast-food life; all the bugs he saw skittering around when he was cleaning late at night, the sweat-stained bits dozens of mares fished from their cleavages to pay with, or the time a stallion who couldn't have had less than ten bowel conditions used the bathroom one night and didn't flush...then he opened his eyes, estimating where on Soarin's relatively showered exterior the point of no return would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when a few of the other Wonderbolts began to snicker at the stretched pause, and Soarin was forced to nervously join in, was when Tom nodded his head. \"Lift it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at his leviathan of a stomach in uncertainty, Soarin' stooped down and grabbed as big of armfuls of the colossal, mushy orb as they could carry and guided it upwards with a strength to rival Spitfire's, leaving in its place a deep, perfectly round basin of flattened cloud in the floor that spread out seventeen feet in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his superior's muzzle wrapped up in a near crimson under the strain, Tom bit his lip, took one last inhale of air that wasn't damp with musk...and stomped over to Soarin before crouching down to crawl underneath his belly, which hovered only four feet above the ground whilst casting a shadow on the shivering human as dark as nighttime. It was probably from being an athlete that spared Tom of any of the grease-streaked cellulite some of his former customers were covered with, but that didn't prevent copious patches of dirt and grass stains from being painted around the vast underside of Soarin's stomach...and Tom hadn't even reached the legs yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember the toilet...remember the toilet... He mentally chanted, then got to work at making contact. A considerable job on its own, touching his boss' body, but after stomping on his own foot and forcing himself to scrape at the fur with the sponge, he was treated with the stains easily wiping away, much of the dirt flaking away on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flabby roof above him jiggled, the immense Pegasus having to clamp his jaw to hold in a tickled chuckle, but whatever other showermates weren't already chuckling and elbowing one another made no secret of their presence. The shower water and sweat condensating on his fur made his grip harder to maintain, and after seven minutes of having his belly's foot scrubbed, Soarin' felt he was barely able to hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...alright.\" Tom puffed out, satisfied that Sarin's stomach was clean when the last smudge of grass was scrubbed off and swirling down the drain...then he looked back. Even under the shower's water, he could see how sweaty Soarin's legs were, the grossly swollen limbs tightly squished together around the thighs even when he stood with them splayed apart as far as he could get them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no laughter then. All the other stallions leaned in to watch, genuinely curious, and Soarin' swallowed nothing but air, knowing solely from their expressions that they'd hit the moment of truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom took one step. That step became two, then three, and then four, each subsequent one an event, all an action that left considerable toll on his mind, body, and soul. His legs were soon a foot away from his face, his eyes observing the blobby arch like the towering gateway to some fantasy villain's layer...and with one last pause to station his mind, he abruptly thrust the sponge in between his legs and scrubbed up and down, cheeks bulging as any air in his stomach was vomited up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin's face bugged at the sensation, frenzied between surprise and a tickled smile all at the same time, while the rest of the guys ceased any sense of class and burst out in a choir of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember the toilet...remember the toilet... He continuously recited, his body only able to register the command of making his arm go up, and down, up, and down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then he felt his arm grace against something...not his leg. Something tender. And he, as well as Soarin, he could tell by the tensing in his muscles, froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Tom eventually manages to scrub Soarin' clean, much to the teasing of their comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Soarin' sneezes during the cleaning, accidentally letting go of his stomach!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soarin knew that it was an accident when Tom brushed his arm up against his what his stomach usually covered up. He knew that when he asked for some \u2018help\u2019, he should have at least expected something like this to happen. But Soarin, out of reflex and shock, still tender up his muscles. His grip on his massive boulder of a gut was already slipping from the rapidly falling energy in his bloated arms, the dampness of his fur, and the playful teasing his Squaddies were giving both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when Soarin tensed up his muscles underneath all of the pillowy layers of fat on him, that was the final nail in the coffin. His blubber reacted with a quiver, just large enough for the fuzzy armfuls of belly he was holding to slip from his grasp. Before he could react, his hot air balloon of a stomach crashed down onto the tiled, cloudy floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom let out a shriek of surprise as his legs and torso were suddenly smothered by pale cornflower blue belly blubber, his now body pinned to the floor. He could here the others go silent for a moment, before bursting out guffawing louder than ever before. The immense weight pushing down on his body was thankfully canceled out for the most part by the plushness and give of the commander\u2019s lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no. Oh no, no, no, no!\u201d Soarin cried as he felt Tom squirm in futility underneath his stomach. He was beet red from embarrassment: some of which came from acting so unprofessionally in front of his men, but most of it was from slipping up and potentially hurting someone. \u201cDude, I am SO sorry! Are you okay, are you hurt?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY- yeah, I\u2019m fine!\u201d Tom shouted from underneath, struggling to keep his neck from being swallowed up by a rogue wave of blubber. He wasn't in any pain, just immobilized, but he wanted-no, needed to get out from under Soarin as soon as possible. The blood rushing to his cheeks was a clear testament to that...if anyone could have seen it. \u201cJust...just try to get me out of here, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay...alright.\u201d Soarin slowly waddled forwards, careful not to step on his accidental victim as his heavy hooves flattened the tiled cloud beneath him. It was slow going, but soon Tom could feel the weight ease off of his back as the fat slided off. Soon, only his legs were stuck underneath the Pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was than, however, that things went sour fast. A lone bubble of soap from the shampoo of one of the chucking Squaddies drifted from the other side of the shower towards Soarin. At the same time, Tom, who thought he had enough weight off of him to wiggle out from underneath, decided to grab onto Soarin\u2019s thigh for support. Having not seen his reaction to the scrubbing earlier, he didn't know that his legs were sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lone bubble of soap from before managed to worm it\u2019s way through the air to pop on the tip of Soarin\u2019s muzzle, at the exact same time that Tom went through with his plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey, hey! Don\u2019t do...do...ah...Ah\u2026!\u201d Soarin attempted to warn Tom, but could not finish his sentence as both his thigh and airways were being tickled. He could feel his legs go numb and started to shake, and just as Tom realized what was happening\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH CHOO!\u201d Soarin sneezed. The gigantic, fat, naked Pegasus fell down to the floor ass first as his legs turned to jelly. For half of a second, Tom\u2019s vision was of his serperior\u2019s round buttocks crashing down towards him like a meteor from the sky. And than after that half of a second they're was only darkness. Darkness...and a lack of air to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank Celestia you\u2019re okay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom groggily opened his eyes as Soarin\u2019s voice rang in his ears. The light flooding from the window in the room blinded him at first, but as his eyes adjusted he noticed that light was tinged in orange. He looked out the window to see the sun setting under an overcast sea of clouds. He looked back around and saw that he was on a reinforced bed made for someone ten times his size in some kind of infirmary\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...with a familiar heavyset Pegasus, now thankfully dressed as much as his Wonderbolt uniform allowed, with a relieved look on his face. \u201cI\u2019m so, so, so sorry about what happened! But they're was this bubble and I got ticklish when you grabbed my leg and...I\u2019m just really sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked up to the elite military commander who could rip his body in half if he wished, whose face looked as if he had just murdered someone. Tom was understandably \u2018miffed\u2019 about being squashed by a Ponies stomach and than sat on, but as he looked up into his assailant\u2019s emerald eyes on the verge of tears, he found it very hard to hold a grudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you don\u2019t have to worry about me, sir. I\u2019m...alright.\u201d Tom reassured Soarin. He was lying when said that, however, or at least half lying. His body was devoid of any bruises or scratches, all of his bones were in the right place, and his head was still screwed on straight. But his lungs felt like they had shriveled up, brittle and liable to break with each breath he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? Do you remember what happened?\u201d Soarin probed further, not convinced Tom was telling him the truth. He sat down at the foot of the bed, oblivious to the other end of the mattress rising up to counter his weight. Tom found himself gripping the sheets to keep from gravitating towards the same posterior he got better acquainted with not too long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well...I remember you uh...sitting on me, and than it kinda went dark.\u201d Tom confessed as he grasped to remember how he got lit from underneath Soarin\u2019s posterior. It was blurry, with fragments of faded voices sprinkled here in their in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin smiled a very forced and awkward smile and looked away from Tom as he figured his hands. \u201cYou uh...you actually passed out under they're. It took awhile for the guys to get me back of my hooves, and by the time they did you were out cold.\u201d That would explain the feeling Tom was having in his chest. It was starved of air and is having trouble suddenly having it again. The elite military commander smiled warmly \u201cBut If you say so. I\u2019m just really glad you\u2019re alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that reminds me!\u201d Soarin got off the foot of the bed, allowing the mattress to spring back down to it\u2019s original position along with Tom. \u201cSpitfire forgot to tell you where you\u2019ll be sleaping for the night. A lot of the Squaddies like to live off the base, but the Wonderbolts offer sleeping arrangements for those who...don\u2019t really have a place to go at the end of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sheepishly smiled along with Soarin. It was not very comfortable to admit that he was, well, homeless. The price to pay to get into Cloudsdale was too high for anything to be left over, and he was counting on getting into the Wonderbolts today or go hungry tonight. Soarin countinued, \u201cYou can stay in the infirmary for the rest of the day if you want, but your new sleeping quarters will be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All being said, though, Tom was mostly taken aback to hear Soarin\u2019 talk to him in the way he did, looking upon his frail, battered form neither the same amount of kindness and concern that he\u2019d more likely share for one of the many recruits he trusted, flew with, and spent years training together with. He acted as if it was <i>Spitfire</i> whom he nearly killed, not a guy who was hired to wipe his crotch in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, sleeping with his commander wouldn't mean he was sleeping on the streets, and the answer was simple for Tom to answer. Simple but not <i>easy,</i> requiring a few gags from his throat to get his vocal cords to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom\u2019s lungs lurched one more time, unable to breath in the air to speak the next word, but managed to work out a single croak that Soarin\u2019 could barely hear. \u201c...deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018scuse me?\u201d Soarin asked, leaning in so his ear was closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d Tom could utter in a completely flat tone, but Soarin\u2019 managed an earnest smile at the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and like I said, it\u2019s a temporary measure.\u201d He enforced. \u201cPlus, as big as I am, I promise I sleep like a baby. We\u2019ll get along fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I take it I\u2019m the laughingstock of the facility, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou? Nah, the troopies\u2019ll forget about everything that\u2019d happened by tomorrow morning.\u201d Soarin\u2019 answered. \u201cIf you\u2019d seen all the stuff <i>I\u2019d</i> gotten myself wrapped up in when I was a rookie, you\u2019d be chuckling all the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time around, Tom didn\u2019t have the difficulty of being required to keep up pace with Soarin\u2019s mammoth footfalls rattling the floors and walls to the facility\u2019s bedding corridors, the gentle-giant of a Pegasus having opted to let him sit on his shoulder instead, but Tom still had to endure quite a bumpy ride with Soarin\u2019s waddling gait in tow. Having waited till nightfall to leave the infirmary, the once amber glow of sunrise that bled in through the cloudy surfaces was gone, replaced by a deep blue tint that matched a stark drop in the facility\u2019s temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom grabbed onto Soarin\u2019s shirt to stay seated, nearly thrown off by a particularly shaky wobble from Soarin\u2019s hooves. \u201cEven if \u2018everything\u2019 pertains to \u2018scrubbing down and getting sat on by their boss?\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho do you think got me off of you in the first place?\u201d Soarin\u2019 countered. \u201cI promise, the laughter ended the moment I sat on you. Give everything a few weeks, and they\u2019ll be chatting with you like you\u2019re wearing a uniform yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two approaching a particularly expensive set of doorways in the barracks, evident by the varnished ebony wood and the golden decals representing their owners\u2019 names, Soarin pinched his meaty fingers into the pocket of his shirt and drew out a ring weighed down by a hive of keys whose net mass must\u2019ve rivaled Tom\u2019s alone, his thumb expertly flipping through them before settling on a brass one with a blue-winged head, then stepped up to the door by his side to let his arm reach down to slot the key into the lock, then side-stepped to push it open with his own body and ventured in side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, here we are!\u201d Soarin remarked, flipping the light switch. \u201cCasa de Soarin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Soarin\u2019s bedroom, and finally beginning to question whether Soarin possessed the strength to <i>hop</i> with his indomitable bulk, let alone fly, Tom wondered if Soarin\u2019 even <i>was</i> a field commander for the Wonderbolts, or was really some lazy brother of Spitfire\u2019s who happened to freeload in the facility. The only evidence that Soarin\u2019s bedroom was that of an athlete were a display of trophies and award perched above the bed, which in itself was a massive surface that occupied nearly half the room, clearly curtained to fit Soarin\u2019s waistline, but their refined appearance was overshadowed by movie posters caked over the other walls like moss, the room beyond the bed occupied by a massive couch whose cushions and armrests were battered by so many years of abuse that they were molded into a perfect death mask of Soarin\u2019s butt, a testament to years being spent in front of a television on the other wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in a wooden case below the TV, displayed by glass windows, was what wasn\u2019t exactly a library of video games as much as it was a <i>museum</i>, fitted with several decades\u2019 worth of technology that ranged from the old and dirty to the new and pristine. Yet, for every console present, there had to be no less than a few dozen for each that sat in a bookcase spanning the entire end of the room across from the doorway, some of their labels not even in Equestrian tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin\u2019 chuckled, seeing Tom\u2019s stunned eyes narrow in on his selection of game. \u201c...and before you ask, yes, you can play them if you promise not to break anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise.\u201d Tom mechanically replied, slurring the words as everything about the room save for the games seemed to melt away, even his Soarin\u2019 himself, who gave his catatonic recruit a concerned look before gently nudging him in the side with his finger, briefly re-awakening him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to his senses, Tom scanned his eyes around the room one last time, an important question dawning on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I gonna sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin\u2019...</span></div></div>",

There's a place where I can sleep, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah...no.\u201d Soarin\u2019 sighed, dropping his hand away from his face. \u201cI knew I was forgetting something, but I just kept pushing it to the back of my mind. Damnit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what about the couch?\u201d Tom pointed to the lounge area in the other room, stuttering a tad and trying to not think of the worst possible scenario. \u201cPlenty of space for a little guy like m-me, Huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin tilted his head to see Tom in his shoulder and smiled, but his heart wasn't in it. \u201cThat poor thing is it really the best spot for your size. I spend a lot of time on it, especially in the mornings, and I don\u2019t think you and my butt want to get together again.\u201d He chuckled softly, internally beating himself up about how stupid he had been for not thinking in advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're is...they're is one place you could sleep.\u201d Soarin got an idea, his eyes peeking up in revelation. He turned so that Tom could see what he was gesturing towards. The human stifled a gasp when he saw that his boss meant his BED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Tom\u2019s brain went on pause mode for a second starting back up again. \u201c...can\u2019t be serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Soarin asked genuinely confused. \u201cIt\u2019s big enough for you. I even made it before I left, so it\u2019s all ready for ya\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I appreciate taking me in for a while and all, but what if you turn in your sleep?!\u201d Tom protested. \u201cThe idea of being your glorified Teddy Bear is not that tempting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d Soarin blinked, tilting his head in confusion. Before he could finish his sentence, his eyes widened he understood what Tom was saying. To the human\u2019s Surprise, the massive pony turned his head back and started laughing as hard as his Squaddies. \u201cOh my Celestia your funny, man! No, I\u2019m taking the couch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...oh\u2026\u201dTom dropped his head down in embarrassment. Today was really not his best first day in the job. \u201cThat makes...a lot more sense when I think about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah man, I think your cute and all, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit too early to be sleeping together?! Soarin\u2019 continued to laugh at Tom\u2019s expense, making the poor human blush with shame. Suddenly, he rewound the last statement the pony made in his head, and found something that sounded strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you...you think I\u2019m cute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin stopped laughing mid chuckle. His mouth was comically stuck between chortles as beads if sweat began to run down his head, eyes trying to avoid Tom\u2019s line of sight. \u201cOh! Well would you look at the time!\u201d The Pegasus pointed to a wall clock on the wall, one that Tom thought was broken since it read \u20187:07 A.M\u2019. \u201cWow, time sure does fly by when your having fun! Welp, time to hit the hay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tom could get a word in the matter, Soarin had already deposited him down gently on his bed. The height was too far up for him to drop down without getting hurt. Soarin, with such a phoned in smile that it could trigger lie detectors, gave the Human a reassuring and totally not weird at all pat on the head, and quickly backed up away from him towards his mancave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you in the morning!\u201d Soarin waved and shut the door behind him, but not before his flipped the light switch in the side of the doorway, plunging the room with Tom in it into total darkness. With nothing better to do, Tom gave a shrug to himself and walked to the front of the bed to get under the covers. A weird way to end a weird day.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmph\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom awoke to the sound of gentle grunting. He had no idea what time of night it was, but he was sure it was still dark out by his body punished him for interrupting it\u2019s REM cycles. He head soft shuffling to the side of him, but couldn\u2019t see what it was due to the room\u2019s darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoarin\u2019...?\u201d Tom yawned, a little irritated at the pony for waking him up in the middle if his sleep. He got up and walked over to the side of the bed, assuming that the shadowy figure was him. \u201cWhat freaking time is it anyway\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was blinded by a sudden influx of light entering the room, making him staffer and fall on the bed under him. After a few minutes he managed to regain his composure and see what was My he source of his eye\u2019s irritation. They're was a mini fridge underneath the nightstand, packed with chips, candy, soda, ramen noodles, and all other sorts of foods that bachelors might have in their first apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Soarin was raiding it in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Tom muttered as he observed the Pegasus stuff his face, sometimes wrapping and all, with his eyes glued shut. Soarin gave a few noises here and they're, some of them snores, some of them grunts from eating food instead of breathing air, but most of them were signs of contentedness as his belly filled up with cold treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so weird\u2026\u201d Tom sat down and leaned on his side so he could get a better look at the spectacle. A few words of caution about how he might have a tendency to sleepwalk was something Soarin\u2019 forgot to mention, obviously. \u201cAnd...kinda cute.\u201d Tom also observed as he saw the cornflower commando grab a full bottle of orange cola from the fridge. With raw force, he ripped the plastic lid off with his teeth and began chugging the bottle down like a gazelle sipping wasted from a river. He tossed the empty thing to his side, gave out a small but deep belch, and went for another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, he\u2019s such a pig.\u201d Tom suddenly wished he had some popcorn to go with the show. He shouldn\u2019t have been encouraging it, but he couldn\u2019t help himself for wanting to clap at some of the tricks his boss was doing in his sleep. Soarin grabbed a apple and dropped it in his mouth whole. He chewed and swished the fruit pulp around in his mouth before swallowing.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Changelings are one of Equestria\u2019s most curious and fantastic races, with a rather infamous history to put it lightly. At first glance, they resemble your everyday, average Equestrian Pony, but it doesn't take too long to notice they have more in common with insects that equines. Their bodies are essentially a hairless carapace with webbed tails and manes. But the most notable aspect of them are their diet, which is solely composed of love. Throughout history, changelings took the appearance of loved ones and unjustly stole their love to sate their appetites. This behavior has led them down a path of infamy and contempt by much of the other races of Equestria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, up until a couple of months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an event that had shocked Equestria to it\u2019s core, the changelings, under the guidance of a miss Starlight Glimmer, began to stop taking love by wrong means and start sharing love and earning it by what basically boils down to being a good person. This change was in their behavior was so great that their bodies underwent a great \u2018metamorphosis\u2019 that, frankly, made them a whole lot less intimidating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter centuries of cold hostility, Equestria had finally brokered a peace with the changelings, and diplomatic relations began construction in earnest. Today, the ambassador from Equestria to the Changeling Empire would arrive at the new embassy next to the Chrysalis Palace. The ambassador himself was a human by the name of Thomas Knox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas Knox, who frequently was just called Tom, felt cautiously optimistic about his new position in the Changeling lands. A lot of his folks back home in Fillydelphia still had lingering resentment about the insectoid creatures, mainly because one of them posed as a dead family member when he was too young to remember, but he wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping off from the carriage that had driven him from Canterlot to his new residence and workplace, the first thing that Tom noticed about the metaphomasized changelings...was how freaking fat they got in the past months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the metamorphosis, Changelings were jet black with glossy, pupiless eyes with literal holes in their limbs from malnourishment. But now that they was enough love to go around and than some, their coats took on a healthy glow of color, their eye no longer reminded others of sociopathy, and the gaping holes in their bodies had been healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for years the Changelings had been doctrined to scrounge for love, fight for love, take on others appearance for love, because before they was just so little. Almost everyone went hungry and survived on the equivalent of scraps. Now they have more love than they know what to do with, and although their methods of receiving love has changed for the better, their hunger has not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well\u2026\u201d Tom heard a voice on his left muse, \u201c...a Human for an ambassador is certainly unexpected, but definitely not unwelcomed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Tom jumped in his shoes, realigned his tie and turned to address whenever was speaking to him. \u201cHello they're! My name is Ambassador Knox, and on behalf of Equestria I look forward...to mending the relations...between our two\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom wanted to say more, but his mind was in another plane of existence as he looked up, up, and up at the most prominent and important Changeling in the whole kingdom: Chrysalis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3200 pound, 14\u20192 Queen of the Changelings looked down at the Equestrian Ambassador and gave an amused chuckle. Her chuckle caused her belly, totaly open for the whole world to see, to shake and brush the ground beneath her with the consistency of one part gelatin and the other part sandbag. As it jiggled around, Chrysalis lowered her face down to fill Tom\u2019s vision with her flabby face. \u201cWhat? Haven\u2019t you ever seen a changeling before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom\u2019s mind came back to him and immediately he was kicked out of his stupefied expression. \u201cS-s-sorry, your majesty! Yes, I\u2019ve am well familiar with Changelings and your race...I just wasn't expecting to see you so soon is all!\u201d He chuckled nervously as Chrysalis looked over him not unlike a cook appraising a well-roasted turkey, or a child smiling fondly at their favorite stuffed animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me for the intrusion, I just wanted to see who Celestia and Luna had picked for the job. I was half expecting one of the Mane six to fill your shoes.\u201d She raised her head up high again, towering over Tom by more than a foot. \u201cBut you seem just, if not more capable than them, if you don\u2019t mind me saying so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh\u2026\u201d A small tint of rose cape up on his cheeks. \u201cGosh, I...don\u2019t mind you saying that at all, miss Chrysa-I mean Queen Chrysalis!\u201d Tom corrected halfway through his sentence. One compliment and he was already slipping?! Thankfully, Chrysalis didn't get offended by his misnaming. In fact, all he did was elist a more genuine smile from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I can count on you to help improve this kingdom\u2019s...,let\u2019s say \u2018image problem\u2019. People still are apprehensive about my little changelings...apprehensive about me.\u201d She grimaced for a split second, but instantly replaced it with an enthusiastic smile. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have to talk about that know! Please, just walk inside the embassy and someone will show you to your office. I\u2019m sure we will see each other soon...very soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an added comment that came off as more dark than intended, Chrysalis turned around and walked to her place next door, giving the human ambassador a teasing view of her bare backside. Tom turned to his right to avoid staring at it for too long, another tinge of red creeping onto his face, and saw that a crew of rotund changelings, but not as much as their queen, were already unloading the carriage and hauling off his luggage inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to waste, apparently. It was time for Tom to head inside and began his new job as the ambassador to the Changeling Kingdom from Equestria. The moment he set foot into the lobby of the newly constructed house of diplomacy, he was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Standing just four feet shorter than Chrysalis, this other changeling was significantly younger, somewhere in her early twenties, and also carried very little of the revere or confidence that the Queen did; she uncomfortably observed him with deep teal eyes, wearing the kind of tiny spectacles that only secretaries ever seemed to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost striking of all, however, was that unlike the Queen, or even every other changeling he'd come across, this one was <i>completely clothed</i>, her behemothic form censored by a suit ensemble featuring a red work jacket that matched the strawberry color of her mane, buttoned down over a plentiful stomach that, while it would've only been 'mildly' fat if described off a normal changeling, still felt like he was observing some  sort of oversized beach ball hidden under her shirt, a 'moderately' large pair of breast sitting atop that her arms were wrapped around to keep her stubby fingers locked, pushing her cleavage upwards as she blushed in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...all of which was compensated by a zeppelin-like cliff of ass wafting around behind her, hips springing a few feet out from under either of the thick lovehandles sagging off her belly, dressed up in black pants that tired his mind of where there was enough cloth to buy to entirely cover them, if only enough that they still clung to the skin, laminating her deep, tightly compacted ass crack, bulky, engorged thighs kissing against one another, and stubby calves whose ankles spilled out onto her hooves, supplying her with all the swollen curves he would've seen if she wasn't even clothed in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last detail he observed, one he damned himself for not checking first, was her name tag: Ocellus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hey, there.\" He managed to get out. \"Queen, uh...Queen Chrysalis said you'd send me to my office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct.\" She nodded, nervously straightening out her suit's lapel. \"My name's Ocellus, and I'll be your secretary during your career around the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning over her figure one last time, Tom shut his eyes and shook, his head, clearing up his mind so he could give her a welcoming smile. \"Well, my name's Tom, Ocellus.\" He greeted, offering her a hand. \"Tom Knox. And I'm sorry to gawk, I'd just hadn't expected to see you here so early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I understand.\" She confessed, her foggy pupils observing my hand before she tenderly pinched it between her fingers, giving it a baby's shake, and seemed to loosen up enough that she could gift me with a shy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's first on the agenda, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to follow me, first.\" She described, moving to turn around while waving for him to follow suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her backside to him, Ocellus lumbered across the lobby, en route for a set of stairs winding up around the circular chamber that lead to a doorway on the upper level. With so much size to her legs, she stomped forward with enough reach that Tom had to powerwalk to catch up with her, but she still found herself staggering to keep up a consistent pace, her buttocks swinging side to side so often that he couldn't tell if she was trying to seduce him or was fighting their momentum to keep them from making her fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To begin with, Chrysalis wished me to inform you that some delegates of hers will be around in three hours to brief you on the specifics of your position and assign you to your first diplomacy missions. As your secretary, I'm here to help keep your meetings on schedule or arrange any calls you receive in accordance to your duties, or help in any way I can offer to help you on the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm.\" Tom scratched his cheek to cover his lower gaze, forcing himself not to stare at the gigantic, ponderous orbs jiggling along her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any calls I receive will require your direct permission for me to forward to your phone, as well as any business legislatures that I observe which match any criteria you place on me to look out for.\" Reaching the doorway, she drew out a golden key from her jacket pocket. \"This will be your main key, and thus...:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting the tip into the lock, Ocellus drew open the doorway and stomped inside, standing aside for him to have space to enter...and what space there was inside. A spacious, red-carpeted room wait for him with a mahogany desk with finish painted on that seemed to add centuries worth of age and experience to the wooden furnishing, complete with a maroon leather chair inviting him to sit down. Either wall was covered by bookcases, one fitted with an unused fireplace in the center, while the entire back of the office was made of windows, with marble pillars bordering where the glass pains flexed outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The books are all blank, but you're free to request any literature of your choosing to take their place.\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter freely wandering around in the room, jaw hanging wider with every new detail to take in, Tom stopped by his desk and lifted up a brass lamp sitting in reach of the chair, observing the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the button for the secret hideout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcellus merely turned her head aside, trying to keep a neutral face, but Tom smiled to match a snicker that she gave out.</span></div></div>",

If you need me for anything I\u2019ll be right outside the door.\u201d Ocellus gave a polite and professional bow and move to exit Tom\u2019s new office. However, before she could, she felt a small, human hand tug at her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Tom implored, trying to get Ocellus\u2019s attention by grabbing at her hanging limb. \u201cDo you think you have time to...you know, just chat and get to know each other better? If we\u2019re going to work together, I would like to know more about the person who handles my schedule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fully clothed changeling was silent for a moment, before color rose to her chubby cheeks, which we even more pronounced by the gentle and bashful smile Tom had elicited from her. \u201cO-oh...alrighty than, if that is what you desire, Mr. Knox\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Tom gestured for Ocellus to sit down on one of the chairs across from his desk. \u201cCall me Tom. Mr. Knox sounds too stuffy and uptight if you ask me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Tom to his desk and sitting down in one of the chairs, Ocellus flustered expression intensified. \u201cAs you wish...Mr. Tom.\u201d She compromised, much to her superior\u2019s amusement. He heard a series of freaks and moans from the other side of his desk as his secretary sat down. He subtly straightened his back and leaned a tad forward to inspect the damage. The chairs were designed to fit the girth and weight of the average Changeling, but Ocellus obviously exceeded the furniture\u2019s limits with clothed thigh flap spilling out under the arm rests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d Tom noticed Ocellus\u2019s pained expression as she sighed and shifted around in her seating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something I have to deal with. Most of the love I get is put on my behind. At first I thought it was pretty cool, because before the metamorphosis I was pretty much a wallflower. But all those stares and compliments turned to slaps on the ass and whistles for attention.\u201d Ocellus sighed, letting her foggy, teal eyes droop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you where pants?\u201d Tom inquired putting the pieces together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcellus took a deep breath and gave out another sigh. \u201cYeah. I hate them to death, honestly. They're tight and stuffy, and I keep having to buy new ones because whenever I bend down, they rip. But it\u2019s a small price to pay for random strangers on the street not grabbing my ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it really work?\u201d Tom made a face. Even with enough cloth to cover her cliff like rear end, it was still a staggering sight. It seemed to him that it would stand out either way, with or without trying to cover up her skin. \u201cAnd if it really bothers you that much, than why not wear something more stretchy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that...that would make me look enormous!\u201d Ocellus hesitated, eyeballing Tom with a horrified expression. The ambassador merely looked at her and she immediately got the message. \u201cI know, I know, but \u2018you ARE enormous!\u2019 right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelplessly, Tom shrugged. \u201cIf you want my advice, you\u2019ve got what you\u2019ve got. And you\u2019re going to have a tough time hiding any of it,\u201d he added, gesturing at her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo might as well embrace it, and show off your figure instead,\u201d Tom continued. \u201cYou\u2019re going to draw some attention either way, if I may be perfectly frank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026But...everyone will stare!\u201d Ocellus protested. \u201cAnd not in a good way either. Oh, who am I fooling? I shouldn\u2019t bother dressing like a normal changeling anyway\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? Why? If you walk around wearing a bag, that wouldn\u2019t look good either. You\u2019ll still get stared at. And you STILL wouldn\u2019t be able to hide.\u201d Ocellus looked alarmed, but he just shrugged. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like what you're wearing, than why wear it? Humans wear clothes because we need them to adapt to different climates. If it\u2019s cold, we put on clothes. If it\u2019s hot, than you take \u2018me off. It sounds to me your just giving yourself mindless torture!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcellus frowned and gestured to her big bottom again. \u201cYou wanna know how I got this? I used to feed off of people liking me for who I am, but than my ass came in and...and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not real love?\u201d Tom finished for her, to which Ocellus nodded silently. \u201cI think your trying to apply your old self-image to the new you. But this is your reality now, and you\u2019ve got to make a new one. Make it one you can live with! I think if you were a little bit more confident, a little more proud of what you saw in the mirror each morning, people would see both you AND your ass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pregnant pause where she was completely nonplussed, but then Ocellus started to giggle. I let than dawned on Tom that he just said something a boss would never say to their secretary and he blushed bright scarlet as he nervously joined in. Her soft chuckle set the chair squished under her boulders creaking again, exacerbated by the pressure they were under, and Tom couldn\u2019t help but look. She caught him, and immediately clamped an arm on her thigh. \u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh,\u201d she laughed. \u201cNot while wearing this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just worried about the chair in my super cool new office,\u201d he said defensively, refusing to look away this time. \u201cPlease don\u2019t break it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m resisting the urge to stretch. This is really tight on my back, and kinda cramped.\u201d She tried to slip her hand down the side of the furnishing but couldn\u2019t only wedge a few fingers between thigh and the wood. \u201cHard to breathe in, too.\u201d Ocellus gave him a curious look, her eyes difficult for Tom to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know...I haven\u2019t felt this in a long time.\u201d Ocellus smiled, which only confused Tom further. She grinned wider and patted her chubby stomach affectionately. Was it looking a little fuller than usual?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since anyone gave me any real love.\u201d She rubbed her soft tummy, which seemed to expand bit by bit the more Tom stared down at it. \u201cI almost forgot what it felt like to have inside me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...oh no! I-I didn\u2019t mean to...or I thought I was-\u201c Tom rambled on, feeling almost as embarrassed and flustered as Ocellus was a couple of minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine \u2018Mr. Tom\u2019\u201d. Ocellus giggled whilst giving her stomach one final pat. \u201cThere\u2019s no crime in the Changeling Kingdom for giving someone love. Chrysalis knows I needed it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Doughy chitin oozed through her fingers, her entire arm seemingly sinking into the blubber as her stomach was emptied of its contents, but Tom could vaguely notice that her midsection was really plumpening up again, actually <i>engulfing</i> her arm whilst puffing outwards a few extra inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcellus blushed again, but learned to smile back at Tom, the two sharing a chortle at her brief expense...but then her face seized up in fear, knowingly tracing her hands backwards to feel at her own behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...\u201d She whimpered, hearing yet another faint bubbling inside of her belly. \u201cNo, no, not now! <i>Please!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, totally ignorant to her begging and attempts her flanks to keep them contained, Ocellus\u2019 asscheeks ballooned with a growth spurt much more noticeable than her stomach\u2019s, forcing even more paunch from her thighs and lovehandles to ooze through and around the chair\u2019s armrests before the expensive wooden arches were both flung off with two loud <i>pops</i>, both getting tossed aside with record distances. A sickening <i>crunch</i> came from behind when her ass swelled backwards to put enough strain on the backboard to smash it off as well, rendering the seat but an impressive footrest whose reinforced metal legs groaned in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcellus\u2019 face conducted a symphony of terrified emotions at the sensation; embarrassment, fear, and <i>pain,</i> her legs twitching uncomfortably as her pants became hard-pressed at finding more rolls or dimples  to conform to, the material becoming even more strained while the poor girl\u2019s underwear was probably strangling any blood trying to go below the waist. As if to cover the evidence, and with less of the chair\u2019s dimensions present to keep her thighs imprisoned, her entire form sank downwards upon the broken seat and its supports, assfat cascading over and around the wood and seeping into the open spaces underneath till she was merely spitting on the ground, albeit with chunks of splintered wood and metal devoured by her even more gargantuan behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring into Tom\u2019s concerned eyes in terror, Ocellus\u2019 mouth open and closed, over and over as she tried to find the words to make up for what just happened, before she settled on hanging her head in shame. \u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019ll just...see myself out, then...forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Ocellus, listen, it\u2019s not a big deal!\u201d Tom quickly insisted. \u201cI promise, I was just kidding about what I said earlier about the chair. I hadn\u2019t even sat in it yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you won\u2019t <i>now,</i> because of me\u201d Ocellus bitterly snarked back, shifting around in big, cumbersome movements to get back on her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, let me help you!\u201d Tom came down in front of Ocellus and took her hands, trying to help and pull backwards to get her standing again. Probably a useless offer, given how much heavier Ocellus was than him, but Tom cared more to show compassion for the humiliated secretary, and was pleased to see at least a little of the discomfort on Ocellus\u2019 face recede.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few strenuous seconds of the two pulling on one another, the soun d of wood clattering on the floor that was pulling loose from her assfat, Ocellus finally managed to rise up at full height again, but now sporting a suit whose pants were more or less black paint on naked legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, sir...\u201d She hissed, feeling how little air pockets there were left for her legs to breathe in. \u201c...but if...you\u2019ll excuse me, I should go change...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOcellus, come on, listen...\u201d Tom pleaded as she tried to move, just make any form of movement in her pants without ripping them apart. \u201cIf you want to takes them off, I promise, I\u2019m not gonna stare or anything like that. I\u2019m used to being around changelings <i>bigger</i> than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, sir, but...\u201d She grunted out, taking considerable strain to swivel her leg so her hoof could drag just a few inches towards the floor. \u201c...but I <i>insist...</i>\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom was a young, smart, and, at least to some, handsome human being who rose to political power by sheer will and determination. In the time that led up to his ambassadorship, he had dealt with plenty of tense moments, usually in meeting rooms drinking stale, cold coffee and trying to convince his opponents to see things his way. However, when the sound of fabric ripping from it\u2019s seems filled the room as a large tear ran down the side of his new Secretary\u2019s left butt cheek, it made those meetings look like pleasant afternoons in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcellus\u2019s face contorted with terror as the violent noise burrowed into her ears, completely freezing up as to not make the hole any larger. Artic blue carapace spilled out through the opening in the clothes, desperate to be released from it\u2019s black prison. She could feel, despite his best efforts not to, her new boss\u2019s eyes stare at the humiliating display, shame coursing through her veins more than blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs cautiously as possible, she took another step forwards to rid herself of this situation, run all the way home crying and comfort herself with a bottle of wine. Another hole split open, this time around her bulbous thigh. She grimaced an took another step. The fabric around her calves cane undone. Another step. Her other thigh. Another. And another. And another\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd than what remained of her pants fell down to the bottom of the floor, leaving behind Rainbow polka dot underwear in it\u2019s place in food display for Tom to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...so,\u201d Ocellus sighed heavily as she continued to stand like a statue. \u201cI\u2019m fired, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! No, why would you be? Because of...this?\u201d Tom looked at the Changeling a tad incredulously, a trifle offended that she thought him so...superficial. \u201cIt\u2019s a wardrobe malfunction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom did not expect Ocellus to find what he said particularly humorous, but apparently he dis since she started to break out into a fit of muted laughing.\u201cYeah, on the first day meeting my new boss too!\u201d She giggled, but it wasn't a very happy one signified by the single tear that rolled down her chubby cheek. \u201cHaha! My life is freaking over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom fell silent for a moment, pondering on what he could possibly do to remedy this crisis. He tried to think back to to times in his career, and he came up with a solution. Back when he was fresh out of school, the nobles hastily put him on a sub-committee to deal with an international disaster. The Zebras, more wealthy and powerful, decided to launch a war on the poor and unprepared dragons. It was only by casting with bold force that Equestria strongarmed the Zebras into a peace treaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that\u2019s what he would do here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom would be bold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, despite how much you say you hate clothes, I gotta say you have great taste in them.\u201d Tom said after coming up with a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...what?\u201d Ocellus tilted her head to the side as she heard her boss\u2019s statement. She stifled a sniffle and turned around to face him. \u201cWhat are you talking ab-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcellus cut herself off as she called her hooves around her muzzle. Her eyes bugged out and her cheeks went flush with red. Tom was standing in front of her, his belt buckle undone and his pants around his ankles, sporting matching rainbow polka dot undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose great minds think alike.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a solid ten seconds, Ocellus was dead silent. Than, she bursted out laughing, this time for real, as if nothing had happened before to make her embarrassed. Tears rolled down her eyes,  of If sadness, but of out of control ecstasy. Tom smiled with a lighter shade of pink rushing to his cheeks. This is why he was appointed as Ambassador. He got things done, and he did them right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...oh Chrysalis...you...thank you.\u201d Ocellus said, catching her breath after a fur of guffawing. It felt good to laugh after all that just happened. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how much what you did helped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I have a pretty good idea.\u201d Tom nodded, pulling his pants up. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go home and take the rest of the day off? You should not have to work after what just happened. I can take care of the grunt work for my first day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir...I mean Tom,\u201d she corrected. \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, but I couldn\u2019t possibly-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re stomach.\u201d Tom interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy...my stomach?\u201d Ocellus looked down to her chubby middle. Sure enough, it was filling out again with love, pushing against the hem of her undergarments. \u201cYou...Humans don\u2019t have an off switch, do you?\u201d She blushed .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. Now go home, before you get too big for the doorways.\u201d Tom reassured his secretary. She grinned, and walked out of his office in her underwear and a new feeling of confidence about her figure. Tom shut the door behind her and sighed. What a morning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Appleloosa. Equestria's most famous western town, despite geographically being located in the country\u2019s south. Divided between the native buffalo tribes and the ponies, the community was founded from scratch and underwent sudden and rapid population and economic growth. The town\u2019s success can be credited to the soil and climate, which made it attractive to settlers who wanted to earn a quick bit on the apple bucking business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town was never really meant to be a permanent thing, which is why relations between the ponies and the buffalos exist to this day. Doctors came to treat injured legs that bucked too hard, a couple schoolhouses sprung up so that the kids would get an education and stay out of mischief, and by the time the people started building a park they had already set up roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the one thing that tourists to the idyllic prairie town noticed was the distinct absence of restaurants. Sure, there was the Salt Block, but that was more of a bar than place to eat. All the locals just cook from home, using the same recipes that had been passed down for generations, and chalk up visiting frustration to \u2018City-Folk Blues\u2019. It actually got so bad that the train station beld the arriving passengers dry, because they're the only ones who have any food to buy at the snack bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until Tom came to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas \u2018Tom\u2019 Knox. Human, native resident of Manehattan, newest resident of Appleloosa, and enterprising Restaurateur in progress. He heard about it through the \u2018grapevine\u2019 so to say about the restaurant drought in the small town, and saw fit to pack up his things and cash in on the famine by setting up shop. His family had been in the food business for as long as that town has been. His dad was a chef, his mom was a fast food joint manager, so it was only natural that he picked up on their skills. And now he was going to put them to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called the place, \u2018The Chuck Wagon\u2019, mainly to coincide with the towns frontier living lifestyle, and the food he cooks best fits with the whole \u2018roughing it on the trail\u2019 motif. The menu consisted of baked pinto beans, coffee, Chicken fried steak, gravy smothered mashed potatoes, sourdough biscuits, peach cobbler, salted pork, dried beef, and smoky bacon so greasy that it had to be wrapped in a cloth. All of it was so far away from the word \u2018healthy\u2019 that it\u2019s essentially on the diametric other side of the planet, but it his customers never complained, and they always came back for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it stood to reason that the most prevalent thought on Tom\u2019s mind was actually getting someone to stop in for a bite to get hooked. But after a full week of absolutely zilch, he started to regret selling his Manhattan Apartment to finance his little venture. A whole week came and went, and not a single pony, Human, or even tumbleweed came through those doors. Tom gave out a heavy sigh and set his head down on a the counter behind the bar. If this kept up, he was going to be out on the streets in a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ting-a-ling*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...hello? Is this place open?\u201d A voice called out as the bells over the doorway rang their melodic tune. Tom lifted his head up in shock. A customer, finally! Without thinking, he swept his legs over the counter and fell to the hardwood floor with a thud, but that didn\u2019t wipe the smile off his face as he approached his patron. He was a Pony with Pistachio eyes, a coat of gold, and a mane of amber. He could tell his was an Apple bucker by his cowboy attire and the definition of his muscles that only a lifetime of honest, hard work in the sun could give someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning\u2019!\u201d Tom greeted the light yellow pony cordially, getting his attention. \u201cSorry about that, I\u2019m the only one working here as of late. What are ya\u2019 here for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Well\u2026\u201d the pony rubbed the back oh his neck sheepishly. \u201cMah mama wouldn\u2019t like it if she knew if I was here. She\u2019s a great cook and all, but...well I heard about this place, and how it serves more than JUST apples, so I thought I give it a go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m certainly glad you did! Your the first, actually\u2026\u201d Tom trailed off, momentarily getting caught up in his own depression. He shook it off quickly though. No point in bringing this guy down because of his own worries. \u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomethin\u2019 sweet.\u201d The Pony smiled warmly. \u201cI just got back from the field, and I worked up quite a hankering sugary and juicy. Ya\u2019ll got something like that...that ain\u2019t apples?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d Tom returned the smile, making his way to the kitchen already. \u201cJust take your seat anywhere you like, and I\u2019ll have you food out in a couple minutes Mr...I\u2019m so sorry, I never asked for your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBraeburn.\u201d The Apple Bucker smiled with a tip of his hat. \u201cBraeburn Smith\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Tom came back out from the kitchen holding a peculiar treat that Braeburn had never seen before. It looked like Apple pie, but they're was no top so you could see the filling, an orange filling. As the plate was set down on his table, the Appleloosa native grimaced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Tom asked sincerely, noticing the pained look on his first customer\u2019s face. Did he not do it right? He did it just how his mom taught him, so it should at least look okay. The pony looked up at his Human host and forced a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust...not what I\u2019m used to, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Tom felt himself deflate underneath the weight of the statement. \u201cWell...that\u2019s alright! I\u2019ll just get you something else and-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey now, don\u2019t be like that man.\u201d Braeburn stopped atom from grabbing the plate, having a sudden change of heart. \u201cI asked for something that ain\u2019t apples, and that\u2019s what I got. Ain\u2019t your fault I\u2019m a rude guest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove his point, Braeburn dug a big chunk of the orange pie with his fork and stick in his mouth. The moment he did, his eyes almost bugged out his skull. The strange piece of pie washed over his tongue, his mind barraged by the new and intense flavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...how is it?\u201d Tom whispered just loud enough for Braeburn to hear. The Apple farming pony swallowed and licked his lips, a huge grin coming up on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you call this, again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...Peach Cobbler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeach\u2026\u201d Braeburn smiled and rubbed his toned gut in satisfaction. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that is, but I love it!\u201d He took another huge bite of the desert, this time taking less time savoring it\u2019s flavor before swallowing. He already knew it was the best food he had in a long time. In under a minute the rest of the cobbler was gone, save for a few crumbs on the plate, leaving the light gold stallion wanting more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d Braeburn pulled out a sack of bits and forced it into Tom\u2019s hands. It was enough to cover for the food, plus a two hundred percent tip. \u201cYou just earned yourself a regular! I\u2019m gotta tell the whole town about this place!\u201d He got up from his table and walked out the front door with a determined look on his face. Tom felt ecstatic. It felt like the weight on his shoulders this past week have just been lifted away. He made a mental note to stock up extra if Braeburn\u2019s prophecy comes true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...but how the bell did he not know what a Peach was?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Many the cause of a cold sweat in what were once quiet day shifts spent in silence, but at least the cash brought in was a decent motivation to suck it up...that, and the silent praise that it was his dishes bringing in all the ruckus, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mix of all the races known to the quiet, dry plains were wedged into the seats; many of the usual pony folk, catching up on lunches or late breakfasts while chatting casually together, but a few buffalo sat crammed against the tables as well, unable to spare a chance to speak as they endlessly shoveled whatever food was readily available into their maws, their shaggy coats failing to conceal just how freaking big their bodies were underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll filled with a pleased customer, save for a single table near the kitchen, at a spot readily convenient for Tom to travel to and fro from. A spot with three barrels for seats, ready for a specific reservation, but not for a group, yet all to be filled quite soon, any time, now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowdy, Tommy boy!\u201d Sang the very voice, but a minute earlier than the same time yesterday. \u201cGot any of that \u2018pitch\u2019 cobbler stuff on hand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit, Braeburn.\u201d Tom answered cordially, seeing the stallion of the hour squeeze his way through the swinging doors. \u201cI thought you\u2019d know me enough that I always do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and Tom\u2019s scruffed hair and frayed nerves were but a combed hairstyle to the change that took Braeburn over since he\u2019d founded the stop. The infuriatingly fruit-illiterate fruit farmer was always to be seen at the shop nowadays, likely to be feasting on peach cobbler every day since the very first time he\u2019d resolved Tom\u2019s fears of closing down. At first it was mostly a friendly gesture, mainly enabling Braeburn to chat it up with his new friend whilst eating half of a tray, taking the rest out for home as he left, but as the days passed, Braeburn would take out less and less, able to fill up on more with every visit, up until Braeburn would leave whilst patting a stomach bloated with an entire tray. A week after that, those one trays became two, and a week after <i>that,</i>those trays became three...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then Braeburn apparently decided shirts were too restricting, and opted to show his massive self up at the shop half-naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven a few of the biggest buffalo managed a glance at Braeburn waddling past the tables, a few having to drag their own aside to give him room. The formerly fit farmpony\u2019s footsteps shook the silverware and drinking glasses of the other patrons, the dried wood floors bending so loudly that Tom feared that he\u2019d someday plummet into the basement upon entering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at eight feet tall, Braeburn carried a berth that was close to five wide; Tom was a bit too lazy to calculate Braeburn\u2019s true weight on his own, but at the pony\u2019s height, he pictured him having the frame of a human pushing four-hundred and fifty pounds, sporting an  immense, wobbling gut that bulged liberally through the unbuttoned ends of his leather vest, hanging a sizeable distance below his crotch, whilst two rather feminine slabs of blubber sagged where those solid pecs of his once thrived, his arms constricted by the shrunken sleeves they were forced into. All above supported by grossly swollen legs whose thighs each possessed girths to rival a fat man\u2019s waistband, his hands instinctually grappling with the belt to a parachute-sized set of blue jeans that Tom imagined Braeburn ditching someday and showing up butt-naked, his asscrack sculpted by the denim whilst the belt was consumed by his juicy love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no, but we\u2019ve got quite an deal of that \u2018perch\u2019 cobbler you\u2019d enjoyed yesterday, if that\u2019s alright.\u201d Tom passively chided. He didn\u2019t even need to direct Braeburn to his usual seat, only taking out his pad and paper as Braeburn prepped to ready himself for another scarfing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the three barrels together, Tom waited as Braeburn got down to order...and cringed as Brarburn\u2019s gigantic ass sagged over the furthest ends, flexing the wood and metal bindings keeping him supported. His reaction didn\u2019t gop unnoticed, and Braeburn reacted in turn like a shy child...as much as somebody pushing a ton could, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how many would it be today?\u201d Tom asked. \u201cThree? Four?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraeburn\u2019s belly greedily roared at the forethought of food, and the blush on Braeburn\u2019s lard-laden cheeks darkened a few shades as he met Tom with that sheepish smile of his. \u201c...how\u2019s, uh...eight sound? Nine, probably?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pen and pad Tom was holdin g clattered to the floor, and Braeburn\u2019s blush became so red that Tom couldn\u2019t recognize their former yellow color as Tom stood there aghast, but soon blushed at what a poor host he was being and scrambled to pick them back up, giving his best customer a pathetic bow. \u201cCertainly, sir-Brarburn, sir, I\u2019ll get on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraeburn\u2019s mood seemed to lighten up, turning to idly looking about whilst patting his naked gut, but Tom shuffled over to the window and eyed the seven peach cobblers he\u2019d prepped beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Appletart...how about ten more cobblers for table 8?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Oom</i>...\u201d Braeburn partially belched, stroking a belly bloated and round with twelve trays worth of cobbler. \u201cThanks for not kickin\u2019 me out, Tom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs revolting as it\u2019d be for any of the customers to see Braeburn to glut himself so much, Tom\u2019d been entranced a while before the idea to kick Braeburn out could come to fruition, just for sheer sight of seeing somebody\u2019s stomach hold it\u2019s waiter\u2019s weight in cobbler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Braeburn\u2019s weight and gluttony didn\u2019t betray his sense of courtesy, and he grunted to pull something from his back pocket, having to fight against the tight denim before what it was popped out and slammed onto the table; a bag of bits carrying enough to pay both the price and five times the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh...Don\u2019t worry bout it none, bud.\u201d Tom slurred, taking the payment and holding it behind his back. \u201cAnything for my best customer, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraeburn nodded at the sentiment. Normally, now would\u2019ve been the time for Braeburn to get back on his hooves and lumber to the door, off to digest his meal into another hundred pounds of blubber, closer to getting completely stuck in the door when he returned the next day...but this time, Braeburn paused. Not because he was too heavy to move, as Tom first assumed, but because something seemed to be on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, Tom...\u201d He asked. \u201cThere\u2019s a thing or two I was hopin\u2019 to ask you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: For whatever reason, Braeburn needs a place to stay for a week or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: He invites Tom to stay over at his house for a while, to cook for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Out of \u201ccuriosity,\u201d Braeburn \u201chypothetically\u201d asks \u201cfor a friend\u201d how Tom would feel if a guy asked him out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>raeburn didn\u2019t answer Tom right away. Instead, he paused for a couple of moments, slightly content to look down at his new Human friend that seemed to get smaller every time he saw him. His kind had always been rare in this part of Equestria, so it was a bit of a shock to see one opening up Appleloosa\u2019s first restaurant. He looked so...cute when he first saw him. The perfect amount of hair atop his head and bare everywhere else, wide eyes begging to be kept safe and protected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHellooo, Equestria to Braeburn. Come in Braeburn.\u201d Tom waved a hand in front of the fellow ponies face and chuckled as he shook himself out of whatever trance he was in. \u201cWhat happened, dude? You just kinda spaced out they're and...looked at me for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry!\u201d Braeburn blushed with a sheepish smile, trying hard to think of the right way to phrase his question. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...well, ya see, I got this here friend, I was telling him about you and we thought of a \u2018funny\u2019 question to ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Who\u2019s your friend? Maybe you can point him out, I think the whole town might be in here.\u201d Tom smiled and made a sweeping gesture to the incredibly crowded patronage in his restaurant. The whole town\u2019s population may have been an exaggeration, although a more realistic figure would be a fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuh...n-no he ain\u2019t here, b-but that\u2019s alright.\u201d Braeburn inadvertently stuttered, trying to keep his story together. \u201cAnywho, we were just curious, and he wanted me to ask you if...if uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBraeburn?\u201d Tom began to get nervous for his Pony friend. Heads of sweat were running down his forehead and the side of his neck, evan though it wasn\u2019t hot inside at all. \u201cYou look like you sweating up a storm and your under a ceiling fan. Do you need anything? I\u2019m right here and I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d He took Braeburn\u2019s free hand and squeezed it tight, something that always calmed him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I...howwouldyoufeelifyouwereaskedoutbyanotgirl?!\u201d The moment that jumble of words exited Braeburn\u2019s mouth, he instantly clamped a hand around his muzzle in an attempt to push them back in. The scene gained the attention of the patrons in the room. Some turned away, trying to ignore it and go back to their food, while others stared intently, eager to see what happens next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Cherry Tart, Apple Fritter?\u201d Tom called out to his two employees, one of whom was caught staring and the other busying herself with plates of food. \u201cCan you hold down the fort for a few minutes?\u201d Without waiting for a reply, he guided Braeburn back onto his feet and out of the restaurant where it was more private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh said...how would you feel if you got asked out...by a-a not girl\u2026\u201d Braeburn\u2019s face was flush after making a scene in Tom\u2019s place. The two were outside behind the building, the human having chose a spot under a wild bearing Apple tree. \u201cWould you...mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...growing up I didn\u2019t really have what people would call friends. I mean, I had people who I\u2019d go to school with and my parents, but we never really hung out or anything like that.\u201d Tom started after thinking on Braeburn\u2019s question. \u201cSo I guess if I ever had the chance to be with someone...like that, it wouldn\u2019t make much difference who they were and what gender they have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO- oh...well, uh...does that go the same for someone like me?\u201d Braeburn smiled, still feeling embarrassed from what happened, but confident all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid your friend tell you to ask me that, too?\u201d Tom leaned his back onto the tree and lifted one knee over the other cooly, not buying Braeburn\u2019s story for a moment and knowing full well what he trying to say. But there was no rush. Apple critter and Cherry Tart were more than capable to run the Chuck Wagon for a while. The pony had all the time he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh guess...ah guess not!\u201d Braeburn giggled and rubbed the back of his neck with a smile. He tried to avoid Tom\u2019s amused, steely gaze but couldn\u2019t hold it for long. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just curious is all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had been talking to each other every day for the past few weeks, but it was only now that Tom was noticing the way his ears flickers every so often, the way his hair and light yellow fur always managed to stay fluffy, the tone of his muscles still ever present underneath all of that new flab. \u201cS-so...you wouldn\u2019t mind if I ever asked you out...maybe for a couple of drinks at the salt block?\u201d Braeburn gazed down at his human friend, taking a step towards him, pushing his heavy midsection still full of peach cobbler into him and the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm...no, I don\u2019t think I would.\u201d Tom patted Braeburn\u2019s swollen tummy gently, making the surface bounce and bob with butter soft fat. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t think I would mind even if you wanted to go now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-don't you think it\u2019s a little early in the day to go drinking?\u201d Braeburn purred as he bent down to equal out their heights and hug Tom into his belly further with a strong arm, overcome with raw emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have to drink. We could just talk and joke...maybe even dance if you\u2019re feeling up to it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh...ah don\u2019t know how to dance\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither do I. That way we can suck dancing together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...hey Tommy, do ya wanna go out on a date?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He merely remained in place against Thom and the tree, letting them both marinate in the silence. Thom expected, even hoped, that something would break the silence for them, that the patrons of his restaraunt had heard and were about to swarm out in an angry mob, but nobody but a few satisfied orderlies came out, sending no a extra looks their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Braeburn ejected. \u201cThe Salt Block it is, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with anyplace to go.\u201d Thom permitted, debating whether to speak in a friendly or romantic way, but all he could answer with was a dry, pale monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen\u2019re you thinking? An hour from now, I suppose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with half that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe fifteen minutes, then?\u201d Braeburn pressed, then literally did so by moving forward another foot, adding pressure onto his mark. \u201cTen, even?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom, realizing that he was dangerously close to having his chin be trapped between Braeburn\u2019s mantits, stalled in answering at the sight of the ample mounds so near to him, then looked back up with his face dampening in sweat. \u201cI\u2019m down for five, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother step, and Braeburn began sweating as Tom\u2019s face was smooched by his faux mammaries. \u201cMaybe even now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly. Let\u2019s go, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Braeburn replied, but made no effort to move and make route. If anything, the tree tightened up on its wedge against Thom\u2019s spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready when you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat silence again, only mired by a few birds tweeting nearby, with Braeburn\u2019s green eyes locked tight onto Thom\u2019s shy ones, and Thom unable to escape as Braeburn kept enough of his belly\u2019s weight pinned to him so his stomach could come close to completely enveloping the width of the tree, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot gonna hold you up.\u201d Thom injected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLookin\u2019 forward to it.\u201d Braeburn worded once more...and budged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind leading the way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Another few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLead away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty.\u201d Thom could feel his feet going numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t hold you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t hold you back.\u201d The tree emitted a crack, its roots unearthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that the deep-red color blooming under his eyes were his own cheeks, Thom freed up his hands, ready to lead Braeburn there himself to finally get some of the damn beer he was promised in his body...then felt the firm core of food that sat just beneath the beefy lard that aproned Braeburn\u2019s stomach. He could almost count the individual cobblers that\u2019d Brae\u2019d been sold but minutes ago, amassed in a buried sphere containing an entire refrigerator\u2019s bulk of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Braeburn realized what the difference between \u201ccontact\u2019 and \u2018touch\u2019 were, the feeling of Thom\u2019s hands pulling him into lucidity, clarifying the state that his more-than-a-friend was in, and had the idea to back off...but that thought was vetoed when Thom, who didn\u2019t understand what was happening himself, groped his hands underneath the fold hanging on the sides of his belly, guiding his palms upwards to massage around the curvature of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the eight-foot stallion was downed like a cut tree, landing on the ground with a satisfying <i>boom</i> with his body splayed akin to a big, tubby kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom didn\u2019t even realized he liked what he was doing before he leapt up onto the peak of Braeburn\u2019s stomach, but the cross-eyed smile that was splattered on Braeburn\u2019s muzzle made him giggle right back, and the stallion\u2019s lips couldn\u2019t twist around to put the satisfied purr that emanated from his throat into words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom spread his legs apart so his own stomach could nestle into where Braeburn\u2019s exposed naval lay, and splayed his arms out to hug the entire horizon to Brarburn\u2019s belly, his arms coursing up and down, conforming to its curvature and snuggling against his love handles and the underside to his make bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so much happening all at once for him to describe; the cushy exterior to Braeburn\u2019s gut, the fuzziness of his coat, and the goddamned adorable grub on Braeburn\u2019s face that made Thom okay with never eating, drinking, or sleeping if starving to death meant getting to cuddle Braeburn for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Braeburn\u2019s large hand came down between Thom\u2019s shoulder blades and guiding his head down against his chest, leaving no part of Thom\u2019s form without any contact with soft yellow. His cheeks went flush as they felt the tuft of fur between Braeburn\u2019s flabby pecs; even if he was covered in fur, Thom felt as though he was forcibly nuzzling the hairiest chest he\u2019d ever felt, but the way their tips tickled against his eyelids delighted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting his muzzle\u2019s jaw on Thom\u2019s hair, Braeburn gave his most happy sigh, easily one of the two most comfortable folks in town.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thom rested atop Braeburn\u2019s fuzzy, flabby stomach and chest, his arms and legs splayed outwards in an effort to hug and squeeze as much of the yellow flesh as possible. He let out a sigh of utter contentment as he nuzzled his head against his sudden but no less loved boyfriend's jawline, eliciting a quiet giggle from above. Everything about the light gold stallion was just so...adorable, a fact that the human perched atop his torso wished he realized sooner. His brilliant orange mane, his pistachio colored eyes that one couldn't help but lose themselves into, the way his already puffed up cheeks inflated further whenever he gave his signature, ear-to-ear grin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I might be falling in love with you.\u201d Thom said out of the blue, putting both of his hands down on Braeburn\u2019s flabby pecs to life his body up. The earth pony craned his head up to meet the human\u2019s gaze, a small smile creeping up on his thick jaw. Delicately, his pressed his muzzle into Thom\u2019s chest and let out a soft whinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm...what can I do to shorten that down to \u2018I love you\u2019?\u201d Braeburn purred, sliding his muzzle across Thom\u2019s neck until he stopped at his face to plant a little lick-kiss on his cheek. The human shuddered slightly, not used to the type of pleasure the pony was giving him and trying hard to keep up a cool front. Inside, however, he was a veritable mess of endorphins and love, wanting nothing more than to lay on top of his friend forever and ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I want to make sure this isn't a crush.\u201d Thom forced the words out of his mouth, indifferent to the few customers exiting his restaurant letting out their respected noises of endearment at the sight of the both of them. \u201cI want to say that I love you, I really, REALLY do...but I\u2019m scared that my mind is playing tricks on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraeburn smiled thinly, a tad...hurt that Thom didn't trust him enough to assure his feelings were genuine, but understood the fear that kept him from crossing that mental border. He was afraid of letting someone into his life where he was the most vulnerable, where the most damage could be dealt. For that reason, he was willing to take things slow for now, even if the pony was very, very eager to start. \u201cAlrighty, Tommy.\u201d The stallion let out a sigh across the human\u2019s face. His breath smelled like peaches and sugar. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be more confident with a few mugs of cider in ya\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Thom\u2019s entire world shifted as Braeburn lifted himself back onto his two legs with relative ease, almost completely unhindered by the several hundred pounds of plush blubber weighing down his body. With a puffy arm holding his human in place, the light gold pony walked with a spring in his step towards the only bar in town: The Salt Block. You know, I\u2019m perfectly capable of walking.\u201d Thom quipped, shuffling a tad in Braeburn\u2019s grasp to get more comfortable against his furry chest. His captor looked down with a coy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but than I wouldn't get to hold ya\u2019 like a teddy bear~\u201d Braeburn pressed Thom evan further into his faux mammaries, getting a kick how the human attempted in vain to not get flustered and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the outside of The Salt Block, the place looked modest, cheerful, and welcoming. Clay and stone beams made up the building\u2019s outer structure, supporting the terrace on the second story and keeping the old, splintery wood facade from falling in on itself. It's tough to see through the large, curtained windows, but the happiness and joy from within could be felt from the outside. Braeburn smiled, having visited this establishment enough times to call it a second home. For Thom, this would be his first time. He wasn't much of a drinker, but the happy atmosphere emanating from the inside tempted him to make a one time exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two entered the building, and after Braeburn wiggled his body free after getting stuck in the doorway for a couple of seconds, they were almost immediately welcomed by cheerful, vaudeville style singing and a feeling of comfort. The bartender is handling some customers, but still manages to welcome the pair with a wave. The patrons of the bar were not as bloated as Thom\u2019s number one customer, but the effects of his food could be seen on their bodies nevertheless. The whole town seemed to be slowly getting fatter because of his cooking, but no one seemed to mind too much, or evan at all. Some ponies recognized the town\u2019s only human and tipped their hat in a warm greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tavern was as engaging inside as it was on the outside. Tables were made out of old, apple tree stumps with soft, candlelit lamps placed atop. The wall were completely barren, besides the lighting, most likely because customers stumble against the walls too often and would knock off anything on the walls. The whole place was packed, most likely due to the place recently serving food after seeing how popular the Chuck Wagon was doing in business. Thom was more than happy to share the monopoly he had over the town, it was much more easy to serve half the populace than all of it. Several long tables are occupied by seperate groups of people, all enjoying themselves, but they keep to themselves. The other, smaller tables are also occupied by people who seem to be enjoying themselves a lot, perhaps too much, if such a thing is possible. Even most of the stools at the bar are occupied, though nobody seems to mind more company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraeburn took a seat down at the bar as soon as a he saw an empty stool. The wooden furniture creaked ominously under his weight, but stood upright just the same. Thom was relegated to sit down on whatever space in the pony\u2019s lap that wasn't taken up by his bulging belly. </span></div></div>",

All the more of an excuse to have his arm wrapped around Thom, the dwarved human resorting to be sitting  on the assfat that sagged out from his side, left with no other space to be seated with the titanic Earthpony\u2019s belly sat crammed against the bar enough that it was being eaten by one of its folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Thom cared, or could really argue. Literally sitting on his date\u2019s hip was barely a thought compared to the feat of, despite drinking almost Thom\u2019s weight in the brain-poisoning fluid, Braeburn barely acknowledging the booze outside of a red tint rising through his golden fur and a playful gleam in his peridot eyes, gladly making near-constant eye contact with his flabbergasted date as more and more cider was absorbed through his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few assorted guests to the Salt Block would occasionally stop by to see the display for themselves, as curious as anybody would be at Braeburn\u2019s rate of consumption, but only responded by nudging one another and slyly sharing a few good-natured quips; clearly a repeat site around these parts. It wasn\u2019t embarrassing for Thom; it all just felt like the same merry ambience that filled the bar with life and fun, but all it did was make him feel like the last sober man in Equestria; despite the occasional drink here and there, he\u2019d never really drank himself into a stupor before, and that last errant of virginity was all that kept him from getting into the same mood as his date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019all ain\u2019t just gonna keep staring until I pass out, are you?\u201d Braeburn asked, tracing a circle around Thom\u2019s spine that made him shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No, listen, I\u2019m really sorry...\u201d Thom uttered. Even if the Salt Block seemed like a jovial hangout, he desperately wished he hadn\u2019t agreed on drinking as a first outing, if just to keep himself from ruining Braeburn\u2019s night. Top it all off with his first date being with a male, a male who wasn\u2019t <i>human,</i> of all things... \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve never really <i>drank</i> drank before, and...I\u2019m just kinda nervous, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrarburn gave a deep belly laugh that sloshed the contents of his belly around, shaking up an errant of gas that passed his teeth in belch. \u201cAh, who\u2019s there to be nervous around? Yer probably the most sober person in the entire joint!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than let Thom reason his way out, Braeburn looked to the bartender and smacked a hand right on the wooden surface. In a rehearsed action, the barman gathered several mugs of cider and slid them down to join the emptied ones before them, gathering the latter to clean them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom\u2019s lips parted to offer one last word of caution, but Braeburn eshoved a mug into his hands as he took one up for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrarburn, I really don\u2019t-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Brarburn grunted in a tone that somehow argued his point before it could begin, his lips kissing the rim of the mug. With a staunch look in his eye, he seemingly directed Tom to follow his lead as he tipped the mug back and sipped at the cider within, starting in thin gulps. Cautiously, but almost in tune with his date\u2019s movements, Thom followed suit, wincing slightly at the sweet, yet strong flavor of the foaming brew,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>...glp...glp...glp...</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHhhhheeeeeeehhhhhhhh...\u201d Thom wheezed giddily, a hiccup shaking his form that sent ripples against the bulging yellow globe he was greedily nuzzling. \u201cY\u2019know, I thing I do luv ya, man...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraeburn knew it was a partial victory, seeing as Thom was too drunk to even drink past his first and only mug of cider, but he considered it a head start nonetheless. The cider that now flowed in his veins had turned his blush so dark that it robbed his fur of their yellow hue, having <i>doubled</i> what he\u2019d downed overnight and expanding his stomach to twice its previous size, adding two or three extra feet of belly ahead of him that his boyfriend was marking as his territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough Thom\u2019s blurry vision, Braeburn almost looked like he was twenty-so feet in height and that he was only a few inches tall, clinging onto his mountainous exterior for dear life. What was once a strange curiosity for Braeburn\u2019s growth over the past month now ran rampant without any sobriety to keep it contained, wanting nothing more for the love...yes, there was no doubt about it. The <i>love</i> of his life to get bigger, and bigger, and bigger, even if it meant he had to slave away at an oven all day to keep his fatass from getting hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing only tipsy enough that he could perceive enough of the world around him, Braeburn heard plenty of humored chatter surrounding them; some snickering, some even fawning about how adorable the two looked, and beamedm filled with too much joy and cider to make him care if they were that angry mob he\u2019d expected earlier.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been only a short time since Thom mustered up enough vigor to finish off his frothy mug of hard cider, but for the newly made couple, every minute with together felt like an eternity. Maybe it was because Braeburn recognized that time was getting away from them, or maybe he just felt that now was the right time to lay down and digest, but with a content sigh, he hoisted his denim covered posterior off from the barstool with his human clinging onto his alcohol filled gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s uh\u2026*urp* getting kinda late\u2026\u201d Braeburn chuckled with a dopey look in his eyes as he relinquished his hold on Thom, the human sliding off the slope of his stomach to the hardwood floor feet first. \u201cI don\u2019t think my...mama would like me comin\u2019 home TOO drunk, hehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty than\u2026.\u201d Thom looked up at Braeburn\u2019s intoxicated face with a flushed smile. \u201cSame time tomorrow at the Chuck Wagon? I hear that fatty food are good for a liquor damaged stomich...stemuch-Wow, I really am drunk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might have been the alcohol in his system taking action for him, or maybe it was the added confidence that broke down any barrier of shyness, but without much of a warning Braeburn suddenly bent down and grabbed Thom up by his sides once again and sat him on top of his bloated wrecking ball of a belly. Before the human could register what had just happened, he found his mouth being invaded by the obese pony\u2019s tongue. After only a half a second of hesitation, he returned the kiss, only for his love to pull away all too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I might drop by a little bit earlier~\u201d Braeburn gave Thom a wink as he set the Human back down on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m one of those fellas who don\u2019t get hungover...I get hungry.\u201d With that, the golden pony tipped his hat to the bartender, who was always good for his tab around here and turned to exit the establishment, leaving a dazed, happy, and drunk Thom standing on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHungover...hungry...hungrover-God, I\u2019m drunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom did eventually find his way back to his restaurant slash home, having taken up residence in the basement of the building, where the slightly overworked Appletart and Cherry Fritter quickly slapped the drunk from their boss and put him back to bussing tables and cooking the food. The alcohol finally hit his brain like a ton of bricks to the had, but like a trooper he carried on, with no regrets about what had happened to get that wicked hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite nursing a headache, tired as hell, and having vomited a few times, Thom spent the rest of the workday smiling, his frayed nerves surprisingly absent. He paid his workers their hard earned bits and bid them good night, as he closed up the shop and ventured downstairs to his basement dwelling. It was a modest affair, but no less of a home with all the important fixtures...more or less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom couldn't deny the feelings he had for Braeburn were real. Before, he had the scary thought that it was just something shallow, but a drunk man\u2019s words are a sober person\u2019s thoughts, and with some alcohol still left coursing through his veins he came to that conclusion happily. He was head over heels in love. That night, he slept better than he had in a long time, the first good night's sleep since he came to Appleloosa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Thom didn't fully realize that he was in the middle of a dream. The human blinked as he took note of his immediate mental surroundings. He was inside some sort of hybrid between a castle and a barn, with round, marble columns placed on top of a wooden, hay-covered floor, and brilliant chandeliers were hung from the rafters. He was dressed in a chef\u2019s uniform, and when he tried to pinch himself to see if this was a dream, he didn\u2019t feel anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the great room sat the dream version of Braeburn in his throne, with some slight changes from how he was in real life. One, he was an alicorn, complete with a pair of wings and a horn, with a masculine crown where his Stetson hat is usually placed. Two, aside from the crown, he was completely exposed to the elements, wearing no clothes and leaving his golden furred body completely bare, wearing no clothes and leaving his golden furred body exposed Three, and most obviously, he was the size of a semi-trailer. Where earlier Thom fantasized that a twenty foot Braeburn was big, this one was around fifty feet tall, with a frame of a human pushing half of a ton and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountainous pony was currently asleep, his heaving chest and bulging stomach rising and falling in synchronization with each inhales and exhales of air. Thom looked up, up, up at Braeburn\u2019s face and found it so peaceful and tranquil. Without even thinking, he walked to the front of where his boyfriend's gut touched the floor and embraced it, letting his body be enveloped by the fuzzy, warm flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, Thom woke up from his dream in a cold sweat, not quite as hungover from yesterday, but still reeling from the cider\u2019s effects. The human reasoned that the alcohol messed with his brain last night, which would explain why that particular dream felt so...different. Even as he got ready for the day and began setting up the restaurant for the incoming breakfast rush, he could remember what he saw last night in vivid detail. He was lucid, he knew he was dreaming...so why didn't he wake up when he pinched himself? Maybe he was putting too much thought on it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it was more than a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, Thom\u2019s thoughts were interrupted as the same pony he dreamt of last night entered his restaurant...</span></div></div>",

They were massive, and leaking, as the puddles beneath them indicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same proportions, but slightly shorter, was the midnight blue one, whose breasts appeared to be dripping a more constant stream of milk than the other one.

The guard had various shield, sword, and spear themed ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was depositied at the sea the of the thrones and he slowly looked up, and saw the two princesses looking a tree him with interest.

A human turning up in the Everfree apparently was a pretty big deal, because it was full of monsters or something like that. And get this. The locals were afraid of the fact that the plants and animals in there took care of themselves and grew all on their own.<br>\r\nWhen the news got out that you came out of there, the locals weren't the most trusting of folks. In fact, there had been a bit of an uproar that the weird monkey child was going to be sharing a space with their foals. The resentment had mostly quieted down, however, when a certain purple pony and her friends came to your defense. Though you'd still get looks from the townsfolk every now and again.<br>\r\nThat left you with your current predicament: you were basically homeless and considered a minor, so you were stuck until some pony came in to adopt you. There weren't too many ponies who were up for giving you a permanent home. The few who were all turned out to be... \"unfit\" to put it mildly. Weirdly, they were also all invariably single mares. Isn't that weird? They explained to you something about a gender imbalance or something, but you hadn\u2019t really listening. At least the orphanage staff were pretty nice, if a bit standoffish.<br>\r\nAnyway, back to the present.<br>\r\nA sweet sounding female voice pierced through the wooden door. \"Anonymous, get up, sweetie. We've got another interview today, so I need you to be up and attem'.\"<br>\r\nYou heard the telltale clopping of hooves as the voice behind the door left, and with a heavy sigh you got up from the bed and shuffled your way to the door. Looks like you were in for another fabulous day in the land of sunshine and rainbows.<br>\r\nThe door creaked as you stepped through into the hallway. Around you were already a few staff members walking around doing their business. At the end of the hallway was where the other pony children would sleep. You were a special case so you got a room all to your own, a fact that some of the foals seemed to resent you for. So much for making friends.<br>\r\nYour destination was the interview room, the place where potential adopters would get the chance to make their case for adoption; a place you were all too familiar with.<br>\r\nYou nodded as a cleaner looked up and gave you a sympathetic look before you entered the interview room. Sitting at the desk was Sleepy Smile, your case manager. In the other seat was a pony wearing a tasteful black hat with pink trim and bows, but nothing to cover her voluptuous body. She was currently filing her fingernails while waiting for you to enter.<br>\r\nMs. Smile looked upon you entering and um... smiled. \"Anonymous, please do come in and have a seat. I have a special guest here who I'd like you to meet.\"<br>\r\nYou shuffled into the room, dragging your feet, and sat down in the chair next to the mystery pony.<br>\r\nJust as your butt hit the seat the mare said, \"Theeeeere. That ought to do it. I wanted to have my finger nails done before coming, but I hadn't realised the appointment would be so dreadfully early, so I rushed.\"<br>\r\nMs. Smile tittered. \"Well, as long as you look your best...\"<br>\r\nThe mare turned to face you and gave you a warm smile. \"Hello there, darling. I believe we met once before, but I never got to speak to you in full. My name is Rarity.\" She put out her hand for you to shake.<br>\r\nYou didn't take it. Even after all this time, you were still a little apprehensive about these ponies, especially their blatant nudity. Interestingly, she seemed unperturbed by this and withdrew her hand into her naked lap.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Rarity has applied to become your new parent, dearie. Isn't that exciting? She has a real reputation for acts of kindness and generosity around these parts, so I feel like you two might be a good fit together.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh darling, you flatter me, but please do go on.\" Rarity chuckled with a slight blush.<br>\r\nYou weren't so sure of it, but Rarity seemed nice enough for you to give her a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleepy Smile shuffled the papers on her desk and cleared her throat.<br>\r\n\"Now that everyone is present and accounted for, we should begin, don't you think?\"</span></div></div>",

You answered your questions the best you could, and so did Rarity. The way she answers \u2013 her words \u2013 they promised reassurance and nurture, but there was something behind that smirk, that smile of hers... that smirk-!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly gasped, surprised. Ms. Smile asked, \"Is there something wrong, Anon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goodness, is something wrong, dear?\" Rarity asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! Nothing is wrong,\u201d you reply nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" The mare nods slightly. \"Then let's continue, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sudden outburst wasn't out of pain or surprise but it was from... touching coming from the mare next to you. Rarity. The one that wants to adopt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has her palm rubbing your thighs, really close to your crotch, caressing your legs gently. However, soon her palm found its way to your crotch, rubbing your parts through your clothing. This was one of the reasons why most Ponies here shun you. Beside them being untrusting of anything that is alien, ponies were nudists and clothes are considered as an accessory for special occasions or mark of higher social status. Having none of that, your insisting on being dressed all the time was considered rather rude and impertinent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parts reacted, twitching as she continues to massage your crotch. You got goosebumps and excitement started to grow on you. This is where the matron notices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, look at him. He's excited!\" gushed the matron. Did she see? Surely she had to, and yet she gave no indication that this was in any way abnormal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, dear. I am excited, too. I can't wait to take you to a loving home. You don't know how long I've been waiting to get this opportunity!\" That was strangely sultry... something that the matron didn't see or decided to ignore. Also why did her eyes look more... glazy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. The moment he came to the orphanage, we received an increase of possible ponies that were looking to adopt, mostly for him. Unfortunately, most of their intentions tended to be... less than noble. The last mare that came here was Spoiled Rich. I wrote her off after the few questions she... answered. She wasn't looking for a son, but more of a servant or pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I understand. How unfortunate that such rotten souls exist to exploit such an innocent face.\" You might have believed the sincerity of her words if she weren\u2019t still squeezing your thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, Ms. Rarity. Looking at the interview so far, it seems very promising. In fact, why not cut to the chase already!\" Ms. Smiles, well... smiles at you two and presents her hand to Rarity, who accepted. \"I'm pleased to make it official. Congratulation Ms, Rarity. You're now the legal guardian of Anon.\" The alabaster unicorn looked quite pleased, not noticing her horn flaring slightly with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all happened so quickly, and now it was done. You now belong to a possible child molester...</span></div></div>",

A bit of an odd profession, given the reluctance of most ponies to wear clothing, but somehow she managed to thrive nonetheless.<br>\r\nThe carriage ride itself was short but awkward, with Rarity smiling at you all the while saying nothing about what had just happened at the orphanage. Yet all the while you got the feeling that she was undressing you with her eyes. The carriage pulled in front of a funny looking white and blue building that looked like a circus tent surrounded by carousel horses, and Rarity said, \"This is our stop, dear.\"<br>\r\nYou opened up the door and stepped out, standing and taking in scenery. It really was a nice place, situated near the center of town with not a lot of other buildings nearby.<br>\r\nRarity got out after you, and after getting out and paying the driver, the carriage pulled away and she walked up right next to you. \"It really is a nice place, isn't it? When I first purchased the shop it was in terrible disrepair. It took me months and a hefty sum of money to fix it, but look at it now! Now it's the shining jewel of all Ponyville.\" She leaned in close and put an arm around your shoulder. \"You're going to love it here. I promise.\"<br>\r\nRarity took hold of you and walked you inside. Upon stepping t through the double doors of her shop Rarity suddenly whirled you around and pulled you tightly into her naked, plus sized breasts. Her voice was filled with emotion as she spoke. \"I can't believe it. A son of my very own! I do hope that you will find it in you to call me 'Mom' or 'Mommy'. Whichever you choose would be fine with me. I promise that I will do everything in my power to give you the happy home life you deserve.\"<br>\r\nRarity sniffed as she released you, then began to lead you by the hand deeper into her home.<br>\r\n\"Now then...\"</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d been adjusting to the way these ponies so casually went around in the nude. Ms. Smile rarely wore more than a bowtie and the foals were always nude. Rarity was no different, preferring to walk around in her birthday suit. However, something about her body language was starkly different from the others. It was like she was being actively naked, like she knew what her body was doing to him and taking full advantage of that. He\u2019d barely even followed what she\u2019d been saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity sighed as she looked him over with an appraising eye. \u201cAs much as I\u2019m sure you love looking fashionable, there\u2019s nothing quite like feeling the open air against your bare form. Wouldn\u2019t you like to be naked with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnon gulped. \u201cUh, what if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity tilted her head in confusion, her ears flopping adorably to one side. \u201cDon\u2019t want to? But surely you feel stifled under all that fabric. And, if I might be honest, darling, those garments are far from flattering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnon shook his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t want to get naked. And I definitely don\u2019t want to be <i>inside</i> you, whatever that means.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness me.\u201d Rarity cupped a hand over her cheek. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have to write a letter to Mayor Mare. Ms. Smile has clearly been slacking when it comes to educating her charges.\u201d She heaved a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you uncomfortable, darling. Truly I am. I, well\u2026 I\u2019ve been looking forward to this for so long, and I\u2019d hoped you would be better informed before we begin,\u201d she said, again sounding perfectly sincere. Although her eyes still had that hint of longing, maybe Anon had misread the intent behind it. \u201cIf you\u2019ll trust me enough to have a seat,\u201d she motioned beside her, \u201cit would be my privilege to explain things.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Let me cook you a succulent meal to celebrate the occasion!\" Rarity says happily as she takes deeper into the building, upstairs to the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, you reasoned, this wasn\u2019t that bad. At least you had a roof over your head and means to feed. You hoped that she can cook meat. The human body needs meat and iron to remain healthy. Your matron gave you other sources of iron, but you kind of miss cooked beef and chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took you to the kitchen as her horn shone with azure light. The stoves turned on and plates and pans flew about and around. Meanwhile, she manually looks for the right ingredients from the fridge and cabinets, never paying a second thought to you staring at her exposed figure. Ever since coming here, it took you by surprise to know that magic was very much real thing here. You were a fierce believer of it and you often thought that the Vatican was hiding the truth. However, here it was plain easy to see that it was real alongside the experience you got when entering into this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where did I leave that thing?\" she murmured then turned to you. \"I might not be a perfect chef as I am seamstress and fashionista.

Rarity's voice had caught you off guard. You didn't think she would've noticed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity giggled at your reaction.\"Oh don't you worry. We unicorns have a sixth sense about these sorts of things. I know that a growing boy like yourself can get curious about some things, so go ahead and look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to, and the next few moment's of the meals preparation were spent in a terribly awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anon, lunch is served. Eat up, darling, and be sure to tell me how it tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Anon ate, Rarity took the time to critically look over her new son. The worst part about him was the <i>smell</i>, although 'worst' might not be the best term for it. Rarity had, like most ponies, a highly developed sense of smell. This, along with their keen sense of hearing, was an evolutionary holdover from when ponies still lived in fear of predation, and thus needed to be able to run away at a moment's notice. These senses also held for finding mates when their season rolled around. Although neither was all that common in modern times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis natural male scent smelled, in the crude parlance of the vernacular, like \"sex on wheels\". It was an utterly intoxicating smell that would only intensify if he relieved himself and neglected to wash. To a mare in heat, it was like a siren's call saying \"hey look at me, I have a set of cock and balls, please come and molest me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was surprised that mares weren't lining up and crawling over each other to try and tear his pants off. In fact, she could tell that he had relieved himself right before the interview started. Rarity's nethers tingled just <i>thinking</i> about it. Then again, that had likely been the case, but the matron had just done a good job of fending off the worst of them. Luckily for Rarity, she had rather exceptional <i>credential</i> that were persuasive enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor boy wasn't even aware of the effect he had on ponies. He's like a walking talking sex magnet. Whenever he enters a room or public space, he instantly becomes just as much an object of desire as an object that needed to be protected. This seemed even more so than the other colts who were on their own and vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Needless to say that when she started sending him to school, she had a feeling that he was going to be very popular with the fillies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the matter of the manticore attack. They had shown her pictures of what happened and the whole affair made her sick to her stomach. Not only had the attack been brutal, which most likely left the boy traumatized, but the reaction of some of the townspeople after the incident was downright atrocious and shameful. That was what ultimately led her to adopt him for her very own, so that she could give him a happy and loving home life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnon catches Rarity staring<br>\r\nThings are pleasant for now as Rarity waits for the right time<br>\r\nRarity set her plans in motion<br>\r\nRarity can\u2019t wait any longer</span></div></div>",

However, eventually, faint voices started to cut through that placid silence\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... I don\u2019t know! It just fell from the sky! A few inches to the left, and it would\u2019ve destroyed my fruit cart!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEwwww, what is it? It looks like some sort of\u2026 monkey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 think it will be angry when it wakes up? I hope not\u2026 I hear that primates are way tougher than they look!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes slid slightly open, and through the blinding light, you could just faintly make out the strangely huge and round silhouettes of strange people looming over you. Eventually, a louder voice rung out. \u201cOkay, everypony! Back away to a safe distance! Let us handle this!\u201d The figures looming over you backed away, and soon, another, even larger one was blocking out your field of view. \u201cDon\u2019t get too close. We don\u2019t know where this thing came from! We have no idea what kind of exotic diseases that it could have, which we would have no antibodies against \u2014 Pinkie, what are you doing!? Stop <i>poking</i> it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we have to make sure the poor thing is still alive, don\u2019t we, silly billy?\u201d A higher-pitched voice rung out, as you felt yourself get gently poked in the chest. That stopped when you groaned audibly. \u201cSee? It <i>is</i> alive! I\u2019ve been nothing but helpful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first voice groaned, but seeing that it was safe, it tentatively leaned down to start feeling over various parts of your body, as if inspecting you. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not detecting any traces of magic, so we know it can\u2019t use spells. In fact\u2026 I\u2019m not sensing <i>any</i> trace at all. Clearly, this creature couldn\u2019t come from anywhere in Equestria, or at least some of the latent magical energy in the air would\u2019ve rubbed off on it at some point\u2026\u201d She reported. \u201cMost life signs are normal, but the poor thing seems to have some staggered breathing. Dash, could you hand me a health potion?\u201d Soon, you felt a strange bottle be brought up to your lips, as a cool, soothing liquid was poured down your thirsty throat\u2026 and all of a sudden, a wave of vitality and energy came crashing into you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling healthier and more rejuvenated than ever before, you suddenly loudly gasped for fresh air, startling the figures around you as you suddenly sit up! You were left panting, your eyes slowly adjusting to the blinding sunlight\u2026 but once you could finally discern the figures standing over you, your heart started to sink your chest. Indeed, you were just as shocked by their unfamiliar forms as they were by your\u2019s! You almost couldn\u2019t believe they were real! But your mind couldn\u2019t deny it, when they were standing right before you. They looked kind of like horses, but with human bodies, all covered in fur that seemed to be all sorts of weird colors. The horse resemblance was only superficial, too; as they had quite short, gentle, rounded snouts, and huge, bright, expressive eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd most embarrassingly: they were naked! You had never seen a woman naked before, and yet suddenly, here were six of them; six pairs of big, pillowy breasts for your eyes to soak in, leaving you blushing and light-headed! They were all at least 6 feet tall, towering over you, and all had quite pudgy figures; the pink one was probably the fattest of them all, with a belly bigger than your entire body and hips more than three times wider than your shoulders, and the blue rainbow-haired one was probably the thinnest, with a more chubby figure with firm muscle beneath all that chubbiness. And standing in front of them all was a purple one, with a great big, pointy horn, and two huge wings folded behind her back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped as you realized that you <i>yourself</i> were also naked, and immediately tried to cover yourself with your hands, especially as you realized you could feel blood rushing to your crotch. You\u2019d always had quite the\u2026 <i>fascination</i> with pudgy ladies\u2026 and having six of them shamelessly naked before you, human or not, was overloading to your pubescent mind! The six seemed befuddled by your actions, but didn\u2019t make much of it. \u201cWell, hello there, little guy,\u201d the purple one said, giving you a light smile and leaning down to try and comfort you. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? Can you talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re too overwhelmed by these strange (and sexy) creatures to even be able to muster any words. It felt like your brain was fried! All you could do was sit there, staying wide-eyed at the women. \u201c... ah don\u2019t think this thing can talk,\u201d the orange one said in a deep southern accent rubbing her chin contemplatively. \u201cJust our luck. Doubt we\u2019ll ever figure out just where the darned thing came from now! Well, what should we do with \u2018em?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy dontchya just give em to me? My diet could always use a little more lean meat! Hah!\u201d The blue one laughed, rubbing her chubby belly\u2026 but she frowned when the orange one gave her a death glare. \u201cWhat? I was just joking! Yeesh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the pink one, excitable as ever, continued on that line of thought! \u201cIf anybody\u2019s gonna eat \u2018em, it should be me!\u201d She insisted, cooing and licking her lips at the though. \u201cMake cover them in frosting, or dip them in liquid chocolate\u2026 mmm, yummy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now, Pinkie,\u201d the white and purpled-maned one rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not candy, it\u2019s meat. It\u2019d go better on a bed of lettuce with smoked paprika and ancho chile, maybe with a nice glass of chardonnay\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to be eating this one-of-a-kind specimen!\u201d The big purple one finally replied, exasperated. \u201cIf it really isn\u2019t sentient, it can at least be used for research into the-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d You finally managed to squeak one, silencing the women as they turn and stare at you. \u201cI\u2026 can talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all seemed to brighten up at that. \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t ya just say so?\u201d The orange one asked, placing her hand on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe poor little dear is clearly still disoriented. He quite literally fell from the sky, after all! And from the sound of his voice, he is just a child. We\u2019re probably overwhelming him!\" The white-furred one replied, in a quite smooth, velvety voice, like one of a refined gentlewoman. She stepped forward, her pristine white fur shining beneath the sun; her fur seemed perfectly groomed, and her body perfectly cultivated so that, while she was quite pudgy, her figure was as round and smooth and pristine as possible. \u201cAllow me to introduce myself, little guy. My name is Rarity \u2014 enchant\u00e9e!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink one bumbled forward and hip checked Rarity to the side. \u201cAnd I\u2019m Pinkie Pie, at your service!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Applejack,\u201d the orange one said, before hooking an arm around the blue one, \u201cand my friend here\u2019s Rainbow Dash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Fluttershy\u2026\u201d came a voice from the back, from a light yellow mare who had thus far been staying quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Twilight Sparkle, the princess of friendship here in Equestria,\u201d the purple one said, gesturing to herself with an air of pride. \u201cNow, it\u2019s your turn. Do you think you could tell us your name, little one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had your eyes clenched shut at this point, trying your hardest not to look at their bodies, especially those doughy breasts. You were blushing deeply, able to feel their own eyes tracing over your naked form. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 Thomas!\u201d You managed to reply, your mind still struggling to process what was happening. Even the world around you seemed different; everything seemed so soft and cartoony, and the colors were all so bright and vivid compared to the world you were used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThomas\u2026 huh! That\u2019s such a peculiar name. Never heard anything quite like it before\u2026\u201d Twilight Sparkle said, taking a mental note to investigate further into the strange naming conventions of this newly discovered species. You shudder as she took your hand, and helped you stand up! You kept your other hand clasped over your crotch. You couldn\u2019t believe nobody else seemed to mind all the nudity! \u201cAnd, no offense or anything, Thomas, but I simply must ask\u2026 just what <i>are</i> you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a\u2026 human,\u201d you reply. There\u2019s a quiet gasp from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026 human! Such a quaint name,\u201d Twilight nodded, thoughtfully. \u201cWell, you might just be the very first of your kind in all of Equestria, if my memory of the zoological records is accurate. Goodness, there\u2019s all sorts of tests I need to run! I need to collect data before-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity stepped in, placing a hand on Twilight\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNow, now, darling, lets not get ahead of ourselves, here. This human seems to be essentially a colt! I doubt he\u2019s yet a teenager. And he\u2019s all alone, waking up in such a strange place\u2026 his welfare should come before any fancy experiments,\u201d she said, and Twilight sheepishly nodded, seeing the wisdom in Rarity\u2019s words. With that, Rarity gently wrapped an arm around you, hugging you up against the side of her squishy body! It was supposed to calm you down, but it really did the opposite, getting your heart racing as you felt your size get pressed against her pudgy hip! \u201cNow, little one. Would you happen to have any parents, by any chance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced sadly at the question. \u201c... no\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of the excitement was drained from the six woman, replaced with frowns of sympathy for you as they realized what you meant. \u201cOoh, you poor dear\u2026\u201d Rarity turned and sat on her knees, gently taking your cheeks in her hands as she had you look into her beautiful eyes. Luckily, she didn\u2019t notice how burning red your cheeks were, as her breasts were just inches away from your own chest. \u201cPerhaps it was fate that ordained that you would be sent to us, then! No child should have to survive all alone. I don\u2019t know where you came from, but here in Equestria, you will be treated with nothing but love, and be well cared for. We\u2019ll get you a loving family in no time!\u201d</span></div></div>",

You mean like\u2026 a <i>mom</i>!?\u201d She gasped, her eyes widening, the massive mare\u2019s entire demeanor becoming overcome with excitement! \u201cOoooh! I\u2019ve always wanted to be a mom! Get over here, sweetie!\u201d You let out a startled yelp as the massive woman dashed towards you, her hoofsteps shaking the ground beneath you! Before you could react, she had grabbed you with incredible strength, hugging you against her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven among the ponies, Pinkie was absolutely massive plump! Which left you completely smothered in pillowy, doughy, fluffy fat, your body tensing up as she squished your head inbetween her huge, comfy breasts, your crotch being pressed up against her massive, round, gurgly tummy. She cooed and practically purred as she swayed back and forth with your smaller body in her arms, as she planted big smooches all over your face, painting your cheeks with her pink lipstick. \u201cAheh\u2026 careful not to smother the poor boy,\u201d Rarity chuckled, a bit taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Pinkie Pie was overwhelmed with joy at the thought of being a mother! \u201cOooh! My very own little boy! I\u2019m gonna snuggle you and kiss you and name you Muffinberry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face was completely beet-red at being shoved up against the massive woman\u2019s body, but you eventually manage to speak up in a quiet, shy little voice. \u201cUuuh\u2026 m-my name is Thomas\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, remembering. \u201cOh! Yeah\u2026\u201d She frowned for a second, before another thing brought a smile to her face! \u201cOoooh! How about both? Thomas Muffinberry! I love that name! That\u2019s gonna be your name from now on, cutie pie!\u201d As if excited by that, she hugged you even closer, squeezing you against her, even as you wriggle about all flustered at having your naked bodies pressed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think ya can just go namin\u2019 the kid, Pinkie,\u201d Applejack noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie turned to her, keeping your head deep between her breasts as she pouted. \u201cOf course I can! I\u2019m his mommy now! I\u2019m <i>supposed</i> to decide on his name, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash finally interjected, her wings easily lifting her chubby body off the ground as she flew over! \u201cNow, hold your horses! I think we should <i>ask</i> him first before we go jumping into decisions like this,\u201d she insisted. She reached down and pulled your face out from Pinkie\u2019s cleavage, turning you around in the woman\u2019s grip! \u201cListen, kid, tell us. Would you be fine with Pinkie here being your, ahem, \u2018mommy\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie gave you puppy dog eyes. \u201cPlease please please! We\u2019ll have SO MUCH FUN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of their eyes were on you, which only left your heart dropping, as all these funny feelings had left your cheeks as red as tomatoes, your hard-on in clear view. You couldn\u2019t even muster any words! \u201cUuuuhh\u2026 uuummmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack rubbed her chin. \u201cI think that fall\u2019s left his brains more scrambled than a plate o\u2019 eggs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, before you could get too flustered, you suddenly <i>poofed</i> out of Pinkie\u2019s grip, as if you were magically teleported somehow to Twilight Sparkle\u2019s side! She laid a hand on your shoulder as she frowned at Pinkie. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pinkie, but I can\u2019t just let you take this specimen home. It could still be harboring all sorts of extraterrestrial pathogens\u2026 and besides, there\u2019s all sorts of research that must be done on it! This creature is a newly discovered sapient species! Plus\u2026 I think we may need to treat it for brain damage or something,\u201d Twilight insisted. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, for now, the specimen must be property of the state until we fully understand it. After that, we can let you adopt it yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie crossed her arms and pouted, looking just about ready to tear up! \u201cBuh\u2026 but\u2026 it\u2019s not a specimen! It\u2019s my precious little son! I\u2019ve wanted to be a mommy since, like, forever! Well\u2026 a mommy for someone other than Gummy, I mean!\u201d She held her hands together. \u201cPleeeeaaase let me have him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pinkie. But you\u2019re just going to have to be a little patient. You\u2019ll still be able to adopt him eventually, I think,\u201d she reasserted. Pinkie\u2019s posture became slumped, and even the tuft of hair on her head became cartoonishly droopy, but she didn\u2019t argue anymore, knowing that Twilight could just teleport her away if she so chose. With that, Twilight gestured to the crowd. \u201cAlright, everypony! Return to your normal business! The situation is under control!\u201d Seemingly revering her, the crowd quickly dispersed, and Twilight took you by the hand and led you away. She was hardly skinny herself, however, and you had to struggle not to glance at the humongous, wide rump wobbling around just beside you as you walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she made it to a huge, imposing, crystal tower, and had you take a seat on a bench outside. \u201cWait right here, little guy. I have to go find my assistant. Celestia needs to hear about this!\u201d She disappeared into the castle, leaving you twidling your thumbs and gazing at the strange world you\u2019ve ended up in. There were some moderately skinny ponies, but most, the mares especially, were at least on the chubby side, even the ones who seemed to be athletes. You even noticed some of the winged ones fluttering about in the air! Though the pudgier ones seemed to have trouble flying very fast\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as you\u2019re looking up at the spectacle, you\u2019re veiled in shadow. You turn your head\u2026 only to see a MASSIVE pink booty looming over you, taking over your entire field of vision, the deep, dark crack inches from your face. \u201cShhhh, stay quiet for mommy, cutie pie,\u201d you heard Pinkie Pie\u2019s voice say\u2026 before that booty came crashing down! You suddenly found your naked body thrust halfway into that deep canyon between those mammoth cheeks, your nose full of the musk as you were soaked in the sweat covering the energetic mares rump. You struggled all you could, but those doughy cheeks restrained you with their weight and muffled your voice! Meanwhile, Pinkie tried to act natural, yawning and crossing her legs as she hid you beneath her. \u201cYaaawwn\u2026 nothing to see here\u2026 no siree, nothing suspicious is occuring\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she felt comfortable nobody was looking, she finally trotted away, trying to act natural and hoping no one saw your kicking legs dangling from her sweaty asscrack. Eventually, she ducked into a nearby alleyway, finally pulling you free from that sweltering canyon, leaving you gasping for air as she set her hands on your shoulders. \u201cSorry about my friend there, Muffinberry! She can be such a total meanie sometimes!\u201d She said, excited as she was confident she\u2019d snatched you away from Twilight unnoticed. \u201cBut now that you have your new mommy, everything\u2019s gonna be all okay! I\u2019m gonna take gooood care of you!\u201d</span></div></div>",

That is, a world where ponies have average intelligence comparable to a 2-year old human, at best, and are at their tallest around 3 feet tall (4 feet for celestia, 3.5 for Luna).  They get the \"fluffy\" part of their name from the thick fluff that covers their bodies, giving them a very cute harmless look.  Their favorite food, which they'll drop almost anything for, is for some reason spaghetti, (sketties to the ponies), and they have practically no sense of self-preservation beyond running in circles, covering their eyes so they can't see the monster, and it can't see them (not that it works), or soiling themselves to scare off predators/monsters with the smell.  They speak in baby-talk, and usually have a \"smarty friend\" in each herd who more often than not simply a bully who convinced everyone else he's always right.  Pegasus wings are non-functional, some can glide, but that's it.  Unicorn magic is simply having their horn glow or shoot out harmless sparks, rarely both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey really only continue to survive due to their extreme breeding rate, 3 week pregnancy, and 3 months until adulthood with average of 2-8 foals per litter.  Usually they inflate to levels so big the pregnant mares need to be rolled everywhere, which is entertaining in its own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to their low intelligence, it's no wonder the gryphons, yaks, cows, Kirin, dragons, and changelings use them for food (unconditional and unrestrained love for the changelings, meat for gryphons/dragons if not pets) or simple labor.  Though their control is not complete over what we know is Equestria, feral herds exist in the wild, hiding and trying to survive their best from being food for something smarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr some other equestria?</span></div></div>",
