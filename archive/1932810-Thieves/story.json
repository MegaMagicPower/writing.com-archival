You then draw your attention to your window. It is a sunny day. As you stare outside, you think about your girlfriend. It had been a few days since you had seen her as she had been busy working. You decide that you would go visit her. You needed to get out of the house anyway. You had been sitting watching tv and playing video games today until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk along the street, a black van flies past, doing way over the speed limit, mounting the curb at one point to get past a car infront. As you get closer to your girlfriends house, you pass a field. You think about all of the hot days in past summers when you would hang out in that field with your friends, drinking beer and having fun. Just a little bit further along, you hear a female voice scream. It appeared to be coming from the field. You start running to see what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached the entrance to the field, the same black van from before passes you, heading out of the field. You try to run after it, but it easily outrun you. You then dash into the field, to where you think the voice came from. As you get closer to the source of the voice, you find something shocking laying in the grass.</span></div></div>",

Not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Mikki felt next was the same blade that cut her head off being put to work on her body. The thieves sliced both of her arms off at the shoulder, and did the same to her legs, leaving a few inches of stump with her hips.

The box was then sealed up and carried off somewhere. Likewise, her legs were also packaged together in a similar box and carried off by someone else. Her chest and hips were each placed in their own box, and both carried off by two more thieves. The four boxes holding Mikki's body parts were all traveling in different directions, and Mikki could feel that each box was handed off to someone else at least once.

Since these thieves were taking you to God knows where though you decided to wait, escaping had to be your priority. But how in the world were you going to get out of a moving van? There was only one option really, and you weren't fond of it. Jumping out of a moving vehicle was far from ideal, even if you had your own body. If you injured Rebecca's not only would you be out of luck, but you'd inadvertently hurt a friend too. If you stayed though... Well, you'd rather not think about that really. With bodies being stolen you figured nothing good could come out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, so busting out of the van it was then. You weren't driving terribly fast you noticed, probably trying to avoid detection from police. After all an unmarked van speeding down the roads would be sure to grab attention. Escaping shouldn't be too hard then, you just had to get the door open and jump. Another look down at yourself made you less than enthusiastic about doing such a thing. With so much bare skin you were bound to get road rash unless you could somehow cover up. Glancing around the van for anything that might help you smiled spotting a rolled up bit of foam. Probably there to keep 'goods' from being damaged, you thought to yourself. Well it would still technically serve its purpose, you had to keep Rebecca's body safe for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure the foam was in one solid piece you glanced over your shoulder just to be sure you weren't being watched. Thankfully you could hear music being played in the cab of the van, meaning any noise you made ought to be drowned out. Not letting this chance go to waste you moved over to the doors, placing one of Rebecca's slender hands on the handle and giving it a hard twist, elated that it swung open. Looking back just one last time to be sure you swallowed nervously, looking at the road passing by beneath you. It was now or never, goodness knows where this place of theirs was. Grabbing the foam you wrapped it around yourself as best you could, the padding being maybe two inches thick all around. Definitely better than bare skin on concrete, that was for sure. In a silent countdown you waited until the right moment, and conveniently as the van slowed a bit you made your jump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting the ground at twenty miles an hour, even with the padding, was certainly not fun. While your landing was cushioned significantly it still knocked the wind out of you, sending you rolling a few good yards upon landing. Losing the foam rather quickly you ended up laid out on the concrete, a few scrapes and cuts on your arms and knees. Otherwise however you were uninjured, certainly nothing that was life threatening. What's more the van continued on as though nothing was amiss, disappearing around the bend further on up. They might not notice for a while, but it was best not to take your chances. Picking yourself up from where you laid you groaned, now feeling the soreness that came with the impact. Well it might stink to have some nicks, but Rebecca would be grateful she got her body back at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little other choice you hurried off the road, stealing into some random person's back yard. After darting through some bushes you took a seat on the lawn, your new and heavier chest rising and falling as you waited to see if the van would come back around. A few minutes ticked on by and no vehicles returned, hopefully meaning you were in the clear. Granted though you weren't totally safe until you got back home, so probably best to keep moving. Rising once more to your feet you cut right on through the yard and into another, moving onto the adjacent street. Still a bit paranoid about being spotted you made it a habit of moving through yards, hopefully not being seen by too many people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this walking around was really proving to be problematic, and not for the obvious reasons. The way Rebecca's body moved as it walked was completely alien to you, from the sway of her hips to the way her chest bounced. She had a real set on her, you always knew that, but it was totally different now that they were on <i>your</i> chest. Glancing down you hesitantly placed a hand under one, giving it a squeeze and shivering slightly at the sensation. With your male head on this lovely female body it was awfully hard not to do that again, you had to remind yourself of your priorities. Get home, find Mikki and Rebecca and give her this body back. You had a girlfriend after all, what would she think if you were checking out a friend like this? Then again... Would she know?</span></div></div>",

As things stood now though you were two heads, only one with a body, it didn't make much sense to remain that way. Once both you and Mikki were mobile again then you could really get to work, and with any luck return Rebecca to her own body, and Mikki to hers. Agreeing with your girlfriend's plans you gave a nod of your head, looking over at your friend's head thoughtfully. It was still tricky, controlling your body like this, but you figured you could attach someone's head to Rebecca's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that you did... Only it wasn't quite as planned. You had meant to put Mikki onto Rebecca's body, but working from your perspective you'd accidentally mixed yourself up. When you felt a weight on your chest you knew instantly you had goofed up, and Mikki wasn't too shy at berating you for your mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gavin! You were supposed to put me on her body!\" Mikki snapped, staring up at you annoyed as you began feeling yourself over. \"And now what am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I've got this covered,\" you reply, grinning sheepishly as you pick your girlfriend's head up. Your body, having lost your direction had simply collapsed over, lying motionlessly on the ground. Since you had Rebecca's body there was only one option left for Mikki, she'd have to take it. Tucking your girlfriend's head under one arm you carefully sat your body up, affixing Mikki's beautiful head to your relatively average male body. Like you had done with Rebecca's she took a moment to feel herself before looking at you annoyed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is better than nothing. Don't get me wrong Gavin, but... I didn't want to be stuck like this,\" Mikki remarked, sighing as she looked down at herself. Seeing the bulge in her jeans she adjusted her pants fruitlessly, frowning before prodding it with a finger. \"Being a guy is weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, you couldn't really agree or disagree with Mikki, only having ever really been a guy. If anything you'd say being a girl was weird, even sitting down you could just feel the difference. Rebecca's body wasn't anything exemplary, like yours it was relatively average. Still, your very male head atop a female body made it look anything but as you glanced down at yourself, taking in the sights. It wasn't Mikki's body, but you'd admit your friend had a nice figure all the same. Smiling incessantly your hands went back up to your breasts, giving them a fondling as you sighed pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gavin! Cut that out!\" Reluctantly you dropped your hands into your lap, looking up at Mikki. Huh, her face was all red, and she was shifting around a bit. Connecting two and two together you smiled mischievously, recognizing the behavior of your girlfriend. You were more than familiar with your own body to know what was bothering her, and the thought of her being worked up made your newly acquired hardware moisten a bit. Rubbing your own legs together reflexively you reached out, grabbing one of Mikki's hands in your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Instead of sitting around, don't you think we should...\"</span></div></div>",

How could they even remove her head without killing her?

Look, I'm sorry that we gotta do this to you, but I have a family to take care of. I'm not kidding. My wife left me and all I have is my daughter. Well, at least her head. It's for the raise, but she doesn't mind.\" said the thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do tell.\" you replied sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, I can do something for you.\" said the thief, \"I'm also bored here and looking at you has been giving me ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would that be?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief wants...</span></div></div>",

You make you body stand up again and try to chase after them. However, one of the thieves saw your body coming and gave it a swift kick in the groin, causing you to yelp in pain and your body to collapse onto the ground, grasping your sore genitals.<br>\r\nWhen the thieves arrived back at the van, they slide the door open and throw your head inside. you bounce around for a bit before settling in  one spot. The thieves jump in and speed off. Your gaze faced a big sack in the back seat. It was full and you could hear voices coming from it. It seems  that your head wasn't the first that the had stolen today. About five minutes later, the van came to a stop and the thieves jumped out again. They were gone for about two minutes and they returned with a headless female body. You could do nothing as you watched them tie her wrists and ankles together. Once they had succeeded in restraining the body, they sped off once again.<br>\r\nFifteen minutes passed before the van stopped again. This time, one of the thieves grabbed the sack of heads while another thief that you hadn't seen before enters the van and swipes the female body. You felt yourself being lifted by the hair before being spun around to face the thief that cut your head off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home.\" He chuckled with an evil grin on his face. He carries you into what appears to be an abandoned warehouse. They appeared to have redesigned the interior so that it had several rooms instead of one big open space. You were led to a room that had shelves on every wall. They were decorated by several heads, each with its own cubical on the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Gavin, not you too!\" You heard a familiar voice scream. You looked over and saw Mikki's head on one of the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH, so she's your girlfriend!\" The thief exclaimed, just putting together the reason why you were at the field. He finds an empty cubical on the shelf directly across from Mikki and sets you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll leave you two to catch up. I'll see you soon.\" He laughs as he leaves the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" Mikki asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went back to the field to find clues that would lead me here, but when I got there, I found that these guys came back for your body. They found me and took my head.\" You told her. Worried that they may have found Mikki's body, you ask her of anything has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. My body is still in the house. I can't navigate very well, so I've just lay my body on the bed.\" She explains to you. She then asks you about your body. You focused for a moment so that you could feel your body more clearly. You hadn't moved much since you were decapitated, so you were still in the same place. Just then, you felt someone touching you. And hand helped you to your feet and then led you away somewhere. At first you thought that it was one of the thieves, but the hand felt aged and feminine. You decided to trust it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, the thief that decapitated you came back. He picked you up and held you close to his face. He grinned at you, satisfied by what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey lover boy! We've prepared a surprise for you! Come on!\" He then take you away. You could hear Mikki screaming for him to leave you alone, but it didn't stop him. He led you to a room with nothing but a metal table in the center. He sat you down and then grabbed his sword from the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do!?\" You asked him. He laughed at your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be a surprise if I told you.\" He then raises his sword. He places one hand on the top of your head to steady you before carefully cutting though you scalp. He removes your scalp and sits it down next to you, leaving your brain exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A nice clean cut, but this is where it gets messy.\" He says. He then drives both hands into your skull and grabs your brain from two sides. You scream in terror as your feel him lift your brain out of your head. He then holds your brain in one hand as he uses the sword to sever your brain stem. To your surprise, you're not dead. The thief then places your brain on the table in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! That's you!\" He's says with excitement. You stare at him, every part of you shaking with fear, even your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to kill me?\" You ask, stuttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill you? No! That would ruin the fun!\" He tells you. \"I'll be right back.\" He says. He then picks up your brain again and leaves the room. You sat there worried for a few minutes, wondering what he was going to do to you. Suddenly, everything went dark. You lost all of your senses. This last for what felt like an eternity. You wondered if you were dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your senses come back to you and your sight returns. You appeared to be back at the spot where they had decapitated you. You felt that you had a body, but it didn't feel right. As you sat up, you felt an unfamiliar weight on your chest. You looked down and were shocked at what you found. You now possessed the body of a woman in her mid 20's with large breasts. You reached up and cupped them in your hands. As you moved your arms, you caused some long hair to fall into your line of sight. You didn't recognise it as your own. It differed in both colour and length. You placed your hand on your face and discovered that they had done more than give you a new body. They gave you a new head! You looked around and saw a hand mirror on the ground with a note stuck to it. You went over to it and read the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun!\" It read. you then picked up the mirror and looked at your new head for the first time.</span></div></div>",

I'll go make us some tea.\" Betty says, before disappearing into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down on the sofa and try to make yourself comfortable. Your new body doesn't make it easy though. You try to slouch with your legs apart, but it doesn't feel right with your female form. Your posture feels much straighter than it did in your own body, so you decide to sit up straight and keep your legs together. You look down at you body and see that your vision is slightly obscured by your breasts. Since you were on your own, you pull back your sweater neck and take a closer look at your chest, concealed in a white lace bra. The sight turns you on, so you cup one of them in your hand and start squeezing it. With your other hand, you venture up your skirt and rub your vagina. The lack of a penis felt very different, but you liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get carried away, you catch a glimpse of Betty walking in the room in the corner of your eye. You immediately stop touching yourself and sit up straight. Betty looks at you with a confused and concerned expression. She silently walks across the room and sits the tea on a table before sitting on a chair directly across from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not who you appear to be, are you?\" Betty asks. You have no idea how to respond so you stay silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it. Those bastards got you!

You jump a little as two hooded figures darted out of an alleyway. They are thieves! They spotted you immediately and smirked. You had never seen these two before, so they didn't recognise you in your current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, princess. Fancy a chat?\" One of them said while the other chuckled. You turned in the opposite direction and started running. You didn't look back but you could hear laughter behind you as the thieves chased you. You try to run faster, but the thieves were catching up quick. There is no way that you can escape them. You feel a hand on your shoulder and it pulled you back and one of the thieves grabbed you; pushing you to the ground. You trembled in fear as they prepared for what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that chat, then?\" The thief said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" You begged, but it just made them laugh harder.

Having your head stolen and your brain planted into a new body, only to have that body's head severed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do with you.\" One of the thieves said.</span></div></div>",

You pick up your head and try to place it back on your neck. As the skin makes contact, it rejoins. <br>\r\nAfter regaining your female body, you take a look around the van.

One one side, there is your headless body and on the other is the lifeless Gemma.</span></div></div>",

Within moments, you are back in control of Gemma's body.<br>\r\nYou then place the top of the thief's head back on before cutting the head off. You decide as a sort of safety measure, you would stash the body and the head separately. You drag the body over to the corner of the room and then hide the head under your bed. You look around for some nightwear, but with no luck. You start stripping off your clothes, but stop to get a better look at Gemma's body. You knew her breasts were big, but from a first-person perspective they look massive. Without further hesitation, you unclasp your bra and reveal your bare breasts. You walk over to the mirror and see your new reflection: Female, beautiful and topless. You decide to watch yourself in the mirror as you remove your panties. You then start pulling sexy poses in the mirror, while playing with your tits.<br>\r\nAs you watch your sexy body move, you feel yourself getting turned on. You decide not to ignore it and leap onto the bed and lay on your back.

After a few minutes of exploring Gemma's body, you look over to the other bed, where your original body lies. As you stare at it, you feel a strange tingling sensation that you have never felt before. You soon realise that your current female form is attracted to your original body. You then get an idea that would allow you to explore Gemma's body even further, but you're not sure if you should act upon these urges.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as you would like to explore how sex feels from a woman's perspective, you decide to resist your urges. You don't want to be unfaithful to Mikki, even if YOU ARE the girl that your body is going to have sex with. You instead turn over and try to put your sexual urges to the back of your mind. After about 10 minutes, you fall asleep.<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up early. At first, you actually forget that you have a woman's body and get a little surprise when you look down and see your naked body. You snap to your senses and start getting ready. You start by redressing Gemma's body, just so you aren't leaving around a naked body when you leave. You then retrieve the thief's head from under the bed and attach it back onto it's (not so respectful) body. You then grab the sword and go through the process of transferring your brain back into the thief's body. Once you are ready. You pick up Gemma's body and place it gently back on the bed. You head downstairs and find Betty already awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're now then, dear?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I figured I'd best not waste any more time.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Definitely.\" She agrees. Betty then goes silent for a few moments, but she looks like she wants to say something. \"Listen, dear. I was going to ask you, if it's not too much trouble...Could you maybe use that sword to put my brain in that young woman's body?\" You are quite surprised by this request, but Betty then explains herself. \"I don't want to keep it. I'll change back when you return. It's just that I'm a little old woman and I would like to be young and beautiful again, even if it's just for a little while.\" You can't help but sympathise with Betty. You can understand what it must feel like to be old and then suddenly have the opportunity to be young again. You agree to Betty's request, then lead her upstairs to where you left Gemma's body. You then cut open Betty's and Gemma's heads and place Betty's brain inside Gemma's head then close it over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGemma's body, now under Betty's control, sits up and looks down at herself, before cupping her firm breasts in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! I haven't felt this good in decades!\" Betty says, somehow retaining the tone of an older woman through Gemma's more youthful voice. \"Thank you so much for this, dear. Good luck in saving that girl.\" She adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then leave the house and start following the directions that you found in the van last night. It takes quite a while on foot, but eventually you reach a big warehouse out in the woods. As you approach, you a met by a small group of thieves that don't look very pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell have you been, Dave!?\" One of them grunts at you. You recognise him as the one that ran off with the sack of heads last night. You are nervous, but you try to reply in a manner that you think will fit the thief's personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been laying low all night, after you assholes ditched me!\" You yell. \"Good. That should be convincing\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had to. The cops would have been on us any minute!\" Another thief adds. He is the one that made the comment about Gemma's tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give a shit! You never leave a man behind!!\" You yell, adding more fury behind it this time. The thieves back off, some avoiding direct eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, we're sorry. Okay?\" The first thief says. Without saying anything else, you barge past them and head into the warehouse. As you enter, you see that they have done some work to the interior. They've put up walls to create different sections within the warehouse. On the right appears to be the living quarters and on the left is the area where they keep the stolen heads and bodies. That sections has also been separated into two, so to keep the bodies separate from the heads. At the back is where you were taken last time before they put your brain in Gemma's body. You figure that must be an area for the leaders and higher ranks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk around, you discover that there are some female thieves too. Most of them don't appear to be here by choice, having been blackmailed or threatened into working for them. There are a few individual women though that are here voluntarily. As you explore the living quarters, a woman in her late 20's with short black hair approaches you, with a smirk on her face. She wraps her arms around your waist and stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, baby. Where were you last night? I thought we were gonna have some fun?\" She asks, with a sexy tone. She is rather attractive, but there's a slight scruffiness to her, that seems to come with being a member of this group. You try to keep up the act of being \"Dave the thief\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well something came up. I had to lay low last night after those assholes took off without me.\" You grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I heard. It must have been tough.\" She says, still in her sexy voice. \"Do you want momma to make it better?\" She asks, clearly hinting at sex. You'd rather not have sex with her. You want to rescue Mikki as quickly as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good baby, but I'm really not in the mood right now. Maybe later.\" You say. You weren't sure if that was convincing enough, but it seems to work when the woman gives a look of frustration before pushing you away and storming off, yelling \"Fine, then!\" As she goes. You find out later from one of the other thieves that her name is Trisha, or \"Trish\" for short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting any more time, you head to the section where they keep the heads. As you enter, you see that there are hundreds of heads from wall to wall. There are mostly female heads, but there's a fair amount of male ones too. As you cross the room, their eyes follow you with fear, wondering what you are up to. A few metres along, you find Mikki's head on a low shelf. There is another thief in the room with you, so you try to keep up the act until you can get somewhere private with Mikki. You see a sign for the bathroom, which is just around the corner. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel down and pick up Mikki's head. She gives you a look of shock and fear. If only she knew who you really were. You figure that Mikki not knowing who you are will make this next part more convincing. You start walking down towards the bathroom, passing the other thief as you go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Where are you taking me?\" Mikki demands. The other thief give you a light smirk and tell you to \"Have a good one!\" This sends Mikki into a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? No! Put me down, you monster! Get away from me!!\" She screams as you enter the bathroom and lock the door behind you. You sit Mikki down and the kneel down to her eye level and try to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh! Mikki, it's okay. It's me Gavin.\" You whisper. Mikki stops screaming and gives you a look of confusion and disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?...Gavin? But...But how?\" She asks, confused by the claims of your identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, but now is not the time. I need to get you out of here.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came here to rescue me?\" Mikki asks, with still a hint of disbelief, but also very relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did. I love you.\" You tell her \"Look, It's going to be hard to sneak you out like this, so I'm gonna have to find you another body as a disguise.\" You add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do you mean a different body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As in, I'll need to lure one of thieves in here and then place your brain inside their head to give you control. We'll figure out how to get your head out after that.\" You explain. Mikki nods in agreement to your plan. You then raise the sword and start cutting open Mikki's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing!?\" You shrieks, panicking that everything you just said was a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down!\" You whisper. \"I'm removing your brain now, so when I lure someone here, I can get it done as quickly as possible.\" You explain. You then sit Mikki's brain next to head in preparation for what's to come. Mikki meanwhile stares in amazement at her own brain. You then slowly open the bathroom door and sneak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back soon.\" You whisper to Mikki before closing the door. Now you just have to find someone to lure.</span></div></div>",

You decide that she would be the best person to lure away. It will be more convincing to have you and Mikki stick together by using her body. You head to the living quarter since that was the last place you saw Trisha. When you get there, you spot her sitting in the corner, looking a little pissed off. She's probably still mad that you turned down her offer of sex earlier. You think that you can maybe use that to your advantage. <br>\r\nYou start walking towards her. She looks up and spots you, then immediately diverts her sight. You sit down next to her. but she refuses to look at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Trish\" You start, still thinking about what exactly you're going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away, Dave\" She replies, still not meeting your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'm feeling better now. How about I take you up on that offer.\" You say. You decide to lightly stroke her arm for extra effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said go away, Dave.\" She tells you, though she doesn't push you away. It seems like you'll need to try harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're not still mad at me, are you?\" You say. You then wrap your arm around her, while continuing to stroke her arm with your free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm still mad, you asshole.\" She says, though she still doesn't push you away. You might just be able to pull this off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Trish. I'm sorry. Let me make it up to.\" You tell her. Trish doesn't respond this time. You hesitate for a moment with your next move, but then start kissing her neck. You're not comfortable with what you are doing, but you are only doing it to lure her away and save Mikki, so you don't count it as cheating. Besides, you're not even using your own body. Trisha finally lets out a smile as she begins to forgive you. She uses her hand to raise your head, then her lips meet yours. This is the most uncomfortable kiss you've ever had, but you work to make it as convincing as possible. As the kiss ends, you smile at her and then take her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go find somewhere more private.\" You suggest. Trisha agrees and follows your lead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe that actually worked. You start leading Trisha to the bathroom where you left Mikki's head. As you approach the door, you turn to Trisha and gesture for her to go first. Trisha opens the door and steps in. You stick closely behind her and shut the door behind you immediately. Trisha stares at Mikki's head, with her exposed brain with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fu-\" She manages to let out before you place her in a choke hold around her neck and cover her mouth with your hand. You reach for the sword with your free hand and start cutting open Trisha's head. Meanwhile, Mikki watches nervously at the struggle in front of her. You finish the cut and then scoop Trisha's brain out of her head. As you do so, your hand uncovers her mouth slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't get away with this!\" You tries yell, but the noise is muffled as you recover her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep telling yourself that.\" You say. You then toss her brain onto the floor. The impact dazing her for a moment. You take the opportunity to grab Mikki's brain. Just before you finish the job, Trisha speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a guy saving his girlfriend.\" You then place Mikki's brain inside her head. Her body goes limp as the connection to Trisha's brain is severed. You gently lower the body to the floor, then retrieve the top part of the head and recover it, sealing Mikki's brain inside. After a few moments, the body's eyes open again, looking directly at you, then smiling as Mikki realises that she is in control of Trisha's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked! I can't believe it worked!\" She says. She then hugs you for a few seconds before drawing her attention to her now lifeless head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. It's weird looking at my head from this perspective.\" She says. You then place the top of Mikki's head back on, then hand her head to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get out of here. You can hide your head in that sack.\" You tell her, pointing to a small brown sack attaches to her belt. Mikki opens it up and gently places her head inside. You then turn to pick up Trisha's brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this too. We can't leave any trace that this happened.\" You tell her. Mikki agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you are both ready, you exit the bathroom. You look to down the hallway and see the entrance to the room where your head was taken before. You decide to take a look in the hopes of finding it. As you reach the door, you turn to Mikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep a look out for me. I'm going to look for my head.\" You tell her. She nods and turns to face down the hallway. You enter slowly and then take a quick scan across the entire room. Unfortunately, your head is nowhere to be seen. \"Damn!\" You say out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, Dave?\" You hear a familiar voice. You then see a figure emerge from a doorway on the far side of the room. It's the thief that stole your head. This is not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sorry. I was...Just looking for Trisha.\" You lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" He says, keeping an unreadable expression. You can feel yourself sweating. He then starts laughing. Not knowing what else to do, you start laughing with him until he stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I saw her in the living quarters. You should check there.\" He tells you. That was close. You quickly thank him and leave as fast as you dare, grabbing Mikki's arm as you exit. You drag her quickly down the hall before the thief sees the two of you together so soon. Once you are a reasonable distance away, you let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hurt!\" Mikki complains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to get you out of there before that guy saw you.\" You explain. The two of you then exit the warehouse and try to keep up the act until you are sure that you are both out of sight. The two of you make your way back to your house, where Mikki's body is currently being kept. When you arrive, you realise that you don't have your keys. Luckily, you have left a spare nearby. You retrieve it and head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you have saved Mikki, what should you do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once you and Mikki are inside, you close and lock the door behind you. You take a quick glance around the hall. It doesn't seem like anyone has broken in, so hopefully Mikki's body is still here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea where your body was the last time you felt it?\" You ask Mikki, currently disguised as Trisha the thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't remember. It was hard for me to pinpoint where I was in the house.\" She tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to split up to search the house quicker. You start by checking all of the rooms on the ground floor. Some household items have been knocked over, possibly by Mikki's body, but no sign of the body itself. You both then head upstairs and split up again. You check the bathroom, which appears to have been left in a bit of a mess, but still no sign of the body. Lastly, you check the master bedroom. At last, you find Mikki's headless, lifeless body sprawled across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it!\" You call to Mikki, who comes rushing over to you. As she enters the room, she stares at her body in shock for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I was already expecting this, but I still can't believe that this is happening.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither.\" You then kneel down next to the body and examine it. It is still warm, so it appears to be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hand me your head.\" You tell Mikki. She reaches into the pouch attached to her belt and retrieves her head from inside. She stares at her own face for a little while before handing her head over to you. You then line the head up and place it on top of the body's neck stump, causing it to rejoin immediately. As expected, the body still remains lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what now?\" Mikki asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then pull out the sword and carefully trace around the top of Mikki's forehead. Lifting the top off, you once again expose the inside of the empty head. You then stand up and turn to face Mikki in Trisha's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to do the same to you now.\" You tell her. She nods, then closes her eyes. Once again, you run the sword around the forehead and lift the top of the skull off. You then carefully scoop up Mikki's brain, causing her to giggle as you do so. Apparently her brain is ticklish. You sever the stem and carry her brain over to it's respective body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" You ask. Looking back, you see Trisha's body nod in response. It is the last thing it is able to do before you reconnect Mikki's brain to the inside of her own head. As you place the top of Mikki's skull back on, Trisha's body falls to the floor behind you. You take a step back and watch as Mikki's eyes shoot open once again. Her eyes dart around the room, taking in her surroundings and sudden shift in perspective. She then sits up and looks down at her body. She raises her hands to her face, before running them over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm back!\" She exclaims, letting out a smile shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it!\" She screams as she throws her arms around you. You give her a kiss on the cheek as she does so. You want to give her a proper kiss, but not while you are in control of this unpleasant body. Mikki then looks over your shoulder, at the body she possessed just moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do about that?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and unclasp the pouch from the body's belt, which still contains Trisha's brain. You place the top of her head back on, before severing the head entirely. You the shove the head into the pouch, next to it's brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll deal with it later. For now, it'll be safer to keep the head separate from the body.\" You say. You then drag the body across the floor and shove it under the bed to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go see someone now. You'll need to come with me.\" You tell Mikki. She nods in response and follows you to your car. You decide to drive since you know where to go. It would be easier than giving Mikki directions. As you drive, Mikki starts asking about where you are going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to see the person who helped me after I was abandoned. Her name is Betty. She is...Well, WAS an old woman. Before I left, I let her borrow the body that I was trapped in.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so this isn't the body that they trapped you in?\" Mikki asks, gesturing to the body you are currently in possession of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I managed to steal this body along with that sword, but that's a story for another day. They had trapped me in the body of a young woman.\" You tell her. Mikki sits in silence for a few seconds, thinking about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...um...Did you play with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikki !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I just wondered if you...explored that body. Was she hot?\" Mikki says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess you could say that I...tried some things.\" You admit, embarrassed. Mikki bursts out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! You would have done the same if you were trapped as a guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just teasing you.\" Mikki tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. And for the record, she was pretty hot.\" You add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you pull up outside Betty's house. You and Mikki walk up the pathways and knock on the door. There is no answer at first, so you knock again. There was still no answer, so you try the door handle, and discover that the door is unlocked. You a Mikki creep inside and make your way into the living room. In one of the chairs, you see Betty's original body. Lifeless, and still in the same spot as it was when you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god. Is that her?\" Mikki asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was. That's her original body. I don't know where she is now.\" You tell her. The two of you search around the house for Betty.</span></div></div>",

The voice becoming louder as you get closer. As it becomes clear that Betty isn't moaning from any sort of pain, you pick up the pace. Soon, you and Mikki are standing outside the door of the bedroom that you slept in last night. Mikki nods for you to get in there. You nod back at her, then place your hand on the door knob. You quickly turns the handle and burst into the room. You are shocked by what you find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, speechless. Surprised by you sudden entrance, Betty, who is still in control of the Gemma body, turns to face you, exposing you and Mikki to her naked body as she rides on top of your original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing with my body!?\" You yell. Betty climbs off of your body and struggles to retrieve her top from the floor, using it to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry! I just got carried away. This body is just so young and full of life and I wanted to make the most of what little time I have with it!\" Betty pleads to you, trying desperately to explain her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you thought the best way to do that was to have sex with my body without asking?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're upset, but you must know how it feels. This body has urges that are hard to resist. On top of that, I haven't had sex since my husband passed away. It's been 15 years since I've felt this much pleasure! I don't expect you to forgive me, but please try to understand why I did it.\" Betty continues to plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't reply. You just stand there in silence, trying to think over what just happened. Mikki, who is clearly not happy that another woman was touching your body watches your expression, waiting for you to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose you'll be wanting me to give up this body now?\" Betty asks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You take some time to think about your decision. Up until now Betty has been very welcoming and has helped you out on several occasions, but what she has just done has broken your trust. You can understand why she did what she did, but that doesn't make it any more forgiveable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's about time that I take that body back.\" You tell her. Betty lowers her head, disappointed by your decision, but still ashamed of what she has done. \"Get yourself and my body dressed, then meet me downstairs when you're ready.\" You tell her as you turn to leave the room. Mikki follows you back down the stairs and into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! I can't believe that she would do that! The nerve!\" Mikki exclaims, still frustrated that another woman has just violated her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give her a brake. She's clearly had those urges building up for years with no way to satisfy them.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even care about what she just did? To YOUR body!?\" Mikki questions you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I care! That's why I'm taking the body back. I'm just saying, what's done is done. Besides, she has helped me a lot recently. If it wasn't for her, I may not have been able to rescue you.\" You tell her. You can tell that she wants to say something else, but she decides to stay silent, crossing her arm as she paces across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Betty enters the living room, now fully clothed and dragging your headless body behind her. She carefully lays it down in the middle of the room, then takes a quick glance over at her original body. You could see the sadness in her expression, knowing that she'll once again have to return to her life as a decrepit old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Before you put me back, dear, I just want to apologise again for what happened. There is no excuse for how I've behaved, and I am deeply sorry that I have offended you. I guess I should really be thanking you for letting me use this body in the first place. You could have easily declined my request.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does seem genuinely sincere, but you can't let her keep the body after what she's done. In your hands at least, you may be able to return it to it's original owner. Mikki looks at you, waiting for you to raise the sword. You do so and quickly remove the top of the head to retrieve Betty's brain. She watches you closely as you approach her original body and proceed to return her brain back to where it belongs. The young, beautiful body of Gemma immediately goes limp at it loses the connection to Betty's brain. Mikki manages to catch it before it hits the floor. Betty's eyes shoot open and she slowly stands up, now completely restored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, dear. Now that this is all over, I hope that we can put this behind us and get to work on the real issue.\" Betty says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. I think it's best that we pretend that this never happened. There's much bigger problems on our doorstep.\" You agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so are we ready to go?\" Mikki asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. I want to switch bodies first.\" You tell her. You then raise the sword up and remove the top of your own head, lifting your brain out and severing the stem. You then hand your brain over to Mikki and ask her to place it inside Gemma's head. She kneels down next to the body and prepares to place your brain inside while you lay your current body down before you lose control of it. As your brain connects to Gemma's body, you lose all of your senses for a moment before feeling your perspective shift over to Gemma's body. You see Mikki standing over you and the help you to your feet. You lose your balance at first as you try to adjust to Gemma's centre of gravity again. Your skin feels a bit sticky and you can feel a slight tingle in your vagina. Apparently your body hasn't quite recovered from the interrupted sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Mikki asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. *Cough* I'm fine.\" You say, getting used to your female voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will you do now?\" Betty asks you. You reach over to the pouch on Mikki's belt, reaching in and retrieving Trisha's lifeless head and holding it up for Betty to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've got a hostage that we'll need to interrogate. We'll be back at some point to plan our next move.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then carry your headless body, along with the thief body that you stole to the car, with help from Mikki. As you drive back home you feel strange since this is your first time driving in this body, or in any female body for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. You were right. That body is pretty hot. Her boobs are bigger than mine\" Mikki says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well they're kinda distracting me from driving.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I bet they are.\" She says, with a smirk on her face. She knew what you meant, but decided to tease you. When you get home, you and Mikki drag the bodies into the house and set them down in the living room. Mikki sets down the pouch with Trisha's head &amp; brain inside and prepares for her interrogation. Before you do, you decide to freshen up by having a shower. You begin to undress, and watch yourself in the bathroom mirror as you do so. Once again you feel yourself getting turned on, but now isn't the time to explore, or so you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb into the shower and turn on the water. The spray feel surprisingly nice on your breasts. Not in a sexual way, but kind of soothing. You slowly begin to wash yourself and feel every inch of your female form. Just then, you hear someone enter the bathroom. You assume that it is Mikki, but you're not sure what she is planning. She then pulls back the shower curtain.</span></div></div>",

To your pleasant surprise, she is completely nude, her clothes in a heap behind her. She then proceeds to climb into the shower next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikki, what are you doing?\" You ask as she places her hands on your hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that you might need some help...Exploring your new assets.\" She replies. She then brushes your long red hair out of the way, so that she can kiss your neck from behind. You let out a soft moan as she does so. One hand reaches up to fondle your breasts, while the other continues to caress your abdomen. Within minutes, Mikki has you in sexual bliss. As you continue to wash each other, she lathers up your tits as she keeps playing with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you turn around to face Mikki, wrapping your arms around her and pulling her close. You breasts are pressed against her's as you lock your lips together. The two of you make out for a few minutes, the shower soaking you both as you move around. Eventually, you break it off to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I keep forgetting that you're actually bisexual.\" You tell Mikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've never really had the chance to try anything with a girl before now. You know I'd never break up with you for the sake of trying something different. But since you have this body now, I thought <i>'why not explore the other half of my sexuality with you while we have the chance?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I hadn't even thought about how this affects you until now. It must be weird, how your boyfriend is your girlfriend at the moment.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. And another plus side is that I'm hoping this will make you better in bed.\" Mikki smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Am I not good enough already?\" You ask, feeling slightly insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! You are! You're great! I'm just saying that you would be even better if you knew exactly what women like.\" Mikki defends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...Yeah, I get what you mean now.\" You say. You then watch as Mikki reaches for the shower head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And speaking of things that women like...\" She says, She then lowers the shower head to your crotch and turns the spray to its most intense setting. As the warm water soaks your genitals, you gasp and moan from the pleasure. Still holding the spray to your crotch, Mikki lowers her head to your left breast, wrapping her lips around your nipple. She keeps going until you are about explode and then stops. She pulls the spray away from your crotch and stops playing with your tits. She then turns the water off and grabs two towels. She begins drying you with one of them before handing the other to you and letting you dry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikki then steps out of the shower and takes your hand, leading you to the bedroom. She then lays down on the bed, face upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my turn now.\" She says, giving you a sexy smirk as she gestures for you to come closer. You climb onto the bed and on top of Mikki. The two of you start making out again for a few minutes, before you decide to show Mikki what you've learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, both you and Mikki are laying on your backs, side by side. Mikki is panting away, exhausted by what you just did with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You've learned a lot!\" She tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had a great teacher.\" You reply. Mikki laughs at your reply, then turns and kisses you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, no matter what body you have.\" She tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, and likewise.\" You say. The two of you lay there for a few more minutes to get your breath back before getting dressed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we better get this interrogation over with.\" You say. Mikki nods. Once you are both ready, you head downstairs to begin interrogating Trisha.</span></div></div>",

As your head hits the bottom of the bath, you try to make your body retaliate, but Trisha has already severed your arms and legs before you can.

Little does she know that you are the one that took Dave's body. She must have not thought that far ahead and thinks Dave's body is still running around.

You had only just gotten a new body and now you about to lose it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one has a pretty face, don't you think?\" The thief holding your head says. The other thief seemed a little occupied though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but look at these tits! I'd like to have a go on those.\" He says with a perverted grin on his face.

You feel the thieves let go of you body, and then you see what they have turned their attention towards. A dark figure, hidden by the blinding light from the van's headlights, wielding a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thieves charge at him, but he is quick and precise. You watch as the sword-wielding figure dodges everything that the thieves can throw at him, taking limb after limb in response. His movements have a sort of elegance to them, almost like he is performing a dance routine rather than fighting some thieves. Within minutes, the thieves have been defeated. Their limbs scattered across the road and their heads severed from what remained of their torsos. Surprisingly, they weren't dead. It seems that the dark figure's sword works in the same way as the ones that the thieves were using. With the fight over, the van speeds off before the dark figure can claim any more of their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer hidden by the headlights, you can see the figure a bit more clearly. He is wearing a black coat, with a large hood that still hides his face from your view. He retrieves the heads of the thieves, gagging them before shoving them into a pouch attached to his belt, not unlike the ones that the thieves use. He then turns to your body, taking your hand to help you to your feet. He dusts off some dirt from your shoulder and then begins to lead your body away from the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wait!!\" You call from the grass. You pull your hand away from him and use it to point in the direction of your head. He turns and immediately sees what you are trying to show him. He walks over to your head, leading your body by the hand as he does so. He kneels down and lightly picks up your head. You can see his face now. He has some light stubble on his face and appears to be in his late 20's. You take a guess at 28.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I just assumed that they had taken your head away.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. They seemed to be more interested in my body. If it wasn't for you, they would have gotten away with it.\" You tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hurt?\" You try to shake your head, but fail miserably. Oddly enough, you see the neck stump on your body move from side to side as you try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" You tell him, since you can't shake your head currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to come with me. It's not safe out here.\" He tells you. He then hands your head back to your body and slowly begins to walk away, gesturing for you to follow. You have no idea who this guy is, but you feel as though you can trust him. He did just save you from the thieves after all. You decide to go with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you turn your head around to face your body...Well, the body that you currently occupy anyway. It was strange to see the body from this perspective, but you kind of liked it. You then decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

That being said, you didn't see why you shouldn't TRY to enjoy yourself while attached to this body.  While you didn't like getting decapitated the first time since your head and body were in two different places and unable to coordinate now that you could actually see where you were going being headless wasn't so bad.  It was actually kind of fun to look around in ways that were never possible before, like looking over your neck stump at the darkened street behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning yourself back around however you are greeted with a troubling sight.  \"Hello?\"  You call out, your sword wielding savior having disappeared.  \"Hello?!\"  You shout louder, nervousness entering your voice as you swivel your head back and forth with your hands to scan the street.  You reach the corner but don't seem to see any-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly jump out of your skin as a voice shouts right in your right ear, your head tumbling out of your hands in surprise.  Before you can hit the ground however you feel a a sharp tug at your scalp, a fistful of your long blond hair being caught in someone's fist.  Slowly rising up, head swaying side to side in the breeze, you come face to hooded face with the man who saved you.  \"DUDE!  Do not scare me like that!\"  You say, reaching out blindly for your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hurt?  Is there anyone chasing you?\"  He asked, adjusting his grip so that your head was now held in the palm of his hand Yorick style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... not that I'm aware of, no.  I just didn't know where you went, thought I'd lost you.\"  You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been following me?\"  He asks, still holding your head while your body felt around the empty air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look right into his big brown eyes, searching for some hint that he was joking.  Finding nothing but sincerity you say \"You told me to.   Like, ten seconds ago.  After you saved me from those thieves.  Said it wasn't safe here.  Any of this ringing a bell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you dumbly for a few more seconds before two muffled voices mumble something.  Looking down at his side he sees a large black bag with two head sized objects inside it.  Suddenly a light goes off behind his eyes.  \"RIGHT!  Yeah, that's right.  You have to follow me.\"  He says, turning around and walking with you tucked into the crook of his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sir?  My body?  I can't see where it's going like this.\"  You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!  Sorry.\"  He says, turning back and walking over to your female form.  Handing you your head he motions for you to follow him once more, walking quickly away as he does so.  Not wanting to lose the easily distracted vigilante again you hold your head at stomach level and begin jogging after him, big round boobs bouncing on top of your head as you went.  You smile, your warm flesh giving your scalp a nice little massage.  Being a headless woman did have its upsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow him into an abandoned parking garage, stepping past the concrete pillars that blocked vehicles from entering the front gate.  The busted pipes that hung from the ceiling dripped acrid brown water, the whole place reeking of rust and spoiled petrol.  He makes his way towards the elevators, all the lights dead the panel that once held the call buttons now ripped from the wall, leaving only a jumble of frayed cables in its place.  Without hesitation the man reached into his pocket and produced a pair of thick rubber gloves, sliding them over his hands before reaching into the jumble of cables. Hooking two red and one white wire together and tying them off with a small spray of sparks you hear a whir coming from behind the elevator doors.  \"Is this the door to the Bat-Cave or something?\"  You ask jokingly, still trusting this man for the moment but growing more nervous with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you, surprised.  \"Huh?  Who are-\"  He snapped his fingers.  \"Right, the girl from earlier.\"  He nodded.  \"Something like that, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind telling me who you are?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that.\"  He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown.  \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator arrives, the dirty metal doors sliding open to reveal a well lit and surprisingly clean elevator.  \"Please, this way.\"  He said, stepping into the elevator.  You weren't sure whether he was ignoring your question or had just forgotten you'd asked it, but you decide to follow him regardless.  You couldn't explain why, but the hooded man with a sword strapped to his hip and two severed heads hanging off his belt seemed trustworthy.  Somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the elevator you see that the panel inside also lacks any buttons, though rather than a bunch of open wires there was one large key hole.  Producing an appropriately sized key from a necklace tucked under his hooded shirt the man inserted it into the panel and turned, the doors closing behind you and the elevator shuddering to life.  To your surprise the two of you started moving down despite the parking lot having four upper levels and to your knowledge no basement.  As the elevator descends as slowly as possible you decide to ask a few more questions.  \"So, can you tell me what's the deal with those thieves?  Why they're after people's body parts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that.\"  He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow.  \"Can you tell me where you guys got those magic swords?  Or how they work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't.\"  He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me why not?\"  You ask, beginning to lose your patience.  This had been the craziest day of your entire life and this guy refused to explain any of.  He saved you, he attacked the thieves with a sword just like theirs', he had his own subterranean fortress of solitude, yet despite the fact that he had no trouble showing you crazy shit and doing crazy shit he denied to fill you in on the how or why to any of it.  It was like watching an foreign art-house with no subtitles backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  He said, the elevator doors sliding open before him.  Before you could protest he added \"But I can show you.\"  He motioned for you to step out of the elevator.  You look him up and down from your position at waist level, then do as he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator immediately opens into a massive room, at least 100 feet by 100 feet and with a ceiling that extended up ten feet that was plastered with an alternating pattern of fluorescent lights and ventilation.  While it was all one large room the area seemed to be divided into four sections in each corner.  One corner being a living area with two beds, closets, a cubicle shower, a set of dumbbells and a treadmill for exercise, and a small nightstand with a handful of books and magazines piled onto it.  One corner was filled with computer monitors showing off the view of hidden cameras all over the city.  The third corner was some sort of kitchen with huge refrigerators and enough canned meals to last a month or two.  And finally to your right was a corner filled with an operating table and various scalpels and swords.  To your shock two gagged and severed heads rested on a trolley by the operating table, their scalps cut off and brains resting in jars behind them while the rest of their body parts lie in a large pile to the side, chopped apart at each and every joint until you couldn't even recognize what half the small lumps of flesh were.  You would've screamed, but seeing the complete lack of blood and the fact that the heads scowled at you angrily tipped you off to the fact that the two people were both alive and probably more thieves like their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me.\"  He says, walking over to the operating corner.  Doing as you were told you walk over and set your head on one of the vacant counter tops, wincing a bit at the cold metal touching your soft neck skin.  It had only been twenty minutes yet your arms were already tired of carrying you around.  How'd your neck manage to do that all day?  Without warning the man who saved you unsheathed his sword, and...</span></div></div>",

However, rather than aiming at you the man takes off his hood, revealing a thick mane of black hair, before sliding the blade through his own neck.  Setting his head down on the operating table facing you he gives a small smile of reassurance, then he walks his body over to a table covered in swords scalpels.  He seems to know the layout of everything instinctively, not even having to watch his body as it guided itself to the other side of the room, set his sword down in a specific spot without bumping any of the other tools, then picking up a small scalpel and walking back over to his head on the operating table.  It's quickly evident that just like the sword the scalpel was magic, the man poking the short blade into the center of his forehead without spilling a drop of blood before drawing a thin line around the circumference of his head.  \"I know you must be very confused about what's happened to you today.  Two men coming up to you and decapitating you without killing you, then running off with your body?\"  He says.  You wanted to tell him about the part of the story he missed, the part where this was the SECOND time you were decapitated in the same day by a different pair of thieves, and how you were really a man who'd been put into a woman's body, and how all of this started with you finding your girlfriend's headless body out in a field, but you decide to wait.  He was finally going to explain something, you didn't want to sidetrack him.  \"But I'm sorry to say, I'm just as in the dark as you are.  Maybe more so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother fucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished the line around his head and lifted his scalp away, setting it to ones side as he reached in and pulled out his brain just like the thieves had done to you earlier.  With a flick of his wrist he severed the stem, now carrying his brain over to you while his empty head continued to speak.  \"You see, I woke down here up a few weeks ago with most of my memories missing.  Who I was, what this place was, my name, and with most my life just being a blur of scrambled up scenes in my head that don't fit together.  That's because the thieves took this from me.\"  He said, turning his brain to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp, two dice sized cubes of grey matter missing in different spots.  \"Holy shit!\"  You say.  \"So that explains why you kept forgetting who I was!  And why you nearly walked off without my head AND almost left my body behind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgot you?\"  He asked, not remembering him not remembering you.  Deciding to just accept that that happened rather than try to recall it the man says \"I have a hard time forming new memories, and my old ones are all scrambled up to the point of worthlessness.  I know how to wield a sword, but I don't know how its magic works.  I know about the thieves' guild, but I don't know who any of them actually ARE or why they're stealing people's parts.  I knew how to get in and out of this place without any trouble but what the hell this place IS, who built it, or why, no idea.  I must have done something to piss them off but what it was and why they took my memory of it I have no idea.  Just like you, I need some answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why you attacked those thieves!\"  You say, a bit disappointed that he wasn't actively out to save you but still grateful he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\"  He says, walking his body back over to his head and placing his brain back inside it.  \"I used those camera's over there to track their movements, and once I figured out their pattern and caught up to them I brought them down here to get some information.  Unfortunately though they're a lot tougher than they look.  It's been a week and they still haven't said a word.\"  He placed his scalp back on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week?\"  You ask.  \"No, I'm not talking about the two over there, I meant the thieves you caught tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight?\"  He looked around the room but didn't spy any new occupants besides you and the two earlier thieves.  Then he spotted his body, and the large black bag hanging off his hip.  \"RIGHT!  The two from earlier.  When I saved you.  Yes.  Well, the story has the same beginning.  Me spying on the cameras and waiting to pick up a pattern,  then striking.  Hopefully, however, this story has a different ending.\"  With that he untied the bag from his belt and held it upside down over the operating table, the two men's heads thunking into the hard metal with a satisfying clang.  \"So, do you think you can help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help?  How?\"  You wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your memory.  I need you to write down everything they say, analyse it, and try to figure out some clues.  My memory isn't that good, I record everything and listen to it over and over but every time focus on one dot the other dot disappears.  I need you around to help me connect those dots so I can get to the bottom of this, get my brain back in order, and put a stop to these guys.\"  He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

The figure catches her head with his outstretched arm, and as she spots her headless body on the ground, she screams even louder than before. The figure quickly silences her screams by gagging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez! Put a sock in it already!\" He exclaims, before attaching the woman's head to his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take a closer look at the male figure, you see that he is dressed in all black with a large hood over his head. He is also carrying a sword with a long thin blade. Though the blade appeared to be black also, it glistened as the sun reflected off of it. You came to the conclusion that he must be a thief like the ones that took Mikki's head. The thief, now joined by an accomplice, surveys the area before spotting you with Mikki's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we have here?\" He questions rhetorically with an excited tone in his voice. \"Looks like somebody left behind a treat for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waste not time in dragging Mikki's body back in the other direction. As you glance back, you see that the thieves are already in pursuit and catching up fast.

You help her to her feet as fast as you can, but the thieves have already caught up. As you try to run again, you suddenly feel yourself spinning in mid-air, then you see yourself racing towards the ground.

He then kneels down next to Mikki's body to take a closer look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, if the other guys were willing to leave behind such a gorgeous body, then her head must be something REALLY special. I'll need to look for her when we get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away from her!\" you yell at him. You probably should have kept your mouth shut, but your emotions got the better of you. The thief then lifts your head and looks you dead in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you prefer, we can find a use for you instead, pretty boy.\" He mocks you. He then approaches your body while still carrying your head. Without warning, he takes a firm grasp at your groin, making you yelp out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.

I'm sorry about getting your shirt all wet. she replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, don't worry about it.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou study the head in your arms more closely. She appears to be about your age, maybe a few years younger, and extremely cute, beautiful even. Her long blonde hair, cute little nose, nearly flawless features and perfectly tanned skin probably get her lots of attention. What's captured most of your attention at the moment however is those large, deep blue eyes of her, like twin pools, that try as you might, you can't help getting lost in, along with those full pouty red lips of hers, so perfect for kissing, or...other things. Hmm, she did say she'd do anything. As hard as you try, you can't help imagining what that \"anything\" could be in her current state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour suddenly pulled from your thoughts by the sound of Holly voice.\"Um, Gavin?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, kind of spaced out for a moment there. Listen Holly, I know your scared, and you have every reason to be after what's just happened to you. I'm still not sure about letting you use Mikki's body, but if you let me take you home with me, we might be able to come to some sort of arrangement. And if we can't, I promise to look after you until you get your body back, and do whatever I can to help find it. Or, if you'd rather, I can drop you off at the police station or something, maybe contact somebody you know to come and pick you up?\" You suggest, making sure to speak in soft and soothing tones, not wanting to upset the tiny fragment of a girl nestled in your arms any more than she is already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly looks long and deep into your eyes, searching for any trace of deception.

Once you've gotten the three of you inside and the door locked behind you, you let out a sigh of relief  putting your back to the door and sliding down to the floor.

My original plan was to go over to Mikki's house and invite her to dinner. Guess we won't be doing that now though. It doesn't look like she could eat anything anyway, and I'm pretty sure we'd attract a lot more unwanted attention.\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you cook, or...\" Holly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do cook a little.

Once you've made your order, you pick up Holly and deposit her in the middle of the couch, then guide Mikki over to it as well before sitting down yourself, with Holly's head positioned between the two of you. Picking up the remote, you turn on the T.V. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at Holly you ask \"So anything in particular you want to watch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything that isn't a reality series or a talk show is fine. I can't stand either of them.\" Holly informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I feel the same way.\" you agree. \"Although that does kind of limit our options since that seems to be pretty much all that's on these days.\" you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter flipping through a couple hundred channels, and not managing to find anything good on any of them, you eventually decide to boot up net films and see if you can find a movie the two of you can agree on, eventually deciding on a romance comedy that neither of you had seen before, but that was suppose to be pretty good. You were only a few minutes into the movie when you hear the doorbell ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like the pizza's here.\" you say, forcing yourself up off the couch so you could go and answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's probably the cops, don't answer it.\" Holly joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better hope not, if I go down, I'm taking you down with me!\" You joked right back.

Holly's skin tone is pretty close to that of the pizza girl, so it even manages to look fairly natural. You step back a little, and almost as soon as you've done so, Holly shoots up off the couch and wraps her arms around you in a tight embrace, causing her borrowed boobs to dig into your chest. \"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\" she says, giving you a big wet kiss right on the lips. You feel slightly guilty about it, seeing as your girlfriends headless body is sitting right there on the couch, but overall, you enjoy it, as Holly's pretty hot, and the body she's borrowing at the moment isn't bad either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-your welcome I guess.

I think the kiss was enough,\" you reply, looking at Holly a bit warily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, you expect me to believe that? A girl up and kisses you like that and you want nothing more?\" Holly asks, raising an eyebrow incredulously as she smirks. \"Come on Gavin, I know men better than that. Besides, it would be a good way for both of us to relax, don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't one thing today it was another, and now you were being propositioned by some stranger whose name you only just learned with some pizza girl's body. Strange was a safe way to describe this, and how were you supposed to handle it? You'd be lying if you said you weren't the least bit interested, but with Mikki's body sitting right there waiting it felt an awful lot like cheating. Despite your hormones urging you otherwise you swallowed hard and forced out, \"We shouldn't... I mean I've got a girlfriend, and that's not even your body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly didn't seem all that deterred by your excuse, placing her hands on her hips as she frowned disappointed. \"Oh come on, that's really what you're going with? If you haven't noticed your girlfriend is headless right now, so good luck getting any there. And who cares if it's not my body, that just means I can be way more casual about sex and not worry. Now come on, stop being such a pain and just relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrutting up to you Holly began stroking your chest, to which you only stood there and tried to look away. Stubborn as you were trying to be you could feel a stirring in your pants and the smug chuckle coming from Holly told you she was well aware of the effect she was having. Feeling a hand then grab your jaw you were made to look at her, having your lips mashed against once more and this time around a tongue invaded your mouth. For a moment you tried to resist, but temptation eventually gave way and you began to respond in kind. Placing your hands on Holly's hips you returned the kisses, closing your eyes as you tried to at least imagine it was Mikki you were making out with. Unfortunately for you everything about the pizza's girl body felt different, and a decidedly cherry flavored chap stick on Holly's lips told you this was not your girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReciprocating the kiss was all the signal that Holly needed to let loose. With wild abandon she stopped kissing you, smiling smugly as she began to undress herself. First off came her blue polo shirt, which she lifted up over her head to reveal a pink frilly bra that cupped her C cup breasts and pushed them up slightly. In one fell swoop her black jeans followed suit thereafter, and in no short order you were left staring at Holly on her petite stolen body, your eyes drinking in the sights almost greedily. While it wasn't quite as good as your girlfriend's it was still a really nice figure, and with a determined girl piloting it you knew you were in for something special. Watching again as she sauntered up to you, you let out a faint moan as one of her hands immediately went south for your crotch, groping possessively through your jeans for what lied beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get these clothes off you and have some real fun...\" Holly whispered, kissing the nape of your neck.</span></div></div>",

It's usually not true though.\" Holly replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than argue anymore with her, you start the engine, and back the car out of the driveway, beginning the long trip across town.

You decide it would be best if  Mikki waited in the car. Shouldering your bag, you enter the apartment complex, walking up the stairs to the second floor, and begin searching for the right number. It's not hard to find. There's no bell, so you'll have to knock. You go to do so, but as soon as you do, the door creaks open. It wasn't locked, or even shut properly, only pulled to in order to make it look as though it was shut to any casual observer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not good.\" you mutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly must have heard you, because right after you've said it, you hear her ask from inside the bag \"What's happening, I can't see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The door's open.

It would be better if you had me with you so I can explain the situation to her.\" Holly amended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, because some strange guy holding one of her friends severed head is SO much more reassuring.\" You reply sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and get in there.\" Holly ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding you've delayed as long as your able, you walk into the apartment. The place is sort of trashed, as though there's been a struggle, but as far as you can tell nothings been taken. Not that you'd know anyway, never having been here before. You also don't see any signs of Stacy, or anyone else for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't seem to be anybody in here.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me out of the backpack so I can see would you.\" Holly requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just a second.\" you reply, taking off the backpack and setting it down on the floor, then opening it up and pulling out Holly's disembodied head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was free of the bag, Holly took a deep breath. \"Ah, fresh air at last!\" she said. Then, wrinkling up her nose she admitted \"Okay, so maybe not that fresh, we are still in the city. Wow, sombody really did a number on this place!\" she added in a loud voice once she'd had time to take in her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your voice down would you? We're not even suppose to be here!\" You hissed. \"What if somebody comes in? Or even worse, what if the burglar is still in here hiding somewhere?\" you continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax would you?

Lets check the bedroom.\" Holly suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For once, we agree on something.\" you answered walking over to the bedroom door.

Your actually a bit surprised to find that you seem to be winning. You'd expected the thief to be stronger than you, but you seem to have the upper hand for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for the moment you soon find out, as you suddenly feel a knee slam into your crotch!

It causes the thief's grip weakens somewhat, so you hit him there again, and again. This causes the thief to let go of the blade altogether and roll away from you clutching him throat and making gurgling noises as he tries to breath through his injured windpipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've no intention of giving him the time he needs to recover this time though. You stagger to your feet despite the protests of your injured testicles, grasp the sword in a two handed grip similar to the way you'd hold a baseball bat, line it up with the thief's neck, and swing as hard as you can. You hit your intended target dead center, the razor sharp steel slicing effortlessly through the thief's neck, severing his head completely, and causing both body and head to fall to the floor with a dull thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think you've killed him, but then you notice that there's no blood. The sword in your hands is probably the same sort of weapon the thieves used to steal Mikki's head and the other two girls bodies. You study it more closely. It's a rather elaborate weapon, with semiprecious gems and valuable metals woven into the grip. The strangest thing about it though is that each side of the blade is a different color, white on one side, black on the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the sound of your blood rushing through your ears diminishes as your adrenaline rush wears off, and you suddenly become aware of just how much pain your actually in, and it's all you can do not to collapse on the spot. You can't do that just yet though, not until you've secured your prisoner and gotten some answers out of him, then gotten everybody out of here before the cops show up. You also finally become aware Holly trying to talk to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gavin? Gavin, you Okay? I can't see, did you beat him?\" Holly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I beat him. I'm not sure about okay though. Bastard kicked me in the nuts!\" you complained, looking around for her disembodied head. You sroped it sometime diring the fight, but your not sure where it landed and your not seeing her anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! That must have hurt. You want me to kiss it and make it better?\" Holly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious about that, or are you just playing around? Also, where are you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm not serious, what kind of girl do you take me for?! To answer you other question, I think I'm under the bed. I kind of rolled when I hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour about to fish her out when a moans of pain issue from your assailant. You smirk in satisfaction, happy that you weren't the only one suffering after your brutal encounter. Your a bit puzzled though. Those moans seem sort of high pitched for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you out from under there in a minute Holly, I've got a couple loose ends to take care of first.\" you inform her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your time, I love dust bunnies.\" Holly replies sarcastically, letting out a fake sneeze to emphasize her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I just need to make sure our prisoner doesn't go anywhere. You wouldn't want our only lead to getting your body back slipping away on us would you?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, take your time.\" Holly repeats, without the sarcasm this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her answer, you grab a couple of bed sheets and use them to tie up the thief. You study the body more closely. Now that your not fighting for your life, you realize the thief is shorter than you, probably only about 5'7\". Slimmer too, probably no more than 140 pounds at most. That, combined with the general body shape makes you start wondering if the guy you just beat up is really a guy at all. Maybe HE is actually a SHE?\" you'll find out soon enough you think, reaching down to pick up the head of the thief you've just defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, lets see just who you are under that mask.\" you mutter as you prepare to remove it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You rip the mask off the thief's face. in spite of your earlier observations, your still a bit shocked to find that the thief under the mask is in fact a woman! A fairly attractive one at that, though not in the same league as Holly or your girlfriend. The head of the woman who you just beat up appears to be in her late twenties or early thirty's, Caucasian, with a narrow, angular face, pale skin, and short reddish brown hair. Her eyes are a stormy grey color, with a haunted look about them. Currently, those eyes are glaring angrily at you as you look her over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, who are you? Who do you work for? Where do you keep the body's and heads of the people you've stolen from?\" You demanded, firing off questions one after another in quick succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not telling you a damn thing!\" the woman answers defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no? I think if you know what's good for you, you'll tell me everything I want to know. Your group has already stolen the head of my girlfriend, and the bodies of a couple other girls I know. I want them back, and I don't care what I have to do to make that happen. Your totally helpless, and if anyone was coming to save you they'd already be here by now. So do us all a favor and give me a few answers. If the information is good, I just MIGHT give you your body back. Refuse or lie to me, and well... I don't think you want to find out what happens then.\" you threaten, doing your best to try to sound intimidating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know you think you can scare me into giving me into ratting out the organization, and to be honest, I'd love to. But I can't. The guys I work for are bad news, the can do horrible things to people that would give a grown man nightmares. Your a lot better off just forgetting all about us, ya get me?\" The woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that. My girlfriend means to much to me to just hand her over to a bunch on criminals like you. Now, this is your last chance. Either tell me what I want to know, or we'll have to do this the hard way.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, that would be a no. I already told you, if I give you any kind of information on them, the organization will do horrible things to me and my family. I'm a heck of a lot more scared of them than I am of you, so if you've got the stomach for it, go ahead and do your worst, I still won't talk. I bet you won't do it though, you look too soft to do something as despicable as torturing a helpless woman.\" The female thief answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in defeat. she's called your bluff. You really don't have the stomach for the sort of violence it would take to get any sort of information out of her, but you where hoping she wouldn't realize that. Then something she said catches your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you said you and you family. Did these guys threaten your family or something to get you to work for them?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, I didn't mean to tell you that. But I guess it won't hurt to tell you that much at least. Not that it'll do you any good, It's not something you could use to hurt the organization. I was blackmailed, just like you said. I never wanted to work for the bastards, but they got my sister, took away her head like they did your girlfriends. They told me that the only way I'd ever get to see her whole again was if I came to work for them. They do that sometimes. They'll find a potential recruit and abduct one of their friends or family members in order to blackmail them into joining up. They promised to give my sisters head back if I worked for them for a while. I didn't have a choice really. I took the deal.\" the woman explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And how long has it been since you started working for them?\" You ask, struggling to process this information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five years now.\" the woman answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, and, say, what's your name anyway?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does it matter to you anyway? I'm just another thief right?\" the woman answered bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It matters. I won't to help you, if you'll let me. Maybe together we can get your sisters head back along with Mikki's and the other girls bodies. Besides, I can't just keep calling you hey you can I? Not if we're going to be working together anyway.\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working together! What the hell do you mean working together!\" Holly cries from under the bed. \"She took Stacy's body Gavin! She probably helped take my body and your precious Mikki's head too, or doesn't that matter to you anymore?\" She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it does, but you heard what she said, she was forced into it. You would have probably done the same thing in her position.\" You argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I heard her little sob story all right. I thing it's all a load of hog wash. She's just trying to play on your sympathy's, probably trying to lower us in to a trap so that she can get rid of us and get her body back.You can't trust her Gavin! She needs to be punished! For Stacy, for me, for Mikki, and all the other people she's stolen from over the years!\" Holly argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She raises a good point. How do we know we can trust you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I never said you could! I never even agreed to work with you! You asked for my help remember?\" the woman pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't want to work with us then? even if there's a chance of getting your sisters head back? You really trust your bosses enough to believe they'll ever honor their word? You did say it's been five years already.\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course I don't trust them!\" The female thief replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why keep working for them then if you know they'll never honor their bargain? Maybe you just enjoy this line of work?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not, I hate it! It's just...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what?\" You asked, trying to gently encouraging her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that, as long as I keep doing what they want, I can keep hoping you know? I don't know what I'd do if I were to loose that.\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. You still haven't told me your name you know.\" You point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Amanda. I don't know you well enough to be comfortable telling you my last name.\" The woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Amanda, let me ask you something. Would you rather keep hurting people trying to hang onto what you know is false hope, or would you rather join us and trade it for some real hope, maybe help a few people along the way, and maybe even put these guys away for good?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda doesn't answer right away, she appears to be thinking it over. You decide to take that as a good sign for now. Finally, she comes to a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How could you think something like that?\" You demand, doing your best to sound offended. The truth though is that you did forget about her. You didn't even remember she was in the apartment until Amanda had mentioned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better not forget about me either! I'm tired of being stuck under the bed. Get me out of here!\" Holly demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as she says, reaching under the bed and pulling her out, then setting her down on the mattress next to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, happy now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, do I look happy to you?\" Holly asked, while she scowled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why do you think that is?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, why?\" you ask.

Just give it some time, it'll all come together.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think she's up to something.\" Holly said, shooting a glare at Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Holly, I believe her.\" Stacy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, not you too! She's the one who did this to you for crying out load!\" Holly complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes she did, but now she's agreed to help us undo it. She did say she'd tell us where my body is just now. You would have heard her too if you hadn't been so wrapped up in trying to get revenge.\" Stacy pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if she helps us get your body back I'll cut her a little slack. But only a little So tell us thief, where did you hide my friends body?\" Holly demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, don't call me thief. I have a name. It's Amanda, remember it. As for your friends body, believe it or not, the organization has a sort of temporary storage facility in this very building. It's on the first floor near the back of the building so they can slip in and out the back door without as much chance of being noticed. Your friends body is in there.\" Amanda answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay thief, thanks for the information.\" Holly sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you not to call me that, my names Amanda!\" The former thief complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep calling you thief for now, because that's what you are. Once we've got Stacy's body back, I MIGHT decide to start calling you by name, but not before. I still don't trust you!\" Holly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I can see it's going to be loads of fun working with you people. At least in the organization we treat each other with respect. Of course, that's mostly because if you don't, you'll most likely end up with a cap in your ass, or have your body wind up on the auction block, but still.\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you auction off peoples bodies?\" Holly demanded, totally aghast at the very idea of her body falling into the hands of someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course. What did you think they did with them, just kept them around to look at? No, they mostly sell them, usually to the highest bidder. That or use them for blackmail. In fact, your body is probably being sold right now.\" Amanda said giving Holly an evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly looked worried for a moment, but then she got an evil smirk of her own. \"Well, if that happens, I guess I'll just have to use your body then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you listen here bitch, that's my body, and the only one who'll be using it here is me, get it?\" Amanda shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? Well why don't we ask Gavin then? Gavin will give me your body, won't you Gavin?\" she asked, batting her eyes at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, give it to me! I'm taking a big risk by helping you out here. Blonde over there is just dead weight. Besides, it's my body!\" Amanda argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls continue like that for a while, trading insults with each other as each of them tried to convince you that they should be the one to get Amanda's body. Your certain the only thing keeping the two of the from engaging in a full fledged cat fight is the fact that neither of them has the ability to move under there own power right now. As much as you don't want to get involved, your going to have to make a decision here or the two of them will be at this all night, and that's something you can't afford, not with Mikki's body waiting outside in the car and the police likely to arrive at any minute to see what the ruckus is all about.

That's mine!\" Amanda shouted, glowering up at you. \"Give it to me Gavin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this shouting and arguing was getting old pretty fast, you were getting tired of it. Returning Amanda's glare you leaned over, picking her disembodied head up and turning her so she couldn't see a thing. \"Says the person who helped steal two others. These two have been out of luck for a while, so it's only fair one of them gets a body for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Stacy's body was nearby you didn't see a point in giving her another one, and Holly was rather adamant and it was easier to shut her up than deal with her. Going over to the latter's head you returned a slight smile at seeing her beaming, knowing she was enjoying her victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the body Amanda, I'll be sure not to mess it up too badly!\" Holly cheered, getting a few nasty remarks from Amanda in turn. Rolling your eyes you walked to the headless body, kneeling down before it and carefully attaching Holly's head to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a curious sight, seeing her skin seamlessly meld with that of Amanda's neck. As soon as she gained control Holly sat up, taking stock of her new figure. It wasn't near as impressive has her own, but it was certainly better than nothing. Sending a smug grin Amanda's way she felt herself up just to check, running her hands along herself curiously. Feeling eyes on her back she glanced over her shoulder to spot you staring, winking as she cupped her breasts. \"Like it?\" she asked, making you flush red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh way to go whore, feel yourself up in front of Gavin,\" Amanda snapped, unable to turn and face you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, why should I care, it's not my body! I'd go flash people if we weren't busy!\" Getting to her feet Holly was surprised at how short she was now, barely coming up to your chest. This was certainly strange, being on someone else's body, it would take some getting used to. Fixing her disheveled clothing she then grabbed up Stacy's head and tucked it under her arm. \"Welp, I'm good to go kick some ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least someone was gungho about all of this. You couldn't say you were terribly enthusiastic about tussling with more thieves, your groin was still sore from your first encounter. Sighing you went over and grabbed up Amanda's head as well, carrying her in the same manner Holly did Stacy. \"Let's be smart about this, we don't know how many there are or what we might run into. I'd rather not get shot trying to play hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch as Holly wanted to argue she was hard pressed to disagree. Even if it wasn't her body dying wasn't exactly on the top of her list, and by the sounds of it employees were expendable, so they wouldn't hesitate to hurt her. Sighing softly she nodded her head, giving you an inquisitive look. \"Alright genius, so what's the plan? I don't suppose you have something in mind?\"</span></div></div>",

Aside from the obvious I mean?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other than stealing my body, no, not really. I wasn't the only one here though.

In any case, it's obvious that the thieves have been here, as only Jenna's body remains, the rest of her having been carried off by the thieves. And what a body it is! Bound by ropes to keep her from moving and still naked and dripping from the bath, Jenna's body is amazing, with full luscious double D tits, near perfect cream colored skin, narrow waist, broad hips, an exceptional heart shaped rear, long sexy legs, and a neatly groomed triangle of bright red pubic hair resting just above her pussy, which is pretty and pink and still dripping with moisture from the shower. Seeing such an attractive woman in such a helpless state, you'd almost be tempted to try and take advantage, that is, if it weren't for the fact that you had two witnesses sitting right there, not to mention the fact that you already had a girlfriend. Instead you merely stared, drinking in the sight, wanting to remember this as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Jenna, they got you too!\" Stacy exclaimed in horror. Then noticing you staring, as well as the moisture between her girlfriends legs, she exclaims \"Hey you, stop staring! That's <b>my</b> girlfriends body, not yours! I can't help it if being tied up turns her on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" you asked, confused by her ending comment, as well as a bit embarrassed at having been caught staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming slightly embarrassed herself, Stacy blushes and says, \"Uh, never mind. Look just get her untied, alright? maybe if we get her a pencil and paper or something she can tell us something about who did this and were they wen't with her head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure, I can do that.\" you agreed, setting to untying the ropes, eventually being forced to go and get a kitchen knife and cut them instead, the knots being too tight to loosen easily. Once you've done that, Jenna's headless body sits up, spending a moment rubbing her wrists and ankles in an effort to restore feeling in them, before slowly getting to her feet, feeling around for.... you honestly aren't sure. Carefully reaching out so as not to startle her too much, you press Stacy's head into her hands, hoping that by tracing the other girls familiar facial features she can gain some sort of recognition and assurance, rather than trying to knock your block off or something. Realizing what she has, Jenna begins tracing her lovers features, while stroking her hair, attempting to discern her identity or offer reassurance to her girlfriends disembodied head, you're not sure.</span></div></div>",

Some mild sweat begins to form, somewhat soaking your shirt and shoes with your stench. Keeping up with the strange woman has been quite a hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning off once more, this woman is eager to get you to lose sight of her. Even though she does not know who Mikki is, she knows how desperate you are to get it back, and is willing to make sure you lose all hope.

We should still take some precautions though. I figure trip wires, a smoke bomb or two to cover our escape if necessary, and maybe a taser or a can of pepper spray that we'll both carry at all times. Rebecca, you should probably also stay here, just in case.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging the shoulder she's currently controlling, Rebecca replies \"Fine by me. It's not as though I can really take care of myself as just a head you know. Besides, I've grown kind of attached to Miki here if you know what I mean.\" she added with an impish grin, pointing her thumb at your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was really terrible! To many jokes like that, and I might have to donate you to a beauty collage or something Rebecca, let them put you to work as one of those model heads they use to practice cutting hair on or something.\" Miki joked. Well, you think she was joking anyway. Rebecca's pun was pretty bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I get you first! Rebecca replied with a wicked grin, reaching over and grabbing hold of her body mates head and attempting to pull it off, Miki squawking in surprise and outrage at this unexpected act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hearing a scream of terror, your first instinct was to go and investigate. The voice had sounded oddly familiar, and that only spurred you on to move quicker. While the field is usually pretty well managed, there are bits and pieces that have been overgrown. Some abandoned athletic equipment sits along the treeline at the far end, right near where you heard the shouts from. A bit apprehensively, you enter the shin-high grass, minding anything that might be in it as you look for the source of the scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you see at first makes your heart stop in your chest, and for a second you have to look away to try and tell yourself you were seeing things. When your nerves finally allow you to look back, your fear is confirmed. Laying in the grass, moderately visible, is the body of your friend Rebecca. You know it's her because of the outfit it has on; a plaid skirt that extends to the knee, a green camisole with a white v-neck shirt underneath, she's the only one you know who dresses like that. Finding her body laying there wasn't what got to you though, or not exactly. Upon closer inspection, you found her head to be missing entirely! Expecting a gory mess at the scene, you were baffled to find not a single trace of blood anywhere. In fact, as you moved around to inspect the alien scene, there was nothing to show for her apparent decapitation, save for the smooth skin where her head once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving moved around to inspect the body, you knelt down to try and see if there were any clues as to what had happened. Hardly a detective, you didn't know what to even begin to look for. Or more importantly, how to even begin searching. Her head was probably a pretty good place to start, but where would you even begin to search for that? How had her head even become detached in the first place? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Becs!\" you shout, hoping by some miracle she can hear you. It was strange, but for some reason you could have sworn you saw her chest rising and falling with breath. How was that possible with no head though? Was her head around here then? Thinking this was some elaborate hoax for a moment, you nervously reached down and placed a finger on her neck to feel for a pulse... And immediately yelped when her hands shot up and grabbed your arm. Trying to pull it away from the headless body's grasp, you watched silently as it sat up, its legs curling by its side as it did so. \"Becs...? Can you... Uh, hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body didn't seem to respond to your questions at all. However, it did now know that someone was there. Blindly reaching out, Rebecca placed her hands on your face, feeling about as if to try and get some kind of image as to who was with her. After an awkward moment of being examined, she pointed to her head, or the lack thereof, balling her hands into fists and placing them in her lap as her shoulders shook. Even without a head you could tell she was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cry, I'll fix this.\" you say awkwardly, forgetting she can't hear you. Smacking yourself mentally for being so clueless, you reach out and hug her, jumping slightly when she returns the gesture. Getting used to a headless body touching you was going to take a while. After a short embrace, the two of you let go of one another, though she keeps hold of one of your hands as not to lose you. Getting up to your feet and helping Rebecca to hers, you have to decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

What do you mean?\" She asks you, shocked and confused at your statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds insane, but her head is gone, but her body is alive and moving around. There's no blood and she sat up, felt my face then hugged me. I could even tell that she was crying.\" You explain to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make any sense. How can she be alive if her head is gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but there was this black van that sped out of the field just before I found her. I think that has something to do with it.

I'll take you some place safe.\" You say to her, still forgetting that she can't hear you. You keep a look out and avoid anyone that may spot you. You don't think it would go down well if someone saw you walking down the street with a headless body. As you lead Rebecca, she trips up a couple of times since she can't see where she is going. In order to secure her balance, she grabs onto your arm to support her more than your hand. Luckily, Mikki doesn't live too far away and you make it without being spotted. You knock on the door and she answers. Her eyes grow wide as she see's Rebecca's headless body for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. Rebecca!\" She exclaims as she reaches out to hug her. You then usher them both inside before anyone see's you. Mikki leads Rebecca to the couch and sits her down. She examines her neck stump for a few minutes before sitting down and staring at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\" She asks, without breaking her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I didn't think that such a thing was possible.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?\"</span></div></div>",

The police probably weren't going to believe their call, and bringing her out in public would cause panic. It was down to you and Mikki to solve this, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but we've got to try something! We can't leave her like this.\" Mikki remarked, biting her lip as she gave her friend's body a worried glance. \"Where do you think her head is anyways? How is she alive without it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heft your shoulders in a shrug, not sure what to say about the matter. You'd been wondering the same thing since you found her, and the short time you'd been with your friend hardly gave any answers. \"I don't know, I guess we should just be glad she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. Hang on...\" Mikki got up to her feet, giving you and Rebecca a quick glance before heading towards her kitchen. \"I'm going to go call my mom and check when she'll be home. Don't want her coming in with us like this.\" As she left, she gave Rebecca another concerned glance before disappearing through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone with a headless body, you let out a sigh before looking out the window. At this point you were fairly certain that your friend's head had been stolen. After all, she'd screamed moments before you came across her, and that led you to think she'd been attacked. If that was the case, her head could be anywhere by now. It was a pretty big city, not having any definite direction to search was a little disheartening. It could take an entire day just to thoroughly search a single block, and they hardly had that kind of time right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Becs... How did you end up in this situation?\" you mumble to yourself, more out of pity for your friend than anything else. Losing your head like that just seemed... Well, impossible, if it weren't for the proof sitting right beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Mikki came back, you wouldn't be doing anything else, so you figured you'd kill a little time with some television. Leaning down for the remote, you wrapped your hand around it but stopped as you felt hands on your cheeks. Confused you tried to turn your head, puzzled to see Rebecca holding your face. Opening your mouth to ask what was up, your eyes widened in shock as your head was suddenly lifted from your neck! Startled you tried to reach up to grab yourself, even further surprised to find that your body still moved under your volition. Trying to reach for your head, you accidentally knocked your head out of Rebecca's hands and onto the floor. Wincing as you rolled onto your face, you lay there for a second as you blindly felt around for your own head. When something finally grabbed you and you were placed on a neck... You found it not to be yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a body back under your head was weird, but stranger still was the one you ended up with. Feeling a weight on your chest, you glanced down and blinked in shock seeing two C-Cup breasts staring back up at you from under a green camisole. Lifting your new hands to your face, your fingers were decidedly more feminine as well and sporting purple nail polish. You figured what had happened, but almost refused to accept it. By some reflex you reached down to try and grab your manhood, gasping inaudibly when you find naught there but a smooth slit. You had Rebecca's body now, but what happened to yours? Looking over, you were surprised to see it sprawled out on the couch lifelessly, apparently no longer in your control. Now you had the body of your best female friend, what was Mikki going to say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down again, you flushed a light pink as you felt a wetness forming between your legs. You'd never noticed how attractive Rebecca's body was until you saw it from this perspective. Grabbing your new breasts and giving them a small heft and squeeze, you shivered slightly at the pleasure it brought. Lifting your feet out of your sneakers, you gazed at your smooth, pale legs, running your hand along them and smiling pleased at how nice they felt. Unable to help yourself, you grabbed one of your breasts, idly toying with it as you decided to take a peek at your friend's most sacred spot. Swallowing a bit nervously you grabbed the band of your skirt, pulling it away with your panties to steal a peek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, my mom won't be home for a while! We've got plenty of time to-\" Mikki stopped mid-sentence when she spotted you nearly gawking at your new body. How does she react though?</span></div></div>",

Face burning up in embarrassment you quickly withdrew both your hands, feeling rather awkward and guilty. \"Mikki... I... Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax! If I knew you were busy I'd have waited,\" Mikki answered, laughing a bit at your expense. When she noticed the concerned look on your face she sobered up, frowning as she stepped into the room and looked at you worriedly. \"Something wrong? Something happen with Rebecca?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to be kidding right? Here you were sitting, well now standing with the aforementioned friend's body below your head. As if incredulous that your girlfriend would ask that question you gestured to yourself, even going so far as to place your new dainty hands under your breasts. \"Uh... Yeah, she's right here!\" Again your girlfriend gave you a confused look, getting an annoyed sigh out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...? Why are you touching your breasts?\" Mikki asked, even more confused now. Not paying much mind to the shocked look on your face she went over to your body, which to your surprise sat up as she placed a hand on its shoulder. \"Becca, are you okay?\" she asked, forgetting your friend was without hearing for a moment, instead patting \"her\" shoulder to let her know she was alright. \"Really, what's got you so worked up? Did she fall or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... No, I just couldn't find her for a second, she kind of wandered off.\" you lied, lowering your gaze as your girlfriend helped the new Rebecca to her seat. Unbelievable, she didn't see anything wrong with you? Your head was atop a girl's body after all, the very same girl you two had been fussing over just moments before. How didn't she see that anything was amiss? Letting out a sigh of confusion you settled onto the couch, lifting a hand to rub at your forehead. So your girlfriend now saw this as normal, despite your body clearly being a young woman's?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter situating Rebecca in an armchair Mikki came over to your side, smiling curiously as she sat beside you. \"Headache?\" she asked, reaching over and feeling your forehead with the back of her hand. She still didn't see anything wrong with you, it was so strange. Pulling her hand back your girlfriend looked over to your former headless body, her smile fading as she shook her head. \"Like I was saying, my mom won't be home for a little while so we've got time to look for Rebecca's head. Any idea where it might be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Mikki talking, kind of, but your mind was elsewhere at the moment... As well as your eyes and hands. So a woman's body was now, in a way, rightfully yours? The very much male part of you that was in control didn't miss what this meant, and with both curiosity and hormones at a high you had gone back to unceremoniously groping your friend's breasts in plain view. After a second your girlfriend's words registered though and you reluctantly dropped your hands, smiling at her bashfully when she rolled her eyes. \"Uh... The field maybe? I mean, her head may not have gone far? She might have passed out or something from shock, losing your body can do that I'd guess...\" you mumble, reflexively looking over at your own sitting in the armchair in an oddly feminine manner. Man this was strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then we check the field! She's got to be around here somewhere, we can't just leave her like this, right?\" Mikki was surprisingly gun-ho about helping out Rebecca, you guessed it was just her wanting to be helpful. Following her as you both rose to your feet, you watched her take Rebecca's hand, leading her towards the door to leave. \"Come on Becca, we'll get your head back soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps a touch reluctantly you followed along, finding it a touch awkward with your new body to walk along. While Becca didn't dress provocatively in the slightest you couldn't help but be aware of the way your new figure moved with each step. Feeling your hips sway and the slight bounce of your breasts made your cheeks flush more than once, and at one point you opted to even try supporting them by tucking your arms beneath them, finding pushing them up to be just as uncomfortable. The walk back to the park didn't take too long and soon you and Mikki began your search for Rebecca's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the way here, you passed some people and they didn't even notice that your body was distinctly female either. Although they may have been more concerned that you were walking with a living headless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start searching for Rebecca's head immediately. You think that if you can find her, you can hopefully get an explanation for this and put yourselves back to normal. You and Mikki wade through the tall grass for about half an hour, with no luck. You are almost certain that Rebecca's head isn't here. You keep a close eye on your body while you search. You notice that it will make slightly feminine movements and gestures from time to time. It seems that when you gained control of Rebecca's body, she gained control of yours. For a little while, you weren't sure if that was the case, but this confirms it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've found her!!\" You hear Mikki shout from a distance. You run over to where she is. As you get closer, you can see Rebecca's head laying on the ground and you both rush over to it. As you reach her, Mikki picks her up. She appears to be alive, but has a shocked expression on her face. You can't exactly blame her, since her head has been separated from her body for a while now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca, are you okay!?\" Mikki asks her, relieved to have found her. Rebecca then opens her mouth to speak.</span></div></div>",

She still can't see anything wrong with the current situation, in spite of both you and Rebecca being savvy otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's <i>not</i> Mikki. Since when does Gavin have breasts?\" Rebecca asks testily, staring up at you at an angle due to being in Mikki's hands. \"Come on, that's mine...! Give me it back Gavin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikki still seems confused by all of this, giving her friend an uncertain glance before looking at you again. You know Rebecca is right, but you're half tempted to deny it. A rather guilty part of you admits that you're kind of turned on by this situation, as bad as it sounds. You're a hotblooded male after all, and you love the female figure like any other guy would. Having one of your own then is like a strange dream come true, and its hard to deny you're enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand Rebecca is your friend, and Mikki's, and she has been for a while. She's a nice girl, smart and has never really given you any problems. By all means she certainly deserves her body back too, being a victim in this situation. The fact that she could tell you had her body as well didn't help things, she certainly didn't look pleased with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... It's mine...\" you say meekly, lowering your gaze from Rebecca. Without looking at her he could feel her gaze boring into him, and it felt rather angry. You had decided to stay like this, if only for a little while, just until you were tired of it. It wasn't as if you intended to do anything wrong with it either, you just wanted to see what it was like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked up again you saw that Mikki had gone ahead and fastened Rebecca's head to 'her' body, the latter of who was feeling herself up. Taking a second to do the same you glanced down again, a sly smile crossing your lips as you ran your hands up your stomach and down to your hips and thighs. It was definitely different, and a good different. You wondered why girls weren't so thrilled with themselves usually, this was awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that's got to feel better now, doesn't it?\" Mikki asked, smiling hopefully. As far as she knew Rebecca was back to herself, and was fair happy to have been of assistance. \"Does everything still work? That must have been so odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, everything does not feel better!\" Rebecca snapped, frowning as she lowered her hands and looked over at you. Putting her hands on her hips she sighed, shaking her head and giving you a nasty glare. \"He STILL has my body Mikki. Tell him to give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca, calm down... You're probably just a little confused from everything that happened,\" Mikki said gently, smiling as she put a hand on her friend's arm. \"That's Gavin's body, and this is yours. I think I know my own girlfriend's body from my boyfriend's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was still flustered by what had happened, but it was obvious that Mikki wasn't of any use. Relenting with a sigh she shot you another look, and something told you she definitely wasn't done with you just yet. She kept quiet though, and after giving her friend a nod began walking back towards her house. You followed suit behind your two friends, watching curiously as Rebecca adjusted to her new body. She didn't seem have much trouble adjusting, though you could see her constantly reaching down her front to adjust her jeans. <i>Have fun with that...</i> you mused, smiling sheepishly. Glancing down at yourself again you lifted your hands, cupping your breasts and giving them a gentle squeeze. You didn't want to violate this body, but it was hard to not at least touch a little. Engrossed with your new assets you hardly noticed as you walked into someone, looking up to see Rebecca glaring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're playing at Gavin, but I'm going to get my body back...\" Rebecca said, looking down at you as you felt yourself up. \"And stop touching my body, it's not yours!\" she added, slapping your hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... It's just for a little while, I promise. I just want to see how it feels,\" you whined, retracting your hands and folding them behind your back. \"Please? Just for today, then I swear I'll fix us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you two coming or what?\" Mikki called, having stopped a fair bit ahead of you two. Rebecca glanced over her shoulder before looking back at you, still rather miffed and annoyed with you. Unable to do anything though she relented, letting out an exasperated huff before following after Mikki again. Doing your best to behave you did the same, keeping your hands securely tucked behind your back. </span></div></div>",

You pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know.\" The head was nearly in tears, \"These men just came and attacked me.

You had on a low cut top revealing two breasts. They were large, but the top was certainly meant to show them off. Your arms and legs were quite slender, and your nails were painted. You reached down between your legs to confirm that you were no longer a male where it counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" You asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you; they took your body!\" The head said, \"And they left you with mine.

I think I'm going to be sick...\" The young woman said, blowing away a tuft of grass that had been resting against her cheek. Never mind how she could get sick, seeing that she no longer has a body below her head! She watches you continue to examine her body, roaming your borrowed hands across her chest and groin. It being more than just an illusion when you trace over the woman's mouth-watering, curvaceous figure. She blurts out, \"HEY! Stop feeling up my body! Those are not yours to touch! Ewwwwwww!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing before letting out a nervous chuckle, you pick her up carefully, sweeping her strawberry blonde locks out of her eyes with her own hands. Cradling her cranium in your slender arms, you struggle to get a good hold of her. Thank goodness nobody was around to spot you two! It being hard enough to explain why you have a woman's body below your head, much less why you're also holding on to the talking, decapitated head of that woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we get a dialogue going here? What's your name?\" She asked, weirded out at seeing her boobs close to eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Gavin.\" You said, resuming your journey out of the field and toward your girlfriend's house. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Haley Davis.\" The woman said, then added curiously. \"Have we met before? You look familiar for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I'm aware of.\" You reply before stumbling on Haley's heels. Almost letting go of her head, you lurch forward with your new center of gravity. \"Woo-ooah! Sorry, must have broken a heel or something. Hmm. Never thought I would say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \"Never mind that, Gavin. Just take them off before you break my ankle.\" So you set her head down again and took off her heels. Holding the straps through your fingers, your hands were quite full after picking Haley up once more and leaving the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yow! The pavement is hot.\" You complained, putting them back on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Just please tell me where we are going?\" She begged you, distressed at being wholly at the mercy of someone else like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my girlfriend's house. It's just a few blocks away.\" You explained. \"I would take us back to my home, but my wallet, phone, and keys were in my pants pocket. Whoever stole my body has them now, so I'm locked out and can't call anybody. But Mikki has a spare house key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Mikki is your girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think she'll react?\" Mentioned Haley. \"Bursting into her house like <i>this</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No other choice at the moment.\" You shrugged. \"We absolutely need to go somewhere private though. Out here, on the street, we're a total freak show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I disagree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Haley, why did the people in that van give your body back? There's nothing... wrong with it, is there?\" You inquired, looking over her body resting below your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but then again who knows what they're looking for, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they going to do to my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me, Gavin. I just hope they come back so they can give it back to you. And give my body back to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think they'll do that?\" You asked a bit skeptically. \"I saw a bunch of other bodiless heads in that black van. Not exactly law-abiding behavior to go around stealing bodies and heads from people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should call the police!\" She declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we get to Mikki's house. I don't have a phone, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Did you happen to get my purse back? I've got a phone and --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" You replied flatly. She frowned and had a pensive look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is difficult to walk steadily in Haley's strappy 4-inch heels, and sometimes you lose your balance and stumble forward. Your ass feels bigger, rounder. Hips sashaying beyond your control with every mincing step you take, making you feel like a wobbly bowl of jello. Your new arms and legs are shaved, with a sleeve tattoo running down the length of your left arm. On your wrists are adorned several bracelets, and on your left ring finger is a diamond-tipped wedding ring. Although the low-cut gray top covers your midriff, you can feel that Haley has a belly button piercing underneath. Clearly this is a woman who enjoys to decorate and show off her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you married?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you noticed the ring?\" She replied. \"Yeah, it'll be two years this November. I'll talk about Greg later if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-B-but that means... you and your husband... umm... you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We what? Have had sex?\" She said matter-of-factly. Seeing the pale expression on your face she scoffs, \"Yes, Gavin, one of the better parts of being married. We don't all the time of course, but what else do you expect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -- uh -- I -- \" You stammer, realizing that your current body has had sex with men on multiple occasions. Using the vagina resting snugly between your legs. <i>Your</i> vagina at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Gavin! It's nothing to be embarrassed about. If anything, I should be the one flipping out; some strange guy has my body right now! Besides, haven't you and Mikki... you know, together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but this is different. <i>Way</i> different.\" You answered, quickening your pace toward Mikki's house. Briefly hiding behind a large tree as you see a car rush by. The black van nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, your head is so heavy.\" You complain, shifting Haley's head in your arms. Cradling her against your other breast this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm probably not as strong as you were, Gavin.\" She smiled apologetically. \"Be thankful that you still <i>have</i> arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thrilled...\" You groaned. Wishing that you had just stayed home that afternoon and avoided this surreal weirdness entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like forever, you mince up to the front door of Mikki's house. You set Haley down next to the welcome mat and ring the doorbell. Normally you would call Mikki to tell her you were coming over, but in this case it would have to be a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a surprise it would be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? How does Mikki react to the sight of her longtime boyfriend head swapped with a voluptuous, recently married young woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was walking home from work and saw a guy's head being plucked clean off his torso.\" She explains. \"His body was still <i>alive</i>. What was I gonna do, just leave it out in the street?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have done that, yeah.\" You deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley sighs, \"Looks like calling the police is out of the question now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you still have that body somewhere in the house?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikki nods, then leads you (carrying Haley's head) downstairs into the cellar. Pulling on a lightbulb chain, a dull light illuminates the room. It's damp and a bit cluttered, but your girlfriend managed to throw together a mattress and bedsheets for her decapitated companion. She kicked away some pillows covering the body's neck stump, which was amazingly sealed with skin over the top. As if no damage in removing the head occurred. Just a smooth bump where a human head should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouch down and inspect the body. \"Look at that... he's still breathing somehow.\" Noting the calm rise and fall of the body's chest. The man looked to be in fairly good shape, well built, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all,\" Mikki says, holding her fingers along the man's neck. \"You can feel a pulse... a regular heartbeat. The skin is warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks pretty tall,\" observes Haley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From your perspective, shouldn't everyone be?\" You joke. To which she retorts, \"If I had my own hands right now I'd slap you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean these hands?\" You ask, cupping her breasts right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gavin, stop perving and focus!\" Says Mikki, as you raise your hands and apologize. \"Hey, can't fault me for being curious. Don't tell me you wouldn't be curious if your head was on a dude's body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Haley is about to interject, Mikki's eyes flash. \"That's actually not a bad idea. It might even make our problems easier. Do you... do you think we could put your head on his body temporarily? Then try to put Haley's head back on her own body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try tugging on your head to no avail. Mikki tries pulling as well, but it's no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Stop. It's not working.\" You cry out. Putting Haley's head onto the man's body doesn't work either. You spend your energy trying to prop up the man's torso while Mikki tries forcing her head onto the neck stump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing, you readjust your top. \"This guy's such a dead weight! How did you lug him all the way down here by yourself, Mikki?\" To which she shrugged, having taken a while to do it apparently. Not without a few bruises on the unfortunate fellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can't remove heads from bodies, or put them onto headless bodies.\" Haley surmises, frowning. \"Yet those snatchers can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Mikki, and Haley discuss the mystery but can't find any satisfying answers. Trudging back upstairs, you lounge about watching the local news on TV for updates. Mikki is browsing her laptop, while Haley is resting on the sofa next to you. News coverage is slow as usual, with no indication of mischief afoot. Haley runs her eyes all over her body, seeing it from a new perspective for the first time ever. Watching you relieve an itch on your inner thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reddit, Pinterest, Facebook, Google. No info on body thieves.\" Mikki reports, standing up. \"I realize I've been an awful host. Haley, would you like something to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I dunno. <i>Can</i> I have something to drink?\" She stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might be worth finding out. Like, if your mouth is connected psychically to your throat or something.\" Your girlfriend suggests. \"Might explain how that man's headless body down there is still functioning like normal.\" Mikki pours a glass of water with a bendy straw, holds the young woman's head steady as she sips. Amazingly, the water level in the glass fell but the water seemed to disappear as she drank it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I was thirsty.\" She says, as Mikki returns her to the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel any different.\" You remark, half expecting to feel water trickling down Haley's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend sets about making some sandwiches and leftovers to snack on, while you log into to your online bank account using her computer. Trying to ignore the clicking of your long fingernails on the keyboard, you deactivate your credit and debit cards since the thieves likely have those along with your wallet and body. Figuring that this was probably the most <i>creative</i> way to go about stealing someone's identity that you can think of. Assuming that was the snatchers' intentions... but then why steal peoples' heads as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there's an interruption! What's happening?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
