When a split happens, the stars and planets are split into two groups-the fierce and violet New Stellar Empire, and the Democratic Republic of Sol Garga. With the new 'Myrmidon' mecha in mass production, it's a fierce arms race as the two sides duke it out for control of the system... Take control of a pilot serving Sol Garga, and leave your mark on this war!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 2: Electric Soldier Enzarger<br>\r\nWhen the Hadean Empire invades from the sky, Jurota Makigami, a high schooler who likes to fiddle with electronics, finds himself on the side of a secret war against the alien empires, with the help of an intelligent robot named Enzarger, his creator, the eccentric scientist Norifumi Kyosuke, his daughter Maki, and an alien defector named Cerber. Can Jurota, Enzarger, and their help overthrow the reign of Emperor Hade?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 3: The City of Cancer<br>\r\nIn the Golden Kingdom, all rebellion is quenched under the power of the state's Ex-Bios: Extremely small biological nanomachines that can morph and change into different forms. The military uses them for weapons and armor, but they have uses all around: medicine, law enforcement, and even construction, being strong and sturdy for houses to be made out of. In fact, in the Golden Kingdom, the whole city is made of the biological nano-machines, being a living organism into itself. But when cancerous growths with anti-city slogans and strange, biomechanical suits begin to appear, a revolution begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 4: The Bloody Wastes<br>\r\nAfter a nuclear war destroyed Earth, the city of Neo Tokyo seeks a way to expand and grow, and so expeditions using the new Khaos mechanical units begins... a series of struggles against the mutants of the outside world occurs as ideas new and old clash.</span></div></div>",

The man-Emperor Hade-stands up, moving his dark purple cape behind him, revealing his green suit with gold highlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Our Chimerae will destroy the world, and then we can raze it for the thing we so desperately need: Plutite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REDUCE TO SUB-SONIC SPEED!

Jurota Makigami. Age 17, finishing his 3rd year of high school in Japan, specifically the Chubu prefecture. Son to Tohru Makigami, a programmer, and Junko Makigami, a nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he fiddled with the circuit board, he noticed a sound, resounding. Coming from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw the Arbitor-also known as the Mobile Hadean Base: Styxia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice seemed to resound from everywhere, and yet from nowhere at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish creatures of this backwater planet! Bow to your knew subjugators, and know true peace! Bow to the Hadean army!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJurota felt a primal emotion in his heart.</span></div></div>",

The buildings of the city itself are tiny, living organisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're called Ex-Bios. They're tiny, organic nanomachines, able to replicate the appearance of other materials like metal and stone. They have their own power generators, and the whole city, all buildings, are created out of them. Anything that appears inorganic is actually organic. Concrete. Clothing. Tools. Computers. Everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds neat, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor most of the people living in this city, things are normal. They're blissfully unaware of anything viewing them, not knowing that the saying 'The walls have ears' is not only true in a figurative sense, but a literal one. Every Ex-Bio can see and hear anything around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, one year, something very strange happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParts of the city began to act... strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a human body developing a cancerous growth, the buildings warped and shifted. Anti-government slogans appeared as graffiti. Truths were revealed to anyone who was in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, nobody could surveil anyone that was in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEx-Bios make great weapons. The city's army has cutting-edge weapons, both for range and for melee combat. They also have been injected with them, allowing them to have increased speed, strength and endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was, that in these 'Blind' areas, that one person found something to help them fight back: A suit made of rogue Ex-Bios, with armor and weaponry. Adjustable. Sentient. Powerful.</span></div></div>",

Among the towering super soldiers of the Adeptus Astartes, the Dreadnoughts, tomb-mechas piloted by once crtically engineered Space Marines, and Titans, collasal multi team mechas, as well as many others in between, wage war, for the glory of the God Emperor of Mankind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Hail Britaiinia-The Holy Britannian Empire, having conquered most of the known world, has come under threat from Japanese insurgents. You are a new pilot for the Knightmare Frames, agile robots with firepower and speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Mobile Assault Division-You play Sanjuro Makabe, a Mobile Combat Armor (MCA) pilot and Commander in the UCA Security Force. The UCA was originally formed by three dominant megacorporations (Andra Biomechanics, Armacham Technology Corporation, and Shogo Industries). Originally intended as a joint venture that would ensure the continued profitability of the three organizations that founded it, the UCA is now independent, and the dominant military power in existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mission is to locate and assassinate a rebel leader known only as Gabriel. All of the action takes place either on the planet Cronus or on the spaceship Leviathan. The Leviathan is the flagship of the UCA and is commanded by Admiral Akkaraju. Cronus is the only known source of the biologically active material known as Kato, an incredibly powerful energy source essential to the process by which interstellar travel is possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour deadly enemy is The Fallen, a fanatical terrorist group lead by the mysterious Gabriel, threatens the balance of power on Cronus, and ultimately, control of Kato. You will fight them on your feet or from within one of the different types of Mobile Combat Armor, a giant mech which can run, duck, strafe, swim or transform into an ultrafast hovertank. </span></div></div>",
