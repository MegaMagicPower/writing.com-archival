I'm 15 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friends and I are founding members of the Archaeology Club. James Allen, Stephanie Page, Bill Stewart, and I have a real interest in learning about the ancient world. So it was nothing but good news when our folks agreed to take us to Egypt for our summer vacation. And when they arranged for us to explore an actual dig on our last day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe site was a temple of Horus, the hawk-headed god of the sky. Learning about these ancient people was why we founded the Archaeology Club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think it was Stephanie who found it. It was an iridescent white stone, perfectly round. The base had hieroglyphics. \"What does this say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI whipped out my hieroglyphics cheat sheet. \"Looks like it says, 'Gift from the Skies,'\" I said. \"What do you think it means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely,\" James said, \"they found it inside a meteorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie couldn't resist bringing it out into the open, and we couldn't resist following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sunlight touched the rock, my field of vision was filled with iridescent white light. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, a college student asked us, \"What was the best thing about the day for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely the Gift from the Skies,\" I replied. \"I've never seen anything like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither have I. What do you suppose that field was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What field?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The field projected onto you and your friends by that rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had seemed harmless enough, but now we wondered what we were dealing with.</span></div></div>",

I couldn't figure out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on, another weird thing caught my attention: Electronics didn't seem to work right in my presence anymore. The TV, the phone, computers, tablets: it all quit working when I was in the room. And, if I was in the room with it long enough, I would start feeling sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad couldn't get me in to see a doctor right away, but we could clear the electronics out of my room. Mom also seized the opportunity to declare that we'd be eating in the dining room until I was feeling better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat down to supper, I winced as I sat back in my chair. \"What's wrong, honey?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My back hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worse than the rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's have a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lifted my T-shirt, and Mom gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went over to the mirror, and it was my turn to gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two ridges on my back, over my shoulder blades.</span></div></div>",

Or, in this case, three of them: the rest of the Archaeology Club was there. And it didn't take long to figure out that they were going through the same thing I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I finally got in to see a doctor, he ordered X-rays. A nurse brought me to the radiology department, and I stood where the tech told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I'd had X-rays before, so I figured I should be just fine. Once the rays hit me, though, I immediately threw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ER doctor was completely baffled, and the fact that they couldn't hook me up to monitors didn't help. In the end, I was admitted for observation, which, in my case, meant that the nurses actually had to get up and check on me themselves. James, Stephanie, and Bill were also checked in. Presumably, their folks stayed with them, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up in the middle of the night, with the worst pain I had ever felt. The nurse gave me something for it, but my pain washed over it like a tsunami hitting a sand castle. The pain came in waves: Mom would say later that, if she had just my screams to go by, and if she didn't know better, she would've sworn I was giving birth. With each wave of pain, I could feel the skin on my back tightening. The nurses tried, but, with four patients having the same problem, there was no way they could be with everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there came the absolute worst of the pain. I felt my back open up in two places, and I heard my hospital gown tearing. With that, the pain stopped, and I might have let the sedative do its work if Mom hadn't said, \"Oh my God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched me, but not in a place I'd ever felt anything before, and I turned to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I saw the wings growing out of my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWings covered in iridescent white feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the first words out of my mouth were \"Gift from the Skies.\"</span></div></div>",

The doctors might not have been so easily convinced, but they couldn't deny that what had happened was not normal circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA doctor gathered us and our families in a conference room. \"Why don't you four turn your chairs around,\" he said to us, \"see if that's easier for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom always lectured me that sitting that way was bad for my back, and now a doctor was telling me to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I won't pretend to understand what has happened to you four,\" he said, \"but we can explain the other symptoms you presented when you were admitted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lit a box with contrasting X-rays. \"Your bones are now hollow, like a bird's. If you were to stand on a scale, you would find that you actually weigh less than you did before. I recommend caution on your part, however: hollow bones are fragile bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the disruption of electronics in your vicinity, it appears each of you is now generating a magnetic field. The reason for this field is unknown. You're not going to stick to the refrigerator door, but I'm afraid you're off social media for the foreseeable future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we left the conference room, Stephanie pulled us aside. \"Follow me,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe followed her up back staircases until we reached the roof. \"What did you bring us up here for?\" Bill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean to tell me,\" she asked, \"that the three of you can grow wings, and not even consider whether you can fly?\"</span></div></div>",

So it came as no surprise to us when she stepped out onto the ledge.  James tried to talk her down, but Stephanie was having none of it.  \u201cCome on guys, we have wings, shouldn\u2019t we try and use them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of us could stop her, Stephanie jumped off the roof and fell out of sight.  Fearing the worst, we all ran to the edge expecting to see Stephanie\u2019s body on the pavement below.  Instead, we were greeted by the sight of her flying up from below.  <br>\r\nOnce she was level with us, she just hovered there.  Looking at Stephanie, Bill said, \u201cI know you\u2019re a little crazy, Steph, but that was insane even for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh relax, I knew nothing was going to happen.\u201d Flapping her wings, Stephanie said, \u201cIts almost as if my brain knew how to use the wings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all I needed to hear. I jumped off the ledge as well.  I fell about 10 feet before my wings started flapping.  Stephanie was right, it was as if we\u2019d had wings all our lives.  Seeing the two of us flying around, James and Bill reluctantly joined us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe flew around the building a couple of times before we saw our parents on the roof with a handful of security guards.  Turning to the others, I said, \u201cI think our fun is over. We should probably come in for a landing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d sighing, Bill said, \u201cI was just getting the hang of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his resistance, Bill followed the rest of us as we came in for a landing 20 feet from the others on the roof.  As Mom walked up to me, I said, \u201cDid you see that, Mom?  I was actually flying!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a look at the four of us, my mom said ______.</span></div></div>",

I felt like a four-year-old again, caught with my hand in the cookie jar. I hung my head. I even wrapped my wings around me, as if they had the power to protect me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angela? Where did you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lifted my head, puzzled by her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was looking everywhere. \"She was standing right here.

None of us could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camouflage,\" the doctor said. \"Many birds can blend in with their surroundings. Angela seems to have done something similar.\" He approached us. \"I must say, I am impressed. I didn't think you would be able to fly. I thought that, even with hollow bones, you weighed too much for shoulder-mounted wings to lift. Perhaps this is what your magnetic field is for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI relaxed a little. \"How did you know where to find us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When people jump off the roof,\" Mom said, \"it draws attention. When those peopledon't fall, and, instead, fly around, it draws even more attention. And when those people are wearing hospital gowns, so that all those people looking up can see your underwear,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost wrapped myself in my wings again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside,\" Mom said. \"Angela, I'd like to get some measurements, so I can figure something out for you to wear.

Once it was on my back, I put my arms through the arm holes, then buttoned up. From the front, it looked alright. From the back, the wing holes let the breezes in. \"It needs work,\" Mom said, \"but I've got a rough idea what you'll need.

I used to have dreams of flying when I was a little girl. What's the real thing like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was incredible. It felt as natural and normal as breathing. Good thing, since I can't very well ride the bus anymore. But I thought you were mad at me for flying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't mad, dear, I was worried. I was thinking of all the things that could have gone wrong. Once I calmed down, I could be happy for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both at once, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called being a mother.

Turns out having wings doesn't meet anybody's definition of being sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, Mom had a blouse ready for me. The back had a hem around the base of each wing, and zippers to close it up once it was on. \"Good idea, Mom,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friends' parents said the same thing,\" she replied, \"when I showed them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe gathered outside our rooms. \"It's going to feel good to be out of here,\" Stephanie said, \"and start the new normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Normal' is going to have to wait,\" her father said. \"There are reporters gathered outside. How are we going to get you out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea,\" I said. I wrapped my wings around myself. Walking, I asked, \"How does it look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a bit of a ripple,\" Dad replied. \"If they don't know what to look for, it might just work. Good thing the hospital waived the requirement that you ride out in wheelchairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan was simple: Our parents would walk out with us, but we would be camouflaged. With the reporters focused on the hospital, our folks would go to their cars, and we would walk to a clear spot behind the hubbub. Then, we'd fly away home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was because it was so simple, but the plan went off without a hitch. One flap was all we needed to go 50 feet into the air, and another flap had us a block away in less than a second. Needless to say, we beat our folks home.</span></div></div>",

Two days had passed since we were discharged from the hospital, and they\u2019d been camped out in front of our houses since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really made everything easier having our houses next to each other; James and I lived next to each other while Bill and Stephanie lived behind us.

We\u2019ll go to the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was interrupted by the familiar sound of a drone outside.  It came into view through one of the windows; only to suddenly drop when it got too close to us.  Thank you, electromagnetic field!

Knotting my jaws, I decided to sneak out and visit the wise old owl. Sneaking out of the house was the hard part, as Mom had become a light sleeper since the media started camping out outside of our house. Fortunately, Scottie was nice enough to remain silent as I unlocked the door and crept out. \"So far, so good...\" Wrapping my wings around me, I muttered. \"Now to get to the old oak tree...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked quickly, but quietly, past the reporters, as they sipped on coffee and talked among themselves about how to get an interview with me or the others. I was grateful to be able to get past them without notice, and cautiously approached the old oak. It was the tallest tree in the neighborhood, I would dare say it was big and strong enough to hold my friends and me easily on its thick high branches.  Upon reaching it, I met the old owl. He was far larger than I could have imagined, near the size of an eagle. As I unfolded my wings before him, I felt a twinge of fear, knowing the great owl was a bird of prey...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Why have you come?*</i> Sternly, the owl chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Scottie said you may have answers I seek.*</i> Nervously, I chirped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owl looked at me for a moment then chirped, <i>*The Gift from the Skies is not given lightly, or on a whim. You and your friends were chosen.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Chosen?!*</i> Taken back, I chirped. <i>*How... Why?*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old owl gave me what looked like a bemused smile. <i>*You and your flock are well known in these woods, and in the woods beyond.*</i> Cryptically, he chirped back. <i>*To get the answers you seek, you must first go to the crows. They are who first nominated your flock for the Gift.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he spread his wings and flew away into the night to hunt. I sighed, feeling as if the answers I got only raised more questions. My friends and I have been known to feed the crows and other birds during the winter, when food was scarce, for years. We had also fought to protect the bird's habitats from a sleazy land developer who wanted to put up a mall in our back yard, and won. Still, it was nothing spectacular to my mind, just doing the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what the crows will have to say.\" Curious, I muttered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can arrange a meeting with them then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrange a meeting?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crows are very intelligent birds, but they are slow to trust.\" Serious, Dad said. \"It's better to ask for a meeting with them rather than just showing up out of the blue.\" He sighed. \"You said it yourself, the old owl first demanded why you had come to him before he allowed you to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's a start.\" Shrugging, I said. \"Should I call my friends over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"If you go as a group, the crow may never enter the attic.\" Serious, he said. \"Go alone, and arrange the meeting for you all.\" He then tussled my hair. \"Get some sleep, before Mom finds you up and about, and gets worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and went back to bed. I no longer slept in a regular bed as I used to. It was now a large nest I had made myself, out of soft blankets and pillows.

That said, he grabbed a fire blanket from my closet and wrapped it around my body. \"Calm down, sweetie.\" Firmly but kindly, he said. \"Daddy's here, he is not going to let anything hurt his little angel..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, hesitantly, I folded my wings behind my back, with the blanket still around me, and became visible, though still very much shaken. \"Daddy,... what is happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was silent for a long time before he walked over to my computer and typed something in before motioning to the screen. \"I have been researching the Gift of the Skies.\" Softly, he said. \"There are four birds of great power in mythologies all around the world. The Phoenix, the Thunderbird, the Firebird and the Waterbird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What does this have to do with...\" Confused, I asked. Then I saw the screen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting my shocked expression, Dad continued. \"There is a legend that states if all four birds were to unite, the Earth would be restored to balance.\" He sighed. \"We humans have made a mess of things, drove several species of animals to extinction and worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Gift of the Skies...\" Softly, I said. \"I'm becoming the Phoenix...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image on the screen was of a beautiful silver winged girl with golden eyes in an aura of fire. What surprised me more was that the girl was a mirror image of myself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beginning to suspect there was more than your kindness to birds that led you to this gift.\" Serious, dad said. \"You said you had met a real Thunderbird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, tears falling. \"What I didn't mention was that the Thunderbird looked very old...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"He's likely the last of his kind, which means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. \"Which means one of my friends is likely the next Thunderbird...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
