You want one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a rough semester, but finally, it's all winding down. All that remains is for the dorm of five young furs to finish studying and take their exams. Boys, however, will be boys, and this evening is anything but ordinary. Choose a character from the list below to begin his paw growth adventure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Daniel (Tiger):</b>  Tiger, tiger, burning bright.  The tallest of the five, Danny has a slender build and an infectious smile.  Also the only one who is comfortably 'out', he has the best taste in fashion and knows a thing or two about life's finer things, like poetry and philosophy.  A budding writer, Danny aspires to achieve the kind of 'immortal success' he attributes to his favorite authors, but in his heart lies an untested insecurity he conceals behind sharp clothing and a closely protected ego. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kevin (Dragon):</b>  Kevin was raised wealthy and takes his privilege slightly for granted, but is sincere and curious.  Though his parents are livid with the choice, Kevin opted to go to state college instead of attending a more prestigious private school, which he hopes will help strip him of his limited world view.  Slick and cunning, Kevin is an agile risk-taker who hides his wealth from the other roommates in an attempt to blend in.  Studying to become a lawyer, he is logical and at times rigid in his beliefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Paul, aka \"Chugger\" (Husky):</b>  Chugger was kicked out of his frat for taking a prank too far, and no, he doesn't want to talk about it.  As one might imagine, given his nickname, this husky can drink anyone under the table, but as a Phys Ed major and aspiring athlete, he burns off the extra calories without peer.  He's proud of his physique and flaunts it, but there's more to Chugger than meets the eye; this self-professed alpha male is softer at heart than he allows his roommates to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lucas (Coyote):</b>  Luke's on the introverted side and a touch naive, but loving and loyal.  An avid gamer, photographer, and general neat-freak, he can come across as passive when in reality he lacks the confidence to act on his desires.  Although he envies Chugger's athletic prowess and Danny's inspiration, he lacks their ambition, instead often losing himself in comics or the latest triple-A game du jour.  Skinny and boyishly handsome, Luke appears submissive, but like any coyote worth his salt, he has a few tricks up his sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Reader's Choice:</b>  Will it be a nerdy eagle waffling between majors?  A mischievous skunk studying bio-engineering?  Make the choice and embiggen his paws!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Damn it, Chugger, shut the window! The AC's on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an annoyed grunt, Chugger laid his book on the table, stood up, and shut the living room window.  After staring for a moment at the wall, watching a fly he'd let in zig-zag toward the bathroom door, he reached for and shook the near-empty beer can he'd been drinking, then polished it off and grabbed another from the fridge.  With a resounding belch, he sprawled back onto the couch, stretched his enormous paws over the edge, and popped the fresh can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bullshit,\" Chugger thought to himself, carelessly glancing through textbook pages he'd neglected to read throughout the semester. Despite pulling a C- in the class, he felt confident he'd do well enough on tomorrow's exam.  The professor had already told the class there would be 50 multiple choice questions, 20 true-or-false, and 2 short essays based on the four previous tests -- there would also be a curve.  That last item alone inspired Chugger to put in a half-assed effort.  It's not that he was LAZY, per se (or so he believed), he just didn't CARE.  And this being his fourth beer, he was feeling better and better about the choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes more, Chugger laid the book face-down on the coffee table and yawned.  He'd rather be pumping iron than reading about hyperextension or proper technique or whatever.  He already knew this stuff, even if he didn't articulate it well!  Besides, there would be a couple hours left to cram in the morning.  With a firm thud, Chugger set his paws on the carpet and reached for the XBox controller.  Some Call of Duty would hit the spot.  Mid-way through a match, Danny the tiger emerged from his room and stood beside the television with a hand on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paul,\" he smirked, \"I realize you're thoroughly prepared to give your dissertation on Muscle Milk, but the rest of us have finals we're not ready for. Can you please keep it down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure bro, go ahead,\" Chugger said, taking a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such a feral animal,\" Danny said, rolling his eyes as he tweaked the volume on the side of the TV, causing Chugger to prop his paws onto the coffee table with a dismissive laugh. \"Don't you ever think about anyone.....\" Danny trailed off as he stared at the husky's naked soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Chugger said, absent-mindedly flexing his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Paul...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConveniently enough, Chugger had just been killed and was waiting to respawn, giving him enough time to look into Danny's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your paws... Are they normally this big?\" Danny asked, his long tail swishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck are you talking about?\" Chugger smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his disbelief, as Chugger glanced to his already-oversized white-furred paws, they were indeed larger than he expected.  It wasn't just the buzz, was it?  Quirking an eye, he laid the controller beside him and spread his toes testingly.  \"No way,\" he murmured, and covered his mouth to let out another soft beer belch.  If he were to be honest with himself, he'd always loved the fact that he had such large paws.  A burly dude needs equally huge feet, after all.  With a fascinated grin, he crossed one over the other and fanned out his toes, only to realize, as the moments crept by, that they were still growing bigger.  \"Holy shit,\" he gasped, \"Dude, they're still growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was perfectly aware, continuing to stare at Chugger's soles with his mouth agape.  The dog's paws must be nearly 1.5X as large as normal, and showed no signs of stopping!  Unbeknownst to Chugger, for at least the time being, the tiger's shorts were rapidly tenting, and a blush filled his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' awesome,\" Chugger laughed, lifting one to give Danny a better view. His feet were toned and shapely, with lusciously curved arches and long, muscular looking toes. If he had been blushing before, Danny's cheeks were on fire now. \"Maybe you should give me a massage while I play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R... really?\" Danny asked, incredulously. Even then he could feel his fingers twitch, wanting to reach out and stroke across his roommate's soft-furred, perfect paws...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You think I'm playing around?\" Chugger inquired with a playful smirk, spreading his four toes out as far as he could, \"I ran eight and a half miles and my paws are effin' tired.  Be a bro and show me some proper attention, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny could hardly believe his ears.  For all his talent, for all the adulation his professors had showered upon him, here he stood, weak-kneed before his more dominant roommate, embarrassed yet thrilled.  It would be an opportunity missed, he realized, to utter some clever quip and quickly dodge back into his room, like he was suddenly considering.  This moment was, in truth, what he desired.  With a hastened pulse, Danny glanced across the hall for a potential glimpse of the others before returning his gaze to Chugger's enormous soles.  They were perfect -- the feet of a god, he thought, reaching for the low-hanging fruit of melodramatic exaggeration.  And yet, at their current size, they really did appear somewhat godly, much too large for an average creature to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Chugger, they were fitting.  Danny pictured him speeding across the Iditarod, single-handedly dragging a sled in naught but bulging red speedo and reins, his monstrous paws sinking repeatedly into the freshly fallen snow with crisp, rhythmic plodding.  Before long, Danny realized he'd slipped into daydream, and his blush persisted once he spied Chugger observing him with a bemused grin.  The husky took a long drag from his beer and laid it beside him, then picked up the controller and resumed playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long are you gonna make me wait?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe his roommates would catch him in the act, but the risk, Danny surmised, was worth it.  Without further hesitation, Danny dropped to his knees and took Chugger's right paw into his hands, feeling it slowly swell.  He'd masturbated to thoughts like this, loathe as he was to admit it.  Part of him detested the dog's lazy, oft brutish demeanor, but his attraction, particularly in the heat of the moment, overruled everything.  A strange heat emanated from Chugger's sole, almost seeming to pulse as his paws grew.  He was so large he couldn't possibly fit into socks or shoes, and the bigger his feet became, the greater Danny welled with passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm doing this,\" Danny intoned with a near-sigh as he rolled his thumbs along Chugger's arch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he continued his game, Chugger had become distracted and squirmed lightly on the couch.  \"You're not bad at this,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Chugger's surprise, Danny pressed his nose into his sole and nuzzled it affectionately.  Even though all he'd asked for was a massage, the added touch was not unwelcome, especially once he felt the tiger's rough, warm tongue begin to bathe delicately across his pads.  \"Oh god,\" Chugger groaned, his gym shorts rising quickly with his enormous erection.  There was nothing about Chugger, it would seem, that wasn't impressively portioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's bath persisted for a good few minutes, his eager tongue exploring every inch of the husky's paw.  Once he'd cleaned it thoroughly, he moved on to the other, hugging it greedily close to his face.  One after the other, he probed underneath and between Chugger's toes, his audible lapping filling the moments between reports of gunfire from beyond the building where Chugger's character now idled.  Covering his mouth with one hand to muffle a moan, Chugger started to milk himself through his shorts with the other, occasionally fanning out and then scrunching his toes.  Danny's sensual licking was more erotic than he'd imagined, and precum had already begun pooling out from the tip of his beastly prick, seeping through the thin fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamelessly, Danny snuck gratuitous breaths of his roommate's musk.  Chugger had showered since running, but there remained a pleasant blend of hormones paired with his natural, clean scent that made the tiger whine.  Fervently groping at the husky's massive paws, there was no amount of contact that would satisfy Danny.  Both were fully entranced, which is probably why neither he nor Chugger realized...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon, a feeling followed the growth, and marketing Chugger shiver lightly in pleasure, and wiggle his expanding toes. \"Mmm, awwwsome...\"  Danny keeps starring at Chuggers growing, sweaty, soft paws, almost hypnotized.
