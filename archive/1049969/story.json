Sally is 19 and is into dolls like a little girl;  she never really grew up.  Sally's father is a toy maker.  It was Sally's father that made the plush toy that she gave you.  It's a very well-made plush toy and is so soft that you cuddle with it nearly every night in bed.  You know that it's childish to sleep with a toy at your age, but its not like you tell everybody about it.  The Plush toy is slightly bigger than a cat.  <br>\r\n   First off, what is your plush toy?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      4/7 UPDATE<br>\r\n <br>\r\n        You don't have to follow the storyline above.

The fox's eyes are made out of plastic and are black.  The orange fur is soft to the touch. You decided that the fox is a vixen.  You can't say how you're sure about this, but you're convinced its a she.  <br>\r\n     A few weeks after your birthday, your vulpine pal comes to life.  You're not sure how it came to life.  It happened one night when you woke up suddenly with a full bladder.  After going to the bathroom, you re-enter your room and see that the plush fox has moved about a foot from where it was on your bed.  You also see whiskers on the fox, something you don't remember seeing.  It blinks its eyes, with startles you.<br>\r\n      \"Hello\" said the plush fox in a female voice.  <br>\r\n     Your eyes go wide and you let out a small yelp.<br>\r\n    \"Oh, be quiet\" said the fox.  \"you want to wake the whole house up?\"  then, the fox giggled.<br>\r\n     \"But...but..how?\" you stammer.   <br>\r\n     \"Magic\" said the fox, matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n     \"Magic?\" you ask.  \"there's no such thing\"<br>\r\n     \"Don't be too sure of that\" said the fox.  \"that toy maker knows some magic\"<br>\r\n     You haven't moved an inch since the vixen had first spoken to you.  You're too afraid to get near it.  <br>\r\n     \"Hey, I'm not an 'it' !\" said the vixen, sounding angry.  \"I do have a name, you know\"<br>\r\n      \"You do..?\" you ask faintly. <br>\r\n       The fox nodded. <br>\r\n      \"What is it?\" <br>\r\n      \"Racheal\" said the fox.  \"come closer.  I like to cuddle with you some more!\" </span></div></div>",

After all, you still need a full night's sleep, and freaking out isn't going to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few deep breaths, you walk calmly towards the bed and sit down gently next to Raechel.

But she's more than happy to hop into your lap and snuggle up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit for a few minutes, just cuddling and beginning to enjoy having a living toy.

You see a total of eight teeth.  You hadn't noticed those teeth before.  The teeth are pointed, but are made out of plush.  The teeth are not that big. <br>\r\n        \"I said that toy maker knew some magic\" said Racheal.  \"he made me alive with that magic.  I'm alive in every sense of the word; I need food just like you do\"  <br>\r\n       \"Well...what do you wanna eat then?\" you ask.<br>\r\n       In answer, Racheal licks your face with her plush tongue.

It's as if this plush toy is turning into a real fox before your eyes!   You consider running from the wide open maw in front of you but something tells you to enter her mouth.   You don't know why you want to enter her mouth but you feel you can trust Rachael that you won't be hurt.  You step over Rachael's lips and onto her tongue.  Not only her teeth look more real but her tongue feels like the real thing!  She even has gums!<br>\r\n                              Rachael moves you in her mouth, savoring your taste.  You're bounced around the mouth afraid that you might be impaled on one of her teeth but you don't.  <br>\r\n                       \"You taste delicious\" said Rachael.   Then she gulps you down, sending you down her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        The muscles in the throat push you down, down and down until you're forced through a tight ring of muscle and you enter a large chamber that could only be her stomach.  You don't land with a splash into stomach acid but land with a soft thud.  There's so stomach acid at all and the floor of the stomach is soft like velvet.  It takes your eyes several minutes to adjust to the dim light in the stomach.  The light inside the stomach comes from the walls.<br>\r\n                               The inside of the stomach is a strange mix of organic and plushy material.   The floor and the walls are made from what looks like velvet and the top of the stomach seems to be organic.  The stomach chamber is perhaps 20 feet in diameter.  It's quite cozy in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             \"Told you\" said Rachael.   \"you love it in here don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             \"Yes..\" you say.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                               \"Just sit there and relax\" said Rachael.  \"you're gonna be in there for a while\"  </span></div></div>",

Anyway I will catch you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard that and headed for the door. By the time you reached the door you noticed that Racheal began to moved and chase you.

She touches her nose to your pant button and your pants completely disintegrate!  You automatically try to get her off of you, but she puts her paws on your chest and reaches forward and touches your nose with hers.You hold still as she begins to change size and shape, becoming slightly shorter than you and with a soft, feminine form.  Her eyes are different and as you look at them, you realize they're the same eyes that you fantasize about on a girl.  She's humanoid in shape, but still retains her foxish physique: slim, small paws(yes, still paws), a long muzzle with pointy ears and a bushy tail...not to mention the cloud-soft red fur that covers her naked body! She rests her large breats against your chest and spreads her thighs over your hardening dick, then begins to lower herself on it when you....</span></div></div>",

She pulls you closer and bites you gently on the neck.  As you're now looking behind her you notice that now she has more than one tail.  In fact she has nine and she also gained a bit more height, which makes her the same size as you are.  She still has her foxish features.

Any other human might have a problem but not me\"<br>\r\n   She smiles and kisses you and the two of you start to tongue-wrestle.  You then shove your throbbing erection into her. The questions you have for her quickly die while you two start to do the horizontal mambo.  For the next few minutes you two get into a comfortable rhythm.  You don't care if this is a crime against nature making love to a non-human.  All you care is that this feels absolutely incredible.  <br>\r\n     You feel yourself inching towards climax and you thrust even deeper.

Sally's place is about a twenty minute walk away, but there's no way you should be seen carrying a stuffed animal around. If the toy moves, people might mistake her for a real fox, but all it takes is one nosy neighbor to call the authorities.

You think letting Rachael 'carry' you to Sally's might be a bad idea if she doesn't get you there on time.

You land in a small chamber that would've been a stomach.  The chamber is perhaps 10 feet across compared to your size.  The lining of the chamber was soft as velvet, and had no exit to it.  There's no stomach acids here either, so you're sure that you won't get digested. <br>\r\n      \"Welcome to your new home\" said Nithog's voice all around you. </span></div></div>",

They have been around since the Dinosaur days.  When the meteor that killed all the dinosaurs struck Earth, a few dragons survived and thrived, living off the little mammals that were there.  When man came around, dragons decided to change thier forms and into human beings.  At first, dragon and human lived in harmony with one another.  And then, came the middle ages...\"  <br>\r\n      Nithog sighed.<br>\r\n      \"In the Middle Ages, there came a dragon that was named Zorks.  Zorks was wicked and evil to the extreme.

Zorks and I went to war over it...and Zorks won barely.  With my army defeated, Zorks's followers went around everywhere, devouring humans left and right.  The humans started to hunt down all dragons, wheather they were good or evil.  Humans were quite good at killing dragons...they had nearly killed all the dragons.

I had plenty with YOU!\" Shen then grins wickedly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to blush and get really nervous when she strokes your head with a hand/claw. \"Um...I uh...I do have a girlfriend you know...\" you try to tell her, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....I....MUST add you to my collection!!\" she then JUMPS on you and pins you down!! She licks your face a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W....WAIT!!....I said I DIDNT want to eaten!\" you yell at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs, \"Heh...you act as if Ive given you a choice!\" She starts to open her mouth wide like a snake RIGHT over your head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to get terrified, \"NITHOG!

You're able to free one hand from her grip and start to pry your other pinned arm.  She laughs and grabs your free hand.  That's when you knee her in the stomach, knocking the wind out of her.  Appearently, Nithog isn't stronger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Is that what you think?\" asked Nithog.  \"I like to play with my food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You get to your feet, while Nithog is gasping for breath.  You look around in vain for an escape route.  The only way out of this chamber is the way you came in, which is 20 feet above you and you have no hope to get to it.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n      Nithog gets up and jumps at you again, but you dodge barely.  Nithog grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You may be fast, human\" said Nithog.  \"but soon you'll tire..and there's no escape from me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She continues her attack but you keep on dodging them.  Nithog doesn't look angry; in fact, she's enjoying it!  She's right, she's just playing with you until you run out of energy.<br>\r\n          \"You might as well give up, then\" said Nithog, licking her lips.<br>\r\n          \"But I'm too young to die!\" you shout.<br>\r\n          \"Who says you're gonna die?\" asked Nithog.<br>\r\n          What?<br>\r\n      \"You want to eat me\" you say.  \"If you do that, I'll die\"<br>\r\n      Nithog stops her attack and laughs.  <br>\r\n       \"What's so funny?\" you ask.<br>\r\n       \"You think I would kill you?\" asked Nithog.  <br>\r\n      \"You said...\"<br>\r\n      \"I'm going to add you to my COLLECTION, dumbass\" said Nithog.<br>\r\n       \"And your collection is in your stomach?\" you ask.<br>\r\n       \"Yes\" said Nithog.  \"you see, dragons have two stomachs.  One stomach is for digesting food, the other one is for storing food\"<br>\r\n       \"But how can you have two stomachs?\" you ask.  \"if your collection is big, then your belly would be bigger\"<br>\r\n        Nithog smirked.  <br>\r\n        \"Just let me eat you and you'll understand\" said Nithog.<br>\r\n        \"But I don't wanna get eaten\" you say.<br>\r\n         \"I'm so bored hearing that\" said Nithog.  \"you're lucky your not with Zorks.

Nithog is letting you dodge.  <br>\r\n        \"Come on\" said Nithog.  \"I promise it won't hurt...much\"<br>\r\n        \"No!\" you yell.<br>\r\n        You and Nithog continue to do your little dance of jump and dodge.

She closes her eyes and disappears.  The pressence you feel is alien to you.  You don't know who it is.  You can't see him, but you can feel his pressence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     ---Outside---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The red-haired human slave notices the plush toy's eyes are glowing purple light.  Then, the toy's head moves by itself and looks at the slave. <br>\r\n       \"Who are you?\" asked Nithog.<br>\r\n       The human slave quickly lets go of the toy.<br>\r\n       Nithog notices that she's in the lap of a human.  She looks up to see the face of....NO!  It couldn't be!  Fear flowed from Nithog as she recongized the human form of Zorks!  How did HE track her down?!   Last time she heard, Zorks was somewhere in Europe, starting a computer company.  Nithog thought she had hidden from him for good.  Luckily, Zorks was sound asleep.  Nithog looks around wildly and realizes that she's on an airplane.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   --YOU--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The pressence you were feeling was gone.  What was going on?

One tunnel closes and you get pushed into the other one. There you land into some kind of room with lots of padding and pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like some kind of bedroom with comfy beds and pillows everywhere. It even has beautiful red curtains all around the walls It's nice and cozy.  You kinda think to yourself, \"Geez, why didnt I let her eat me in the FIRST place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, someone appears before you. It's that teenaged slave that spotted you earlier! He grins at you, \"Cozy, isnt it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...who are you?\" you ask him. He bows his head and tells you, \"My name is Sadri H'Thiara. And I will need your help in defeating Zorks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zorks?? But dont you serve him?\" you ask Sadri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serve him, yes. But I am in no allegiance with that beast! Let's just say I actually serve a higher force destined to be rid of ancient evils such as that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and look him straight in the eye, \"Im listening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadri then makes a wicked-looking grin at you, \"Good... because I will need your undivided attention!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The plane and the dragon was over the Atlantic Ocean, so nobody noticed that a dragon had appeared from no where.  Nithog had, of course, teleported the toy and herself out of the plane and out of Zorks's lap.  She then reverted to her true form, a thing that she hadn't done in 900 years.  She looked like the toy had; Dark green body, with light green on her belly, huge bat-like wings, two arms thicker than tree trunks, spikes coming out of her tail and had hazel eyes.  She was much bigger than the plane she had been in.  Nithog in her true form was well over 100 feet long.  Her wingspan was 140 feet by themsleves.  Nithog was close too 1000 feet long and looked like a fierce enemy.  She had no hair on her scaley body.  The plane was out of sight when Nithog started to feel a pain in her stomach.  She knew at once what it was.<br>\r\n      Nithog quickly threw up you and Sadri.  You're both covered in stomach acid and salvia.  <br>\r\n     \"What in hell did you think you were doing?!\" asked Nithog.<br>\r\n      Even though it's nighttime, you're able to see Nithog's outline.  You can't help but being intimidated by the sight of her in her true body.<br>\r\n      \"This is S...Sadri\" you say, stammering slightly.  \"he could help us defeat Zorks\"<br>\r\n       \"And how do you suppose you defeat Zorks?\" asks Nithog.<br>\r\n      \"I can block out Zorks's mind reading\" you say.<br>\r\n      \"And while he's doing that\" said Sadri.  \"I can help you fight Zorks\"<br>\r\n       \"A puny human like you fight Zorks?\" asked Nithog. <br>\r\n      \"Ah, I come from a higher power\" said Sadri.  \"I have...certain powers that'll help us defeat Zorks\"<br>\r\n        Nithog flew over the clouds, so that she wouldn't be seen by humans on the ground.  Nithog's hand is bigger than you and her claws are even bigger!  You are simply awed at her size.  And...how graceful she flies.  It's hard to believe that a creature this big can even fly.  </span></div></div>",

They didnt, the president told me personally that he would nuke us in our next battle, i was bound at the time, which was lucky for him.  Another mistake i made was not telling you about it, he wouldn't kill us stwithout a fight if I said, and i always though we could always find a way to avoid the blasts.  when it happened i was wrong, the blast would have killed us all, but only i I survived, i had no idea why, but i just did.  After that i joined the anti-goverment force, hell bent on revenge, that was how Drachte was born, he fed off my anger and chanelled into violence in a fight.

What does my past has anything to do with this?<br>\r\n       Nithog is knocked into the peak of a mountain.  She lets go of you and you fall down and down.  <br>\r\n    \"AHHHHH!!!

Your mother didn't teach you how to fight dragons!<br>\r\n     You continue to fall and you rush towards the ground.  You close your eyes, not wanting to see death coming. <br>\r\n    Then, all goes white.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     *****<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     You've emerged from your egg finally.  You pant as your young body is tired from getting out of the egg.  You belch a small spark of fire.  You hear someone chuckling above you.  You look up, and see your mother for the first time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    *****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You snap open your eyes.  You're not dead.  Sadri has saved you at the last possible moment. Nithog and Zorks are still battling far above you.  <br>\r\n    \"Thanks\" you say.<br>\r\n    \"Bahamut saids that you will find your power on your own\" said Sadri.  \"now, I must go help Nithog\"<br>\r\n     \"Wait!\" you shout.  \"what am I supposed to do?!\"  <br>\r\n     It goes all white again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     ****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You are flying unsteadily through the air.  You're flying right behind your mother.  She is teaching you how to hunt.   <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Are you alright?\" asks Sadri.<br>\r\n    \"I think so\" you say.<br>\r\n    {Your mother needs you}<br>\r\n    But my mother is back in the United States..<br>\r\n    What the hell was going on?!  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's made of aluminum and its fairly heavy considering its a little-league bat. \"The next person that decides to mess with me is getting hit out of the park!\" You say to your almost empty room. You feel someone or something breathing down your neck. \"BATTER UP!\" You scream as you turn around and swing at the empty space. Now you are completely terrified. You try to remain calm and your hand brushes over your belt, something hard is there and you remember what it is and relax a little.

Fang roars again and grabs you. \"Time for a midnight snack.\" Fang says. \"You shall not win that easily beast!\" You say as you pretend to bash Fang with your shield. Fang drops you and falls to the ground. \"Where is the princess?\" You ask. \"I shall never tell.\" Fang replies playing along. \"Where is she?\" You ask again. \"Not that it matters to you.\" Fang answers. \"Why is that dragon?\" You ask not sure where Fang is going with this. \"Because I'm going to eat you!\" Fang shouts as he springs up and pounces on you. You are pinned to the ground and Fang doesn't give you a chance to throw him off you. \"No, the dragon never wins.\" You protest. \"This time he does.\" Fang shouts as he holds you up. Fang opens his mouth wide and begins to swallow you.

Something touches your leg, it's cold and it feels soft. You swing the bat behind you without turning around. Seeing that you hit nothing, you begin to wonder if you're losing your mind. To disprove that theory something taps you on the shoulder. You turn around and still nothing. You're really mad at this point, and you wonder who or what is doing this to you.

You put your plan into action and pretend to scream in surprise. You fall to the ground feeling pretty good (your plan was to make it look like the person gave you a heart attack.) Your idea works and the thing bends down. Your plan had backfired slightly as you had closed your eyes after falling. Something sits you up and wraps around you. You're sitting there limply while this thing has one hell of a grip on you. You take a chance and open your eyes. Your dragon is there sitting next you but slightly leaning over because it's arms are wrapped around you and it's head is laying on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your dragon doing?</span></div></div>",

It doesn\u2019t see them yet. They also see what looks like a giant spiders web near by. These girls are also unaware that a 40-foot tall, wolf like creature, is lurking near by, watching, waiting, and lusting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n These seven nude girls are, 11 year old Tiffany, 11 year old Amber, 12 year old Julie, 12 year old Jennifer, 13 year old Wendy, 13 year old Becky, and 14 year old Tina.</span></div></div>",

Makes a lot of money it does, though most of it winds up in the hands of charities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then states that only one child stayed with the witches as a soul, or ghost as it were. And that was Jessica's little brother Tom. He loved being one so much he even practiced haunting people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for me and my sisters,\" Sandra finished. \"We went to an orphange, turning into babies. We have since been adopted by families, like I wa adopted by my mom and dad.\" She goes to them and hugs. \"I have paid for my past crmes, and hope that I can make them happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh when her story ends. When you look to Jessica, expecting a reaction, what you see makes you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had fallen asleep.</span></div></div>",

Rex moves into the room slowly, sniffing the air.   You still have Pete in your claws, and Sly points the gun at Rex.<br>\r\n     \"One more move, and I'll shoot you\" said Sly.  <br>\r\n     \"With that little pea-shooter?\" asked Rex as he comes closer.  \"that won't hurt me\" <br>\r\n       \"See...I still have friends\" said Pete.<br>\r\n      \"Shut up!\" you snap at him.  <br>\r\n      Just then, a fox enters the room.  A fox with a machine gun. The fox is wearing a police officer's uniform and the name \"Ted Beauville\" is on the nametag.  <br>\r\n       \"Hold it!\" yells Ted in a commanding voice.  Rex slowly turns to see Ted and laughs.<br>\r\n         \"You...you don't work for me\" said Pete.<br>\r\n         \"Nope\" said Ted.  \"someone called in the police...now paws over your head, Rex\"<br>\r\n         \"No chance, officer\" said Rex as he steps towards Ted.  It all happens in a few seconds.  Sly and Ted both fire thier guns at Rex, at the same moment Pete breaks free of your grip and grabs for the gun in Sly's hand.  Pete never grabbed the gun, because you manage to grab him and gobble him up.  A moment later, Rex falls to the floor with a loud thud.  <br>\r\n         \"Who called the police?\" you ask, and belch loudly.<br>\r\n          \"Jessica\" said Ted.  <br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

Most of them are set free, only to face a worst problem: the press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems the whole world now knows furs are alive and exist. Lawmakers originally wanted them put in zoos, like Klondike was, but now it has become clear that you deserve to have the right to live as you wish. Especially now that you, Jessica, Sly, Sandra, and her parents are all heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete, meanwhile, doesn't even struggle inside you, seemingly accepting his fate. You sigh some. He was mad he was. His idea for furs to rule the world showed his heart was in the right place... but his brain was long gone. He simply tells you that furs will rule the world someday, and only wishes it had been Klondike, not you, that ate him in the end. THen he falls asleep inside you, possibly never to wake again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Jessica the moment you and Sly leave the building. She has her arm in a sling, but she looks alright otherwise. She rushes to you quickly and hugs you, glad that this is all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Wolfgang,\" Sly says, \"here is where we part company.\" He smiles and poits to the roftops. \"As a racoon I think my best occupation is burglary, both of valuables and of women's hearts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You relaize,\" Ted says as he comes over. \"That if I catch you it is likely you iwll rot in jail. Or be skinned, whichever seems more suitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I better never get caught!\" With that he leaps away. \"Later coppers! And WOlfgang, nice working with ya! We must do it again sometime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he is gone, leaving you utterly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did he help us? and who was he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays pass and still it doesn't die down about what happened. Many are neutral about there being living furries among humans, but children, of all people, accept them quickly. In a way, Pete's plan still goes on to a degree, as many kids try to talk their parents into letting them play with furs... or become them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr be eaten by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jessica become the center of the press, going on almost every talk show known to man, and even tlaking with leaders of other countries, many of which find furries of their own and have them meet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later, furries are offically made citizens in every country, and you even wind up ina high standing job in your hometown. You and Jessica get married not too long after that, and, thanks to the massive sex sessions, have tons of cubs. Many of which become vorish, even have personal best friends they like to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup, life is looking up. Pete may not have had the right idea on how furs and humans should live...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you have a feeling that things are just the way they sdhould be... and always will be.</span></div></div>",

I don't need anyone else really. No offense.\" She brings over a large slice of bread, or at least it looks like one. In actuality, it is part of a plush sandwich, an oddity you have seen sometimes in stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wolf swallowed this in a joke one time. It's really very comfy, but I prefer the teddy bear I got recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wondered where it went.\" You say, blushing. You climb on the bread, it is very soft indeed. You lie down quickly and look to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you like being alone huh? I'll try not to disturb you too much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say you couldn't.\" She winks at you and climbs into bed. \"Who knows? I might decide to play with you.\" she snuggles into her makeshift bed and waves good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing is for sure. this will be intresting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You are 26 years old, and you still have that plush tiger that your grandmother gave you when you were six years old for Christmas.  It's a cute tiger wearing a green T-shirt and blue shorts. The clothes can come off and can be put back on.  The plush toy is one of those big plushies, easily 5 feet tall.  The tiger towered over you when you were six.  You gave the tiger the name of Angela.  Angela has a bow on her head, clearing meaning that she's a female.  It's also one of those plushies that has a fat stomach.  It has a big white belly and has orange and black fur, just like a real tiger.  When you were little, you couldn't get to sleep without Angela beside you.  You've used her big white belly as a pillow several times and as a sleeping bag. <br>\r\n          You know that Angela is alive, and have known it since Christmas night when it started to talk to you.  At first, you were freaked out, but you thought that it was cool to have a toy that could talk to you.  Angela not only talks, but can read your mind!  Angela didn't eat you until New Year's Eve.  <br>\r\n        You were allowed to stay up until midnight to watch the New Year celebration, but you couldn't stop going to sleep.  Finally, around 10:30, you decided to watch the celebration in your room, where you would go to sleep.<br>\r\n          When you entered your room, you saw that Angela has the remote control for the small TV you had in your room.  Angela is watching one of those nature shows about real tigers in Africa.   <br>\r\n          \"Hey, Kiddo\" said Angela.  She calls you \"Kiddo\" today too.  <br>\r\n           \"Hello, Angela\" you say.  You only named her just two days ago.  You named her after your great-grandmother, who died four months ago.  You went over to your bed and sat beside Angela.  You were six at that time, so Angela was bigger than you then.  You laid your head on her big white belly, which was covered by the shirt she wears.  After a few minutes, you began to feel drowsy.  Then, you fell asleep and that's when Angela ate you for the first time.  You were swallowed in one gulp, since you were small compared to Angela.  At around midnight, you wake up slightly to hear the \"Happy New Year!\" shouts from your parents and that song they always play at New Year's.  You noticed that the shouts were somewhat muffled, and that you were no longer in your room.  You were too sleepy to figure out where were you.  You quickly went back to sleep and awoke in the morning.  <br>\r\n         Angela had refused to let you out of her stomach the next morning.  You were scarred you weren't going to come out ever.<br>\r\n        \"Don't be silly\" Angela had said.  \"I'll let you out...someday\"<br>\r\n        Angela did let you out around 12:00 noon.  Angela's stomach is silky smooth and more comfortable than any bed you've slept in.  <br>\r\n        Now you're 26 and live in an apartment with Angela.  You have a girlfriend named Kelly, and you make sure that Kelly never gets to see Angela.  If Kelly found Angela, she might think that you're a wuss or something.  <br>\r\n        You work for a computer company, and you're one of the programmer for games for the PC.  Your job pays very well and you like your job.  Angela understands the reason of having a job, but doesn't get why she couldn't talk to anyone while you're at work.  Angela gets lonely at the apartment when you're not there.  <br>\r\n        You're driving home after a tough day at work.  Henderson, your boss, was on your case all day because you were late at work that morning.  You just want to enter the apartment and go to sleep.  But Angela had other ideas. </span></div></div>",

She is slender and cute, and has many of the facial qualities Angela has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" You say, unable to move in fear of what will happen next.

But this plushie is very unique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt once belonged to her, and it shows. Fat and soft, it must be at least as big as you are if not more so. It is wearing a cute blue shirt and white shorts, but also as a bow on its head, showing it is a girl. THe name your grandmother gave it was Sheela. You decide to keep that name, as you love your grandma so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks ike a real tiger otherwise, with orange and lack stripes, a cuddly looking face, and a HUGE white belly. It's mouth is able to be opened, and it has several teeth made of foam, and a silky soft tounge. All in all, it is bnoth very cute and VERY cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have had it a week now, and tonight you are doing your usual thing with it: You are snuggled in your bed, next to the tiger. You are staring into that mouth it has.... er... SHE has, smiling a little. To a degree, you wish it was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHOULD BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR NEXT TIME!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you think these thoughts, the plush blinks. Excuse me... BLINKS? That's right. It blinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHen it wriggles it's nose. It feels like it is sniffing you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it starts to move, wrapping her arms around you in a soft cuddly hug, like what you might get from a loving mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it tops it all with what it does next.<br>\r\nIt looks right at you, and starts to speak in a feminine voice. \"Hello there new foodstuff. I'm Sheela.\" It says, you cannot help but smi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... did it just say FOODSTUFF?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes this thing want to eat you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" It says, reading your thoughts. \"I love little boys especially. Had a little girl for the longest time, and she made an ok meal, but you.... mmmmm.... I could just see you slathered in mustard or squished into a bun.... yum yum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEEK!

A little mean maybe, but all in all very cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Here I am!\" She says, holding you tighter to that soft, wondeful belly of hers. \"I will eat you all up tonight, and you will be sleeping in my stomach.

Sheela looks you over and grins. Then, without any further ado, she shoves your head into her mouth!  Her silky tongue runs all over your face, tickling you and causing you to giggle.  Sheela is making \"hmmmm\"ing noises as she tastes you.  Then, she swallows your head, sending it down her velvetly soft throat.  You're looking straight down the throat, but you can't see anything.  Sheela swallows again, and your chest enters her mouth.  She licks all over your chest with that silky tongue of hers, causing you to giggle some more.  As she swallows again, your head is forced through a tight ring of muscle and your head enters a BIG chamber that can only be Sheela's stomach.  A couple more swallows later, the rest of you ends up in her stomach.  <br>\r\n         The stomach is able to hold you.  In fact, you have a little elbow room in the stomach.  The stomach is silky like the tongue was, and very comfortable.  <br>\r\n           \"Yummy\" said Sheela's voice from all around you.  \"paw-licking good!\" <br>\r\n           Sheela said you were going to sleep in here, so you make yourself comfortable.  <br>\r\n           </span></div></div>",

So, you do what all seven year olds would do--go get mommy.  You are out of your room before Sheela can make it off the bed.  You run down the long hallway towards your mother's room.  You could hear Sheela chasing you. You get to your mom's room, open the door and enter the room and then slam the door.  The slamming of the door jerks your mother awake.<br>\r\n         \"What is it?\" asked your mother.<br>\r\n         \"My tiger came to life and said it wanted to eat me!\"  you say.  Your mother is still groggy, but she just smiles at you.  <br>\r\n          \"Mom, didn't you hear me?\" you ask.  \"that big tiger--\"<br>\r\n         \"The name's Sheela\" said Sheela, coming into the room.  Your mother rushes to Sheela and shakes her paw!  WHAT'S HAPPENING?! <br>\r\n          \"Long time no see, Janet\" said Sheela.<br>\r\n          \"It's been too long, Sheela\" saids your mother.  You are at a loss for words.  This makes Sheela turn to you and grin.<br>\r\n           \"I did say that I had a little girl that I used to eat\" said Sheela.  \"and that little girl is standing before us\"<br>\r\n            \"But--\" you stammer. <br>\r\n            \"Sheela has been in the family for a while\" saids your mother.  \"My grandmother's mother had Sheela!\"<br>\r\n           \"Wow\" you say.  <br>\r\n          \"I've been eating your family for the past 100 years\" said Sheela, who grins.  \"and you are now on the menu\"<br>\r\n          \"How did you...?\" you start to ask.<br>\r\n         \"...come to life?\" finishes Sheela.  \"well, I really don't remember.  Do you remember your own birth?\"<br>\r\n          The only answer to that is no.  You know it, you mom knows it and Sheela knows it.  <br>\r\n         \"So, I suggest we go down stairs and cover this boy in mustard\" said Sheela, licking her lips.  \"I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\n          \"It isn't as bad as you think it is\" said your mom.  \"I did the same as you when Sheela said she wanted to eat me--ran to my mother\"<br>\r\n           </span></div></div>",

You don't notice this right away, because you are too sleep.  The stomach is swaying as Sheela walks, lulling you into the most peaceful sleep you ever had. <br>\r\n         You find yourself in the jungle before too long.  You've never been to any jungle, but it's a jungle nonetheless, with all the noises you hear in the movies.  Suddenly, you come across a river in the middle of the path you're walking on.  It's a thin river, hardly more than creek, but it is about 20 feet across.    In the river, you see crocidiles.  Somewhere off in the distance, you hear a lion roar...or at least you think it's a lion.  You decide not to cross the river, or you might end up as a snack for the crocidiles.   <br>\r\n        The undergrowth of the jungle is thick, and you can hardly see anything more than 5 feet in front of you.  And you don't have a sword to cut down the undergrowth to make a path.  Suddenly. you're out of the jungle and there's a door by itself.  Logic tells you that the door shouldn't be there without a building.  But dreams are rarely logical.  In fact, dreams have thier own logic it seems.  You don't think it's weird when you're in a forest one minute in a dream and in a house the next. The door is wooden, painted white, and has some kind of symbol on it.  The symbol is a star within a circle with an orange eye directly in the middle of the star.  The orange eye is glowing slightly.  You get the creepy feeling that the eye is looking at you.<br>\r\n        Suddenly, the door shoots open and a great suction pulls you into the door.  When you enter the door, you're in blackness.  Suddenly, you see a light..a light from a candle.  <br>\r\n         \"Go away\" growls a voice that sounds like Sheela's.  <br>\r\n          That's when you wake with a start, still in the stomach of Sheela.   You have no memory of the dream you just had, and Sheela seems to be asleep.  You go back to sleep and you have more pleasant dreams.  In one, you are a captain of a spaceship, exploring the vastness of outer space.  The dreams seem to collide with one another, always changing and never making much sense.  You can sorta tell that you're in the middle of a dream, but can't control what goes on in it.  <br>\r\n          Finally, you wake up.  You felt like you had the best sleep in your young life.  You're still in the stomach of Sheela, and under the blanket of that loaf of bread.  The stomach still smells like perfume, although there is a trace of mustard in the smell now.  </span></div></div>",

You find yourself crawling up a sliky tunnel, which can only be Sheela's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you poke your head up, getting a view of the outside through her open mouth. THe sight makes you giggle some. Now you know how most prey sees the world for the last time when caught by a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiger perhaps?\" You hear Sheela say all of a sudden.

You were very tasty, and very filling.\" she embraces you in an affectionate hug. You smile a liottle.

It is more like an anime character in some ways though, with big cute eyes. Despite howfamilar you are getting with Sheela, you are still shaocked when you see Wolfie move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Here is the boy Sheela is tlaking about!\" He says with a deep voice, smiling and offering a paw to shake. \"Name's Wolfie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say your name and shake his paw. Man! This is getting kinda neat! You always liked Amy, but you are getting more and more in common!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela giggles. \"Someone has a crush I think!\" She says, causing you to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is said next makes Amy blush next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No suprise. So does she.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two plushies hmm some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got an idea!\" Sheela says. \"How about we have a little party, with these two as the snacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfie ponders. \"Let's let them decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both look at you hungrily.</span></div></div>",

It makes sense really, considering how many times he has eaten Amy, even if what she says is an understatement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last,m you finally slip completely into the belly, surrounded by soft plush. You slowly unwrap yourself to get a feel of the insides. It is veyr rubbery actually, but still very nice. Also, it is a bit warmer. If WOlfie is indeed fatter, which he is according to him, then the fatter a plushie, the warmer and comfier it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you EVER would give up Sheela for Wolfie, you like her too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww!\" You hear her voice in your mind. \"You're so sweet!\" You feel the belly squeeze around you as Sheela gives a hug through WOlfie.

I thought I saw a tail, but I didn't have time to look at him more closey\"<br>\r\n      \"A tail?\" asked Tony.  \"the thief is a furry, then?\"<br>\r\n       Furries are animals with human characterics; they can walk on two legs and talk.  Furries is the result of genetic testing by humans.  All furries vary in size, just like humans do.  A furry is usually 5 feet tall, but some furries can be bigger than most humans.  The biggest furry you ever saw was a 15-foot tall racoon named Sly.   Sly lives in the same apartment building as you and Tony do.  Sly is a security guard for a computer company.  Sly is friendly and gentle.    Furries are offically citizens of the United States, and have been since the Pete Holloway scandal came out 10 years ago.  <br>\r\n       \"I guess so\" said Henry.  \"but I couldn't be sure. Like I said, I only saw a glimpse of the thief\"<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

You tell the security guards of the apartment building to keep a look out for the thief (or thieves).  <br>\r\n       Sly the racoon helps up clean up the apartment.

When you first moved into the building 3 years ago, you and Sly use to hang out alot with each other.  You two were offically dating when you met Tony.

Most furries eat people, but furries have a second stomach for storing food.  You've been in Sly's second stomach before, and it's quite roomy.   But, not all people end up in this second stomach of Sly's.  Sly is a security guard for a nearby computer company, and he has permission to eat tresspassers or anyone sneaking into the building.

Police are everywhere, and there's not a furry around for miles.   You and Tony mingle through the crowd, looking for a pile of plushies.

Patrons of the park not in the rally are held back by barriers and police.  There's about 3,000 people protesting the rally, and the police is trying to keep the two groups separated.

The plushie bnlows off the dust and giggles at the price: 25 cents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If yoiur father only knew...\" The plushie says, opening the book. A couple cobwebs can be seen, but you cannot understand the words. The plushie smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here... hmmm... fox....bear....platypus? hmmmmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Tumtum?\" You ask, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THis is a book on transformation spells. VERY old, but still useable. There should also be ones on reformation here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Re wha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" He chuckles and turns a page. \"A ha! Here it is! Mouse! Now, I have to ask... would you like to be turned into a little mouse kid right now, or should we wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder, getting excited about this.</span></div></div>",

Furries are \"humanoid animals\"--as your father calls them--and you never saw one this close before.  The only furry you know is a big skunk named Roger that works for the Giant Eagle in town.   Roger is friendly and always eager to help.  But you don't recongize this furry at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Who are you?\" asked Tumtum.  \"and how did you get into this room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Foxes are sly\" said the fox as if that explained everything.  The fox is wearing loose-fitting pants and a \"Humans are good...\" shirt.  You saw this shirt before.  On the back of the shirt, it says \"...in the stomach\"  along with a picture of a human in the stomach of a furry.  Most furries don't wear clothes, so you find it odd that this furry is wearing clothes.<br>\r\nThe furry and Tumtum are about the same size, and each of them are 50 foot tall at least  to your small from now. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n       \"Allow me to introduce myself\" said the fox.  \"My name is Jazz, and I'll be your eater for today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"She's mine!\" yells Tumtum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"You better run, little mouse\" said Jazz, looking down at you.

Your 5'3\" and she can't get to sleep without you beside her.  <br>\r\n      You're a plain tiger plushie with black stripes all over you, and have a big white belly, big enough for kids to use it as a pillow.  <br>\r\n       Ashley used your belly as a pillow last night.  <br>\r\n        \"Morning, Snuggles\" said Ashley, rubbing your belly with her hand.<br>\r\n         \"Good morning, Ashley\" you say.<br>\r\n         \"You can talk?!\" asked Ashley, getting off of your belly to look at you more closely.<br>\r\n         \"Yep\" you say.   \"I can talk and I'm hungry\"<br>\r\n         \"Hungry?\" asked Ashley.  \"but you're just a toy!\"<br>\r\n        \"Us toys get hungry too\" you say.<br>\r\n        \"What do you wanna eat?\" asked Ashley.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tom never touched a bottle in his life, but after his wife died he went into a deep depression and started to drink to drown his sorrows.  Unluckily, he's a mean drunk.  If he was a jovial drunk, you wouldn't mind at all.  Tom comes home drunk at least every other day.  And he beats his son...or he would, if you weren't there.  When not at school, Daniel is usually hiding in your stomach.  Your stomach is Daniel's only safehaven from his father.  You heard Daniel crying himself to sleep in your stomach for countless nights.  This is no life for a boy.  Daniel has told you that he feels safe from harm in your stomach, and you're perfectly willing to eat him.  Instead beating on Daniel, Tom has started to beat on you...but you fight back.  You may have not claws, but you're able to outrun a drunken man, and throw items at him to defend yourself.  The police has come to Tom's house so often that you only need to dial 911 and the police will come quickly.  On the nights Tom comes home drunk, he's hauled away by the police.  In the morning, when Tom is having a hangover, he apologies whatever he did while drunk.  You're getting tired of this, and Daniel deserves so much better.  <br>\r\n        It's Thursday night and you're reading a bedtime story to Daniel.  Daniel is 12 years old.  Your bedtime stories are usually about Daniel's mother.  You hear a car pull in the driveway.  Tom is home.  Daniel is already in your belly, so he has nothing to fear. <br>\r\n        \"Snitch...or whatever your damn name is, come here\" said Tom as he enters the house.  His voice is slurred.  Sighing,  you exit Daniel's room and go to see what Tom wants.  <br>\r\n         Tom has brought some friends over.  Two other men has come home with Tom.  One man is just as drunk as Tom is.  The other man looks to be sober.  The sober man is in his mid-20's and has black hair and is wearing a trench coat.  The other drunken man is short and fat and has red hair.   You think you recongize the sober man, but can't be sure.  The sober man must be a resident of the town because he doesn't freak out when he sees you.<br>\r\n         \"Cook me some dinner\" orders Tom.<br>\r\n        It's 2:30 AM.  <br>\r\n         \"Tom, I'm really getting tired of this\" you say.  \"you're suppose to take care of Daniel, and being drunk half the time isn't a good way to do that!\"<br>\r\n        \"Stop bitching and make me some dinner\" said Tom.  \"I shouldn't have to repeat myself\"<br>\r\n        \"And I would like some flapjacks\" said the other drunken man.  The sober man is trying to keep Tom upright.<br>\r\n             \"I'm not cooking anything for a bunch of drunks\" you say.  <br>\r\n             \"Now, you listen here\" said Tom.  \"this is my house,which means you have to do anything I say\"<br>\r\n           \"That doesn't mean I'm your slave\" you snarl. <br>\r\n          \"Where is Daniel?\" asked Tom.  \"I need you, boy!  Make this bitch cook me a meat loaf\"<br>\r\n            Daniel is trying not to listen in your stomach.  He hates to see his father like this, and it's 1,000 times worse for him to hear his father.  <br>\r\n         \"Tom, go easy on Daniel\" said the sober man.  <br>\r\n          \"I am going easy on Danny\" said Tom, sitting roughly in a chair.  The other drunken man passes out on the couch as soon as he sits down.  <br>\r\n          \"Daniel is terrified of you, Tom\" you say.  \"his mother dies and you crawl into a bottle...that's no way to raise your son\" <br>\r\n           \"Ah, just shut yer mouth, you fat little bitch\" said Tom.  <br>\r\n           \"A bitch is a female dog\" you say.  \"I'm a female tiger\" The sober man laughs.  <br>\r\n           Tom gets up and smacks you upside the head with his hand.  You snap then.  You grab Tom's hand and you throw Tom into the wall. You're not too strong, but you're able fight off a drunk. Tom, not being able to stop himself, runs headlong into the wall and he falls to the floor and doesn't move.<br>\r\n           \"Call the police\" you say to the sober man.  <br>\r\n         The police come to your house and arrest Tom.  The other drunken man is still passed out on the couch, so the police hauls him away too.  The sober man stays.<br>\r\n            \"What's your name?\" you ask, when all the ruckus is over.  Daniel has gone to sleep.  <br>\r\n            \"Jerome\" said the man.  \"I was the one who brought Tom home.  I..didn't want to bring him here, but you try arguing with a drunk\"  <br>\r\n            You sigh.<br>\r\n           \"I knew Tom before he started to drink\" said Jerome.  \"he was a good family man, until Harriet died.....it's an old story, a man drowning his sorrows over a loved one that died\"  <br>\r\n           \"Yeah...\" you say.  \"I wish I could just leave here so Daniel won't keep hiding in my stomach...I like him in my stomach, but a boy should by out playing instead of hiding from a drunken father\"<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Oertime you have seen him so much as a son rather than as a human owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Jennings is waiting for you as you come down after letting Daniel out. It took some time to explain it all, but he seems happier now than ever. He is very excited when he sees Pouch, and goes off with him. THe meeting reminds you to ask about Billy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes... I figured that would be coming up.\" THe doctor says, smiling as he drank some honey tea. \"You see... some kids get very attached to their toys. TO some who arew very low in this poor world, they are all they have. But of course, plshies are immortal as long as they are cared for, and humans are well... not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and nod in agreement. You saw your most loved owner die, asking you to take care of her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... there is a way around this. A plushie only has to digest the child they eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... we can't!\" You say. The doctor smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are partially right. You cannot break them down into nutrients and all that. You don't need to. But I have found that all plushies can, if the concentrate, convert human flesh and bone into stuffing, silk, and fur. The soul is encased in this conversion, and while it takes some time to adjust, the truth is that the resulting new form is actally very nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, there is no way to reverse the process. Billy will never again be a little boy. He will be a plush kangaroo as long as he lives, which is a long time for a plushie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Why did he agree incidently? TO give up all his humanity...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHe doctor sighs. \"I suppose I can tell you. You see, he was dying. He had a form of cancer which would have killed him. His parents could have had it removed, they had the money to, but they did not want him. They wanted no children to spend their wealth on. Pouch told Billy he could end his pain... but he would never again be a boy. Billy was so heartbroken by his parents that he gave it all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THe conversion took three days. When he emerged from the pouch, with the cute button eyes and the round little belly, he was initially shocked, even a little sacared. But ever since, he has never been happier. He loves seeing the kids come in, give him hugs and kisses, and then snuggling up in Pouch's... er... pouch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hmm some. It is a possibility to consider, if nothing else works.</span></div></div>",

I was only a baby when he did this. He told them to run the circus themselves, how they see fit, with me as an owner but not as a master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said yes, and turned the circus into what it is now: \"THE FANTASTIC CIRCUS\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan. \"Not muchg of a name, but it does fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPendragon smiled some. \"THey chose it not me. THey decided they would aim it at the unusual desires and dreams kids have. It worked. The circus is the best in all the world. We have made a fortune in my lifetime, enough to last all of our lives and many more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when we saw that so many kids were in trouble, in one way or another, we realizxed our work was not over. I myself decided to take in any child that a parent no longer wanted, offering large sums for abused children, doing whatever it took to take them in and care for them. Once here, they become part of a family that loves them. Granted, no one here is what you would call normal. But then again, who is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and watch the other kids.

Her plushie, a large fox named Sly, is on the other end of a tube out, waiting with a bun just her size. She waves to you once, and talks to you for a moment. Apparently, she was sold as a baby, and got Sly at the circus. A sad tale really, she sure seems a lot happier now. You giggle as she slides down to Sly and the waiting bun, eager to be a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another room you meet some boys just your age. A few you met before, but two are new to you. one of them, Charles, is a freckle faced kid who seems to keep to himself mostly. His plushie is a huge plush pikachu who is currently playing with some of the others. As for his origins, he does not say. The other boy is Wally, named after the Leave it to Beaver character. he is rough and loves to wrestle, but never hurts anyone. He was taken in when his father died of cancer. his mother is unknown. His plushie is the wierdest so far, a plush... flytrap? No, it is relaly an Audry II, though Wally named it Snapper. They play happily with you for some time before you move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meet the oldest of the group nextr, in a room that is kinda ordinary, where he is writing on a tablet twice his size. Barret is his name, and he tells you he is here by his own choice, the only one so far who came from a happy family, to act as a sort of big brother to the others. His plushie, wo is the Care Bear Tenderheart, was a final gift from his mother before she was killed in a car crash. barret says he is not a kid eater like the others, bbut more of a big brother too, one the others can go to if they ever have a problem opr just want to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one you meet them all, some of them here by choice, others came because they had nowhere else to go.

She backs up at once when you try to get near her.<br>\r\n      Barret has followed you and enters the room with you.  Barret explains that Flora's parents (her mom mostly) had abused her all of her life.  They wouldn't feed her dinner, they would beat her. and they would do all that terrible stuff that abusive parents do.  Flora's dad was a bit nicer to her than her mom was.  <br>\r\n        Flora was sold to the circus when she was 7.  She hasn't spoken a word since coming to the circus, and most think she can't talk.  Flora is on the skinny side, but not dangerously so.  You feel for her because your mom has abused you too.  Your father died 3 years ago in a freak accident at his job.  <br>\r\n        Flora's plushie is the only snake in the circus (apart from Carmen), and is the only plushie that can go through the rooms for kids in the maze.  <br>\r\n        Albert is the snake's name, named after Flora's father.  Albert speaks, and he tries to get Flora to talk.

At last, David came by with an offer to buy the two of them. THey agreed, but only if she would become animal chow.

On your way, you see a big semi-truck making its way to the freak show.<br>\r\n         \"Breakfast for Carmen\" said Alice, as she looks at the truck.  <br>\r\n        \"That is just for Carmen?!\" you ask.  <br>\r\n       \"Yep\" said Flora.  \"she's a big eater\" <br>\r\n        \"I can see...\" you say.  \"what does Carmen eat then?\"<br>\r\n         All three tamers laugh at this, including Flora.   <br>\r\n         \"You mean what doesn't she eat\" said Jerome.<br>\r\n         You make your way to the side show tent and enter it.  </span></div></div>",

Jerome moves to make Torch to back off with his whip, but Torch grabs the whip and yanks it out of Jerome's hands.  Torch throws the whip well out of Jerome's reach.  You make to get Jerome's whip, but Torch dodges Jerome's sword and grabs him with his mouth and gobbles him up.<br>\r\n       You back off and pause, wondering what to do next.  While you're waiting, Torch picks up Alice and rips her off of the pole she was tied too.  Alice goes into a fit and begs for her life.  She knows how to put on a good act.   You go bravely to Torch, but it's too late. Torch eats Alice in one bite.  Torch rubs his stomach and belches loudly.  <br>\r\n          \"Ye dragon, perpare to face thy fury!\" you yell as you rush at Torch.  Torch dodges you, and goes to grab you...but you manage to leap out of the way right in time.  <br>\r\n        You get Torch to run around in circles with your whip.  And you get Torch to do tricks, but you manage to not get eaten somehow.  Near the end of the act, Torch makes a wild grab for Flora as you're chasing him.  Torch manages to tear Flora free of the pole that she's tied too, but doesn't get her in his claws.  <br>\r\n        \"Very good!\" said Pendragon when the rehersal was over.  \"Torch didn't eat you...which is a major feat!

Carmen gobbles you two down quickly and you enter her second stomach.  <br>\r\n      Carmen's second stomach looks like any other stomach,  but it has no stomach acid in it whatsoever.  The second stomach has some kids in it, along with thier plushies.   There's light in the stomach, coming from one of those big flashlights that lights up an entire area when out camping.

And when I say 'stuffs herself', I mean she gorges herself until she can't move.  See, she needs a lot of enegry when she hibernates, or she could die from the winter's cold.  So, she eats a ton to give her that energy.  Carmen usually eats all of us too, keeping us in her second stomach until spring\"<br>\r\n      \"Interesting...\" you say.<br>\r\n      Flora nods.  \"Carmen hardly gets up in winter...just wakes up to go to the bathroom or something like that\" <br>\r\n       This past winter was unusually warm....but not to a cold-blooded creature like Carmen.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Next month is the new season, and you all work hard to get ready for it.  You, Flora and Wanda get to be Carmen's snack a week before the season starts.  When it gets to be evening, Carmen lets you out and you three head towards the maze.<br>\r\n     That's when you see a man in a dark cloak, much like the ones in Kingdom Hearts II.  This man in the cloak has a big letter 'M' on the hood of the cloak.  The hood is currently up, hiding the man's face in shadow.  The cloaked man is near the main tent, and seems to act like a lookout.  You, Flora and Wanda watch as the cloaked man glances in your direction.  But, the cloaked man doesn't do anything when he sees you.  He just looks at you for a minute, then looks in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n      \"Who's that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n      \"Someone from 'The Ministry' I guess\" said Flora.<br>\r\n      \"What is this Ministry?\" asked Wanda.<br>\r\n      \"David used to hang around those guys\" said Flora.  \"I don't know anything about them\"<br>\r\n        Just then, Pendragon and another man in a dark cloak exits the main tent.  This second man in the cloak has his hood down, revealing the man's face.  The face looks handsome with dark red hair.  Pendragon is talking to the man with red hair, but you can't hear what is being said.  You three continue to walk to the maze tent, when you hear something like a gunshot.  You all whirl around to see the men in cloaks are gone, and Pendragon entering the main tent.<br>\r\n         \"What was that all about?\" you ask.<br>\r\n        \"I have no idea\" said Flora.<br>\r\n         \"And where did those men go?\" asked Wanda.<br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

The dog is a big german shepard that's bigger than the cat.   A dog is no better than a cat; a dog would still eat little humans.  The dog isn't skinny or undersized.  In fact, it looks well-fed and you think you see a collar around its neck.

You and the other kids repair the stitches as best as you could.  But it's much easier traveling in Carmen's stomach.  Carmen sent down some food to her stomach so you all have something to eat.  A week later, Carmen lets you all out.<br>\r\n      \"Welcome to Moon Ssssscar Isssland\" said Carmen.  <br>\r\n      Moon Scar Island turns out to be the oringal home of Carmen.  It's a fairly large island in the shape of a half moon, thus its name.  Pendragon had been living on the island for two months before he knew Carmen was living on the island as well.  <br>\r\n      Pendragon's house is actually a mansion with four stories to it.  The front door of the mansion has symbols on it, to ward off intruders, or so saids Carmen and the other plushies.

The \"eye\" is glowing slightly, making it eerie to look at.  <br>\r\n         \"Pendragon callsssss that an 'Elder Sign'\" said Carmen when you ask her about the symbol.  \"it'ssss ssssssssome kind of ward\"<br>\r\n       Carmen use to live on a run-down river boat that's on the other side of the island.  The river boat looks just like the river boat in the Walt Disney movie \"The Rescuers\".  Carmen lets you see it.  On each door of the river boat, there is another one of those Elder Signs, or another warding spell.  <br>\r\n       \"Pendragon doesn't like company, or not?\" you ask.<br>\r\n      \"Let's jussssst ssssssay that he runsssssss into some interesssssting people\"  said Carmen. <br>\r\n         <br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

She eithers eats the poachers or...use them as sex toys.  Carmen has a very beautiful human half, but you don't want to think about what she does to the tiny poachers.  Some poachers have met thier deaths in Carmen's stomach by digestion. <br>\r\n       Carmen was born on the riverboat some 100 years earlier. It turns out that nagas have long life spans.  Carmen's mother, Janica, had been evil.  It was Janica who ate the crew of the riverboat, making it crashing into Moon Scar Island.  Carmen was only 24 when Janica died of old age.   Nagas live to be 300 or so.  <br>\r\n      Carmen is the only naga in North America. There's a LOT more nagas in other places in the world.  Since nagas are cold-blooded, they tend to live in warm places, like the Tropics and such.  Janica had been living in Mexico City, when she moved northwards to Louisana.  The reason why Janica moved to Louisana isn't known to Carmen.<br>\r\n     Carmen tells you all this when you all have dinner.  Carmen is a great cook, but she sees little use of it.  Nagas swallow thier prey whole and alive, like snakes.  Carmen cooks a chocolate cake just for you, and she catches a deer that was wondering near the riverboat. You watch as Carmen slowly swallows the deer, wrapped up in her coils.  Wanda's stitches have been repaired.  Wanda has no dinner, but she'll eat you later.<br>\r\n        \"So, Carmen\" said Wanda.  \"why don't you eat humans like your mother did?\"<br>\r\n         \"A human ssssssaved my life once\" said Carmen.  \"hisssss name wasssss Jim Hopkinssss.  I wassssssss captured by a poacher'sssssss cage.  And then, Jim comessssssss along and freed me.   Since then, I only eat poacherssss and not innocent humanssssss\"<br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

Your left stranded on her tongue that seems to go on for almost a mile between humongous shiny white teeth and a completely dark tunnel with a big uvula dangling from the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you can see a taste-bud starting to rise over the tongue ground and start to change shape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slowly morphs into a figure... a woman's figure... with cow-ears, cow-legs and a tail... oh my god, this taste-bud changed into the shape of Belle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis reddish Belle-like being smiled at you.. and hugged you TIGHT!!! You just couldnt enjoy this embrace, because it was soaked head-to-toe in saliva! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just shrugged and started pushing 'her' off! Finally, you push her off and run as fast as you can toward the humongous teeth-walls...however ANOTHER taste-bud rises from the ground and morphs into Belle-like form in front of you! You quickly change direction... only bump into the uh..utters of ANOTHER Belle-bud!! You stick your head out of the chest and see it smiling down at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, more and more Belle-buds have sprouted out of the tongue and surround you from all over! Each of them start marching toward you smiling while the one you bumped into has wrapped its arms around you!</span></div></div>",

Sally sees you and rushes to you.  You two hug.<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Right now you were enjoying Bessie\u2019s soft belly and chest just above her udders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could just stay like this forever. Even your hangover seemed to ease in her embrace.

A furry is an animal that has human traits;  they can talk, walk on two legs, etc.  A furry varies in size just like humans;  some furries are only 4 feet tall, while the tallest furry was reported to be 20 feet tall!  You and Sally went to a booth at the fair to knock over a stack of bottles for a prize.  All the prizes were plush toys; Bessie was the second-biggest plush toy there...the biggest plush toy at that booth had been a huge Kangaroo with a baby kangaroo in its pouch.  There were other plush animals too, but Bessie caught your eye.   You tried to give Sally your prize, but she insisted that you keep Bessie since you won her.  You just shrugged and decided to keep Bessie.  You like to cuddle up to her nice soft belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"You know what?\" asked Bessie, looking at you in the eyes.  \"I'm hungry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Hungry?\" you ask.

Then a red and black blur whips past you and you begin falling to the ground. You fall onto something smooth and scaly and are quickly pinned down by it. You stare the creature in the eyes but you notice something on its back. From your limited view the object appears grey and square and you think you see some writing scratched on the corner of the box. It looks like 'SX+~'. Then it hits you. The thing on this creature's back is your old boom box. Then you wonder how the creature got your old boom box. Then the lizard looks at you more closely. \"Sean? Is that you?\" The lizard asks. \"Aye. That's me.\" You answer. \"Sean it's me! Slats!\" It says. Then you finally recognize him. It's your old lizard plush Slats.

You go deeper into the jungle and see that you're on a well-worn path.   Maybe this island won't be too bad as a home...at least you won't die of thrist.   You come to a small village inhabited by several people!  All of the people, as it turns out, were former owners of Eboshi that now live within her!     There's a total of 10 people in the village.  The 'mayor' of the city is a young man around your age by the name of Bill Sinclair.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"We've lived here since Eboshi ate us\" said Bill.  \"we've come used to living in a plush toy...I'm glad to see that Eboshi has found a new friend for us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     All of the people in the village are overweight by a good 200 pounds.

Oh, you dont wanna know!\" he starts shaking his head, \"Theyre used to be around 40 of us living in this village. A lot of our friends went beyond this village, like weeks ago! Sigh...

Good... those were her arms! You reach in farther and wraps your arms around the woman's waist underneith the sand as you continue to pull her out!<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, ma'am!\" you tell her, \"Youre gonna be fine! Just relax! I'll get you out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for some odd reason, she doesnt seem to be scared anymore.. if anything, she's smiling... scratch that!

Yep, it always feels great helping out those in need...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait a second... you start to witness stranger things as you pull more and more of her out of the sand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when you pull her bottom half out of the sand, you see that it isnt human!

You back out of the quicksand pit before the naga can do anything.<br>\r\n      \"Hi there\" said the naga, slithering her way towards you.

You've heard that nagas eat people and large animals.   <br>\r\n        \"Is this your first time seeing my species?\" asked Carmen.

Aw crap.. how many more creatures lurk in the ninja-girl's insides?!<br>\r\nYou scream out loud as the silver dragon glares into your soul with it's grey-colored eyes. Hey wait a minute... this dragon looks familiar.. That's when you notice the blue pen-writing on his cheek. It says 'Sean'! ...Oh my god, it looks just like your old childhood toy, Silver! That couldnt be... could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uh...Silver? Is that you?\" you ask it. It tilts it's head while staring... then finally speaks, \"...Sean? ....SEAN!!!!\" It gets off of you and helps you off the ground. \"Sean... wow, I never thought Id see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, all these years, I thought I had lost you!\" you actually hug this big scaly silver-colored dragon without any regret whatsoever!<br>\r\n\"Same here!\" Silver hugs back, \"I thought I would never see you again after that ninja-girl swallowed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, \"Eboshi got you too, huh?\" Silver shrugs and nodded, \"Ever since then I desperately tried getting off this island.. but.. I was always too afraid of getting in the water because of whatever's lurking in it! I heard it's some big ugly scaley sea monster...\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you heard otherwise, \"Carmen told me it's some kind of giant whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon thinks to itself, \"Well, no one exactly knows.. the ones that actually HAVE seen it never came back!\"<br>\r\nHearing this just makes you even more tempted to see what's in the water preventing anyone from escaping... just what is this guardian Carmen and Silver seem to talk about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it's gonna have to wait as you think about heading back to the village... but then again, what about your dragon friend?<br>\r\nSure, bringing him might cause up quite a scare to the poor fat human villagers, but you just dont wanna leave him just yet! You still got some catching up to do!!!</span></div></div>",

Eboshi is watching Carmen so you run up to her and grab her katana. Eboshi is about to stab you with her kunai but you knock her out with the handle of her own katana. You hold the sword to Camren's throat. Carmen drops Silver who is actually choking a little. You pick up Silver and carry him away (he's about your size so it's not hard to carry him. Unfortunately you do have to drop Eboshi's katana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the beach and put Silver down. \"Thanks.\" He says. \"Anything for an old friend.\" You reply. \"How can we get past that guardian, it's huge!\" Silver asks. \"Maybe we can outswim it.\" You suggest.

You look at Silver who says. \"Ready when you are.\" You nod and dive deep. The water is clear and warm so swimming and seeing through it is easy. True to Carmen's theory you see a cave. It looks like the guardian hasn't noticed you so you continue towards the cave. Silver begins to talk to you in you head. \"Look out!\" Suddenly the guardian is swimming towards you. Something grabs you (it's Silver so don't worry). You are now jetting toward the cave faster than you could've imagined possible. Remarkably you reach the cave. It goes upward and you realize that it continues out of the water. You and Silver climb out. \"That was easy........ too easy.\" You say. Silver understands what you mean. There is a torch mounted on the wall. Surprisingly it is lit. You grab it and move deeper into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*splash* Suddenly the rocky cave floor is replaced with soft skin that you assume is Eboshi's throat. It's slippery but you manage to climb up and out. You reach a large room. You are suddenly surrounded by light.

You got a good look at her glittering white and pearly sharp fangs as she moved her mouth while she talked! Goodie.

Kee ee,\" she just replied in own tongue you cant understand. At least her voice sounded a little calmer than before.

But there's STILL that slight chance that Minnie could be wrong. If that's true, the last thing you'd want eating you alive would be a spawn from Hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do about that creepy demon pinning you against the ground and giving you quite a threatening stare?

Perhaps the last thing you'd ever want to do in your life is piss off one of Hell's finest... but just looking at those jaws of hers gritting your way, the second-to-last thing would be letting yourself slip in between them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, it's gonna be ok!\" Roberta assures you, \"She wont chew you. It's just one simple quick swallow and in just a few hours, you'll be good as new!\"<br>\r\n\"P-p-p-promise?\" you can feel the demoness' fingers touching the back of your neck at this point!<br>\r\n\"You have my word,\" she promises, \"you'll be good as new, just another friend, and a little smarter! You wont regret it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trust her. You dont think she has any reason to lie to you. Sure Klingata...something is kinda scary, but you gotta face your fears sooner or later!<br>\r\nYou look back at the demoness, staring deeply into her yellow eyes and give a slight nod, \"...Ok... you can eat me.\"<br>\r\nThe moment those words left your mouth, the glare disappeared from her face. As if she understood what you said, \"...Gali?\"<br>\r\n\"...Gali,\" you nod, \"go right ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlungleah actually smiled at the response, almost giddy-like! \"KEE!!\" she cried out in joy. If you werent scared of her, you'd admit that the look on her face was almost cute.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could reflect on the demon-girl's 'cuteness', she put her freezing cold hands around your neck and opened her mouth wide and slowly descended over your head.<br>\r\nHer slimy tongue was even colder than her hands as REAL saliva squirted all across your face. Her breath kinda reeked of raw meat, but knowing what she tends to eat is understandable! Her teeth didnt bother you at all other than her fangs. It hurt a little as they scrapped against your scalp. It probably cut and bled. Good thing she intends on swallowing you whole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your body being pushed even closer to the back of her purplish throat. Though you were scared, you just kept telling yourself 'Im gonna be fine. Im gonna be just fine! Dont worry! Remember what Bird said!'<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, just before you were squeezed against Klungleah's tonsils, you could overhear Roberta saying something to her... though it sounded a little faint, you could make at least one little sentence.................</span></div></div>",

However, youre not out of the clear YET...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thinks for a while....and grins wickedly at you!!! She then stands up and youre finally free! But before you can run, she takes out her claws and slashes at you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but youre not hurt!...However your clothes are torn apart!

So, could you stop crying or something, it\u2019s kinda embarrassing.\u201d Your voice stops the fall of tears and the catgirl looks down at you. Her look of surprise is replaced with that of rapture and she plucks you up by the armpits and brings you to her face. You immediate reaction is to struggle as you near her mouth, but her tongue isn\u2019t what you feel, instead it\u2019s the soft fuzz of her cheek. She is nuzzling you, while purring contently with a big cat like smile on her plushy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little reluctant to be so close to the big animated toy, you try to push her cheek away.

I\u2019d be bad girlfriend if I couldn\u2019t speak with boyfriend.\u201d This stops you again; the catgirl thinks you\u2019re her girlfriend. This revelation comes second to the information that she could read your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf boyfriend wants me to stop reading mind, then he must admit to being boyfriend?\u201d You gulp at her, knowing that she could over power you with the strange powers, telling her that you already have a girlfriend could be bad. Maybe you should play along and say you\u2019re her girlfriend, then your mind would be free from her invasion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a groan of pain, you walk back towards the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That's better\" said the green-haired nurse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Just make it quick\" you say as you close your eyes, ready to feel your flesh being torn apart by these nurses.  You wait and wait...and wait.  What's the holdup already?  If they wanted to eat you, why have they not done anything to you yet?   The pain in your body fades somewhat once you're on the bed, but it still hurts like hell.  You dare not open your eyes, because you don't want to see these nurses rip into you.   You wait for something to happen, but it never happens.  After 3 minutes of nothing, you open your eyes only to see you're not on your bed anymore.  You're not even in the same room as before!   You look around and see that the room you're in now is more like a chamber.  A chamber with pinkish walls and wrinkled sides.  You look around wildly and see a hole right above your head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Where am I?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The only answer you get is a girlish giggle coming from everywhere around you.   </span></div></div>",

You let out a little moan, your grip on her relaxing just enough for her to sit up. She looked at you, smirking at your dazed expression, while her tail was sending tingling sensations of pleasure all over your body. She placed a hand on your chest, giving a light push, which sends you falling to the bed, spread eagle and panting lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her as she slinks over your legs, stopping at your boxers, where a prominent bulge was visible under your clothing. Quick as a wink, she whipped out her claws, and before you realize it, your boxers are shredded, leaving you naked before her. She grinned as she approached your rock hard member, which was already dripping pre-cum. She gave it a slow lick, causing you to gasp and buck your hips, your body aching for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked at your expression,slowly taking your dick into her mouth. You moan in pure bliss, feeling her tongue rubbing against your length, the hot confines of her mouth sucking on you as her head bobbed up and down, taking your whole length in her. You buck your hips, crying out as you reached your climax, your seed exploding into her mouth. She moaned at the taste, swallowing your cum, with a few drops dripping down her chin. She licked her lips, already craving more, as were you.</span></div></div>",

So, in order to find more mates, we turned oursleves into immortal toys and....\"<br>\r\n           \"Whoa whoa whoa\" you say.   \"you honesty expect me  to believe all that?!\"   It sounds just a tad far-fetched to you!   <br>\r\n               \"It's the truth, Sean\" said Sally.     <br>\r\n            \"You're serious about me being a mate?\" you ask.  \"we're not even the same species!  How does that work?  And....how's come you aren't a plushie anymore? And you couldn't have been the plushie that...\"<br>\r\n                  \"Sean, Sean\" said Sally.  \"relax, would  you?

The toy appears to be modeled after a small kitten with salt and pepper fur, his paws set in pure white. The detail on the cat is quite good, down to his little pink nose and underpaw, and it's believed to be custom made. Of course what is not known is the fact that the cat possesses considerable magical power, able to alter reality to it's whims, and that this power is generated by consuming it's owners in body and soul. The cat rarily communicates with it's prey, though it can, and delights in using it's tricks to twist their mind before finally swallowing them whole.</span></div></div>",

The sinister air grows deeper with each step and you find yourself increasing your speed. The staircase seems longer than usual and you soon break into a run to reach it's bottom in time. It seems very much as if the stairs are growing in an attempt to halt your movement, and you are happy to finally reach the bottom. It seems silly to have grown so disturbed for no real reason, much less to sprint downstairs, but at the very least you were not seen. At least you thought that you had not been seen, until a slight blue light flickers in the corner of your right eye. Spinning about you once more find that nothing is unusual, though the sinister aura has grown far stronger. At this point you decide that going to be would be a good option to calm your nerves, but first you decide to stop by the kitchen for a quick snack. You nearly let out a scream as you reach the kitchen and come face to face with a figure. Fortunatly you realize that it is none other than your girlfriend and regain your composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here so late?\" You try to hide the surprise in your voice but you doubt she will overlook having scared you. However she does not seem to acknowledge you and simply stares forward. After a few moments you notice tears running from her eyes. \"It hurts... please stop it, please stop it!\" To your horror gashes in her clothing begin to manifest. \"Please stop it!\" With no sign of cause or effect Sally then vanishes. At this time no desire for food or sleep remains, and you turn to run for the door. Once again the blue light flashes in your eye and you can feel an unspeakable presence descending upon you. There is a second flash, and with that you awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun is already shining brightly by the time you sit up in bed, the last traces of the nightmare slipping from your mind, fortunatly it is your day off from work. After the terrible dream you barely notice the small cat on your shelf, Sally's gift to you, is now sitting at the front of it's row. In a better mindset you might have recalled having placed it much further back the night before, but it was not possible at this point. With a last yawn you roll from the bed and decide to get ready for the day ahead.</span></div></div>",

On the other hand it was actually rather fortunate that your current owner did not realize your true \"value\"; otherwise you might not have been found in time by a proper owner. In actuality you could remain fully powered for over a decade without a meal, however you were still very eagier to feel your belly filling once again. The owner of the shop was always a possibility but he was easily ninty, his life force would lack the vivid flavor that youth provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chain of thought was broken as a young man, about seventeen, stepped into the shop. The doors movements triggered a light bell which stirred the owner back into full attention as well. Outright communication would harm your cause and as such you instead simply did you best to radiate an aura that would cause you to stand apart from the bins other items. For a moment it appeared the ruse had failed, had you grown so weak already?! Seconds passed before he finally turned back to the bin and plucked you up, his large hands fully enwrapping your tiny form. Without a word he produced a wallet with his free hand and slipped a doller upon the counter. As your new owner turned to leave the shop keeper locked his gaze directly upon you, could he possibly have known what you were?! Regardless the old man made no attempts to stop your exit as you were carried to your new owners car. The light of the sun, how long it had been, subtly increased the scent of your owner's hand. To a normal creature this would have been unnoticable but it sent your palette into storms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your owner entered the car you were rather unceremoniously dumped onto the backseat. Pain was an alien concept to you but discomfort was certainly real, your meals final moments would be that much more painful. There was no noticible change in your felt body but as the car ride continued you began to relax, waiting for the coming games to begin.</span></div></div>",

You got up groggily with a lack of warmth and look around your room and notice that its standing beside your bed... wait, last time you checked it couldent stand on its own! Guilmon:\"Hi!\" (you):\"WHOAH!\" You imediatly launch back behind you and fall off your bed from sheer shock. Guilmon:\"Uh... you okay?\" (you):\"Ow....\" Your stuck in between the crack of your bed and the wall when you feel a thump as the living guilmon plushie jumps on the bed and helps you up. Almost astonished that a (almost) real live digimon is right in front of you on your bed! Guilmon:\"Are you alright?\" You notice that his voice is of course high pitched but deeper than a girls voice, it must be male. (you):\"I-i-i-i'm....okay...\" You where really nervous, i mean c'mon of course you would be startled that a inanimate red dino plushie your girlfreind gave you is alive and just talked to you. Guilmon:\"Dont be afraid, i wont bite.\" He says in a jokingly manor. You were still nervous but you where somewhat at ease knowing the big chubbed up red dino was freindly. (you):\"....S-so how are you alive and stuff?\"(lol stuff, HAHA.... man that was corny) Guilmon:\"Well your girlfreind is very talented at plushie making, so talented that she was able to make me come to life, so she decided to give me to you since your special to her\" You blush, she must really love you because she knew about your fantasy of digimon coming to life. \"and\" Guilmon continued \"shes making herself one too, i think shes still deciding what it should be.\" suddenly Guilmon's stomech growls. Guilmon:\"Im kinda hungry, is it alright if i eat you?\" You where stunned at the question, now he wants to eat you?! (you):\"B-but your a plushie! and plus wont i die?!\" Guilmon:\"Thats the point silly, im a plushie, i cant digest you.\" You calmed down a little, then his stomech growled again. Guilmon:\"Please?

Books, bookcases, your clock radio, and nearly all of your clothes are all on the floor.  It's as if someone was looking for something and they didn't care to clean up.  You notice one wall of your room has been spray-painted with two words: Furry Lover.   Another wall is spray-painted with the words \"Welcome to the war, kid\".   You look around to see nothing is missing except for your Renamon doll.   You look down at your bed to see a lengthy note lying there, no doubt left behind by whoever stole the Renamon toy.  You pick up the note and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"What war?\" is no doubt the first question that you're thinking about.  Well, it's a long story...much too long for this piece of paper.  Let's just say for now that this war has been going on for a thousand years;  a war between us Humans and the Furries.  A Furry is an anthromorphic animal; an animal with human traits.  If you want to learn more about Furries, I suggest you visit the following address: 30410 Alberta Benson Blvd.   There, you'll find one of the Furries that we've tracked down...we're aiming to kill him any day now; he doesn't even know that we know where he lives.  He goes by the name of Daniel Fredrick MacGregor and he's a horse.   Good luck not getting eaten by him.  <br>\r\n                     Why did we take your little Renamon toy?  Let's just say we're preventing something very bad to happen.  Like I said, the story behind the war is far too long to explain here.  Trust me, you'll be glad that we took Renamon away.  Don't come looking for us;  by the time you read this, we'll be outside the county.    Goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             D.W. L.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                       Alberta Benson Blvd?   That's clear across town, near the Van Meer Homes...which happens to be a bad neighborhood.  You haven't heard of this MacGregor before.  He's a horse?  This is all very confusing!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       Suddenly, two people enter your room.  Or rather...two animals enter your room.  One of them is a raccoon that's slightly taller than you, and the other is a very obese rat that's only four feet tall.  The two animals are dressed like normal people; the raccoon is wearing a tee shirt and blue jeans while the rat is wearing a polo shirt and sweat pants that clashed horribly with the polo shirt.  They take a look around the room before talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Give me that note\" said the rat, snatching it from your grip and glancing at it.   \"Langford again\"<br>\r\n               <br>\r\n             \"No surprise there\" said the raccoon.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Excuse me\" you say.  \"what is this all about?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"Brief him\" said the rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"Here?\" asked the raccoon, who was now holding the note and reading it over.  \"he says that they know where Daniel is hiding.  We should go there and get him out of there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Daniel has moved\" said the rat.  \"he moved two days ago.  Roger and Harrison helped him\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Okay, okay\" said the raccoon.  \"but we should get out of here to start looking for...Renamon\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n        \"They're probably heading for New Philly\" said the rat.    \"okay, brief the kid on the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Hey, I'm not a...\" you start to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Right...we're not doing this proper, are we?\" asked the raccoon.  \"my name is Frank and this is...Templeton\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Theodore\" corrected the rat.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n         \"Can I get a straight answer for once?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Frank the raccoon sighs heavily and starts to explain.  </span></div></div>",

But, I must preface that it does tend to drag on in certain places, so I'll try to minimize the filler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a very long, very drawn-out explanation, you started to understand what was going on. Back in the 70's when the furry fandom began to form, a strange phenomenon began happening to many of the people within it; they began to turn into their fursonas with no rhyme or reason. They also had the ability to turn back into humans - as Frank and Theodore had done so as not to draw unwanted attention to the car - at will, which explained why you had never heard of this before; because very few people actually knew it was a thing. Of course, a handful of people outside of the furry fandom had a problem with people becoming animals, calling them, among other things, \"abominations\". This ultimately led to a, for want of a better term, war between the furries who could transform and the self-proclaimed \"anti-furs\"; a war that was still happening, and one you were now roped into, whether you like it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow,\" you said. \"This is an awful lot of information to take in, but I think I get the gist of it. You said this has been going on since the 70's right? Well, the person who left me that note said it's been going on for a thousand years or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Either they were just exaggerating for theatricality,\" Theodore said, \"or they were flat-out lying. Either way, the fact of the matter is that this war has been going for as long as the furry fandom has been around. And it's constantly covered up by the media whenever there are casualties on either side; the news ain't gonna say 'the killer was an anti-fur', for instance. But there ARE some instances where the media will try to turn neutral people to the side of the anti-furs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait,\" you say, \"you mean like that one episode of <i>CSI</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You catch on quick,\" Frank answered. \"That episode--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It was called <i>Fur and Loathing</i>, which is a pun on <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>, since the original <i>CSI</i> takes place in Las Vegas,\" Theodore said. \"That doesn't have any relevance to the conversation, but I can't let obvious puns go unmentioned... It's a really bad habit of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, I know,\" Frank said, annoyance clear in his voice. \"As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, that episode was written by an anti-fur to try and get neutral people to turn against us. And it worked; that episode was the first time many people had even heard of furries before, and many of the people who saw it still think we're nothing but sexual deviants and still conflate us with otherkin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's Note: I don't actually know if the real life writer of that episode was an anti-fur or not; I'm just trying to do some world-building.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" you begin, \"I wasn't fooled by that episode, or by <i>CSI</i> in general. Growing up with a police detective for a mom and a scientist for a dad, they taught me many things about their respective trades, and I knew that <i>CSI</i> oversimplified pretty much everything. Besides, <i>Law and Order</i> was WAY better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see,\" Frank said. \"Back to the point, the media has swayed more than its fair share of people against us. The media has made attempts to sway people to our side; some more successful than others. But whichever side they're swayed to, these people become supportive of that side of this war, whether or not they realize it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok, but, why did the anti-furs come after me,\" you asked? \"I'm not a furry, nor am I on the side of the furries. Even if I was, how exactly could I help them? I'm just an accountant. But at the very top of this long list of questions is this: why did they steal my Renamon plushy? That was a hand made anniversary gift from my late wife; it's all I have left to remember her by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, a hand made gift from your wife,\" Theodore said, \"and you said she's dead. How exactly did she die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh? She died from a gunshot wound while she was walking to the cafe on the corner a few months ago,\" you replied with a noticeable hint of confusion in your voice. \"The coroner told me she was hit by stray bullet.\" Frank and Theodore looked at each other, their eyes visibly widening. \"Huh? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tell me,\" Frank said, his voice thick with concern; \"what was her name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Her... name? Uh... her name was Sayaka Ishida,\" you answer honestly. \"Why do you ask; were you friends of hers? Because, if so, she never mentioned you before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you dense,\" Frank asked? \"Your wife was a prominent member of the furry fandom. Don't tell me you didn't know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait what? She never told me she was a furry,\" you said, getting even more confused. \"She never did anything to imply she was a furry either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well let me ask you something,\" Theodore said; \"didn't Sayaka make lifelike plushies and sell them on the internet, most of them being animal ones? And you never thought that was suspicious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-yeah,\" you replied. \"She told me told me it was just a hobby that started when she was eight. She also told me she sold them to parents to give to their children as presents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So this IS news to you,\" Frank sighed. \"Well, let me let you in on another little secret of hers. Now, you may want to prepare yourself for this, because it might blow your mind: Sayaka not only had a Renamon fursona, but she could turn into it as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She could what,\" you exclaimed?! \"She never told me that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She was probably going to tell you when the time was right,\" Frank said. \"Additionally, Sayaka wasn't hit by a stray bullet; she was targeted by an anti-fur. Her killer just made it LOOK like she was hit by a stray bullet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh-what,\" you asked? You were starting to get angry now; you loved Sayaka with all your heart, and now you learned that she was murdered. \"When I find whoever was responsible, I'll fucking gut them like a fish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Theodore said, \"you're in luck; Sayaka's killer is the very person who stole your Renamon plushy. And we're taking you to them right now. Speak of the Devil, there's the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Frank then pulls the car up to a house and the three of you head inside. There you find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Your plushy had come to life, and it was in the process of swallowing Sayaka's killer whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Similar to the above, but your plushy had already finished swallowing Sayaka's killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Your plushy was fighting Sayaka's killer and winning.</span></div></div>",

You can just make out the outline and it seems to bulky to be a person.  The door to your room opens silently, so you're able to peek inside your room without drawing attention.  The light switch of your room is about 20 inches from the door itself.  You open the door a little more and reach inside to turn on the light switch.  As soon as you do, something grabs a hold of your arm, making you yelp in surprise.  You're pulled into your room roughly, but you're still holding the bat.  You're thrown to the bed and the lights come on, revealing your attacker.  <br>\r\n                   The intruder is a man dressed all in black with a ski mask on.  You look around to see another man, dressed also in black and a ski mask on that must've turned on the lights.  The second man comes and wrestles the bat from you and throws it across the room.  The life-sized doll of Renamon is leaning against the wall close to your closet...the bat landed right in the Renamon's lap.  <br>\r\n                 \"Where did you get that?\" asked the man that threw you to your bed, pointing at the Renamon doll.<br>\r\n                  \"My girlfriend gave it to me\" you say.  \"what about it?\"<br>\r\n                   \"Randy\" said the second man.  \"I think we--\"<br>\r\n                  \"Don't use my real name, idiot!\" snapped the first man.  <br>\r\n                   \"You two are still after me?\" asked a sexy female voice.  All three of you look to see that the Renamon doll is standing up and holding the bat that was in its lap!   She swings the bat a few times and tosses it to the floor with a loud \"thunk\".   The Renamon doll smiles, revealing all of its teeth and suddenly leaps onto Randy!  Randy's pal goes to help Randy, when Renamon knocks him down with a flick of its tail.  You're too stunned to do anything but stare as the Renamon doll opens it mouth and shoves Randy's head into it!   Randy's partner sees what's happening and runs from the room.  Meanwhile, the Renamon doll continues to gobble up Randy!  As you watch, Randy's legs disappear down Renamon's throat and the belly of the Renamon distends as Randy falls into it.<br>\r\n                          \"Urp!  Excuse me\" said Renamon, who giggles.   It turns to you and smiles and says \"Hi there\" in a cheery voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n                         </span></div></div>",

The weirdest thing about it is, there's only one visible stitch on the entire doll. On the back there is a small amount of stitching that you guess was where the stuffing was put in from. If it wasn't for that one stitch you'd swear the thing was the real deal, just smaller... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Little did you know that when you woke up the next morning, your whole world would be turned upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Your eyes slowly open. \"Ugh...

There's air in the stomach too....and it isn't stale...if anything, its slightly sweet-smelling.  The light seems to come from the stomach walls themselves and they're far too slippery for you to climb up.  Well...if you can't go up, you'll have to go down.  Since the stomach looks and feels real, there must be a way to the intestines.   Gatomon continues to pur, making you feel like being inside of an engine.

You begin to look for the entrance to the intestines.   <br>\r\n                 Not  only the stomach look and feel real, its big too.  It seems that the stomach is as big as a house!   You walk a little ways before coming to a....gland?   There's something right in the middle of the stomach that reaches the \"ceiling\" and the \"floor\"  The gland-thing is pinkish-red and is pulsing just like a heartbeat....but this plainly isn't the heart; it's pulsing too fast and it makes no sound.  There's several veins running through the gland.  The gland is too slippery to climb up.  The gland is the width of a large tree trunk.  <br>\r\n              You walk around the gland three times until you spot what looks like a palm marking.  The palm-marking on the gland is indented too...as if you could fit your hand into it.  You shrug your shoulders and put your palm in the marking.  As soon as you do, you're able to see the outside world with Gatomon's eyes!  <br>\r\n                    \"[I could go for some fish now...or another yummy human]\" <br>\r\n                     The thought came from Gatomon's head!

And I promise you, you're trip will be very stimulating.\" As she said so, Gatomon prepared to get off your bed and head for the window and leaped from it, leaving your room in a blurry flash and landing on the lawn in the front yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused at the tone of her suggestion and removed your hand from the hand-print on the gland. You're sight returned to that of your own. You look around the huge stomach and spotted 2 large holes. \"I thought that there is only one way in the digestive system.\", you thought.  \"I told you that I was different internally and capable of making you smaller within my body, allowing you to explore my...more...intimate ...parts.\", said Gatomon.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged your head at Gatomon's suggestion. And you look at the two hole: one is mark \"Second Stomach of Gatomon\"  and the other one is marked with \"Personal Bedroom\".  The two signs have you perplexed as you don't know which one to take for the lack of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which hole will you be choosing?</span></div></div>",

You walk to the hole that was marked with  \"Second Stomach of Gatomon\".   You go through the hole and enter a narrow tunnel.  Suddenly, you start to feel yourself shrinking even more!  Looks like Gatomon was telling the truth when she said she could make you smaller in her body....does that mean you can get even smaller?  How small could you possibly get?  Could Gatomon make you so small that you were microscopic?  The thought about being microscopic disturbs you.   You shake your head as you enter a much bigger chamber which can only be the second stomach of Gatomon.  <br>\r\n                             The second stomach looks bigger than the first stomach, although that was probably because you shrank some more.  There's no acid whatsoever, yet the \"floor\" of the stomach was slick with moisture.  You walk deeper into the stomach.   That's when you spot what looks like a single-story house made out of flesh!  You enter the house and see that it also has a gland with a handprint on it, no doubt it would give you Gatomon's sight.  Sure enough, when you touch the gland, your vision turns into what Gatomon was currently seeing.   Gatomon was walking down the neighborhood, keeping to the shadows.  Your street only has one streetlight on it, so it's easy for Gatomon to sneak around.   As you watch, Gatomon comes to a T-section at the end of your street.  If she goes right, she'll end up downtown eventually.   If she goes left, she'll head out of the city.  Gatomon paused and considered a moment before turning left.  <br>\r\n                              \"Where are you taking me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                              \"That, my little friend is a secret\" said Gatomon.<br>\r\n                               Gatomon then get down on all fours and started to run down the street.  You take your hand off of the gland and decide to explore more of the second stomach,  The second stomach has three more holes in it, all leading to different locations in Gatomon's body.  Each of the holes has signs in front of them.    One hole is marked with  \"Gatomon's Inner Sanctum\" , one hole is marked with  \"Brain of Gatomon\" and the last hole is marked with  \"Enter at own risk\".  Just how big are the innards of Gatomon anyway? </span></div></div>",

You see other places in Gatomon you can visit, including a small chamber close to the brain called the \"Digivolve Control\".    Does that mean that Gatomon could \"Digivolve\" into Angewomon?

The slimy feel to the tunnel confirms your speculation that the plush Gatomon actually has an organic interior for some reason.

The sheets on the bed were printed with images of Gatomon and the material feels like the fur on the actual Gatomon and the bed-lamps on either side of the bed has a greenish-blue color and designed in a shape to suggest Gatomon's beautiful eyes. As you look onto the floor, you discover that it is emblazoned with the body markings of the Digimon. On one end of the bedroom, there is a chair and table that are made to resemble the green paws of Gatomon; the black paw pads on them looks soft and feels real. The 'paw table' also contain a hand imprint at the center, which no doubt allows you to see Gatomon's vision. On the surrounding fleshy walls, there are countless murals of Gatomon in all kinds of pose, some of them sexually attractive. And something surprises you the most: there is a \"Computer-TV\" set built into the wall facing the bed. The screen is now displaying a stylized logo of Gatomon with the word <i>'Gato TV</i>' printed at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely, isn't it\", Gatomon asked you, \"I have always fantasize about having a human living within me and you fulfill that purpose just right.

You instantly forgot about the plushie until you enter your room when it came to bedtime.  <br>\r\n                          The moment you enter the room, you know that this night isn't going to be a good night to be you.  The first thing you notice when entering the room was a huge downward-pointing pentagram on one of the walls.  The downward-pointing pentagram was written in black chalk...as was the inverted Cross that was on the opposite wall.   Your room looked very much looked like a room of a devil worshiper.   <br>\r\n                           \"What the hell....?\" you ask. <br>\r\n                           \"Funny you should mention that\" said a female voice. <br>\r\n                            You look around until you spot the LadyDevimon plush toy sitting on your bed--which now has a comforter with \"Hail LadyDevimon\" written on it.  As you watch, the demonic digimon tears up a picture of Jesus you had hanging on the wall where the inverted Cross is now.  You weren't a Christian by any means, but your grandparents were.  Your  grandmother gave you that picture of Jesus.   You only hanged the small framed picture of Jesus in your room to give it some color and to \"ward off any evil\" as your grandmother would put it.  <br>\r\n                 \"I took the liberty to re-decorate your room\" said LadyDevimon.    She now looks more like the real LadyDevimon on the show....but she's still four feet tall and a plush toy.  She tore up the picture of Jesus with her VERY real-looking claws!  <br>\r\n                   \"You can talk\" you say. <br>\r\n                    \"Indeed\" said the demonic plush toy.  \"you see, I'm under a curse that traps me in this loathsome form and you're going to help me lift it\"<br>\r\n                     You start to head for the bedroom door, when it snaps shut before you can reach it.  <br>\r\n                      \"Why walk away from me?\" asked LadyDevimon, sounding hurt.  <br>\r\n                     \"Because you're evil\" you say in a somewhat shaky voice.<br>\r\n                     \"You have no idea\" laughed LadyDevimon.  <br>\r\n                      \"Why should I help you lift the curse?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                       \"Because when I'm free of this curse, I'm going to give you a mighty gift\" said LadyDevimon.   \"you can have anything you want then; money, fame, glory, all the usual stuff\"<br>\r\n                       \"At the cost of my soul, right?\" you ask dryly.  \"that's the usual price with these kind of deals\" <br>\r\n                      \"I don't want your soul...or anyone's soul for that matter\" said LadyDevimon.  \"it isn't yours to give away, first of all\"  <br>\r\n                    \"So what's the price?\" you ask, not sure you want to know the answer.<br>\r\n                        LadyDevimon smiled wickedly.   \"Worship me\" <br>\r\n                         You blink.  \"What?!\"<br>\r\n                       \"You heard me\" said LadyDevimon, \"you can have anything you want after you've set me free of this curse, but only if you worship me and convert others to do so as well\"  <br>\r\n                      \"I won't do it, then\" you say.<br>\r\n                      \"You sound like you have a choice\" said LadyDevimon.   \"it looks like I have to convince you that you have no choice but to help me lift this curse\" <br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

One you owned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'You sound like you have a choice. It looks like I have to convince you that you have no choice but to help me lift this curse' ?\" you ask. You already knew all LadyDevimon's attacks from watching the show and looking them up online:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness Wave: Summons a great number of black bats into her enemy in order to kill the enemy. <br>\r\nBlack Wing: Turns her hand in to a big poison needle and attacks her enemy. <br>\r\nEvil Wing: LadyDevimon sends fire-encased bats at the opponent. <br>\r\nVile Wing: LadyDevimon dashes at the opponent with her razor sharp claws. <br>\r\nEye Laser: LadyDevimon can fire energy beams from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLadyDevimon smirked at you. \"So you think you know everything I can do, Hmm? You're an amusing little thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked startled, she could read your mind? What the heck?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe she-devil smirked and pointed at you and a black-crimson glow covered your body and blinded you. When it faded, you gawked. Compaired to the Ladydevimon plush toy, you were two inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all mine now!\" Staring with a seductive smile at you, Ladydevimon immediately bent over and lifted you via her hand, laughing as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a lot of effort just not to crush you. Ladydevimon knew easily that if she were to hold you normally she could pop the head of the little human she held without even meaning it. That wouldn't do for her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill to avoid such a thing the well endowed giantess lifted you by the head, recoiled her fingers back as if to ball her fist and dropped you into her palm, which she kept open. \"Now, my little toy, we can have some F-U-N.\" Playfully and teasingly drawing out the final word of her statement Ladydevimon silently giggled in glee at you. Your face was pale white, obviously intimidated by the sexy giant teasing you by debatedly the most seductive way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few moments before you could gulp and speak, \"Erhm...what kind of fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if awaiting the question Ladydevimon answered without even needing to think first, \"Whatever I wanna do. If I wanna see you struggle to climb my feet that'll be it. If I wanna feel you squirm around in my mouth then we'll do that. If I wanna crush you under my sexy butt there we go. If I want you to climb my breasts than you better start climbing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you gulped. \"Erhm.....are there other things we could do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I could go shoe shopping with a little insole, my nose and ears might be an interesting adventure for you, you could try climbing me from my feet. Tons of possibilities and each of them are such fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled further, none of these ideas were in any way fun to you...but then why should she care about that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...what to do to you?\" Ladydevimon said.</span></div></div>",

She was still a plush toy, but she was like thirty feet tall to you!  Whoever had made the plush toy did a good job with the little details.   You find yourself staring at her well-endowed chest.  One of the things that you liked about Ladydevimon was that she had big breasts,  This plush toy had breasts that were bigger than you....you could use her breasts as a bed.  <br>\r\n                  \"You like my breasts?\" asked Ladydevimon.   \"well, I hope you enjoy them!\"<br>\r\n                 With that, Ladydevimon drops you into her huge cleavage.  It would've been a little sexy, if not for the fact that she pushed her breasts together that prevented you to breathe.  She tortured you a few times with her breasts;  she would suffocate you almost to the point of blacking out and then letting you breathe for maybe ten seconds until she smothered you with her cleavage once more.  After about fifteen minutes of this passes by before Ladydevimon stops.  You hurt all over.  Even though the breasts are soft doesn't mean that they can't hurt you.    During the torture, your body was forced into uncomfortable postitions which made your body cry out in pain.  With the torture stopped for now, you're able to catch your breath at last.  You can't see what Ladydevimon is doing now because you're covered in the clothes that she wears.  You do know that she's walking.  When you ask where she's going, she tortures you once again with her breasts....letting you suffocate almost to the point of blacking out, and then saving you from dying from lack of air.  The second bout of torture lasts for twice as long as the first time.  Now your body was aching everywhere, and you decide to keep your mouth shut.  <br>\r\n                        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      When the third bout of torture begins, you're sound asleep.    You begin to shout for mercy, which only increases the torture.    After about two hours of constant torture--or what felt like two hours--Ladydevimon pulls you from her cleavage and lifts you to her face.<br>\r\n                    \"Ready to submit to me?\" asks Ladydevimon.   \"all you have to do is bow down to me and I'll stop torturing you and then we can begin to find a way to break this curse I'm under\"<br>\r\n                 She sets you on her hand.  <br>\r\n                </span></div></div>",

For one thing, small towns aren't crime-ridden areas like those big cities are. But small towns are poor towns, with not many shops or people in them.  Chester is one of those crossroads towns that are small.  Chester has a population of maybe 5,000.   It's only claim to fame was Lake Chester, which is a huge camping ground and national park.    If it wasn't for the national Park, the town of Chester wouldn't be where it was.   The town also has one big factory in it, and a couple of shops.  One of these shops was a shop that was called  \"Gregory's Shop\".     Gregory's Shop sold all sorts of weird stuff---it's a thrift shop.    The store's owner--Gregory Dearns--was a very charitable man....not to mention very religious.     Gregory's Shop sells second-hand goods and a fair few--and rather limited--DVDs and old VHS tapes.  The shop has two dozen volunteers that work at the store.    And you just happen to be one of the volunteers that work at the store as a stock boy.  <br>\r\n                            One evening, you were stocking the part of the store that sold second-hand stuffed animals.  Some of the stuffed animals looked pretty dirty, but perfectly suited to be sold at the store.  It was near quitting time and some of the employees are leaving for the day.   You put the last stuffed animal up on the shelf and you notice that it's a plush toy of Angewomon of the Digimon series.  The plush toy is about three feet tall.   When you leave it on the shelf, you hear a voice in your head calling your name.    \"<i>Don't leave me here</i>\" the voice had said.  It had been a soft feminine voice.  You look around, but see nobody around. <br>\r\n                  \"<i>Take me with you</i>\" the voice said again.<br>\r\n                    You look back at the Angewomon and....grabbed it off of the shelf.   You hadn't intended to remove it from the shelf, it was like  your body was moving by itself.  You stuff the Angewomon back in the box you got it from.  You then walked to the back of the shop, threw away the box in a large bin and leave the shop with the Angewomon in hand.  The next thing you knew, you're at your house and you enter it  with your key.  You had just moved into this house after graduating from college.  <br>\r\n                             You take the Angewomon to your room and leave it there and went back downstairs to watch TV and have dinner.<br>\r\n                               When bedtime came, you went upstairs and enter your room.......and gasped in shock as you see that your room has been cleaned.  The walls of your room are now covered in Christian art and a huge Cross is now on your door.      <br>\r\n                              \"Your room looks better now\" said a feminine voice.  You turn to see that the plush toy of Angewomon is on your bed, smiling up at you!     When you were turning to face the plush toy, you thought you saw something else than a simple plush toy at the corner of your eye....but when you fully turned to face Angewomon, you see a simple plush toy.  <br>\r\n                  \"You can talk\" you said.<br>\r\n                  \"Yes\" said the Angewomon.   \"and you've been recruited to help me return to my normal state\"<br>\r\n                    You Blink.   \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n                   \"I've been cursed in the shape of this toy\" said Angewomon.    \"and you're going help me get my old self back\"<br>\r\n                  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You\u2019ll never forget the day you first got Winona. You got her for your third birthday, and she was the best present you could ever ask for. She was the biggest plush toy you\u2019d ever seen, around 2 feet tall, so she was almost as tall as you were back then! Of course, that was a long time ago. Now, you were seven, and the kangaroo plush fit snugly in your arms. She was still just as soft and comfy as ever, and cuddling with the toy reminded you of all the good times you\u2019ve had in your life, and comforted you. You were a shy, weird kid, so most of the time Winona was your only friend. Still, you were content living with just your parents and Winona, like one big, happy family. Still, even that wasn\u2019t meant to last forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour memories of that one, fateful morning were blurry. Your parents went out just to buy some groceries. That usually takes them 15 minutes or so. But this time, an hour passed\u2026 and then another\u2026 and then another\u2026 and before you knew it, the sun was setting, and they still hadn\u2019t come home. You stayed up all night waiting for them, and eventually, there was a knock on the door\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t your parents, it was a police officer! He let you ride around in his police car, and even let Winona wear his police hat, so that was pretty cool, but you couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was wrong. You kept trying to ask him where your parents were, but he kept dodging the question. Over the radio, though, you noticed him saying something about a \u2018drunk driver\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he introduced you to a nice social worker lady that told you that your parents have been in an accident, and went up to heaven. You didn\u2019t understand. Why would your parents just leave you here? She explained that they went to heaven without you because they wanted you to be happy here on earth, and that they\u2019d be watching over you from now on. That answer didn\u2019t satisfy you. You didn\u2019t want them to <i>watch over</i> you, you wanted them to <i>be with</i> you. Still, you couldn\u2019t think of any other arguments, so you just stayed silent from then on. You never cried, but you did hug Winona really, really hard. It seemed that, from now on, Winona was going to be the only friend you had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nice social worker lady worked on your \u2018case\u2019 for a week or two. She told you that your parents had specified your grandmother as your guardian in their wills, and that the people in the courtroom had to decide whether she was capable. You liked the social worker lady, but you didn\u2019t like the people in the courtroom. They were all so serious, and always talked about things you didn\u2019t understand. Luckily, that whole process didn\u2019t last long. Before you knew it, you were sitting in the back of the social worker\u2019s car as she drove you to your grandmother\u2019s house. The only possessions you were taking with you was an old lunchbox stuffed with toys and games, and of course, the big, stuffed kangaroo you held in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, this was the summer time, so you didn\u2019t have to go to a new school right away; you could take a few month to process your grief and figure things. Your grandmother lived out in the countryside. It was kind of cool. There were horses and cows and stuff. Still, she didn\u2019t have any cable or internet or anything, and you didn\u2019t really have any friends nearby, so there wasn\u2019t much to do. Your grandmother was nice, but she wasn\u2019t very fun, and didn\u2019t understand how to play any games. Thus, you spent most of your time lying around playing with your gameboy, and playing pretend games with Winona. Still, the lonelier you got, the more you wish Winona could talk, or move, or do anything. She was nice to snuggle with, but you just so desperately needed someone to talk to right now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, you were sitting around in the living room playing Pok\u00e9mon Yellow while your grandma silently knitting something, when suddenly she looked up and gasped. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh! Oliver! Look! A shooting star!\u201d</span> She stands up, more excited then you\u2019ve ever seen her. You gaze out the window she was pointed towards, only to see a huge, beautiful star lighting up the entire sky as it flew past. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIf you wish on a shooting star, it\u2019ll come true!\u201d</span> She explained, and your heart skipped a beat. Maybe this was your chance to make things right! You consider asking for your parents to come back, but you figured the angels would be angry if you took somebody from heaven. No, no\u2026 you had another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinona couldn\u2019t talk, or move, or anything, but she was always watching. She could always see what was going on around her. You\u2019re sure she wanted to say something\u2026 but she couldn\u2019t. She was just a toy. Still, you desperately wanted to hear whatever it was she had to say. She\u2019d understand you\u2026 she\u2019d finally give you a good explanation, so that things made sense. So, hugging your plush toy tightly against your chest, you looked up solemnly at the star. Dear shooting star\u2026 please, please let Winona talk, and move around, and play, so we can be friends for real, you whispered silently to the star. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the shooting star disappeared, and you noticed it was about your bedtime. Your grandma tucked you in, and kissed your forehead goodnight, leaving you alone with Winona. You stayed awake for an hour, just staring at the kangaroo, waiting for her to do something, convinced she\u2019d spring to life at any moment. Still, she didn\u2019t move, not giving even the faintest signs of life. You sighed as you gave up and rolled over in bed, deciding that this whole \u2018shooting star\u2019 business had just been a waste of time. Just a piece of dumb ol\u2019 superstition. With that, you drifted to sleep, lonely as ever\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2504\u2504\u2504<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In the middle of the night, in your sleep, you felt a pair of fuzzy, soft paws pull you into a hug. It felt like Winona was lying behind you, snuggling you against her unbelievably soft, comfy belly. Of course, that wasn\u2019t possible. You were obviously just dreaming. Still, this had to be the comfiest dream you\u2019ve ever had. With a sigh, you practically melt into the cozy arms, falling into the deepest, most relaxing slumber you\u2019ve ever had\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2504\u2504\u2504<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, the feeling was gone. You rubbed the sleep from your eyes as you sat up in bed, seeing your room was completely empty. What a strange dream, you thought. Ever since what happened to your parents, you\u2019ve been having terrible nightmares most nights\u2026 but this one was actually quite nice, although brief. Then again, that\u2019s if it was a dream. You looked over to the chair you left Winona sitting in, and realized it was now completely empty. You raised a brow. Did grandma move her? You walk over to investigate, only to find a strange note left sitting on the chair;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Meet me in ol\u2019 Palmer\u2019s farmhouse ASAP :)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the note for a while. It was written in curvy handwriting you didn\u2019t recognize, but beyond that, there weren\u2019t any clues. You quickly rushed through your morning routine, your mind racing. Who wanted to meet you? Did somebody take Winona? Your grandma was the only person who could\u2019ve done such a thing, but you could hear her in the kitchen right now. She couldn\u2019t be expecting you to meet her anywhere. Could\u2026 could Winona have left that note herself? No, no\u2026 that was impossible, of course. But it was mighty coincidental this happened the morning after you made that wish. No matter how ridiculous it seemed, you just couldn\u2019t shake the possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grandmother smiled at you as you walked into the living room in a daze. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cGood morning, sweetheart!\u201d</span> She says, looking up from her oven, the delicious smell of whatever she was cooking wafting through the entire house. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI was just about to make breakfast. Are you hungry?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cN-no, maybe later,\u201d</b> you said, awkwardly. You figure it couldn\u2019t hurt to ask, at least. <b>\u201cSo, uh\u2026 did you leave that note in my room?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat note?\u201d</span> She said, sounding genuinely oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... nevermind,\u201d</b> you said with a shaky voice, as you pick up your boots and quickly slide them on. <b>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go outside and play. Is that okay?\u201d</b> You call as you tie your shoes and throw on a light sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOf course! Be safe!\u201d</span> She replied, as you pushed open the front door. You shivered slightly as you stepped into the sunlight. You lived up north, so even in the summer, it could be quite chilly in the early mornings. That was the last thing on your mind at the moment, though. You wandered through the big, empty fields of the countryside for about ten minutes, with nobody in sight besides grazing farm animals, before finally coming across the farmhouse you were searching for. It was old and abandoned, and basically in the middle of nowhere, but it was always left unlocked, and it had been fun to explore during those boring, lonely summer days. Now, however, there was apparently someone inside\u2026 waiting for you. Could it really be Winona?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh nervously as you push open the big, heavy wooden door, peeking slowly inside\u2026</span></div></div>",

Is someone here?\u201d</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peeked inside, to see the dusty old barn was completely empty, beside the big, plush kangaroo sitting in the middle. It\u2026 looked like Winona, but it was different somehow. Most notably, it was about four feet tall, almost twice Winona\u2019s regular size! It was turned away from you, so you couldn\u2019t tell if it was Winona or not, but as you moved closer, you thought you noticed\u2026 movement. Namely, the plush toy\u2019s tail shifted just the tiniest little bit, as if moving on its own. You froze in place. Surely you must just be seeing things, right? It couldn\u2019t be\u2026 <b>\u201c... W-Winona? Is that... you\u2026?\u201d</b> You hazard a guess, as you creepy slowly closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plush toy shifted again, as if startled. You watch in awe as the toy stands up on its own, standing at about your height. You try to come up with a rational explanation, but all those possibilities left your mind when the kangaroo turned around to reveal that, yes, this was definitely the Winona that you knew and loved. You jaw hung open as you watched Winona move around on her own, her tail swinging and her ears twitching just like a real kangaroo\u2019s. More notably, she used to have the same expression locked permanently on her face; but now, defying all logic, her eyes and lips could move freely, which she demonstrated by giving you a big, warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn epiphany shook you to your core. You couldn\u2019t deny it anymore. The wish you made\u2026 it worked! What grandma said was true! You had brought Winona to life! Unable to control yourself, you watched forward and practically leaped into the kangaroo\u2019s arms. <b>\u201cWinona!\u201d</b> You cried, hugging the big, soft, comfy plush toy as tightly as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh, Oliver!\u201d</span></b> She smiled, wrapping her arms around you and returning the hug, cuddling you against her unbelievably soft, fluffy body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cY-you can talk! You can move!\u201d</b> You say, crying with excitement as you rested your head on the kangaroo\u2019s shoulder, not wanting this hug to ever end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI know! Oliver, with your wish\u2026 I can do anything now!\u201d</b></span> She replied gleefully, obviously just as ecstatic about this as you were. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cThere\u2019s so much I\u2019ve been wanting to say!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her with a sniffle, wiping a happy tear from your eye. <b>\u201cR-really?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cYes, Ollie! I might\u2019ve never been able to move, but I\u2019ve always been listening. Watching,\u201d</b></span> she explained, hugging you close. She frowned, as if about to address something serious. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI guess I wanted to say is that I\u2019m\u2026 so, so sorry about what happened to your mom and dad. You\u2019ve been very brave, but\u2026 no child should have to deal with something like that alone. I promise we can turn this summer around. We can have the best summer ever!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... yeah, we can, can\u2019t we? The best summer ever!\u201d</b> You repeated, realizing just how true those words were. Even when she was just a regular toy, Winona was the funnest companions you\u2019ve ever had. Now that she could talk and move around, it would be on a whole new level! As the two of you cuddled, you excitedly told her about all the games you could finally play together, and all the cool human technology you could show her, and all the places you could go to. All the while, she just nuzzled you with a smile, listening attentively, finding her excitement absolutely adorable. <b>\u201cAnyway, why are you so big now?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh, that\u2019s why I wanted you to come to the farmhouse. I actually have another surprise for you\u2026\u201d</b></span> She smirked, and another big smile dawned on your face. Another surprise? What could possible be better then this? To demonstrate, though, Winona had to stop hugging you, which disappointed you somewhat. \u201cStand back! Clear the way!\u201d She said with a smile, and you walked over to the other side of the barn, watching her attentively, wondering what she could possibly be planning on showing you. Once you were out of harm\u2019s way, she clenched her eyes shut as if concentrating\u2026 and to your shock, she started to grow right before your eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, she was ten feet tall\u2026 then fifteen\u2026 then twenty! You worried for a moment that she might just break through the roof, be she stopped just short, reaching a size she was satisfied with. She was almost as big as this entire barn; about six times your height! <b>\u201cW-Winona! You\u2019re huge!\u201d</b> You said, walking cautiously up to her and laying a hand on her fur. Her paws themselves were now bigger than your entire body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cYup! I can be as big or small as I want to be, now,\u201d</b></span> she said with a smile. Just her tiniest movement ended up knocking a hay bale off a nearby beam. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWhoops! Seems this might be a little <i>too</i> big, though. Hehe!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</b> You said, enraptured by the kangaroo\u2019s incredible size. <b>\u201cI kind of like it.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cHow flattering! Well, be that as it may, I\u2019d rather stick to a more manageable size,\u201d</b></span> she says. You stand back as she starts shrinking down again, this time deciding on a more reasonable 8 feet. She was still twice your size, though, with you being about waist-height. <b><span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cThere. Is this still big enough for ya?</span></b>\u201d You looked up at her, awed by her size. You\u2019d always sort of wished Winona was bigger, but this was more than you could\u2019ve ever imagined. You loved it! You nodded eagerly, a big smile on your face. She seemed flattered by your excitement, leaning back and patting her belly. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cHeh, I\u2019d hope! At this size, you\u2019re small enough to fit in my pouch!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cC-can I?\u201d</b> You said, practically hopping in excitement at the possibility. You used to use Winona\u2019s pouch as a pocket for coins or whatever, though you always wished you were smalling enough to ride around inside her pouch yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOf course! Hop on in!\u201d</b></span> She smiled. You beamed with excitement as the kangaroo leaned forward and pulled open her pouch for you, seeing that you\u2019d easily be able to fit inside. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, you crawled headfirst into her pouch. Her pouch was actually a lot deeper then you thought, and you ended up falling to the bottom, suddenly surrounded completely by her soft, comfy plush \u2018skin\u2019. This was better then you could\u2019ve ever imagined! It was so delightfully warm inside her pouch, and you liked how it pressed you up against her big, round, pillowy belly. When you were lying still, it was the most comfortable place you\u2019ve ever been \u2014 the only problem was that it was so tight, moving around was a little difficult. You could hear Winona giggling and laughing as you tried to pull yourself up to the entrance of her pouch. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cHehe! Don\u2019t wriggle so much, I\u2019m ticklish!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSorry!\u201d</b> You laughed as you finally managed to poke your head out of her pouch, holding onto the edge with your hands, the rest of you tucked away inside the kangaroo\u2019s huge pouch. You giggled in excitement as Winona started walking, easily carrying you around with her as she made her way out of the barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cAlright, Ollie. Hang on tight, now\u2026\u201d</b></span> She said, and you gripped onto her pouch with all your might as she got ready to start really moving. Once you were ready, she started hopping, just like a real kangaroo would; but at Winona\u2019s size, she hopped almost as fast as a car! You squealed and laughed in excitement as she hopped across the wide-open fields at 25 mph, the contents of her pouch getting jostled around with every hop. It was a little scary, but you\u2019ve ridden roller coasters before, so it was nothing you couldn\u2019t handle. In fact, it was a dream come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWoohoo!\u201d</b> You cheered as she sped across the landscape, having more fun then you\u2019ve had all summer. Luckily, you were out in the middle of nowhere, so there was nobody around to notice the giant kangaroo hopping through the fields. <b>\u201cFaster! Faster!\u201d</b> You egged her on, thrilled as she slowly worked her way up to 30 mph, then 35. Eventually, though, the kangaroo slowed to a crawl again. <b>\u201cWhy\u2019d you stop?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cPhew\u2026 hold on\u2026 I have to catch my breath\u2026\u201d</b></span> She said, leaning against a tree as she took a break, exhausted from all the hopping. You giggle, as you let go of the edge of her pouch, letting yourself sink back to the bottom. You just loved the warmth within her pouch, and the utter comfiness surrounding you on all sides. You almost never wanted to leave\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHey, Winona,\u201d</b> you ask, another idea intriguing. <b>\u201cThink I could just\u2026 live in here?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</b></span> She said, opening her pouch slightly so she could look down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt\u2019s just so warm and comfy, I don\u2019t think I ever want to leave!\u201d</b> You replied, smiling up at her, pushing playfully against the walls of the pouch. <b>\u201cI just need my gameboy, and some snacks sometimes, and I can just lay around in here forever\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cHehe! I\u2019m glad you like my pouch so much\u2026 but don\u2019t you think your grandmother might be a little upset?\u201d</b></span> She said. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cAfter all the time she spent setting up your room and getting you settled in, why would you want to live somewhere else?\u201d</b></span> You sighed. You definitely liked Winona more then your grandmother, but\u2026 your grandmother was your guardian. She was the one who was taking care of you from now on. As much as you wanted her to be your new \u2018mother\u2019 or sorts, Winona was just your best friend, and you were satisfied with that. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cBesides, I don\u2019t want you in there all the time. Think of all the games we could be playing!\u201d</b></span> Well, you can\u2019t argue with logic. In fact, at the moment, you felt in the mood for...</span></div></div>",

Winona looks slightly surprised when you suddenly climb out from her pouch, practically leaping down to the ground below face-first. You stand up without skipping a beat, wiping the dirt off you with a big smile on your face. <b>\u201cNow that you can move, I can show you how to play video games!\u201d</b> You say, practically jumping with excitement. You\u2019ve always wanted to share your favorite hobby with somebody, but none of the adults you\u2019ve known understood it. <b>\u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d</b> You say, excitedly running back to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWait!\u201d</b></span> She said timidly. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWe have to be careful bringing me around the house.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhy?\u201d</b> You asked, confused as you walked back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOllie\u2026 we can\u2019t let your grandmother know that I can move and talk now. We can\u2019t let any grown-ups know,\u201d</b></span> she sighed, sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell\u2026 why not?\u201d</b> You ask, bothered by the sad look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cBecause it\u2019s magic, and we can\u2019t let them know magic is real,\u201d</b></span> she explained solemnly. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cGrown-ups are\u2026 used to things being a certain way. If something happens that they don\u2019t understand, they get scared.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou\u2019re not scary, though!\u201d</b> You insist. <b>\u201cYou\u2019re, like, the least scary person ever!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI know, Ollie, but if they find out I can use magic, they might think I\u2019m dangerous,\u201d</b></span> she replied. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cThey might try to take me away.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze in place, your heart sinking in your chest. You felt your face going flush with fear. <b>\u201cT-take you away?\u201d</b> You gasp. <b>\u201cForever?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cMaybe,\u201d</b></span> she nodded softly with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there, considering the possibility, only to have to turn away from the kangaroo as you paced back and forth nervously, your hands shivering. By the time you turned back to Winona, tears were streaming down your face, and your eyes were red from crying. <b>\u201cNoooo!\u201d</b> You sobbed, running up to Winona and hugging her for comfort. You couldn\u2019t comprehend anybody taking her away from you, and the very thought was making you cry more then you have in years. <b>\u201cWhy d-do people have to b-be such... <i>bullies</i>?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinona was shocked. Even when you lost your parents, you didn\u2019t cry once\u2026 but now, for the first time in years, you were downright sobbing! She\u2019d never seen you like this! She panicked when she realized what happened. After having lost everybody else you cared about, the thought of losing her too was enough to finally push you over the edge. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh, Ollie, don\u2019t cry!\u201d</b></span> She insisted, wrapping her arms around you and hugging you close, pressing you against her soft belly, your tears wetting her \u2018fur\u2019. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cNobody\u2019s ever going to take me away. I promise!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniff, looking up at her. <b>\u201cReally?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI promise. I\u2019ll always be there for you, Ollie. Always. You never have to worry about that,\u201d</b></span> she whispered reassuringly. Eventually, the kangaroo\u2019s big, comfy hug calmed you down. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cNow why don\u2019t you show me your\u2026 what\u2019s it called? Game Man?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201d</b> You giggled softly, wiping the tears from your cheeks with your sleeves. <b>\u201cIt\u2019s called a Game Boy, you big ol\u2019 dummy...\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201c\u2018Dummy\u2019? Now look who\u2019s being a bully!\u201d</b></span> She laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her, a devious look suddenly dawning on your face. <b>\u201cHeh. Yeah, I\u2019m a bully,\u201d</b> you smile, <b>\u201cand I\u2019m gonna getcha!\u201d</b> Before she could react, you playfully \u2018tackled\u2019 the massive kangaroo, and she pretended to fall down on her back in response, with you landing on top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cNoooo!\u201d</b></span> She laughed as the two of you playfully wrestled in the dirt. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cHelp, somebody! I\u2019m being bullied!\u201d</b></span> She was twice as big, and thus twice as tall as you were, but you weren\u2019t afraid to fight dirty! Before she could roll you off of her, you reached down and started furiously ticking her sides, causing the kangaroo to giggle and squeal uncontrollably. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cHahaha! No, have mercy! I\u2019m too ticklish!\u201d</b></span> Your playfight continued like this for a while, until you both finally wound down, giggling and exhausting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201d</b></span> She giggled as you laid down on her comfy, bed-like belly, too worn out to continue wrestling. She lifts you up by your sides, and easily sets you down on the ground in front of her as she sits up. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019m going to go back to my normal size now, okay? That way you can bring me inside without your grandmother noticing anything strange.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOkay...\u201d</b> You say, a little saddened by the fact she had to return to normal, even if it was only for a few moments. You watched as the 8-foot tall kangaroo started quickly shrinking to a fraction of her size. Eventually, she returned to her normal, 2-foot tall self. She went limp, like a toy, and went back to that exact same facial expression that used to be locked on her face, though there was visibly more cognizance behind her beady eyes, if that made any sense. <b>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</b> You said, picking her up. Her \u2018act\u2019 was so convincing, she looked just like she did when she was just a toy! This would surely convince anybody!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling better, you start making you way back to your grandmother\u2019s house. You shivered in the cold, wishing for a moment that you were inside Winona\u2019s pouch again, but you tried to focus on the task at hand. Your grandmother smiled when you walked in and quickly kicked off your boots. \u201cOh, Oliver! I was wondering when you\u2019d be back,\u201d she greeted. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDid you have fun out there?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYep!\u201d</b> You cry over your shoulder as you rush back to your room. <b>\u201cBut, uh, I\u2019m still not hungry, though, so\u2026 later!\u201d</b> You grandmother is a little confused as she hears you quickly slam your door behind you. You were acting awfully strange today. Perhaps you were just missing your parents? She resolves to come up with a nice surprise for you, just to make you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you lock the door and set Winona down on your bed. <b>\u201cOkay, you can grow again now.\u201d</b> With that, she starts growing again, until you were about the same height at four feet tall. She stretches, glad she didn\u2019t have to fake that same old smile any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cMm! That\u2019s better,\u201d</b></span> she said. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cNow, what game did you want me to play, again?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as you dug under your bed, and excitedly pulled out your Game Boy, holding it up in front of her. <b>\u201cPokemon!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201c... I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not familiar,\u201d</b></span> she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHehe! That\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll show you!\u201d</b> You said as you sat on the bed beside her, booting up Pokemon Yellow and handing the console to the plush kangaroo, who gently took it in her \u2018hands\u2019, curiously analyzing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh, dear. This won\u2019t be a difficult game, will it? My paws are a little\u2026 uncoordinated,\u201d</b></span> she frowned as she experimented with the device, <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cand slightly too big for these buttons.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNo. I already beat the game, so you can just do whatever you want,\u201d</b> you smile, looking over her shoulder, watching her screen as she reached the main menu. <b>\u201cPress the A button.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe selects \u2018Continue\u2019, and a few moments later, the game started up proper. Your character was currently hanging around one of the major cities, after you\u2019ve already beaten the elite four. She curiously pressed buttons, until she realized she could move around your character. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh. Is this me?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYep, you\u2019re the human boy,\u201d</b> you point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh, like you! Hehe!\u201d</b></span> She giggled, her long, thick tail wagging behind her. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s this thing following me?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThat\u2019s Pikachu. It\u2019s a Pokemon,\u201d</b> you say, and she stares at you, uncomprehending. <b>\u201cThey're sort of like magical, super smart animals,\u201d</b> you sheepishly explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cLike me! Oh, I like this game already!\u201d</b></span> She smiled, seeming more excited now. You try patiently to walk her how to play the game, though she didn\u2019t really seem to \u2018get\u2019 it. She definitely had fun just wandering around doing her own thing, though, even if she didn\u2019t make any progress. Her paw pads were indeed a bit too big for the buttons, with her occasionally walking into walls and choosing the wrong options, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind. She almost looked fascinated by the technology, despite how simple it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, just as she started getting bored with the game...</span></div></div>",

Sally likes Pokemon, so that's why she got you a pokemon plushy.<br>\r\n      It stands on the head of your bed, along with your books and a few other stuffed animals that Sally has gotten you either for Christmas or your birthday.  You don't want to make Sally mad, so you've kept all the stuffed animals that she ever gave you.  <br>\r\n      Anyway, it was a dark and stormy night when the Charizard comes to life.  (Yes, I know that's one of the worst ways to begin a story!).  It's one of those nights when a series of thunderstorms is sweeping through the area, so you get periods of peace and quiet and 15 minutes later it'll start to storm again.  And each new storm seems to be stronger than the last.   <br>\r\n     A loud thunderclap awakes you with a start.  For a second, you think you see someone outside your window, but it's just a trick of the lightning.  You decided to go back to sleep because you have a big day tomorrow...tomorrow is your graduation from High School!  <br>\r\n         When you lay back on your bed, your head comes to rest on the plushy pokemon.

Damn!  That feels...  Whoa!\", you say as she waists no time in glorping down on your cock all the way to the root, swirling her tongue around it as her lips squish and shlorp around the base of it, gently sucking in your balls and spitting them out as she works your foreskin up and down like a seasoned cocksucker.  Pulling back, your charizard squishes the covered tip of you penis between her plump, pouty lips and teases it relentlessly with flicks of her tongue, making sure to concentrate her effort on the sensitive underside of your manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Mmmm!

Tonguing your pucker hole with the tip of her tongue, she gulps down repeatedly on you slippery covered cock head, sending you over the edge and spurting uncontrollably into her greedy, gulping throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That's right little boy!  Cum long and hard for me!  The next thing I swallow is gonna be your squirming, naked ass!\", your pokemon teases you explicitly, as she expertly empties your balls of jizz and keeps on slurping, albeit a bit more gently, until you are rock hard and ready once again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ungh!  I'm a not a little boy!  I'm twenty years old dammit!\", you say as your post-orgasmic haze clears and you get hard once again in her mouth as she continues to diddle you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Before your very eyes, your charizard starts to quickly grow in size; four, six, ten, twelve, fourteen feet tall!  Back-pedalling on your sloppy mattress, your boner swinging to and fro, you stare slack-jawed at Charlene's new size, both intimidated and excited that she can now make good on her promise of gobbling you all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, you look look like a little boy from where I stand squirt!  But just to make sure...\", she says as she spits out another ball of fire directly at you!  Just as the first one, the fire doesn't feel hot, even as it engulfs your entire body, quickly and painlessly burning off all of your hair except for you head and eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Looking down at your now perfectly smooth body and throbbing erection you realize that your plush pokemon toy is going to get her way whether you like it or not!  Luckily for you, the helplessness and pervertedness of your situation only seems to turn you on more as you start to leak pre-cum freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh yeah!

As your feet and thighs disappear between her plump lips, you thrash your hips from side to side, causing your boner to flail wildly, smacking againts each of your thighs in turn, throbbing and swinging wildly and comically as Charlene slowly slurps you bare legs up between her sloppy lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm!  Slurping naked little dinks like your's is the nummyest ting in the whole wide world kiddo!\", she says in your head as she slurps you in without mercy!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more and more of your thighs get slurped up between your plush dragon's slobbery lips, your wiggling quickly becomes less and less as your throbbing boner approaches her sloppy smile!  Just before your dick is about to get slurped in, you feel Charlene thrust her huge tongue out between your butt checks, over your smooth, tight.ballsack, and up along the underside of your thobbing cock, only to curl around the tip and grind down upon your helpless little foreskin as she expertly molested the entirety of your naked crotch like a crack-starved whore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it little boy!  Squirm and thrash around as hard as you can!  I'm gonna lick and slurp that hard little boner of yours no matter what you do 'cuz it's soooo 'frickin' nummy!!!!!!\", Charlene says as she diddles your foreskin and slithers her huge tongue all around your throbbiing cock like crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirming your hips once again against your plush toy's dominating tongue, you feel it wriggling and squiggling all around your throbbing dick as she plays with it and gets an honest to goodness taste of your helpless privates in the process!  Squirm as you might, her tongue windmills and squish/slithers your foreskin-covered dick all over the place as she proceeds to slowly slurp up your bare-naked little ass between her gross lips and into her warm, slippery/slimy mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummy-yum-yum!  I'm slurping up your bum!  Mmmmm!  That dinky of yours is soooooo 'frickin' nummy!  I'm just gonna keeps on slurpin' on that tasty little dick of yours for like ever and aver boy-eeee!\", Charlene teases as she continues to tease your throbbing cock with her wicked tongue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery so often Charlene runs her slimy tongue betwen your butt-cheecks roughly which only increases your arousal as her powerful tongue grinds over your helpless butt-hole!  So it goes as your squirming hips are sucked into your dragon's merciless mouth!  Your dick is slither/swirled over and over even as your bum is licked non-stop!  Because Charlene it a dragon and her tongue is so incredibly nimble, she manages to keep this pattern up, even as she sucks in your mid and upper body into her slobbery mouth!  As her lips lips wrap around your torso, just under your arms, and you are about to climax, she starts to violently chomp your naked body into her mouth in a series of comical lip-squishing \"Nom-Nom-Nom's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly finding yourself completely sealed inside of her sloppy, boy-gobbling mouth, you can do nothing but writhe and squirm about helplessly in the slick darkness as she rolls you around and molests every square inch of your bare flesh with her wicked, slippery tongue!</span></div></div>",
