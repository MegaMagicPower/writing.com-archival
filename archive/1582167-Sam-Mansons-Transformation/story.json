            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One day at Fenton Works...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was helping her boyfriend Danny's parents rebuild the ghost portal. Danny himself would have been there to help them, but he got called by the mayor (Tucker Foley) to stop a dead plitician from haunting city hall. Sam had just handed Danny's mom a soldering iron to re-attach a couple wires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think we've done all we can for now.\" Danny's mom, Maddie said. \"We should get back to calculating the precise power requirements to get this thing up and running again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but that's boring!\" Danny's dad, Jack said. \"Can't we just fiddle around with the portal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, it's still unstable. Doing anything now could cause catastrophic results.\" Maddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie and Jack then walked upstairs discussing their next course of action, leaving Sam alone with the portal. Sam noticed that there was one wire Maddie forgot to re-attach, so she walked over to it. She didn't notice a cable on the floor, so she tripped over it and accidentally pressed a button on the inside, activating the portal with her inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire body was now in unbelievable pain. She felt like she was being torn apart and then reassembled again. After about a minute, the portal exploded, and Sam was left unconscious on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Sam woke up to Maddie wiping her brow with a dishcloth. She looked around and saw that she was in Danny's room, on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what happened to me?\" Sam said in a daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me.\" Maddie said. \"Me and Jack heard an explosion in the lab, and we went down to find the portal blown up and with you like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, the explosion...\" Sam said. \"Wait, what do you mean by 'like this?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie grabbed a mirror. \"Sam, this may come as a shock to you...\" Maddie said right before Sam took the mirror out of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam noticed that the arm she grabed the mirror with looked different, more beefy. Sam looked in the mirror and saw that her hair had a white streak in it and her eyes were now glowing purple. She looked down at her body, and recieved the biggest shock of all: her body was now that of a body-builder's! Her arms and legs were now very muscly and well-toned, and her stomach now had a nice six-pack. Her breasts had also gone up a cup size, adding to her muscly image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't worry Sam, I'm sure that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look awesome!\" Sam said, springing out of the bed, shaking the floor when she landed. She then flexed her arms like the confident, muscly girl she was. \"I'll bet any of Danny's enemies couldn't beat me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then stretched out her arms to yawn, accidentally blasting beams of purple energy out of her hands. \"Whoah, I have ghost powers too? This just gets better and better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, I'd like to run some tests to make sure you're alright...\" Maddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well I'm running some tests of my own!\" Sam said. She then went intangible and flew outside....</span></div></div>",

Sam looked down to see Ember terrorizing some people at a record store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks like a job for SUPER SAM!\" Sam shouted to the sky. \"Hee hee, I've always wanted to say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the record store, Ember had scared some people away so that she could steal the store's brand new amplifier, capable of going all the way up to 12. \"I don't care if this makes me look like a Scooby-Doo villian, this was a good plan!\" Ember said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Ember was punched in the face by a very strong arm. \"I'll have to disagree, you didn't count on me!\" a familiar sounding voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber looked to see that it was the ghost boy's girlfriend, with a twist. She now had huge muscles and glowing purple eyes. Ember didn't know whether to feel afraid at her new power, or aroused at her new body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ember, you're going down!\" Sam said in a powerful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber shook her head to get her mind out of the gutter, and then said \"Hey what's with you? Been taking steroids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steroids can't do this!\" Sam said, firing a beam of purple ghost energy at Ember. Ember got back up and attempted to hit Sam with her guitar. This proved fruitless, as the guitar broke on contact with Sam's rock-hard body, who was only knocked back a few inches. Frantic and out of ideas, Ember tried launching herself at Sam, who just hit her with a good, clean punch, knocking her to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to give up?\" Sam said, an arrogant tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhhh....\" Ember said, dazed and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam picked up the KO'd Ember and flew off...</span></div></div>",

She turned around to see Danny, a shocked look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, this is the new me!\" Sam said, holding Ember with one arm while flexing the other. \"Wanna feel my muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny shook his head to clear the cobwebs, and said \"Um, well, there's a ghost around here, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then held the beaten, unconscious Ember up to Danny's face. \"Don't worry, I took care of it.\" Sam said. \"You got a thermos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny then grabbed the Fenton thermos and sucked Ember inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, how did you get those muscles?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the ghost portal malfunctioed, I got hit, and now I have ghost powers, plus more!\" Sam said, flexing both her arms across her torso. \"So, wanna hang out, if you know what I mean?\" Sam said, getting a seductive tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was so much for Danny to take in. Not only did his girlfriend become a muscle-bound halfa, she was fighting ghosts without his help and now she wanted to play a game of touch-football with him!

Her boyfriend was hanging out with her, but he got called by the mayor to stop some ghost, so he had to leave early. She spent the rest of her time eating a bunch of pudding pops while surfing the internet. After accidentally coming upon some website where girls (especially those from PokeMon) were often seen gaining ridiculous amounts of weight, she decided to call it a night. This caused her to have some very weird dreams, which would tonight prove to be very bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree the wishing ghost had just phased into Sam's room, looking as if she had just run a marathon. \"I can't believe how persistent that ghost boy is!\" Desiree said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree then heard some mumbling in this room. She looked over and saw Sam sleeping in her bed, mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, she's talking in her sleep. People usually make the best wishes this way.\" Desiree said, wanting to get some more power for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....fat....want fat...\" Sam mumbled in her sleep. \"I want to be a...fat ghost girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of weird dream is she having?\" Desiree said. \"Oh well, so you have wished it, so shall it be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree then released a cloud of green smoke upon Sam, who was now beginning to fatten up. After about a minute, Sam now weighed 250 pounds, and was floating above her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like my work here is done.\" Desiree said, flying out of the room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam woke up, and looked around. She had some very strange dreams last night, and was now glad to be back in the real world. She sat up, but noticed that it seemed harder to do. She walked over to a nearby mirror and nearly screamed. Her belly was now the size of a basketball, her face was chubbier, her thighs were now thunder-level, her breasts were now D-cups, and her ass looked like two watermelons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! How did I get this fat!?\" Sam said, squeezing her belly, somehow expecting this to not be real. This would not be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam held her head in her hands. \"Ugh, how am I gonna explain to my parents that I suddenly gained 135 pounds overnight?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she didn't feel weighted down. In fact, she felt almost weightless. Sam looked down and saw that she was floating above the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now what?\" Sam said. She tried to will herself back down, but she was having trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Sam heard a knock on her door. \"Hey Sam, sorry about last night. Can I make it up to you today?\" A voice on the other side of the door said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Danny!' Sam thought 'I can't let him see me like this!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, actually, I'm not feeling well.\" Sam said, using the first excuse her brain could think of. She then accidentally shot a beam of energy at her desk lamp, destroying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay in there?\" Danny said, wondering about the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah Danny.\" Sam said. \"You can just go about your business now.\"</span></div></div>",

He remembered something soft and heavy falling down on him, but he didn't know what it was. He looked forward though, and found out. It was Sam!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAM!?\" Danny said, shocked at Sam's new weight. \"What happened to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just woke up like this!\" Sam said, trying to keep herself on the ground by gripping the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, did you have any strange dreams?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam thought back to last night.

And if not...\" Sam said, getting closer to Danny. \"...you can always rub the rest all over my naked body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's face turned bright red at Sam's come-on. He wondered breifly if Sam's new powers were somehow affecting her sexual desires...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Sam's huge order came, and she had to borrow a few empty tables to hold it all. She started on the waffle-cones, then worked her way up to sundaes, and then she just went wild over the ice cream cakes. As she ate, her belly was growing and growing, soon sinking past her knees. She had to back her chair up several times to allow room for it to grow. Eventually the chair broke, and she had to stand up to eat all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long time, Sam had finally finished her huge ice cream binge. Her belly was now the size of an over-inflated beach ball and had little specks of ice cream and chocolate sauce over it. Sam moaned in pleasure as she rubbed her gigantic gut, thinking of what the rest of her body would look like once all of the ice cream in it was converted into fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I've never seen anyone eat that much ice cream.\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I love this. I wish I could kiss my own belly...\" Sam said. Suddenly she got an idea. \"I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then concentrated, and a perfect clone of Sam appeared next to her, gigantic belly and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" Danny said. \"Why is it that everyone can get cloning right but me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam ignored Danny's comment and crawled (and I use this term loosely) over to her clone and started kissing and playing with the clone's belly. After about a miute of this, Sam crawled up and planted a big kiss on the clone's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny eyes shot open at this, and his nose started to bleed. 'Oh man, this is hot...' Danny thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making out with her clone for ten minutes, it disappeared, leaving a large, ice cream covered girl sitting on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm ready to go home now....\" Sam said.</span></div></div>",

He then looked at her messy face and larger belly. \"Have a good breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-hm.\" Sam said. She then wrapped her skinny boyfriend in a BIG hug, feeling his body squish into her belly and between her breasts. She then rose him up and planted a big kiss on his face, her tongue delving deep down into his throat. Ever since Sam had acquired her fat and her ghost powers, her libido had gone through the roof. She wanted her fat body to be invaded by Danny's, nay, anybody's hands, perhaps even other appendages...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then put Danny down, who was now gasping for breath. \"Alright, let's go on our date now.\" Sam said. She and Danny then flew off...</span></div></div>",

She would have Danny take her to a restaurant or two (or ten), then she'd bring Danny home and have some fun with him in the bedroom. She wanted Danny to do her until the bed broke (which, considering her size, wouldn't be very hard.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Sam, this was not meant to be, as her's and Danny's ghost sense went off. 'Aw man.' Sam thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sam, duty calls.\" Danny said. \"Hehehe, I've always wanted to say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Danny looked around for the ghost, and then they saw it; a thirty-foot monster made of ground beef attacking a restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare this restaurant have a vegitarian menu!\" the monster said, breaking a big hole in the restaurant's wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, the Lunch Lady must have been bored out of her skull.\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny and Sam then flew at the Lunch Lady and tried to punch it, but they just got their fists stuck in the ground beef. The Lunch Lady picked them up and held them up to her face. \"Well, looks like one of you has been eating well.\" The Lunch Lady said in a sweet, calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled at this, enjoying the Lunch Lady's complement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO EAT MEATY DEATH!\" the Lunch Lady yelled in a loud, booming voice, pinning the two teens down with her meaty hand. They went intangible to escape, leaving her momentarily confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, Danny's fist began to glow blue. \"Let's see how she likes the meat locker...\" Danny said, charging up an ice ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Danny, I've got a better idea.\" Sam said, cutting Danny off. Sam then charged purple energy into her hands and flew over to the Lunch Lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should eat your meat, girl!\" the Lunch Lady said. \"Then you wouldn't have slipped from my grip so easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I will!\" Sam said. Sam then unleashed a huge blast of ecto-energy upon the Lunch Lady's meaty body. The heat of the blast was instantly cooking the meatthat made it up. For at least a mile, people could smell burger meat cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sam finished her attack, the Lunch Lady flew out of the meat body of hers. \"I can't use this! I need my meat uncooked!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Danny came up, pointed the Fenton Thermos at the Lunch Lady, and sucked her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, that was awesome! I never-Sam?\" Danny said, now realizing that he didn't see Sam anywhere. \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny then heard loud chomping and smacking noises. He looked over to the cooked meat monster body and saw that Sam was eating it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sam, aren't you a vegitarian?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget morals, I'm hungry!\" Sam said, breifly stopping her feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just had a huge breakfast!\" Danny said. Sam paid no attention to that and just continued eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Sam had finally eaten the entire meat monster body, and her body definitely showed it. Her belly was now the size of three RVs, her breasts were each as big as wrecking balls, and her ass was twice as big as her breasts. Her arms and legs looked like gigantic pillows with tiny hands and feet that looked like they would get swallowed up any minute, and she had a fat face with ten chins to top it off. From one look, one could say that she weighed at least three tons, if not more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, that was good...\" Sam said, in a food-induced daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I can't believe you ate all of that!\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Sam said. \"So, can we still go on our date?\"</span></div></div>",
