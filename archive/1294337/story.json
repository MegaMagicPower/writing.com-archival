Their scaly skin ranges from dark rusty brown to a rusty black color. They has glowing red eyes. Their tail is nonprehensile. Kobolds wear ragged clothing, favoring red and orange. A kobold is 2 to 2\u00bd feet tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds. Kobolds speak Draconic with a voice that sounds like that of a yapping dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKobolds like to attack with overwhelming odds\u2014at least two to one\u2014or trickery; should the odds fall below this threshold, they usually flee. However, they attack gnomes on sight if their numbers are equal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey begin a fight by slinging bullets, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKobolds are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Metallic Dragons</u></b><br>\r\nMetallic dragons make up the good branch of dragonkind, but they are every bit as aggressive as their evil cousins when threatened or challenged. They also tend to be covetous and proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Gem Dragons</u></b><br>\r\nGem Dragons are neither good nor evil, but view the world in a neutral way. They tend to follow a path that benefits them most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Chromatic Dragons</u></b><br>\r\nChromatic dragons form the evil branch of dragonkind. They are aggressive, greedy, vain, and nasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Other</u></b><br>\r\nHalf Dragons, and non-kobold/dragon races here</span></div></div>",

Yet to the eyes of most humanoids, he's a scrawny little thing, bright red in color, but by the Ancestors look at those wings!! Those wings!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Biography: </b>When Klang was born, with the rare trait of wings, he was immediately hailed as a prophet within his clan, an incarnation of dragonhood and combined with great natural abilities, was constantly told how he would lead the clan to new heights. He was taught the arts of sorcery, which Klang quickly proved adept at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his clan was one day attacked by a band of adventurers, forcing them to flee. Deeply traumatized by the experience, Klang and his clan, drifted from city to city, usually belittled for being a kobolds, with none recognizing his greatness, having to endure humiliating circumstances such as begging, odd jobs and most recently as an exotic pets by a human slave trader. That circumstance did not last long, as the human slaver soon found himself being burned into a crisp after Klang crafted a nasty magic fire trap that involved pigs, booze and oil, but the satisfaction of murdering his slave master did not last long as Klang was then captured and now found himself slated for execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang found himself rescued by Master Flare, a young chromatic dragon looking to make a name for himself, and also seeking to gain a band of loyal servants. Klang, honored to be in the presence of a dragon pledged to do the chromatic dragon's bidding. Master Flare doesn't treat him or his clan overly well, seeing Klang as merely one of his many expendable minions, but Klang does not mind at all the poor treatment at all. So long as he gets to serve in the presence of a mighty dragon!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Klang thinks very well of himself, spouting out constantly that he is a dragon reborn, as if he is the one that is 30 feet long and several tons, and wants everybody to know it, using by blowing out puffs of smoke into the air of random breaths of fire. This bragging belays a deep cowardice that he is not quite good enough, that he\u2019s not really as dragon, and doubt constantly creeps into his kobold mind. Yet he doesn\u2019t hate people really, because well its never a good idea to antagonize your meat shields. Klang also likes shinies, thinking that hoarding shinies will make him more like a dragon, and he is also a notorious cheapskate. He would burn his own mother for a copper piece. Lastly, Klang likes fire, very, very, very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his traveling companions and non-kobolds or draconic speakers, Klang can be obnoxious at times, perhaps fitting into a stereotype of kobolds being 'nasty little buggers'. His favorite words are 'Berk', 'Stronk', 'Fiya' and 'Shiny'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet at the same time, Klang actually has another more formal personality, which he shows to others of his kind. Sorcerers are thought of highly in kobold society, and as such takes great efforts to act in a very polite, and respectful manner. He very much thinks himself as though he is a paragon of kobold society, ever seeking to push the fate of his people forward and fighting selflessly on their behalf, and has a very refined taste for koboldesses. Those who would know Klang as an obnoxious bugger would be shocked at the contrasting behavior Klang comports himself with others of his kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang is very subservient in the presence of his master, Flare the Chromatic Fire Dragon, and sees the dragon with a combination of fear and awe. The reason he hasn't died yet is because Klang is pretty adept at telling Master Flare the things he likes to hear and assuaging the dragon's ego, along with the fact that the kobold amuses him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what is Klang doing at this very moment?</span></div></div>",

Klang had his own spot in the hotsprings, a small rock outcropping near the edge of the waters. It was not a natural formation, instead built by the clan for Klang.  It had a pathway of rocks that came to the outcropping, to allow Klang to reach it without getting wet, if he so chose.  It had a simple throne made out of the nearby stones to allow him to retain a command presence if needed.  Next to the throne was a large flat area, perfect for laying down and drying off.  The outcropping had a small inlet in it, a private pool where Klang could relax.  He was in this pool, watching over the social activities of the kobolds.. HIS kobolds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the shore of the springs, tables were set up, taken from various raids, and different bottles of drink.  The kobolds had done enough work in human lands to recognize the benefit of a well stocked bar.  In here, everyone was off duty, and there was no rank, no prestige, except for Klang, or perhaps Flare if he had ever decided to come in and mingle with the masses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn each arm, in the pool with him were two female kobolds, no one in particular, just had been in the right place at the right time.  They were each taking turns rubbing a cloth against his scales and wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff on her own was another kobold, a blue scaled by the name of Frill. Not that the clan had an issue with Frill, she was one of theirs.. but Frill always seemed to do her own thing.</span></div></div>",

His hands were wrapped around their smooth bodies, and his claw tips explored one of their tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Bartender!! If you would be so kind, a drink for myself and the two young koboldesses</i>,\" said Klang. He snapped his fingers to signal what he wanted. Before long, the bartender had summoned three glasses full of beer. With both of his arms already occupied by the two koboldesses, Klang summoned a few mage hands to deftly take the glasses and serve them to himself and his koboldesses. The drink was of moderate strength, enough to give him a nice buzz, but not to the point where he would take leave of his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, one thing led to another and Klang found himself thoroughly enjoying his time with the shiny koboldesses in the jacuzzi.  Klang had proven himself the strongest of the kobolds, and thus felt entitled to have any female that he chose, and that he was blessed by the Ancestors indeed that such pretty ones had come by. As chieftain of the clan, he had already sired a decent number of eggs, and with the way that Klang was going at it with the koboldesses, it would seem that it was number that he was keen on seeing grow. At the end of it, Klang reclined at the edge of the bath with a crooked smile on his pointed jaw, the two females laid contently at his side, their tongues lolling out in a wondrous daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that Klang noticed the other blue female. She was named Frill wasn't she? Klang had tried seducing her before, but she had never been interested, perhaps given that she liked spending her time with one of the guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang stepped out of the Jacuzzi, making himself decent before facing Frill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ah yes... is there something I may do for you?\"</i> asked Klang.</span></div></div>",

Did he say what he wants from me?\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the kobold clans that paid fealty to Flare both worshipped and feared the large red dragon, very much like God of the Old Testament. To a kobolds, who already had a natural, inbuilt subservience to dragonkind, Flare was very much like a force of nature; powerful and unshakable. When Master Flare called a kobold over, they were expected to drop everything and address him. It didn't matter if they were on a great quest, or seeing the birth of their hatchling, or currently having sex; if you didn't answer his summons, you ended up as literal dragon food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No, I am afraid that he did not specify</i>...\" answered Frill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang let out a gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Then I shall go attend to him immediately...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other kobolds suddenly gave him sympathetic looks, or as if he was about to walk to his own funeral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang exited the cave system of the Berkberk Clan, and took the long trek up the great mountain, which was quite cold, to the lair where Master Flare dwelled, which was naturally at the top of that mountain. As he climbed, a sense of fear grew within the little kobold. Had Klang not worshipped Master Flare properly? Surely, he had done everything he could to ensure that every member of his clan knew that he was Master!! Klang was near catatonic as all the various scenarios of how he could have conceivably displeased Master Flare as he went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Flare oftentimes took the form of a kobold, usually to personally observe the goings on of the kobold clan, but it was only during important tasks, he made sure that he was in his full draconic form. Whenever he was in draconic form, Flare wanted to make it crystal clear just who the Master truly was, and regardless of how much power Klang had amassed as chieftain of the Berkberk Clan, he was still a kobold and a servant, while he was a true dragon. The mere sight of the huge red dragon in his true form was both awe inspiring and fearsome to behold, leaving Klang's knees weak. He sat upon a huge nest of gold coins and treasure; the sight of it left his covetous senses mingling. Yet woe be any kobold who took even a coin of Master Flare's wealth. They tended to end up in his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Klang's dismay but not his surprise, Master Flare looked most displeased indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is about time you have shown up to face your master. If you had been any slower, then I might have been forced to eat you whole!!\" snapped Flare in common. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Berk!!\" chirped Klang with fright. The mere force that he spoke with nearly knocked the little kobold off his feet, and Flare relished in seeing Klang's fearful reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Masta Flare!! Good, glorious Masta!! Please no eat Klang!\" he bowed down.  Common tongue was not Klang's first language, yet when Master Flare spoke in common, he expected to be addressed in that language and with sufficient subservience as well. Flare also seemed to know of Klang's trouble with common, as Klang tended to talk to him much more subserviently than Klang would have had he been allowed to speak in his elegant draconic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What cans Klang do fors Masta Flare to please him!!\" said Klang in a trembling voice. Flare, being a relatively young red dragon, was prone to sudden mood swings and bursts of anger, which meant that kobold chieftains had shorter than usual tenures as leaders of their respective clans. If Klang did not demonstrate what Flare deemed to be adequate subservience, he might decide to eat Klang. By the Ancestors, even if Klang did demonstrate adequate subservient, Flare might decide to eat him anyways just for the heck of it and there was nothing Klang would be able to do about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlare's eyes narrowed menacingly. \"The humans have slighted me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da humans? But... but wes trade with dem! Dey be peaceful...\" chirped Klang, perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlare's nostrils billowed with smoke and out a short roar, \"You dare question me in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beeerrrrkkk!!\" chirped Klang, going bug-eyed his body stiffening in fright, \"Of course no Masta Flare!! Ehehe... Dose nasty, nasty humans!! Dey speaks most terrible things of Masta Flare!! Dey shoulds be punished, mosts terribly!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlare seemed contented that he had gotten his way, as he always did of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad that you have seen reason, my little servant,\" said Master Flare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, the human kingdom of Vertigard has failed to deliver a maiden to me at the appropriate time. My only interpretation of this is that its king has begun to think that he can defy me. He needs to be shown that he is mistaken to think this,\" said Flare. \"He shall pay!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang blinked. Was Master Flare crazy, going to war with an entire human kingdom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Masta Flare!! We nos have da forces to take ova and destroy da Kingdom!! He hire adventurers, and dey bes nothing but trouble!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlare's eyes went wide again, burning with fire, and Klang feared that he might have signed his own death warrant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you dare have any other suggestion then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang wondered if he should talk. Well, if he was already dead anyhow, what was the harm in it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... wes can infiltrate da Kingdom!! Deys only no deliver a maiden yes? So wes sneak into da capital city ands steals dere princess and deliver her to Master Flare!! When we no have to destroy da kingdom and dey only bes intimidated, den you still be ables to extract manys, manys more shinies from dem!! So, Masta Flare end up with even bigger horde den before!!\" he chirped, his body trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease don't eat me, please don't eat me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlare rumbled. \"Yes, I believe I like that plan valued minion...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dos?\" asked Klang with a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I think about it, simply flying over the capital city and razing it to the ground might be unprofitable. Taking the King's daughter and forcing the king to either pay a huge ransom to get her back, or better yet if he refuses I'd get a prime opportunity to ravage her; it would be a far more potent demonstration of my virility I must say. Either way, the King of Vertigard would be cowed to the point where they would continue to pay tribute to me. I'm glad I thought of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!!\" nodded Klang. \"Yous truly a brilliant, brilliant Masta!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I am,\" said Flare, \"Since you are such a valued minion...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang purred like the cat on an evil mastermind's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am assigning you and your best team of kobolds to make sure that the scheme succeeds. Infiltrate into the capital city of Vertigard, kidnap the princess, and bring her to me alive!! Failure will not be tolerated, and will see the liquidation of your entire clan if you fail. However, if you succeed, my favor toward you and your clan will increase,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Master!! Good Master!!\" bowed Klang. \"Thank you for gibbing Klang da privilege of servings you!! Klang will not fails you!! He bring you much glory and shinies!! All hail Masta Flare!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!! Now get going!!\" he bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang made his way out of the room, letting out a sigh of relief. Every time he went into Master Flare's chamber, he went in there half-expecting his own death, but in its place he had given him an even greater task.</span></div></div>",

Klang knew that Frill had not been in direct service to Master Flare too long, having been doing odd jobs for the clan before, though she had made a name for herself for being stubborn and insubordinate to her superiors.  Why Flare chose this one to be his personal assistant was something only Flare knew, but Klang suspected it had a lot to do with Frill's own draconic blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Flare said he would have a task for you, and I was to assist you in it, Chief.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking forward to a bit of adventure, not having ever been too content sitting in the caves all day long. Frill's sire was a blue half dragon that had sought refuge in the caverns, one of the few times Flare had shown generosity, even allowed him to take his pick of the females to keep him comfortable for the night.  Of course, that generosity did come with a price, and Frill was the result.  Though only a quarter dragon, Frill showed an intelligence that would be equalled to Klang, unlike most kobolds.  Why Flare was cultivating kobolds with dragons blood in them was another unknown question, one that Klang had no intent of ever asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to Frill with a grin.  \"Its good to know that Master Flare intended the entire time to send me on a task. This job is a kidnapping, taking the King of Vertigard's daughter because they stopped with tributes.  We will need two others. Do you have suggestions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrill thought on that as her tail twitched back and forth. \"My clutchmate, Skiir.  He good with a blade and can be trusted to watch our back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang nodded. \"Skiir.. yes I know him, the one that always seems to be watching you when he doesn't think anyone is looking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrill tried to hide her amusement at that.  \"Skiir has it in his mind to flirt with me every time he gets, wanting a chance to fill me with a clutch no doubt.  I am just not interested in him that way. He is a good friend, and a good protector.\"  She thinks some more.  \"Actually, we should find the shamans and see if they can recommend anyone as well.

Yes, she and Skiir would do quite nicely together, not only romance wise but also combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang had seen Frill at her craft. She was a quick and dexterous fighter who was a whiz with daggers and hand crossbows, craft all manners of nasty traps and could pick any lock and most of all was intelligent. Her clutchmate Skiir was the stronger of the two, a powerfully adept swordsman who had the strength of the much larger humanoid species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn't have to worry about those two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, their little group would need a healer, and Klang knew just where to find one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed off to the clan's local temple of Kurtulmak, down a series of dark, winding passageways. At every periodic point, he would seemingly randomly move to the side, or duck and the like; he knew that should any pesky adventurers attempt to infiltrate this holy place, they would be hit by all sorts of traps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance of the temple of Kurtulmak was a long corridor, leading to a grand hallway that finished with a statue of Kurtulmak. While Klang was a worshipper of Astilabor, the goddess of wealth and hordes, he nonetheless held a deep respect for the faith of Kurtulmak, being the patron god of kobolds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Chieftain Klang,\" said the head priest, an old kobold named Kharaman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I greet you my old teacher,\" said Klang with a bow. \"It is good to see that you are still well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKharaman had been the one who had been Klang's instructor when Klang had been growing up from a hatchling, who had taught him discipline, his knowledge in Draconic and lastly his abilities. Klang owed the old wyrm a lot, and he would dare say that without his guidance, he probably would have ended up in Master Flare's belly quite a long time ago. While he moved on a cane nowadays, he still moved with a steady gait, and nobody in the clan was wiser. Even now, he served as an elder advisor of sorts, to help him make decisions for the best of the Berkberk Clan and how he should approach Master Flare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" he replied, \"It is a boon to see you as well, my old apprentice. What brings you around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, to offer my prayers of course,\" said Klang. \"But secondly, there is a task of great importance. Master Flare has called upon me personally to lead an expedition to obtain tribute from the Kingdom of Vertigern, specifically in the form of the king's daughter. The quest to travel to their capital city, gain entry, capture her and get back safely will be a long and arduous one, and I would have need of the services of a user of divine magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... that's quite a quest indeed. I would recommend the temple's most talented prodigy, and the task you have in mind would be ideal for achieving fame...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the kobold I have in mind, that would be...\"</span></div></div>",

Wait a second, a kobold with a metallic dragon ancestry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called Master Kharaman?\" said the gold koboldess, gliding into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed Kirill...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? A kobold with metallic ancestry?\" said Klang skeptically. Normally, no kobolds with any ancestry in metallic were ever allowed in, but perhaps he had thought wrong. Kirill gave Klang a sharp look, perhaps not even caring she was addressing the leader of the entire clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes she indeed does Chieftain Klang, and as I told you, she is our most talented prodigy in divine magic. I trust that you will be able to make use of her in the quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that I would,\" said Klang, trusting his old instructor's judgment in this. He was a bit miffed that he had not been informed of the fact that his clan had taken in a metallic descended kobold; even with there being a large number of kobolds in his clan, he figured that he would have heard of such a thing happening. Maybe Kharaman had decided to pull a fast one over Klang to keep his former apprentice on his heels?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though I am curious, Kirill,\" said Klang, \"How you managed to be raised by Master Kharaman. Being the chieftain, one would think I would hear of all the kobolds in my clan, or at the very least exceptional ones such as yourself....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told that my birth mother lost my egg during an adventurer attack, and that I was found by Master Kharaman and raised to be a proper devotee to Kurtulmak,\" she shared. Klang could tell from her tone that such a vague explanation did not seem to satisfy the young koboldess and did not believe that to be the entire story for a second, who clearly wanted to know more. If that was the story that Kharaman had brought her up with, then Klang would have been suspicious that he had not told the whole truth either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did those with metallic ancestry end up siring a kobold that ended up in a clan with near total Chromatic? Whatever that answer was, Klang decided not to press the point for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet the circumstances of my birth are irrelevant. I am to prove to the chieftain, to Kurtulmak and to Master Flare that I am a worthy divine cleric. I hope that you can provide that opportunity chieftain Klang for me to demonstrate my talents,\" said Kirill confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang couldn't help but flash a half smile. So, she was one of those prodigies who thought she could do anything? Well, Klang had not been too much different himself, so he could relate to that. He also wondered if her metallic heritage made Kirill even more than usual to demonstrate her abilities and overcome whatever prejudices she might have faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, that is exactly why I have come Kirill,\" said Klang. He explained the mission that Master Flare had given to him, along with the other kobolds that they would be working with thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that would be a worthwhile means for me to finally display my prodigious talents properly. So, when those two end up stumbling into traps, you want me to bail them out correct?\" she said with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a sense, but don't be afraid to ask them for help either, though those two will need to take some time to get used to you...\" said Klang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no doubts of your abilities, but how prepared are you truly? For instance, how well can you speak common?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirill puffed herself up, \"I's speaks it wells enough,\" she squeaked. \"Fars superiors to da others in da klan! With alls due respect of course chieftain!\" she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that actually wasn't any worse than Klang's common tongue. However, she would need to work on that attitude a bit. She was quite a looker he had to admit. Maybe a good, hard fuck to pop her cherry would be effective. Despite her arrogance, Kirill was indeed a supremely talented magic user, and you know... perhaps a pairing between an arcane caster such as himself and a pretty female like that would be an interesting breeding experiment.  Yet maybe that was just Klang's lust for shiny kobold's speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore likely the realities on the road would shape her up a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you can tell Chieftain Klang,\" said Kharaman, \"You'll have quite the clawful with this little firecracker! Yet I am confident that she will shape up just fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you chieftain,\" answered Klang, in a voice where he wasn't sure if he wasn't being facetious or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when are we heading off?\" snapped Kirill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, we still need to gather up all the necessary gear for the quest, and whether or not we want to take anybody else...\"</span></div></div>",

Among them were various hides prepared for travel.  Frill glanced back as Klang entered with the golden kobold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in time... I was supposed to be handling the trade of hides with the nearby town, but was .. interrupted by Master Flare offering me a job.\"  Skiir looked as if he was about to say something about that, but clamped his maw shut as Frill gave him a glare.  There was obviously more to the story there. \"Apparently they did not find a replacement for me, so the trade still has to be done. It will give us an excuse to be in the lands, and a trade permit in case the authorities stop us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkiir nodded at that.  \"Humans like their rules, we play by them, they mostly leave us alone.  And with some coin from the trade, we can make sure we got coin to spend around when we get to the capitol.  We need to ensure we got witnesses say that we not do kidnapping.  Means that whoever taking the princess cant be seen with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrill nodded.  \"I need to be one seen because permit is made to me, and two for guards is allowed.  So one who be doing actual kidnapping will be spending entire trip in hidden compartment in trunk.\"  She motioned to a rather large, uncomfortable looking, old  wooden trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkiir hesitated.  \"Chief... choice is yours on how you want it done.\"  It was clear he wasnt too keen about being put in the box, though Klang couldn't blame him.  The possibilities ended up being down to three, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.  Klang knew he could kidnap the Princess easy enough as long as she was caught unaware, but the idea of being in the box for at least 3 days sounded quite uncomfortable.  Kirill was an unknown, and though claimed to be a follower of Kurtulmak, could be a trick.  Then again, the golden scales would allow her to get closer to the target and trick the princess.  Skiir would be another good option, as he could probably fight off two or three humans by himself. But Skiir tended to be a blunt force type creature, very little finesse, so would be hard for him to sneak to where he needed to go.  However, if Skiir did go into the box, it meant Klang would be spending the trip in the private company of two quite lovely koboldess'.</span></div></div>",

Its not happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrill let out a huff. \"You afraid that you'll ruffle your wings shiny?\" she sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" she insisted, fluttering them  couple of times, \"My wings have to be in optimal condition for my spells to function properly!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on koboldesses,\" said Klang. \"No need to fight over it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two females glared at each other; it seemed fairly clear that the personalities of those two clashed. Personally, Klang thought it was quite cute; in his mind he could envision them snuggling together and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocus Klang!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can do so if required,\" continued Skiir required, though he too was reluctant with the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admire your spirit of volunteerism,\" said Klang, \"But you're not exactly our best at stealth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Frill,\" said Klang, \"Frankly if we were going with the box plan, you, given your skill and dexterity, would actually be most suited for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrill let out a squeak of surprise, as if she'd been found out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet at the same time, you already have a deal lined up and have to be seen by the merchant guilds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem that nobody, then, wanted to be stuck inside the box. Klang had to think up a different solution to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I might not have as much experience in trading with the humans as you do Frill, but surely, they would have checkpoints, and they would want to ask what is inside the box. If they open it up and find us inside, they'll suspect that something is up, and the game would be up. I do have an alternate plan in how we might be able to get away with this; we just need to look at it in another manner. We need not limit ourselves simply for respect to the humans rules; when we can utilize them to our advantage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one, I can craft a number of fake passes with good enough signatures, and furthermore, don't underestimate what magic can achieve to ensure we can escape suspicion. For example,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlang snapped his finger, and with a simple prestidigitation spell, the normally red kobold was suddenly a platinum scaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans put quite a lot on color coding you see, and for the vast majority of humans, they will see me as a kobold of platinum origin and thus automatically assume me to be friendly to humans,\" said Klang. \"Most humans can hardly differentiate between us aside from color, and if they put up notices for us, why, with another prestidigitation spell I can change my color scheme again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could work I guess; saves one of us from having to spend three days in a box,\" said Skiir, \"But if its such a simple spell, wouldn't it be able to be seen through easily by anybody with rudimentary knowledge of magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am still concerned if there are paladins in the city...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, once again, my magic would be able to come in use,\" said Kirill with her trilling, high pitched voice, \"I can ensure that they end up detecting the alignment they want to see from us. With the divine blessing from Kurtulmak, he shall certainly see us through!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrill rolled her eyes at the insufferable gold koboldess. Were all clerics this arrogant, or was it just this gold girl in particular?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the need is most acute, I would be able to turn somebody invisible or polymorph them into a humanoid, but unless something truly unexpected happens, we shouldn't need to worry too much until we get into the capital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously, such methods are not fool proof, as those tutored in the arcane or divine magics would be able to see through an illusion, but it should be able to enable us to travel through these lands unmolested,\" said Klang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no reason we cannot complete the previous trade we had set up,\" said Klang. \"So lets stop by there first. We can get a few rumors about what is going on, get some extra coins and maybe even buy a few goods ourselves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we're in the capital city, we also might look about establishing some contacts; perhaps some non-Bahamut worshipping Dragonborns, local thieves, political rivals etc, who might have an interest in pursuing a conflict with the current ruler of Vertigern. The better we can divide the humans in their city, the easier it is for us to get off with our princess...\"</span></div></div>",

They had their militia of course, but the general protection of the area actually was done by the kobolds.  It was a symbiotic relationship; The kobolds maintained the security of the roads, in exchange the town allowed itself to be used as a trade hub.  This has proven to be quite beneficial to Miravale as well.  Its reputation had grown to the point other non human races would come to the town to trade. Miravale even had a yearly festival where races that normally did not interact, used the city as a neutral ground for trade and negotiations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis festival was 6 months away still, however... meaning that most likely the only things they would run into is kobolds who have chosen to work in the city, humans, and maybe a few other individuals who made the place home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrill explained this to everyone, more for Skiir and Kirill's purpose than Klangs.  Lord Flare did not demand tribute from this town, provided it remained friendly to his kobold clan.  Apparently the profits from the trading was enough, plus it meant they weren't hunted everytime they turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the town was a known sympathiser to the kobolds, and would provide protection and an alibi if needed... after all, he profits quite well by skimming the taxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA temple to Kurtulmak existed in the town as well, though hidden from normal view in the underground of the town. There was a passage that linked to the kobold caves, though seldom used unless someone needed to escape from the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe General Store was where they needed to go to trade the hides, and the price had already be pre-determined. There should be no need for haggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tavern accommodated all tastes, and on rare occasion offered long pork for any who knew to ask, usually some unfortunate soul sentenced to death by the local constabulary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA orcish blacksmith lived in the town, offering fine orcish armor and weapons, for a price. He usually does work by request or consignment and usually doesnt have a large stock on hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Constable worked for the crown, but a few crowns his way has ensured that has looked the other way during some shady deals in the past.</span></div></div>",

Masta Flare send us on special mission dere, and be concern but what going through da mind of King Theudebert....\" said Klang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... yes...\" said the Mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see, word is that the King's got a whole different set of advisors as of late, and been levying tariffs on any non-human groups in the kingdom. He's facing pressure from all sorts of church organizations, Templars and other goody two types not to compromise with 'evil', as he puts it, and have been distributin all sorts of coin to nobles, merchants, clerics and anybody who'd listen to take a harder stance. I'd already seen a number of those adventuring types stop by; they haven't caused trouble yet, but if they're being paid by the ones advising the king, I reckon they'd start causin trouble. Also heard that he's trying to marry off his daughter to one of these Crusading type nobles as well, and that they're workin on a betrothal, and if it happens he might try and organize an army to 'purify the land of evil'; you know how those types are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, if that happens, big ol' Flare is gonna come swoopin' down on the capital which will be good for nobody, not me, not you and not for the kingdom,\" said Haldric. \"It would be all out war...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Klang see... It explain why da King no longer be gibbing tribute to Flare, because he think dat dese Templars be telling him dat wes evil,\" said Klang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy what he was hearing from Theudebert, it would seem that dealing with some of those troublesome nobles and Templars would do more to help restore the status quo, then taking the more provocative move of capturing the princess. However, Master Flare had explicitly ordered the princesses captured, and disobeying Master Flare was a big no-no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a decision that Klang would have to make; but he still needed to know more. Klang also wondered if he should reveal the full scope of the mission to Theudebert, who was sympathetic to the kobolds and could lend tangible support in terms of goods and manpower. Sympathetic, of course, did not necessarily mean that he would be disloyal to the crown.</span></div></div>",

Colder than what was needed to hatch, kobolds could keep eggs viable indefinitely, letting them hatch only when they needed a surge of new members.  They have been at peace for a while, but peace always came with a price.  They had hunters out of the clan looking for food and treasure outside the borders, to trade with the humans that lived nearby.  As they were a source of trade, the human authorities have no seen a need to take them out.  Part of their deal in this was to keep their numbers \"manegable\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have a position in the clan, other than a member, and as such followed the commands of the guards themselves.  The guards answered to a captain, who answered directly to the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is where you been hiding.\" The voice, draconic in language, was from one of the guards.  If a human heard them talk, it would be like a bunch of yapping dogs, but the kobolds language was much richer than that, each yap could have its own meaning and actually expand the draconic language itself.  Frill glanced back.  \"I am where you had sent me.\"  She inspected the last egg before moving to the guard.  \"Now, what is it you want this time?\"  She spoke a bit testily, as THIS guard seemed to always seek her out for rather dull assignments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard smirked. \"Now Frill, you can at least address me by name...\"</span></div></div>",

Soon, they reached the baths, and at the moment, there was none there. Stripping off the simple red and orange cloth she wore, she let herself slip into the warm water.  Letting out a hiss of pleasure, she murred to herself.  The baths were warmed by an underwater spring, and as such made this bath a popular meeting place after work was done.  Behind her, she could hear Skiir removing his armor and placing it neatly on some nearby rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced back only a moment to observe him.  As a guard, skiir was required to keep himself in a better physical condition, and his training showed.  THe strength in his arms and back was evident in the toned muscles under the scales, and even the tail appeared to be strong. He probably could knock any kobold in the clan down with a swipe of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the show?\" Skiir grinned and slipped into the water beside her, taking some mud from the bottom of the pool and scrubbing it against Frill's back.  \"We will need to get you presentable for the humans.

There was no red scaled kobolds in the clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kobold looked between Frill and Skiir, before waving a claw to the guard. \"You are dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkiir gulped again before speaking.  \"S..sssir I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature gave a glare to Skiir and hissed menacingly.  \"I said... dismissed.\"  Skiir quickly ran off, grabbing his armor on the way.

As the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy until they reach a warm, burnished appearance. The grand head-plates of a brass dragon are smooth and metallic, and it sports bladed chin horns that grow sharper with age. Wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As the dragon grows older, its pupils fade until the eyes resemble molten metal orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelligent creature tries to leave without engaging in conversation, the dragon might force compliance in a fit of pique, using suggestion or a dose of sleep gas. A creature put to sleep may wake to find itself pinned or buried to the neck in the sand until the dragon\u2019s thirst for small talk is slaked. When faced with real danger, younger brass dragons fly out of sight, then hide by burrowing into the sand. Older dragons spurn this ploy but still prefer to have the advantage in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A brass dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of fire and a cone of sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Bronze Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bronze wyrmling\u2019s scales are yellow tinged with green, showing only a hint of bronze. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color deepens slowly to a darker, rich bronze tone. Very old dragons develop a blue-black tint to the edges of their scales. Powerful swimmers, they have webbed feet and smooth, flat scales. The pupils of its eyes fade as a dragon ages, until in the oldest the eyes resemble glowing green orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze dragons dislike killing animals and would rather bribe them (perhaps with food) or force them away magically. They use detect thoughts to learn intelligent creatures\u2019 intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen attacking they blind their opponents with fog cloud and then charge or, if flying, snatch them up. Against seafaring opponents they conjure up a storm or use their tails to smash the vessels\u2019 hulls. If a dragon is inclined to be lenient, ships might be merely becalmed, fogbound, or broken-masted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: Bronze dragons have two types of breath weapon, a line of lightning and a cone of repulsion gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Copper Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt birth, a copper dragon\u2019s scales have a ruddy brown color with a metallic tint. As the dragon gets older, the scales become finer and more coppery, assuming a soft, warm gloss by young adult age. Very old dragons\u2019 scales pick up a green tint. A copper dragon\u2019s pupils fade with age, and the eyes of great wyrms resemble glowing turquoise orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA copper dragon appreciates wit and usually doesn\u2019t harm creatures that can relate a joke, humorous story, or riddle the dragon has not heard before. It quickly gets annoyed with anyone who doesn\u2019t laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor. It likes to taunt and annoy opponents into giving up or acting foolishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angry copper dragon prefers to mire foes using transmute rock to mud. The dragon pushes trapped opponents into the mud or snatches and carries them aloft. A copper dragon tries to draw airborne enemies into narrow, stony gorges where it can use its spider climb ability and maneuver them into colliding with the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A copper dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of acid and a cone of slow gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Silver Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silver wyrmling\u2019s scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until the individual scales are scarcely visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when faced with highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use fog cloud or control weather to blind or confuse opponents before attacking. When angry, they use reverse gravity to fling enemies helplessly into the air, where they can be snatched. Against flying opponents, a silver dragon hides in clouds (creating some with control weather on clear days), then jumps to the attack when it has the advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A silver dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of cold and a cone of paralyzing gas<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Gold Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn hatching, a gold dragon\u2019s scales are dark yellow with golden metallic flecks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flecks get larger as the dragon matures until, at the adult stage, the scales are completely golden. Gold dragons\u2019 faces are bewhiskered and sagacious; as they age, their pupils fade until the eyes resemble pools of molten gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold dragons usually parley before fighting. When conversing with intelligent creatures, they use Intimidate and Sense Motive to gain the upper hand. In combat, they employ bless and their luck bonus; older dragons use their luck bonus at the start of each day. They make heavy use of spells in combat. Among their favorites are cloudkill, delayed blast fireball, fire shield, globe of invulnerability, maze, sleep, slow, and stinking cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A gold dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of fire and a cone of weakening gas.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Choose your Dragon Type<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Amethyst dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath weapon: Line of force<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most powerful of the neutral gem dragons, amethyst dragons are honorable, regal creatures. They inhabit the mountains of the northern islands, living on the shores of isolated lakes and pools. At birth, these dragons have lavender skin with fine, translucent-purple scales. These scales darken as the creature grows older, eventually reaching a sparkling lavender color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese creatures approach life with a detached air, ignoring the conflicts of good and evil, law and chaos. At best, they see these conflicts as petty squabbles over inconsequential points of view, and not worthy of their time or consideration. These majestic dragons consider themselves to be the leaders of the gem dragons, and most of the lesser gem dragons acquiesce to this leadership. While amethyst dragons consider their silver and copper cousins to be foolish and have an active dislike of red and white dragons, they do not consider any life form to be their inherent enemies. They prefer to reason out a settlement through discussion and negotiation rather than through combat, but they can and will fight if they must. Being honourable and noble, these dragons never hide or attempt to ambush foes. To them, even retreating is a dishonourable action, but they will flee if faced with certain death. Amethyst dragons eat large quantities of fish and gems. They keep vassals to attend to their needs, though they do not place as many restrictions or requirements on them as other dragon lords do. Most keep at least one hidden, underwater cave for seclusion and secrecy. Amethyst dragons approach mating in a very logical manner, seeking the optimum partner to produce the best offspring. Love and pleasure rarely, if ever, enter the equation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Crystal dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath weapon: Line of blinding light<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friendly crystal dragons spend much time trying to learn about world around them. They value friendship over all else and the treasures tend to be sentimental rather than valuable, they welcome visitors who come to them with good intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatchlings have glossy white scales that become more and more translucent with age. By the time they reach adulthood, these scales become luminescent in moonlight. In the full light of the day they glow with a dazzling, almost unbearable brilliance. Fun-loving and mischievous, crystal dragons tend to be irresponsible rulers. For the daily running of their domains, these dragons rely on their vassals to keep things going. They establish domains in the cold, open northern reaches, building castles out of snow and ice. They leave these castles open to the sky, for they love to watch the stars on clear, cold nights. The white dragon clans consider crystal dragons to be nothing more than prey, so the two types are almost always in conflict. The crystal dragons also have little love for the giants that often come south to enslave the small, relatively weak gem dragons. Like other benevolent dragons, the crystal dragons prefer to talk rather than fight. Even without special abilities, they can be charming and engaging to an extreme. Gems and metal ores are their foods of choice. They mate with willing partners whenever they want, as desire and need move them. It has also been known for crystal dragons to adopt white dragon hatchlings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Emerald dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath weapon: Powerful burst of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerald dragons live among the tropical islands in the Io's Blood chain's southern waters. They are a curious species, taken to keeping track of history, lore and customs. They tend to be very reclusive, suspicious that others covet their treasure hoards and territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatchlings have translucent green scales, which harden and take on many shades of green as they age. These scales are scintillating in the light, giving an emerald dragon's hide the appearance of being in constant motion. A desire for privacy runs through the emerald clans, going so far as to determine where the dragon lords and their spawn establish lairs. Only their most trusted vassals are permitted to serve them within the main lairs. The others tend to duties throughout the rest of the domain. The primary lairs consist of traps and alarms designed to warn the dragon of visitor and other threats. Emerald dragons prefer to quietly observe intruders and rarely emerge from hiding. If parlay is called for, they send their kindred or chief vassals to handle such duties while they watch, hidden, from cover. When forced into combat, emerald dragons prefer to attack by ambush, using stealth and surprise attacks to quickly disable their enemies. If the threat prove to be too great to handle, an emerald dragon will not hesitate to retreat. However, it will plan revenge, and its patience can last for centuries if need be. Emerald dragons have no compunctions about what they eat. They prefer lizards and giants, but they will eat anything in a pinch. Of all the other type of dragonkind, emerald dragons get along best with the sapphire dragons, often controlling parallel domains (emerald dragons taking the surface, sapphire dragon the subterranean areas below). They fear the red dragon clans because of their well-known greed, and they are usually in open conflict with the fire giants. Emeralds like the security and protection offered by a trusted partner and will take a single mate for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Sapphire dragon</u></b><br>\r\nThe sapphire dragons control subterranean domains. While most of the territory above their realms belongs to the emerald dragons, they keep a small portion of the surface area as their own as well as the extensive caverns beneath the tropical jungles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom birth, sapphire dragons are beautiful, with scale ranging from light to dark blue in color, which sparkle in the light. Because of their coloration, they are sometimes mistaken for blue dragons. Of all dragonkind, perhaps the sapphire dragon clans are the most militaristic. They fervently protect their territory from outsiders, going so far as to distrust anyone who even gets close to their borders. They work to keep their vassals in peak fighting condition, maintaining some of the best-trained armies in. As most of the territory that interests the sapphire clans is below the ground, they rarely come into conflict with other dragon clans unless they attempt to take caverns currently in use. Only the black dragons compete with them for the tropical underground, and even they are wary of going into direct conflict with the armies of the sapphire clans. Most of the demihuman vassals serving the sapphire dragons are either dwarves or gnomes, as these races have no problems living and working beneath the ground. Also, elves are too much like drow, whom these dragons consider to be one of their natural enemies. Dwarven vassals are treated little better than slaves, as the two species were once at war, and they are almost never granted the kindred bond. This honour is usually reserved for gnome only. Giant spiders make up most of a sapphire dragon's diet, and great hunts are conducted through the subterranean tunnels to find these delicacies. When a dragon lord feeling particularly lazy, it will send its dwarven vassals into the tunnels in search of the spiders. Of course, they must capture the spiders alive. While militaristic and warlike, the sapphire dragons are not quick to attack. They prefer to observe intruders (all visitors are intruders) so that they can plan how to deal with them. If drow or dwarves from another clan approach, they are immediately attacked. Others can often at least make some gesture of friendship or parlay before being told to leave. If a sapphire dragon or its treasure is ever threatened, it attacks immediately with its breath weapon, spells, and physical attacks. It uses psionics and special abilities to escape if faced with a more powerful foe. Sapphire dragons take a single mate for long periods of time, however sapphires seek to possess a mate to enhance their prestige and status more than other reasons<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Topaz dragon</u></b><br>\r\nBreath weapon: Cone of dehydration<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopaz dragons inhabit the coastal regions of the temperate islands, building lairs below the waterline, though constructing them so they remain dry. Clannish and self-seeking, these gem dragons usually want little to do with the other inhabitants of the isles. They keep vassals to fill their domain and make them appear as prosperous as their neighbors, but for the most part these dragons neither seek company nor welcome it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the egg, a topaz dragon is a dull yellow-orange in color. With the age, its scales harden and become translucent and faceted. When it reaches adulthood, a topaz dragon sparkles in the light of the sun. While topaz dragons enjoy the feel of sea wind and spray on their faceted-scale hides, they do not particularly like the water. They swim to hunt, attack, or reach their lairs, but not for enjoyment. They do love to eat fish and other sea creatures, especially the tasty giant squid. While not malicious, topaz dragons are not the best of company or particularly pleasant to deal with. Besides caring little for social graces, they display erratic behavior that is unsettling and very confusing. They dislike visitors, but tend to avoid combat if they can help it. If combat is unavoidable, they use tricks and promises to distract their foes before striking with teeth and claws (which they enjoy using). Unless it specifically interests or affect them, topaz dragons tend to be indifferent to the causes and concerns that occupy the rest of dragonkind. They dislike bronze dragons and usually oppose the interests of those clans. It takes time for a topaz dragon to accept another dragon's friendship, but once it does it remains a friend for life. once another dragon gets past its outer defenses and gruff exterior, it finds a loyal companion and ready protector in the topaz dragon.</span></div></div>",

Adding to the skeletal impression is the gradual deterioration of the hide around the base of the horn and the cheekbones. This deterioration increases with age and does not harm the dragon. On hatching, a black dragon\u2019s scales are thin, small, and glossy. As the dragon ages, they become larger, thicker, and duller, helping it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack dragons are especially fond of coins. Older dragons sometimes capture and question humanoids about stockpiles of gold, silver, and platinum coins before killing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A black dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Blue Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue dragon\u2019s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by blowing desert sands. The size of its scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with built-up static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and sand. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems\u2014especially sapphires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older dragons use their special abilities, such as hallucinatory terrain, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the target. Blue dragons run from a fight only if they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A blue dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Green Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wyrmling green dragon\u2019s scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon ages, the scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green, which helps it blend in with its wooded surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking on creatures of any size. If the target is intriguing or seems formidable, the dragon stalks the creature to determine the best time to strike and the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears weak, the dragon makes its presence known quickly\u2014it enjoys evoking terror. Sometimes the dragon elects to control a humanoid creature through intimidation and suggestion. Green dragons especially like to question adventurers to learn more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A green dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Red Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small scales of a wyrmling red dragon are a bright glossy scarlet, making the dragon easily spotted by predators and hunters, so it stays underground and does not venture outside until it is more able to take care of itself. Toward the end of young age, the scales turn a deeper red, and the glossy texture is replaced by a smooth, dull finish. As the dragon grows older, the scales become large, thick, and as strong as metal. The neck frill and wings are an ash blue or purple-gray toward the edges, becoming darker with age. The pupils of a red dragon fade as it ages; the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to appraise an adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap decision whether to attack, using one of many strategies worked out ahead of time.

As the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy until they reach a warm, burnished appearance. The grand head-plates of a brass dragon are smooth and metallic, and it sports bladed chin horns that grow sharper with age. Wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As the dragon grows older, its pupils fade until the eyes resemble molten metal orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelligent creature tries to leave without engaging in conversation, the dragon might force compliance in a fit of pique, using suggestion or a dose of sleep gas. A creature put to sleep may wake to find itself pinned or buried to the neck in the sand until the dragon\u2019s thirst for small talk is slaked. When faced with real danger, younger brass dragons fly out of sight, then hide by burrowing into the sand. Older dragons spurn this ploy but still prefer to have the advantage in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A brass dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of fire and a cone of sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Bronze Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bronze wyrmling\u2019s scales are yellow tinged with green, showing only a hint of bronze. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color deepens slowly to a darker, rich bronze tone. Very old dragons develop a blue-black tint to the edges of their scales. Powerful swimmers, they have webbed feet and smooth, flat scales. The pupils of its eyes fade as a dragon ages, until in the oldest the eyes resemble glowing green orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze dragons dislike killing animals and would rather bribe them (perhaps with food) or force them away magically. They use detect thoughts to learn intelligent creatures\u2019 intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen attacking they blind their opponents with fog cloud and then charge or, if flying, snatch them up. Against seafaring opponents they conjure up a storm or use their tails to smash the vessels\u2019 hulls. If a dragon is inclined to be lenient, ships might be merely becalmed, fogbound, or broken-masted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: Bronze dragons have two types of breath weapon, a line of lightning and a cone of repulsion gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Copper Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt birth, a copper dragon\u2019s scales have a ruddy brown color with a metallic tint. As the dragon gets older, the scales become finer and more coppery, assuming a soft, warm gloss by young adult age. Very old dragons\u2019 scales pick up a green tint. A copper dragon\u2019s pupils fade with age, and the eyes of great wyrms resemble glowing turquoise orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA copper dragon appreciates wit and usually doesn\u2019t harm creatures that can relate a joke, humorous story, or riddle the dragon has not heard before. It quickly gets annoyed with anyone who doesn\u2019t laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor. It likes to taunt and annoy opponents into giving up or acting foolishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angry copper dragon prefers to mire foes using transmute rock to mud. The dragon pushes trapped opponents into the mud or snatches and carries them aloft. A copper dragon tries to draw airborne enemies into narrow, stony gorges where it can use its spider climb ability and maneuver them into colliding with the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A copper dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of acid and a cone of slow gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Silver Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silver wyrmling\u2019s scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until the individual scales are scarcely visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when faced with highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use fog cloud or control weather to blind or confuse opponents before attacking. When angry, they use reverse gravity to fling enemies helplessly into the air, where they can be snatched. Against flying opponents, a silver dragon hides in clouds (creating some with control weather on clear days), then jumps to the attack when it has the advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A silver dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of cold and a cone of paralyzing gas<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Gold Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn hatching, a gold dragon\u2019s scales are dark yellow with golden metallic flecks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flecks get larger as the dragon matures until, at the adult stage, the scales are completely golden. Gold dragons\u2019 faces are bewhiskered and sagacious; as they age, their pupils fade until the eyes resemble pools of molten gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold dragons usually parley before fighting. When conversing with intelligent creatures, they use Intimidate and Sense Motive to gain the upper hand. In combat, they employ bless and their luck bonus; older dragons use their luck bonus at the start of each day. They make heavy use of spells in combat. Among their favorites are cloudkill, delayed blast fireball, fire shield, globe of invulnerability, maze, sleep, slow, and stinking cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A gold dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of fire and a cone of weakening gas.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Choose your Dragon Type<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoose your Dragon Type<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Amethyst dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath weapon: Line of force<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most powerful of the neutral gem dragons, amethyst dragons are honorable, regal creatures. They inhabit the mountains of the northern islands, living on the shores of isolated lakes and pools. At birth, these dragons have lavender skin with fine, translucent-purple scales. These scales darken as the creature grows older, eventually reaching a sparkling lavender color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese creatures approach life with a detached air, ignoring the conflicts of good and evil, law and chaos. At best, they see these conflicts as petty squabbles over inconsequential points of view, and not worthy of their time or consideration. These majestic dragons consider themselves to be the leaders of the gem dragons, and most of the lesser gem dragons acquiesce to this leadership. While amethyst dragons consider their silver and copper cousins to be foolish and have an active dislike of red and white dragons, they do not consider any life form to be their inherent enemies. They prefer to reason out a settlement through discussion and negotiation rather than through combat, but they can and will fight if they must. Being honourable and noble, these dragons never hide or attempt to ambush foes. To them, even retreating is a dishonourable action, but they will flee if faced with certain death. Amethyst dragons eat large quantities of fish and gems. They keep vassals to attend to their needs, though they do not place as many restrictions or requirements on them as other dragon lords do. Most keep at least one hidden, underwater cave for seclusion and secrecy. Amethyst dragons approach mating in a very logical manner, seeking the optimum partner to produce the best offspring. Love and pleasure rarely, if ever, enter the equation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Crystal dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath weapon: Line of blinding light<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friendly crystal dragons spend much time trying to learn about world around them. They value friendship over all else and the treasures tend to be sentimental rather than valuable, they welcome visitors who come to them with good intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatchlings have glossy white scales that become more and more translucent with age. By the time they reach adulthood, these scales become luminescent in moonlight. In the full light of the day they glow with a dazzling, almost unbearable brilliance. Fun-loving and mischievous, crystal dragons tend to be irresponsible rulers. For the daily running of their domains, these dragons rely on their vassals to keep things going. They establish domains in the cold, open northern reaches, building castles out of snow and ice. They leave these castles open to the sky, for they love to watch the stars on clear, cold nights. The white dragon clans consider crystal dragons to be nothing more than prey, so the two types are almost always in conflict. The crystal dragons also have little love for the giants that often come south to enslave the small, relatively weak gem dragons. Like other benevolent dragons, the crystal dragons prefer to talk rather than fight. Even without special abilities, they can be charming and engaging to an extreme. Gems and metal ores are their foods of choice. They mate with willing partners whenever they want, as desire and need move them. It has also been known for crystal dragons to adopt white dragon hatchlings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Emerald dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath weapon: Powerful burst of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerald dragons live among the tropical islands in the Io's Blood chain's southern waters. They are a curious species, taken to keeping track of history, lore and customs. They tend to be very reclusive, suspicious that others covet their treasure hoards and territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatchlings have translucent green scales, which harden and take on many shades of green as they age. These scales are scintillating in the light, giving an emerald dragon's hide the appearance of being in constant motion. A desire for privacy runs through the emerald clans, going so far as to determine where the dragon lords and their spawn establish lairs. Only their most trusted vassals are permitted to serve them within the main lairs. The others tend to duties throughout the rest of the domain. The primary lairs consist of traps and alarms designed to warn the dragon of visitor and other threats. Emerald dragons prefer to quietly observe intruders and rarely emerge from hiding. If parlay is called for, they send their kindred or chief vassals to handle such duties while they watch, hidden, from cover. When forced into combat, emerald dragons prefer to attack by ambush, using stealth and surprise attacks to quickly disable their enemies. If the threat prove to be too great to handle, an emerald dragon will not hesitate to retreat. However, it will plan revenge, and its patience can last for centuries if need be. Emerald dragons have no compunctions about what they eat. They prefer lizards and giants, but they will eat anything in a pinch. Of all the other type of dragonkind, emerald dragons get along best with the sapphire dragons, often controlling parallel domains (emerald dragons taking the surface, sapphire dragon the subterranean areas below). They fear the red dragon clans because of their well-known greed, and they are usually in open conflict with the fire giants. Emeralds like the security and protection offered by a trusted partner and will take a single mate for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Sapphire dragon</u></b><br>\r\nThe sapphire dragons control subterranean domains. While most of the territory above their realms belongs to the emerald dragons, they keep a small portion of the surface area as their own as well as the extensive caverns beneath the tropical jungles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom birth, sapphire dragons are beautiful, with scale ranging from light to dark blue in color, which sparkle in the light. Because of their coloration, they are sometimes mistaken for blue dragons. Of all dragonkind, perhaps the sapphire dragon clans are the most militaristic. They fervently protect their territory from outsiders, going so far as to distrust anyone who even gets close to their borders. They work to keep their vassals in peak fighting condition, maintaining some of the best-trained armies in. As most of the territory that interests the sapphire clans is below the ground, they rarely come into conflict with other dragon clans unless they attempt to take caverns currently in use. Only the black dragons compete with them for the tropical underground, and even they are wary of going into direct conflict with the armies of the sapphire clans. Most of the demihuman vassals serving the sapphire dragons are either dwarves or gnomes, as these races have no problems living and working beneath the ground. Also, elves are too much like drow, whom these dragons consider to be one of their natural enemies. Dwarven vassals are treated little better than slaves, as the two species were once at war, and they are almost never granted the kindred bond. This honour is usually reserved for gnome only. Giant spiders make up most of a sapphire dragon's diet, and great hunts are conducted through the subterranean tunnels to find these delicacies. When a dragon lord feeling particularly lazy, it will send its dwarven vassals into the tunnels in search of the spiders. Of course, they must capture the spiders alive. While militaristic and warlike, the sapphire dragons are not quick to attack. They prefer to observe intruders (all visitors are intruders) so that they can plan how to deal with them. If drow or dwarves from another clan approach, they are immediately attacked. Others can often at least make some gesture of friendship or parlay before being told to leave. If a sapphire dragon or its treasure is ever threatened, it attacks immediately with its breath weapon, spells, and physical attacks. It uses psionics and special abilities to escape if faced with a more powerful foe. Sapphire dragons take a single mate for long periods of time, however sapphires seek to possess a mate to enhance their prestige and status more than other reasons<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Topaz dragon</u></b><br>\r\nBreath weapon: Cone of dehydration<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopaz dragons inhabit the coastal regions of the temperate islands, building lairs below the waterline, though constructing them so they remain dry. Clannish and self-seeking, these gem dragons usually want little to do with the other inhabitants of the isles. They keep vassals to fill their domain and make them appear as prosperous as their neighbors, but for the most part these dragons neither seek company nor welcome it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the egg, a topaz dragon is a dull yellow-orange in color. With the age, its scales harden and become translucent and faceted. When it reaches adulthood, a topaz dragon sparkles in the light of the sun. While topaz dragons enjoy the feel of sea wind and spray on their faceted-scale hides, they do not particularly like the water. They swim to hunt, attack, or reach their lairs, but not for enjoyment. They do love to eat fish and other sea creatures, especially the tasty giant squid. While not malicious, topaz dragons are not the best of company or particularly pleasant to deal with. Besides caring little for social graces, they display erratic behavior that is unsettling and very confusing. They dislike visitors, but tend to avoid combat if they can help it. If combat is unavoidable, they use tricks and promises to distract their foes before striking with teeth and claws (which they enjoy using). Unless it specifically interests or affect them, topaz dragons tend to be indifferent to the causes and concerns that occupy the rest of dragonkind. They dislike bronze dragons and usually oppose the interests of those clans. It takes time for a topaz dragon to accept another dragon's friendship, but once it does it remains a friend for life. once another dragon gets past its outer defenses and gruff exterior, it finds a loyal companion and ready protector in the topaz dragon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Choose your Dragon Type<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Black Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack dragon are sometimes known as skull dragons because of their skeletal faces. Adding to the skeletal impression is the gradual deterioration of the hide around the base of the horn and the cheekbones. This deterioration increases with age and does not harm the dragon. On hatching, a black dragon\u2019s scales are thin, small, and glossy. As the dragon ages, they become larger, thicker, and duller, helping it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack dragons are especially fond of coins. Older dragons sometimes capture and question humanoids about stockpiles of gold, silver, and platinum coins before killing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A black dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Blue Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue dragon\u2019s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by blowing desert sands. The size of its scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with built-up static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and sand. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems\u2014especially sapphires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older dragons use their special abilities, such as hallucinatory terrain, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the target. Blue dragons run from a fight only if they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A blue dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Green Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wyrmling green dragon\u2019s scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon ages, the scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green, which helps it blend in with its wooded surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking on creatures of any size. If the target is intriguing or seems formidable, the dragon stalks the creature to determine the best time to strike and the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears weak, the dragon makes its presence known quickly\u2014it enjoys evoking terror. Sometimes the dragon elects to control a humanoid creature through intimidation and suggestion. Green dragons especially like to question adventurers to learn more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A green dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Red Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small scales of a wyrmling red dragon are a bright glossy scarlet, making the dragon easily spotted by predators and hunters, so it stays underground and does not venture outside until it is more able to take care of itself. Toward the end of young age, the scales turn a deeper red, and the glossy texture is replaced by a smooth, dull finish. As the dragon grows older, the scales become large, thick, and as strong as metal. The neck frill and wings are an ash blue or purple-gray toward the edges, becoming darker with age. The pupils of a red dragon fade as it ages; the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to appraise an adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap decision whether to attack, using one of many strategies worked out ahead of time. A red dragon lands to attack small, weak creatures with its claws and bite rather than obliterating them with its breath weapon, so as not to destroy any treasure they might be carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A red dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>White Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten like mirrors. As the dragon ages, the sheen disappears, and by very old age, scales of pale blue and light gray are mixed in with the white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down from aloft or bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. They loose their breath weapon, then try to knock out a single opponent with a follow-up attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A white dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of cold.</span></div></div>",

As the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy until they reach a warm, burnished appearance. The grand head-plates of a brass dragon are smooth and metallic, and it sports bladed chin horns that grow sharper with age. Wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As the dragon grows older, its pupils fade until the eyes resemble molten metal orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelligent creature tries to leave without engaging in conversation, the dragon might force compliance in a fit of pique, using suggestion or a dose of sleep gas. A creature put to sleep may wake to find itself pinned or buried to the neck in the sand until the dragon\u2019s thirst for small talk is slaked. When faced with real danger, younger brass dragons fly out of sight, then hide by burrowing into the sand. Older dragons spurn this ploy but still prefer to have the advantage in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A brass dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of fire and a cone of sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Bronze Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bronze wyrmling\u2019s scales are yellow tinged with green, showing only a hint of bronze. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color deepens slowly to a darker, rich bronze tone. Very old dragons develop a blue-black tint to the edges of their scales. Powerful swimmers, they have webbed feet and smooth, flat scales. The pupils of its eyes fade as a dragon ages, until in the oldest the eyes resemble glowing green orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze dragons dislike killing animals and would rather bribe them (perhaps with food) or force them away magically. They use detect thoughts to learn intelligent creatures\u2019 intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen attacking they blind their opponents with fog cloud and then charge or, if flying, snatch them up. Against seafaring opponents they conjure up a storm or use their tails to smash the vessels\u2019 hulls. If a dragon is inclined to be lenient, ships might be merely becalmed, fogbound, or broken-masted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: Bronze dragons have two types of breath weapon, a line of lightning and a cone of repulsion gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Copper Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt birth, a copper dragon\u2019s scales have a ruddy brown color with a metallic tint. As the dragon gets older, the scales become finer and more coppery, assuming a soft, warm gloss by young adult age. Very old dragons\u2019 scales pick up a green tint. A copper dragon\u2019s pupils fade with age, and the eyes of great wyrms resemble glowing turquoise orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA copper dragon appreciates wit and usually doesn\u2019t harm creatures that can relate a joke, humorous story, or riddle the dragon has not heard before. It quickly gets annoyed with anyone who doesn\u2019t laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor. It likes to taunt and annoy opponents into giving up or acting foolishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angry copper dragon prefers to mire foes using transmute rock to mud. The dragon pushes trapped opponents into the mud or snatches and carries them aloft. A copper dragon tries to draw airborne enemies into narrow, stony gorges where it can use its spider climb ability and maneuver them into colliding with the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A copper dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of acid and a cone of slow gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Silver Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silver wyrmling\u2019s scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until the individual scales are scarcely visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when faced with highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use fog cloud or control weather to blind or confuse opponents before attacking. When angry, they use reverse gravity to fling enemies helplessly into the air, where they can be snatched. Against flying opponents, a silver dragon hides in clouds (creating some with control weather on clear days), then jumps to the attack when it has the advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A silver dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of cold and a cone of paralyzing gas<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Gold Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn hatching, a gold dragon\u2019s scales are dark yellow with golden metallic flecks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flecks get larger as the dragon matures until, at the adult stage, the scales are completely golden. Gold dragons\u2019 faces are bewhiskered and sagacious; as they age, their pupils fade until the eyes resemble pools of molten gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold dragons usually parley before fighting. When conversing with intelligent creatures, they use Intimidate and Sense Motive to gain the upper hand. In combat, they employ bless and their luck bonus; older dragons use their luck bonus at the start of each day. They make heavy use of spells in combat. Among their favorites are cloudkill, delayed blast fireball, fire shield, globe of invulnerability, maze, sleep, slow, and stinking cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A gold dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of fire and a cone of weakening gas.</span></div></div>",

They inhabit the mountains of the northern islands, living on the shores of isolated lakes and pools. At birth, these dragons have lavender skin with fine, translucent-purple scales. These scales darken as the creature grows older, eventually reaching a sparkling lavender color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese creatures approach life with a detached air, ignoring the conflicts of good and evil, law and chaos. At best, they see these conflicts as petty squabbles over inconsequential points of view, and not worthy of their time or consideration. These majestic dragons consider themselves to be the leaders of the gem dragons, and most of the lesser gem dragons acquiesce to this leadership. While amethyst dragons consider their silver and copper cousins to be foolish and have an active dislike of red and white dragons, they do not consider any life form to be their inherent enemies. They prefer to reason out a settlement through discussion and negotiation rather than through combat, but they can and will fight if they must. Being honourable and noble, these dragons never hide or attempt to ambush foes. To them, even retreating is a dishonourable action, but they will flee if faced with certain death. Amethyst dragons eat large quantities of fish and gems. They keep vassals to attend to their needs, though they do not place as many restrictions or requirements on them as other dragon lords do. Most keep at least one hidden, underwater cave for seclusion and secrecy. Amethyst dragons approach mating in a very logical manner, seeking the optimum partner to produce the best offspring. Love and pleasure rarely, if ever, enter the equation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Crystal dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath weapon: Line of blinding light<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friendly crystal dragons spend much time trying to learn about world around them. They value friendship over all else and the treasures tend to be sentimental rather than valuable, they welcome visitors who come to them with good intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatchlings have glossy white scales that become more and more translucent with age. By the time they reach adulthood, these scales become luminescent in moonlight. In the full light of the day they glow with a dazzling, almost unbearable brilliance. Fun-loving and mischievous, crystal dragons tend to be irresponsible rulers. For the daily running of their domains, these dragons rely on their vassals to keep things going. They establish domains in the cold, open northern reaches, building castles out of snow and ice. They leave these castles open to the sky, for they love to watch the stars on clear, cold nights. The white dragon clans consider crystal dragons to be nothing more than prey, so the two types are almost always in conflict. The crystal dragons also have little love for the giants that often come south to enslave the small, relatively weak gem dragons. Like other benevolent dragons, the crystal dragons prefer to talk rather than fight. Even without special abilities, they can be charming and engaging to an extreme. Gems and metal ores are their foods of choice. They mate with willing partners whenever they want, as desire and need move them. It has also been known for crystal dragons to adopt white dragon hatchlings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Emerald dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath weapon: Powerful burst of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerald dragons live among the tropical islands in the Io's Blood chain's southern waters. They are a curious species, taken to keeping track of history, lore and customs. They tend to be very reclusive, suspicious that others covet their treasure hoards and territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatchlings have translucent green scales, which harden and take on many shades of green as they age. These scales are scintillating in the light, giving an emerald dragon's hide the appearance of being in constant motion. A desire for privacy runs through the emerald clans, going so far as to determine where the dragon lords and their spawn establish lairs. Only their most trusted vassals are permitted to serve them within the main lairs. The others tend to duties throughout the rest of the domain. The primary lairs consist of traps and alarms designed to warn the dragon of visitor and other threats. Emerald dragons prefer to quietly observe intruders and rarely emerge from hiding. If parlay is called for, they send their kindred or chief vassals to handle such duties while they watch, hidden, from cover. When forced into combat, emerald dragons prefer to attack by ambush, using stealth and surprise attacks to quickly disable their enemies. If the threat prove to be too great to handle, an emerald dragon will not hesitate to retreat. However, it will plan revenge, and its patience can last for centuries if need be. Emerald dragons have no compunctions about what they eat. They prefer lizards and giants, but they will eat anything in a pinch. Of all the other type of dragonkind, emerald dragons get along best with the sapphire dragons, often controlling parallel domains (emerald dragons taking the surface, sapphire dragon the subterranean areas below). They fear the red dragon clans because of their well-known greed, and they are usually in open conflict with the fire giants. Emeralds like the security and protection offered by a trusted partner and will take a single mate for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Sapphire dragon</u></b><br>\r\nThe sapphire dragons control subterranean domains. While most of the territory above their realms belongs to the emerald dragons, they keep a small portion of the surface area as their own as well as the extensive caverns beneath the tropical jungles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom birth, sapphire dragons are beautiful, with scale ranging from light to dark blue in color, which sparkle in the light. Because of their coloration, they are sometimes mistaken for blue dragons. Of all dragonkind, perhaps the sapphire dragon clans are the most militaristic. They fervently protect their territory from outsiders, going so far as to distrust anyone who even gets close to their borders. They work to keep their vassals in peak fighting condition, maintaining some of the best-trained armies in. As most of the territory that interests the sapphire clans is below the ground, they rarely come into conflict with other dragon clans unless they attempt to take caverns currently in use. Only the black dragons compete with them for the tropical underground, and even they are wary of going into direct conflict with the armies of the sapphire clans. Most of the demihuman vassals serving the sapphire dragons are either dwarves or gnomes, as these races have no problems living and working beneath the ground. Also, elves are too much like drow, whom these dragons consider to be one of their natural enemies. Dwarven vassals are treated little better than slaves, as the two species were once at war, and they are almost never granted the kindred bond. This honour is usually reserved for gnome only. Giant spiders make up most of a sapphire dragon's diet, and great hunts are conducted through the subterranean tunnels to find these delicacies. When a dragon lord feeling particularly lazy, it will send its dwarven vassals into the tunnels in search of the spiders. Of course, they must capture the spiders alive. While militaristic and warlike, the sapphire dragons are not quick to attack. They prefer to observe intruders (all visitors are intruders) so that they can plan how to deal with them. If drow or dwarves from another clan approach, they are immediately attacked. Others can often at least make some gesture of friendship or parlay before being told to leave. If a sapphire dragon or its treasure is ever threatened, it attacks immediately with its breath weapon, spells, and physical attacks. It uses psionics and special abilities to escape if faced with a more powerful foe. Sapphire dragons take a single mate for long periods of time, however sapphires seek to possess a mate to enhance their prestige and status more than other reasons<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Topaz dragon</u></b><br>\r\nBreath weapon: Cone of dehydration<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopaz dragons inhabit the coastal regions of the temperate islands, building lairs below the waterline, though constructing them so they remain dry. Clannish and self-seeking, these gem dragons usually want little to do with the other inhabitants of the isles. They keep vassals to fill their domain and make them appear as prosperous as their neighbors, but for the most part these dragons neither seek company nor welcome it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the egg, a topaz dragon is a dull yellow-orange in color. With the age, its scales harden and become translucent and faceted. When it reaches adulthood, a topaz dragon sparkles in the light of the sun. While topaz dragons enjoy the feel of sea wind and spray on their faceted-scale hides, they do not particularly like the water. They swim to hunt, attack, or reach their lairs, but not for enjoyment. They do love to eat fish and other sea creatures, especially the tasty giant squid. While not malicious, topaz dragons are not the best of company or particularly pleasant to deal with. Besides caring little for social graces, they display erratic behavior that is unsettling and very confusing. They dislike visitors, but tend to avoid combat if they can help it. If combat is unavoidable, they use tricks and promises to distract their foes before striking with teeth and claws (which they enjoy using). Unless it specifically interests or affect them, topaz dragons tend to be indifferent to the causes and concerns that occupy the rest of dragonkind. They dislike bronze dragons and usually oppose the interests of those clans. It takes time for a topaz dragon to accept another dragon's friendship, but once it does it remains a friend for life. once another dragon gets past its outer defenses and gruff exterior, it finds a loyal companion and ready protector in the topaz dragon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Choose your Dragon Type<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Black Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack dragon are sometimes known as skull dragons because of their skeletal faces. Adding to the skeletal impression is the gradual deterioration of the hide around the base of the horn and the cheekbones. This deterioration increases with age and does not harm the dragon. On hatching, a black dragon\u2019s scales are thin, small, and glossy. As the dragon ages, they become larger, thicker, and duller, helping it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack dragons are especially fond of coins. Older dragons sometimes capture and question humanoids about stockpiles of gold, silver, and platinum coins before killing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A black dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Blue Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue dragon\u2019s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by blowing desert sands. The size of its scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with built-up static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and sand. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems\u2014especially sapphires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older dragons use their special abilities, such as hallucinatory terrain, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the target. Blue dragons run from a fight only if they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A blue dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Green Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wyrmling green dragon\u2019s scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon ages, the scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green, which helps it blend in with its wooded surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking on creatures of any size. If the target is intriguing or seems formidable, the dragon stalks the creature to determine the best time to strike and the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears weak, the dragon makes its presence known quickly\u2014it enjoys evoking terror. Sometimes the dragon elects to control a humanoid creature through intimidation and suggestion. Green dragons especially like to question adventurers to learn more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A green dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Red Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small scales of a wyrmling red dragon are a bright glossy scarlet, making the dragon easily spotted by predators and hunters, so it stays underground and does not venture outside until it is more able to take care of itself. Toward the end of young age, the scales turn a deeper red, and the glossy texture is replaced by a smooth, dull finish. As the dragon grows older, the scales become large, thick, and as strong as metal. The neck frill and wings are an ash blue or purple-gray toward the edges, becoming darker with age. The pupils of a red dragon fade as it ages; the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to appraise an adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap decision whether to attack, using one of many strategies worked out ahead of time. A red dragon lands to attack small, weak creatures with its claws and bite rather than obliterating them with its breath weapon, so as not to destroy any treasure they might be carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A red dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>White Dragon</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten like mirrors. As the dragon ages, the sheen disappears, and by very old age, scales of pale blue and light gray are mixed in with the white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down from aloft or bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. They loose their breath weapon, then try to knock out a single opponent with a follow-up attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath Weapon: A white dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of cold.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Somewhere in the many glades of the Gnihl Woodland, a small pack of kobolds drag a loudly protesting, completely naked human man through the dirt. He was shouting and wriggling with all his might, and he would be punching and kicking at the vile lizards too, if every inch of his body wasn\u2019t bound by ropes. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUnhand me, lizards! I\u2019ll have your heads for this!\u201d</span> He cries out, clicking his teeth as he tries to bite at the ropes restraining him. Already exhausted by having to drag his weight around, the kobolds seem to have zero patience for the man\u2019s cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human had the breath knocked out of him when the apparent leader of the pack \u2014 a female with paris green scales and a fancy headdress \u2014 smashed the butt of a sword into his stomach. It was his sword, in fact; the kobold had recently stolen it from him. Despite being a shortsword, it looked pitifully unwieldy in the kobold\u2019s small hands. Still, the damn thing hurt. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cShush, hyuman!\u201d</span> The green-scaled one hissed. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cOr kobolds will gut you like fish!\u201d</span> Grumbling and groaning, the man begrudgingly let the kobolds carry him back to their lair, waiting to see what they might have in store for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man\u2019s name was Harding, and for him, this started out as just another normal day, miserably harvesting crops to pay off his dues to his lord. Of course, it took a turn for the worse when a pack of reptiles suddenly leapt out and ambushed him while he was farming. You see, a group of kobolds had moved into the area recently, but unlike most people, Harding had had a \u2018live and let live\u2019 attitude towards the reptiles. How foolish he had been! He should\u2019ve exterminated them while he had the chance. They hadn\u2019t even fought fairly, instead just shooting him in the head with a slingshot while he wasn\u2019t looking. After that, they ransacked his farm, stole his clothing and gear, tied him up, and started dragging him here for god knows what reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he was awake, concussed, and thoroughly pissed off, but he couldn\u2019t fight back as the damn lizards had tied him up while he was knocked out. Harding resolved to just wait for an opportunity to break free. These kobolds weren\u2019t very bright, so it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to trick them into untying him eventually, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glances around, a little surprised as the kobolds drag him into their encampment. He had thought there were only a few kobolds here, but apparently, there was actually a few dozen! Damn things breed like rabbits. They seem to be living in relative squalor, huddling in primitive makeshift huts and subsisting off stolen loot. He\u2019d almost feel sorry for them, if he wasn\u2019t seething with rage. Eventually, the kobolds bring him to a large cave near the back end of their encampment, and drop him onto the cold stone ground. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cDere! Hyuman lay dere! No move ever, or die!\u201d</span> The leader says, before the kobolds start chirping amongst eachother in their strange language, apparently celebrating their successful kidnapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarding rolls his eyes. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cCould one of you reptiles <i>please</i> tell me what this is all about!?\u201d</span> He groans, interrupting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader seemed a tiny bit angry to be interrupted, but was too giddy to really care. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cGold! Gold! Gold!\u201d</span> She chanted, practically hopping up and down. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cWe call hyuman\u2019s family! Say if dey want hyuman back, dey need to give kobolds all dey gold! Den\u2026 kobolds kill hyuman anyway!\u201d</span> She cackles as she explains what they were doing. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cKekeke! It\u2019s de perfect plan!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarding paused for a moment, dumbfounded by her stupidity. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSeriously? You\u2019re going try to collect a ransom on me?\u201d</span> He was an impoverished peasant with absolutely no wealthy friends or family members. What kind of ransom were they expecting to get? <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhat in Syrtyx\u2019s name makes you think that will net you any gold?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cStupid hyuman! King will give many golds when he hear smart kobolds kidnappd de prince of all de lands,\u201d</span> the kobold replies, haughtily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cPrince?\u201d</span> Harding shouted, confused. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI\u2019m a bloody cabbage farmer, you <i>churls!</i>\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kobold blinks, as if surprised. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cSvabol? Is you not prince Harding?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarding practically groans out loud when he finally realized what had happened. He just so happened to share a name with the prince of the current prince of the royal family, and somehow, these moronic lizards managed to get the two of them mixed up. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHarding? No! I mean, yes, but\u2026 I\u2019m the <i>other</i> Harding!\u201d</span> He yells. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cPrince Harding lives in Curdingham Keep! He\u2019s a hundred miles from here!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s silent for a few moments. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cWhat? No prince?\u201d</span> She squints for a moment, her diminutive brain trying to put the pieces together, until she finally realized you were telling the truth. Filled with disappointment that her \u2018genius\u2019 plan wasn\u2019t going to work, the kobold looks around for a scapegoat. She quickly lays eyes on a brown-scaled kobold male standing next to her. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cGnashgab! You sed dis human were prince Harding!\u201d</span> The two of them starting chirping furiously at eachother, apparently having an argument in their tongue. The brown-scaled one seemed to be trying to explain himself, but it was no good. You actually flinch at the sight when the female suddenly jabs the sword through the other one\u2019s heart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood splattered across the sword as the brown-scaled kobold fell to the ground, twitching and gasping for a few moments, before finally going still. The other kobolds chirp worriedly amongst eachother, though none of them seem to be brave enough to defy their leader. Once he was dead, the other kobold turned to you, her eyes wide with anger. Your heart sunk as she pressed the head of the shortsword up against your chest. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cHyuman? You no prince?\u201d</span> She growls. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cDen you is useless to us!\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to plunge the blade into your heart, you shout at the top of your lungs. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWAIT!\u201d</span> The kobold flinches, her delicate ears pained by the sheer volume of his shout. This seems to knock the wind from her sails, giving him an opportunity to say his piece. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cY-you said you wanted gold, right? Well, I might not be a prince, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make any gold off me!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kobold narrowed her eyes. Eventually, she huffed as she drew the sword away from his chest, ready to hear what he had to say. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cMhmm?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tries to come up with something convincing. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cMy grandfather\u2026 he runs a meadery! Biggest meadery in the kingdom! He can get you gold!\u201d</span> Technically, Hardin wasn't lying. He just opted to omit the fact that he's never even met his grandfather, and odds are, his grandfather couldn\u2019t care less whether he lived or died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kobold raises a brow. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cHow much gold?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUh, he has\u2026 a billion! A billion gold coins!\u201d</span> You lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks confused. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cA\u2026 a billian? How much is dat?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarding rolls his eyes. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSo much gold, you could swim in it!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kobold seemed excited at the prospect of swimming in gold. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cYes, yes, yes! Gold, gold, gold!\u201d</span> She cheers, convinced she was back in business. The other kobolds cheer too, apparently having already forgotten about the dead one lying there on the ground. Eventually, she spun around, and triumphantly pressed the blade of the sword back up against your neck. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cAlright, hyuman! Where is dis... \u2018grandfather\u2019?\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later, the sun was starting to set over the village. Harding was tied up in a flimsy wooden cage, the kobolds occasionally giggling at him as they walked by. Earlier, the kobolds had him give them directions to his grandfather\u2019s meadery, and they then dispatched a scout to go collect the ransom. Chances are, that unlucky scout was never going to return, considering the fact that what Harding actually gave them was the directions to an ogre\u2019s lair. Now, Harding only had a day or two to escape before the kobolds caught on to the fact that he had deceived them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there in the cage, exhausted and miserable, Harding weighed his options. His hands and feet were still tied together, but if only he could slip free from the ropes, he could easily break out of this crappy cage. The kobolds were very weak individually, but they had the numbers to literally dogpile on him, so he didn\u2019t want to act out just yet. He just had to get his hands on his shortsword. That green-scaled female seemed to be proudly waving the thing around everywhere she went, the meager shortsword impressive compared to the daggers and slingshots every other kobold was using. If only he wasn\u2019t tied up, he could easily just grab it from her hands and turn it against the kobolds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cH-hello? Hyuman?\u201d</span> Harding hears a low, timid voice ask from outside the cage. He lifts his head, to see a nervous-looking kobold with violet-blue scales looking in athim. Like most kobolds, she was wearing nothing more than a loincloth and chest binding \u2014 the latter of which seeming to be redundant, as the reptile\u2019s chest was already completely flat and featureless. Most notable was what she had in her hands; it seemed to be the leftovers from her dinner. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI-I am Naru. I thought de hyuman might be hungry, so...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUh\u2026 okay. Thanks,\u201d</span> Harding said, a little surprised. Was she really being generous? He\u2019d never thought kobolds to even be capable of compassion. But with how unbearably hungry he was, Harding didn\u2019t ask questions. She hesitantly reached a scrap of meat through the bars of the cage, unceremoniously dropping it into the man\u2019s waiting mouth. He can immediately tell it\u2019s cooked hog, and to his surprise, it\u2019s a lot better tasting than he expected. For a couple minutes, the kobold drops bite after bite of food into his mouth, a weird expression on her face constantly. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Never seen a human before?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems a little embarrassed that he\u2019d even ask, but tries to maintain her composure. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNaru\u2026 never see hyuman up close,\u201d</span> she sheepishly admits. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHyuman is\u2026 taller den expected.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarding chuckles. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYeah, well, you kobolds are a big bigger than I expected, too,\u201d</span> Harding admits. He had always expected kobolds to be about three feet tall, but they\u2019re much closer to four, which was a little unnerving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, \u2018Naru\u2019 feeds him the last of her leftovers, sating his hunger for a time. She was about to turn and leave, but she hesitated, as if something else was weighing on her mind. Harding rolled his eyes and looked away in disgust when he noticed that the kobold\u2019s loincloth doesn\u2019t seem to cover her \u2018hindquarters\u2019 whatsoever. Eventually, Naru turns around again. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI try to say to Suzu to no hurt de hyuman. Mebbe\u2026 let de hyuman go,\u201d</span> she sadly admits, grabbing the bars of the cage. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShe no listen!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarding raises a brow. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSuzu?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe points to the green-scaled kobold who planned this whole operation. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cShe kobold\u2019s ssissth. Chief,\u201d</span> Naru explains. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cVery scary. Hurts kobolds. Might hurt hyuman.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTrust me. I can take her,\u201d</span> Harding chuckled, before leaning in closer to the bars and speaking in a low whisper. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI just need you to cut these ropes off me. Think you can do that? Then I can take care of that \u2018scary\u2019 kobold.\u201d</span> He had no idea why this kobold was being so compassionate, but she might be his best opportunity at escaping this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru seemed severely tempted for a few moments\u2026 before covering her face with her hands, turning away. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cN-no! Suzu would kill Naru!\u201d</span> She whimpers. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSo sorry, hyuman. So sorry\u2026\u201d</span> Before he could say another word, the kobold scampered away, leaving him to wonder what that was all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to stay vigilant for opportunities to escape, but eventually, the exhaustion of the day overwhelmed him, and Harding finally drifted off to sleep.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, Harding dreamed he was still home, enjoying the fruits of an honest day\u2019s work. In his dreams, his wife is still alive, and the two of them cuddle by the fireplace after supper. He can almost vividly hear her voice as she whispers sweet nothings in his ear, just like she always used to. It feels like fireworks were going off inside him as he locks lips with her, after all these years alone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he wakes up. Still sitting in the mud and filth, still tied up with itchy ropes, still locked in a flimsy cage. As he slowly regains consciousness, he can faintly see the blurry blue outline of a small kobold looking in on him. As his vision clears, he quickly recognizes her as the one who visited him last night\u2026 and for some reason, she seemed to be staring intently at his crotch area. With a groan, Harding look down to see what she was looking at, only to realize he has a serious case of morning wood. \u201cIthquent! You are huge, hyuman!\u201d She coos, a big smile on her face as she \u2018admires\u2019 him, her scaly tail wagging behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarding was reasonably well-hung for a human man, but he realized that, by kobold standards, he must seem like a goliath in the \u2018lenth\u2019 department, especially to one who\u2019s never seen a human before. He couldn\u2019t tell if that look in her eyes was disbelief or desire, but either way, the way she was staring directly at his manhood, apparently unashamed, made him uncomfortable. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUh, hey! It\u2019s rude to stare, you know!\u201d</span> Unfortunately, he was still tied up, so hiding it with his hands was an impossibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHmm? Why?\u201d</span> She said nonchalantly, as if this was the most normal thing in the world. He guess he should expect this sort of thing, given kobolds\u2019 nudist tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</span> He groaned. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cLook, I know you kobolds like walkin\u2019 around with your junk out, but I, for one, like prefer privacy.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOkay...?\u201d</span> She raised a brow. She obviously didn\u2019t understand what the problem was, but she seemed to try and respect his wishes. Once she cleared that from her mind, she perked up as she remembered what she came here for. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAnyway, good, good, good news! Naru talk to Suzu allll night, and Suzu say she will let hyuman go!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cReally?\u201d</span> He asked, surprised. After all this, they were really going to let him go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYes! Yes! Suzu no kill hyuman!\u201d</span> She chirps happily, almost jumping in place. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOnce kobolds get gold, hyuman goes free!\u201d</span> He frowned, realizing that this actually doesn\u2019t help him out whatsoever, considering the fact that these kobolds are never going to get any gold. Of course, he didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh! Uhhh\u2026 thanks, Naru. Really, I\u2026 appreciate it,\u201d</span> he said, a little disappointed, but trying his best to sound grateful. Really, he was. He never expected any of the kobolds here to put that much effort into guaranteeing his wellbeing. He just sort of assumed all kobolds were in it for themselves. Just as Naru was about to turn around and leave, Harding called out to her. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHey! I, uh, just want to know; why do you even care if I live or die? You don\u2019t know me. We\u2019re not even the same species.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNaru wants no one to be hurt. Ever,\u201d</span> she says, sternly, before blushing, <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cand besides, Naru thinks hyuman is\u2026 very, as you say, handsome?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles. A kobold finding a human good-looking? That has got to be a first. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUh. Wow. Okay. That\u2019s\u2026 flattering, I suppose,\u201d</span> he reacts. He wishes he could say the same for her, but to be honest, he found her reptilian anatomy simply unnerving. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cBy the way, you don\u2019t have to call me \u2018human\u2019. My name is Harding. Can you pronounce that? Harding?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHard-ing. Harding,\u201d</span> she repeats thoughtfully, as if contemplating the name, before smiling and nodding. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cVery good name! How hyumans choose name?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mulls over her question for a while. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUh\u2026 I guess I don\u2019t really know. Certain names are just popular, so most parents just choose one of the popular ones,\u201d</span> he shrugs. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHow about kobolds?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNaru choose own name,\u201d</span> she smiles. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cKobolds\u2019 name changes all throughout life.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOkay,\u201d</span> he says, idly. He didn\u2019t really have much else to do, and socializing with this strange little reptile lady at least beat sitting around in a cage, so he decided to ask more questions. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cDoes \u2018Naru\u2019 mean anything?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNope! Jus easy to pronounce.\u201d</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFigures. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSo\u2026 how did you all end up here, anyway? What got this whole \u2018clan\u2019 started?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks a little saddened at the question, glancing down at the ground. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOooh\u2026 dis is a sad, sad tale\u2026\u201d</span> She frowns. Before Harding could say anything, though, she continued. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBefore dis clan, kobolds belonged to cruel dragon. Dragon did terrible, terrible, terrible things to kobolds. Killed all de males\u2026 kept de females as \u2018toys\u2019. On hatching days, de dragon burned de male hatchlings right in front of deir mommas!\u201d</span> She shivered at the memory. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBut Suzu made plan! She attached a hyuman bomb to the ceiling, and all de kobolds hid outside. When de dragon came back, she blew up the entrance to de cave\u2026 trapping de mean dragon inside!\u201d</span> She smiled. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDen, kobolds come here. To new home. No more fear, no more death\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that would explain why this \u2018clan\u2019 seemed to be all-female. Harding had been wondering about that, but he can hardly tell male and female kobolds apart anyway, so he hadn\u2019t really questioned it too much. It also explains why they selected Suzu as their leader; she was apparently relatively smart and ruthless, at least by kobold standards. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSo your clan is all female?\u201d</span> You ask. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHow do you reproduce?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cKobolds have been trying to find kobold male. Only need one,\u201d</span> she says, sadly. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBut\u2026 most other kobold clans already dead\u2026\u201d</span> Kobolds used to be a lot more common, indeed, but with the popularity of knights and exterminators nowadays, they were now an endangered species. Seeing the look on her face, he somehow felt a bit of sympathy for the lizard, inhuman as she might be. Before he could say anything, though, she perks up at the sound of a bell in the distance. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOooo!\u201d</span> She coos, hopping to her feet. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNaru has to go eat breakfast! Will bring hyuman some food, too!\u201d</span> With that, she trots off, blending in which a crowd of other kobolds as they storm towards the center of the encampment for their morning meal.</span></div></div>",

There is a few rules for submissions to keep this as a high quality interactive story. Though this is an \"everything goes\" interactive (vore, sex, adventure, whatever you want it to be), we still want it to be of high quality for our readers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. All posts should be in third person. It should read like a book. Story threads that read like actual missions will be given a highlighted position on the front page!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. I reserve the right to delete short posts that do not add to the overall story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. If a personality of a certain race/role combination has been established, please keep to that. Also if a specific group has been established, please keep to that as well. A list of all introduced characters and NPCs will be listed below. Note, this does NOT mean if a group has a kobold guard, that you need to use that name for a new thread. This is just to ensure that there is some consistency among the story threads as a whole<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Please keep your posts realistic, even though this is a fantasy setting.  Posts should be somewhat believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. I reserve the right to rewrite a post if I think the idea in it is sound but doesn't conform to above. However, any rewrite will keep true to your original post, and your original post will still be listed so it is clear that it has been edited. This is a last resort. I would prefer the original author to make the changes themselves :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy the writing, and I hope you have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>FAQ</u></b><br>\r\nQ. Why do some of the kobolds seem to speak very well?\"<br>\r\nA. If talking to their own kind, or one that speaks Draconic, it makes sense for them to be easilly understood. If they are talking a language other than Draconic, how their speech is written will change<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Playable Characters: Status: First appearance: Credited creator</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>BerkBerk Clan</u><br>\r\nFlare, Male Red Dragon: NPC: 1152112: Valareos<br>\r\nKlang, Chieftain: PC: 1111: Bmao<br>\r\nSkiir, Male Kobold Guard: NPC: 11521: Valareos<br>\r\nFrill, Female Kobold Clan Member: PC: 1152: Valareos<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Monthly Post Awards</u></b><br>\r\nMarch 2016 - Bmao for 1111</td>",
