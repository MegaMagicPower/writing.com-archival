You didn't have time to waste, because today was the first day of the cookie drive. Last night you and the other girls had received your cookies and planned out your routes. Yours were waiting for you in the garage, all tied up in your little red wagon. After scarfing down a quick breakfast of instant waffles and some no pulp OJ, you hauled your little butt into the garage to receive your precious payload. Thankfully they were all right where you left them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your cookies in tow, your uniform neat and pressed, and your map in hand, you were ready to embark. What you didn't know was that this was going to be the most unusual cookie route you've ever experienced in your scouting career. But before you start, who are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, who wants to buy girl scout cookies when, nowadays, Amazon drones can deliver any pastry your heart desires to your front door in seconds? All things considered, it's an aniquated business model, kept around only because it's considered a staple of American culture. Culture doesn't pay the bills, though, so the higher-ups of the organization have recently been desperately trying to figure out new revenue streams. In the process, a few very strange changes have taken place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the scouts are being instructed to sell cookies specifically in strange, creepy areas, where anthros and other strange folk are known to live. With this change, these cookie drives have become... well, disasters, to put it frankly. Last year, a vast majority of the scouts who participated mysteriously disappeared, never to be seen again. Notably, for every scout that disappears, a very large sum of money is 'donated' by anonymous benefactors. Indeed, it seems that the organization has resorted to selling something other than cookies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like you knew anything about that! The organization had cleverly kept their involvement in such things covered up. As far as you knew, you were just going to have a regular day selling a few delicious cookies! Of course, you only had one concern; Heart Avenue, the little street tucked away in the most hidden-away section of your neighborhood. That was where all the strange folk lived, and your parents wanted you to stay far away from there... but the scout organization very strongly reccomended you sell there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to try selling cookies on the other streets first... and find your naive enthusiasm for selling cookies dashed! Not a single person in your neighborhood actually seemed to be interested in buying any cookies! Some people you know bought some cookies just to humor you, but they hardly helped. By the end of the hour, your legs were sore, your heart was broken, and your wagon was still almost entirely full! If you wanted to have any hope of selling these cookies, you were going to have to resort to desperate measures...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to walk through a forested area, pass over some railroad tracks, walk by some creepy abandoned houses, pass a ton of empty lots, before finally, finally making it to Heart Avenue. The entire street had a creepy atmosphere to it, and you couldn't help but shiver a bit as you walked down the sidewalk. Unlike the rest of the neighborhood, you didn't hear any birds chirping, friends lauging or dogs barking. All you could hear was the creepy creaking of your wagon wheels as you pulled it down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe houses here all looked way older than the rest of the neighborhood, with cracked windows and chipped paint. Their yards were all messy, covered in strange debris, and looked like they had never been mowed. The street ended in a little cul-de-sac, at the end of which, a huge, out-of-place, Victorian-looking mansion waited. Why in the world would the people on this street want to buy scout cookies? You had no idea, but it's what was recommended, so you had to give it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to start with one of the houses at the start of the street, mostly because the ones near the cul-de-sac creeped you out. You eventually walk up to the house of a...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You're a member of the Moo-Scouts, an up and coming scouts organization for young girls, and your annual cookie drive has just begun. You, a chipper, bright eyed little girl, sets out on her own to sell more cookies than any of her scout sisters! But the way of the scout isn't easy, and if you're not careful you might end up getting slurped up with your precious cookie supply! The neighborhood you live in is home to everything from peckish anthros to hungry beasts to ravenous witches and demons, and they all think a tender young girl scout would be delicious! Try to sell as many cookies as you can before you end up someone's dessert!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Characters</u></b><br>\r\nYou have five characters to choose from<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sunny Deez</b>- Age 11. Thin, blonde and sunny, but grounded. Most level headed out of the girls and spent the most time planning her cookie route. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Clarissa Pickle</b>- Age 12. Long black hair done up in a bun, needs glasses but doesn't normally wear them.  A bit of a haughty rich girl, the cookie drive is the most work she's ever done in her life<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Leona Lawry</b>- Age 9. Orange hair in pigtails, and a frail thin body.  Plucky, but a bit of a nerd. Leona is a hypochondriac and always sick, making her a weaker girl than most<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Maddie Mackenzie</b>- Age 10. Short red hair and freckles, with a slightly muscular body. A tomboy who has a habit of getting into fights. Fights that she usually loses because she's a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Polly Annabelle</b>- Age 7. Brown hair that goes down to her hips. The youngest out of the scouts, and a bit naive at that. But she's a very pure-hearted girl who wouldn't hurt a fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Important notes</i></b><br>\r\nThis is a VORE story, so be prepared for lots of bad ends with girls ending up in stomachs. Any sort of vore goes, not just oral. It can also feature other things like digestion, disposal, torture and even sex, but keep the focus on vore.</td>",
