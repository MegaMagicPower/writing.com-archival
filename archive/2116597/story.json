Not long has she worked at KITT headquarters which is a motor vehicle company but already has she found the workload astronomical. Therefore, to make a good impression she's come in to catch up on work. Leaving the car she she presses on a keypad on the door to lock it. It's a company car and has some fancy new security keyless entry. Inside the lift she selects the 38th floor, which is also the top floor. She feels pretty special getting to work up there and the view of the city is spectacular. Wendy takes a moment to admire herself in the mirror, it's not everyday the lift is so empty to do so. Wendy is 25 years old, has long black hair, fair skin and green eyes. She's of average weight and stands at 5 foot 8, her breasts are of slightly large but not huge, she's in proportion. Today she's wearing a long overcoat, it's a bit cold outside. Underneath she's wearing a business shirt and trousers, with heels. Even though it's a weekend she still figured it's best to wear work clothes. Suddenly the lift stops on level 13 and a man enters. \"Working overtime too? Inquires Wendy who is a rather outgoing girl, which is probably how she got this job in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at her for a second and checks the floor she's going too. \"Oh same floor!\" He replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy doesn't recognise him, but the floor is pretty big and hectic so it doesn't surprise her too much. \"Yeah, soo?\" Responds Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses for a moment again. \"Oh I don't work here, I hired the floor to make a movie, only time is the weekend to use an office space. Don't worry I know what you're thinking, we won't get in your way or be too distracting.\" Responds the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, my desk is out in the open, I'll use the bosses office and close the door, no way will they be quiet. \"Oh wow, that sounds like fun! I'll use one of the officers to keep out of your way.\" She responds with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay cool. By the way that coat of yours, do you mind if we borrow it? Wardrobe has been a nightmare and our lead actress has turned up without one...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy looks at him surprised of his ask, she doesn't know this guy, she hasn't even got his name yet, but he's already asking a favour. \"Sure, I won't need it inside, the aircon is pretty good. By the way what's your name? I'm Wendy\" she responds whilst handing over the coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben, nice to meet you Wendy\" he said while taking the coat and folding it over his arms. The lift opens at their floor, Wendy rushes out and waves to Ben. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have a lot of work to do, have fun making your movie, I'll probably be here all day so you're free to return the coat whenever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Shouts Ben as Wendy rushes to the boss's office and closes the door. Taking a moment to admire the view as she waits for the computer to load. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my god, why do I have so many emails, thinks Wendy as she starts sifting through the important ones. So many reports, this place is insane... Wendy lets out a sigh and kicks off her heels. An hour passes and Wendy is startled by a knock at the door. \"Umm come in?\" She shouts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slowly opens and Ben steps inside walking up to her desk. \"Hey, just wanted to check if we haven't been too distracting?\" Speaks Ben with his hand on her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I've been so busy I haven't noticed\" she responds raggedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh excellent you see our movie is about...\" continues Ben as he starts telling Wendy all about his film. In what seems like forever, Wendy becomes weary, wondering if he'll ever leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey ummm sorry to interrupt, but i'm really busy at the moment.\" Interjects Wendy with Ben ceasing immediately. \"Oh sorry I'll let you get back to it\" he responds and walks out of the room \"yeah thanks\" responds Wendy as he closes the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy continues with her work, but a good 15 minutes later she is interrupted by the door again. \"Yeah!\" She shouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens and Ben pops his head in, \"we're getting coffee do you want anything?\" He asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I'm good\" she responds and he closes the door. Another further 15 mins and a knock comes again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?!\" Shouts Wendy again starting to get frustrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door once again opens \"Oh we just started moving some things around wanted to make sure it wasn't annoying?\" Said Ben. \"It's fine! I really can't hear anything\" says Wendy in a annoyed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" says Ben he closes the door. Ugh, why I can't focus is you coming in every 15 mins, I came in on the weekend to get away from this, thinks Wendy as she returns to her reports. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnock knock. Oh come on it hasn't even been 5 mins now...\"What now?!\" She yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen enters the room this time Wendy doesn't let him speak. \"Seriously, stop bothering me, I'm super busy. Whatever it is I'm not interested.\" Says Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, look this is important and unless it's critical again but we need a favour.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening\" says Wendy in a over it fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look it's a bit awkward but our lead actresses outfit is not working at all, it's just terrible and even a post edit won't help... so can we borrow your shirt and trousers?\" Asks Ben with limited confidence. Wendy's eyes widen \"what the fuck kind of ask is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know it's a big ask, but we'll pay you, we just can't lose this opportunity to film here today.\" Responds Ben<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\" starts to say Wendy but is interrupted by Ben \"If you help I'll leave you in peace unless it's critical.\" Wendy bites her lower lip, getting some extra cash would be good and she not getting through her work... at least he'll stop bothering her then. Fuck it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you'll have to leave and I'll pass through the clothes, I'm not letting you see me in my underwear. She says. Ben nods and exits closing the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy stands up, I can't believe I'm doing this, but at least I'll get some peace. Wendy unbuttons her white shirt pulling her arms out, placing it on the desk. Now standing in a black bra in her office she crosses her arms in embarrassment even though no one is there. Taking her hands she pushes them down her sides releasing herself from her trousers, revealing her matching black panties. Now on the floor she steps out of them and places them on the desk too. Taking both garments she walks over the door and opens it slightly, keeping the door as a cover she holds out her clothes. \"There you go\" she remarks and she feels a hand take them away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that, you're a lifesaver Wendy\" says Ben as Wendy closes the door. Wendy sakes her head in disbelief, what did I just do? Now standing barefoot and in wearing only underwear in her boss's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy heads to the window and closes the blinds. Then sits back at the desk, the leather chair now feels colder without her trousers. Wendy immediately gets back into her work, hoping to get through it all. Tapping away, she feels almost liberated sitting their mostly undressed, she's never done anything like this. Wendy tries to stop her mind wandering at the thought of someone catching her. Lucky for her she believes the chance of that happening today is nonexistent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly two hours later. Knock knock. Wendy jumps in her seat, then settles herself. \"Don't open the door!\" She yells as she gets to the door and slightly opens it but doesn't peer out, instead staying behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to bother you Wendy, we have another favour to ask...\" ask Ben through the door. Wendy is trying to contain her frustration, she may have gotten two full hours, but isn't fully satisfied with being interrupted again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it now?\" She asks sharply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does your underwear look like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm excuse me?\" Responds Wendy surprised, what is with this guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they look like? You see we have a sex in the office scene to film and our lead's is positively ghastly, I mean who wears hello kitty underwear to work? Oh and don't get me started on the bra...\" rants Ben. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess you want to borrow them? Well listen here buddy, no way in...\" says Wendy  attempting to be authoritarian but is interrupted by Ben. \"I promise not to interrupt you again, you'll be free to do whatever you need to do in there\" he interjects quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy pauses for a second, the fact this jerk is asking her to get naked should infuriate her, but on the other hand he just hasn't stopped all day and she is way behind, this will put a stop to him bothering her, a promise is a promise. A little smirk goes across her face, being naked in the office and no one will ever know feels a little adventurous. Wendy unfastens her Bra revealing her gorgeously formed breasts and quickly pulls down her panties freeing her clean shaved pussy. She then hands them through the door as she did with her clothes. \"Oh my god these are perfect, thank you! We'll pay you extra for them!\" Says Ben as Wendy shuts the door and locks it this time just to be safe. Looking down at herself a sudden feeling of regret occurs. What did I just do? Circles though her mind. But she's safe, she keeps telling herself as she goes back to the computer sitting down on a colder feeling leather. Oh my this actually feel good! Time passes quickly as she gets her work completed undisturbed like promised. Wendy looks at the time, oh my god how is it that late! The sun would have gone down, but because of the blinds I didn't notice! She springs up, I better get going! Realising she needs her clothes but can't go out there her only option is to shout for attention. Running to the door her breasts bounced in splendour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy unlocks the door, leans over with the door as a shield and shouts. \"Hello, Ben? Are you there I need to leave and need my clothes back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?! Anyone?!\" She continues to repeat over and over in a panic, while she is also completely naked.  Wendy stops, she can't even hear movement out beyond the door. Biting her lip, she ponders what to do...</span></div></div>",

Did they forget about me and leave, or go to another floor. Shaking at her loss of clothes she decides to call security. They'll know where the crew went. Heading over to the desk, she sits her naked ass back down on the chair and picks up the phone dialling security. The phone rings a few times. \"Security\" a male voice answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi, it's Wendy from the 38th floor, there was a film crew up here today and they have something of mine, I was hoping you could tell me where they have gone?\" Says Wendy in a calm tone not to raise suspicion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm a film crew, I wasn't aware or have a record of one today? Did you get a name? They would have signed in today\" queries the security officer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy tries to stay calm but stresses a little with his lack of knowledge of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I spoke to Ben\" she replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben? Let me check. Well the only person who signed in today was a Jacob who works on the 13th floor. You haven't signed in today, how did you get in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I used my card on the car park entrance and parked, I didn't know I had to sign in though\" she says nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, maybe your Ben did the same, I'll check the records. Nope only you scanned in today and Jacob used the front entrance, he's also left the building hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy freaks, Ben must be Jacob, I've been duped there is no film crew. Now I'm stuck up here without any clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, are you still there?\" Queries the security officer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy hesitates \"Yeah sorry, I must have been mistaken, thanks for your help\" Wendy attempts to hang up but is interrupted. \"Wait! I need you still to sign in, it's the legal requirement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm leaving now anyway...\" she tries to say \"then you'll need to sign in AND sign out at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't...\" stresses Wendy coving herself with one arm with the thought of being seen naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if you're in a rush or whatever, you're not leaving this building until you have signed out. I'll block your exit access if I have too!\" Shouts the security officer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck! What do I do! I can't let him see I'm naked! She panics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that, you see the truth is I'm...\" Wendy gulps. \"Kind of without clothes, which is why I needed to track down Ben.\" Silence is on the line. \"It's not what you think, I was tricked into giving them to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're having a laugh right? I mean this has to be the best excuse I've heard for not signing in.\" Responds the security officer with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm serious!\" Yells Wendy, not happy with him not believing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then I'll bite, how does one get ticked into giving up their clothes?\" He queries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he just kept bothering me, and I had so much work to do, then he claimed his actress had the wrong clothes, then later wrong underwear. He promised to stop bothering me if I helped him. So I did...\" spoke Wendy rapidly trying to explain herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" He questions trying not to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, he stopped\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He stopped alright, kept his promise so much that he left with you clothes. You know how stupid that was right haha?\" Without helping himself he had to laugh, this was the dumbest thing he's ever heard personally. Wendy stays on the line and then eventually asks \"so I can go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, you still need to sign in and out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After what I just told you! I'm naked!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I come up and hand you the registry book?\" Offers the security officer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy thinks for a moment and realises he can pass it through the door! \"Sure! That will work!\" She shouts excitingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll be up in a second\" he says and hangs up the phone. Wendy hangs up her receiver slumps in the chair, her heart feels like it'll rip through her chest. But at least now once she gets the signing out of the way then she can leave to her car, knowing no one else is in the building. Not wanting to leave anything to chance she stands up in all her naked glory and positions herself to open the door using it as cover. Moments later a knock comes to the door and Wendy pops her head out to see an older man wearing a building security outfit. \"So its true! I still had my doubts\" He remarks with a surprised look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep... can I have the book now?\" She asks lacking confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep as soon as I see your employee ID\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy freaks she left her ID in the car with her swipe pass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me he stole your ID too?\" He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you believe me if I said yes?\" Responds Wendy and is left with silence. \"Alright fine I left it in the car with my swipe card\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you did... you know you must wear it at all times in the building, even on weekends?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I didn't know, can I please just have the book please?\" Pleads Wendy cowering uncomfortably behind the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, because I need to see that ID. I'll have to escort you down to your car, see it and then you can sign. After that you're free to leave.\" Responds the security officer, in an annoyed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy wants to die of shame, can't he give me some leeway? I mean seriously this isn't any other situation! \"Please don't make me do this! Can't you make an exception? Just this once?\" She continues to plead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's either your embarrassment or my job, and I don't choose my job\" he says rather sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy starts breathing heavily, with the knowledge she's about to expose herself to this man plus have him escort her completely naked. Covering herself with her arms she uses her bare foot to open the door fully. The security guard stands before her wide eyed at this beautiful woman standing naked before him, her long black hair flowing down. Squirming where she stands, she notices his name tag say Peter. \"Can we go now Peter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods and they both walk towards the lifts. On the weekend only one runs, it's some power saving thing for modern buildings. Wendy struggles to contain her feelings, wanting to cry in embarrassment standing next to this fully clothed man, who she notices doesn't stop himself from looking at her. *ding* the lift arrives and they both walk in. Wendy is made more conscious of her state by seeing herself in the mirrors and she goes a shade of red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter presses the button but neither of them were expecting what happens next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wendy focuses on the floor numbers descending in what feels like the longest lift trip ever. Suddenly the lift stops and the numbers disappear. \"What happened!?\" Shouts Wendy looking at Peter who starts pressing the open door button rapidly. \"We've stopped...\" he responds surprisingly calmly. \"What no no not now!\" Panics Wendy. \"Can you call someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looks at Wendy holding herself and panicking and responds \"no because the whip phone connects to the security desk and guess what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only you isn't it?\" She asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep... the next shift doesn't start for a few hours too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great... so what now?\" Wendy says as she slumps on the mirrors still coving herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you don't want to wait the only way would he to use the emergency exit and climb up to the closest floor\" Wendy looks at Peter in disbelief knowing what he'll say next. \"So if you want out girl, you'll have to climb\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you do it?\" Wendy says in hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that hatch above you? Well for one you wouldn't be strong enough to boost me and two if I boost you wouldn't be able to lift me over\" Peter remarks giving Wendy only two options wait naked for hours or climb out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, get me out of here!l she says angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget this is your fault, don't get angry with me\" he bites back as he positions himself below the hatch. \"Alright get on top\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy hesitates knowing she have to uncover herself. \"Hurry up\" shoots Peter. Wendy lets her arms go, giving Peter a full look at her body, she holds back tears as she gets boosted by Peter. At the hatch she pushes the release and climbs up. \"Take the ladder to the next floor, they'll be a release switch. Use it to open the door and then find a phone to call the fire department.\" He shouts from the lift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy starts her climb, the lift shaft is cold and windy, giving her chills and hardening her nipples. On reaching the top she hits the release button for floor 27, it slowly opens the door. She pulls her naked body though the door crawling herself on the floor. Huffing and puffing she bringing herself to her feet. The lights are off, she can barley see anything. Feeling herself along the wall she makes out a workstation pod and feels herself along the desk to find the phone. Picking it up she finds it's dead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course no power, and these phones need power to operate. I better get back to let Peter know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the lift shaft, Wendy holds only the wall and shouts \"Peter! All the power is out the phones aren't working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, then you'll need to walk down to the ground floor and use the emergency phone down there or alternately check the main switch in the basement, it might have tripped and just needs resetting!\" Peter shouts back. \"Okay, I'm on it! Shouts Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy follows the wall to the emergency stairs. Not coving herself she walks herself down, her bare feet are cold against the concrete steps. As she descends she contemplates escape, it's the perfect opportunity. Peter will be okay, the next shift will look after him she concludes. She reaches the car park floor and enters it, seeing it is extremely dark but has a rough idea where her car is she slowly makes he way in that direction. Thump! \"Ouch\" squeals Wendy as she walks into her car with her leg. Following the car's outline she makes it to the keypad entry drivers' side. Punching in the code the car opens and light shines out. She jumps inside with haste, letting out a sigh of relief. \"I'm free!\" She shouts as she closes the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's nighttime so driving naked home won't be too much of a risk, she'll turn the light off inside after leaving the car park. Starting the engine the beams come on lighting up the car park, she carefully drives to the exit. Taking her access card from the passenger seat she leans over through the window to swipe it, but nothing happens. She tires again and nothing. Getting frantic she keeps swiping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy isn't it working? She screams internally then realises it needs power! Hitting her hand on the steering wheel, and placing her head on top sobbing at her failed escape attempt. Eventually she pulls her head up, knowing she has to follow one of the options Peter laid out if she wants to get out of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she resets the power she could just get back to her car and escape. But she could make the situation worse. Otherwise, calling the fire department from the front desk would get her and Peter out but means more people will see her naked...</span></div></div>",

What were her options... what were her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned. \"Oh this is no good.\" she muttered to herself. \"I need to wake up a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door once more and peered outside. Absolutely certain that the office was empty, Wendy opened the door fully and stepped outside. With one arm draped across her breasts and her free hand covering her crotch, Wendy began to move between the office stalls, their walls high enough to cover her body but low enough so that she could see over them. There was no sound other than the gentle pad of her bare feet against the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a little silly as she made her way into the break area, a large recess to the side of the office that contained a fridge, a sink, some cupboards, some countertops and a kettle. She was coming to make a coffee to wake herself up, but the little trek across the office was providing more than enough stimulation! Nonetheless, she hurriedly rooted through the cupboard until she found a packet of instant coffee and an empty mug. She filled the kettle with water and turned it on, then leaned against the counter to wait. She looked over the office, no longer bothering to cover herself. She started to laugh. Bare ass naked in the middle of the office and she was making coffee! She shook her head; so ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little adventurous spark stirs within her again. Grinning, she makes her way back towards the boss' office, not bothering to cover herself this time. Once there, she reaches under the desk and pulls out her heels. She slips them on. She steps outside into the office and, hands on hips, begins to walk between the aisles. She stops at one of the desks and sits on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Madison, I need the monthly report immediately.\" she said with mock seriousness. \"Never mind that I'm naked; you just focus on your job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sauntered between the empty desks, imagining them filled with shocked and aroused co-workers. She found herself giggling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy jumped with fright as she heard a loud 'clicking' sound. Her heart thudded against her chest. It was with some relief, a moment later, that she realised it was just the sound of the kettle boiling. Abandoning the heels, she jogged over to the break area and unplugged the boiling kettle. She was just about to pour it out when she heard the unmistakable sound of voices approaching! She peered out of the break area and saw Ben in the hallway outside talking to somebody wearing headphones and carrying a large microphone. Wendy could see them through the glass doors leading outside, although neither of them were looking into the office. It looked pretty obvious they were about to come inside, though!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Wendy do?</span></div></div>",

Taking a deep breath, Wendy grabbed her cup of coffee and strolled out of the break room, coffee in hand, feeling her breasts bounce with each step, and feeling very exposed and thought that's her face must be as red as a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a peek behind her, she saw that neither man had noticed her naked stroll, but she kept walking, knowing that if either one looked over, they'd see her bare behind swaying down the office.  Taking a calming deep breath, she continued on her way, eventually reaching her office and closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down in her chair, she felt her heart pounding in her chest, and couldn't believe how alive that made her feel!  Something she could look back on and laugh at, she supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the computer, she sent a paper to get printed, but remembered that the printer was at the other sid of the cubicles, menacing she'd have to walk through the aisle that's she just came back from the break room from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a quick peek, she saw that Ben and the guy he was talking to had left, and she started her trek to the printer.</span></div></div>",

Sliding them on, she carefully took another peep outside, and not seeing anyone, she decided to continue her casual strolling through the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to herself as she walked down the aisles and past empty cubicles, imagining a workday in the nude, how her coworkers would react.  Giggling to herself, she continued to entertain this fantasy, walking past the printer to head into the meeting room, strolling around it, imagining herself giving a presentation to her boss, or an important client.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes,\" she said to her imaginary audience, \"I am kept abreast of the situation, and nothing important to your business will be exposed to the public.  We had some minor boobs (meaning mistakes), but nothing we couldn't handle, but if something too big comes up, we'll put everything in your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bowed to her imaginary audience, giggling at her wordplay in that faux presentation.  \"Maybe I should do this more often!\"  She laughed to herself as she headed to the printer to grab her papers.  But once at the printer, she saw that her papers didn't print, looking at the screen on the printer, she saw that it was out of paper.  Frowning at the thought of a coworker leaving the printer empty, she searched through all of the cabinets for a stack of blank paper, but couldn't find even one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have to get some paper from the next floor.\"  She said, eyeing the main aisle nervously.  \"Wait, Ben and the other guy had a microphon, they'll be at least four floors down, I've got the rest of the building to myself!\" She said, strolling confidently down the main aisle out to the hallway in her birthday suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may have been confident, but she wasn't stupid, sticking her head out the door, she checked the hallway first, finding it empty, she smiled and continued her casual pace through the hall to the elevator.  Once there, she smiled at how surreal this all seemed, strolling naked through the office building.  Once the doors were open, she held her head high and her chest out, walking confidently through the hallway, and down the next set of offices, looking for their printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a little victory cheer, she grabbed a big stack of printer paper and began her trek back to her home office.  Walking down the rows of cubicles back to the elevator, she felt so excited!  Never before had she had this much fun while at work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing a quick check down the hall to make sure it was empty, she walked back to the elevator, and headed back down to her floor.  \"I'm home free!\" She thought to herself as she re-entered her office doors.  Now skipping down the aisle, she felt like she was walking on air, \"Which mateches my work suit for today\" she giggled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she finished loading up the printer, she banged her head on a nearby cabinet, collapsing on the floor with a little bump on her head.</span></div></div>",

Feeling her head for any serious injury, she was relieved to find none, \"Just a little bump then.\"  As her papers were being printed, she felt like she was forgetting something, something important, looking down at her naked body, her C-cup breasts and her moderately sized bush, she didn't see anything out of the ordinary, aside from some lint that she plucked out of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My work suit for today.\"  Those last words before bumping her head had altered her minds perception of what was normal work-wear.  Not that she realized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming to herself, the black-haired beauty strolled down the cubicles counting her papers, making sure everything was there.  Once she was satisfied that all her papers were there, she put them in a folder to drop off at the mail room on her way out.  Grabbing her purse, the folder, and ensuring her computer was off, she walked calmly out the door to the main hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the show that she'd be offering anyone who happened to see her, she walked calmly to the elevator and pushed the 'B1' button, to drop the folder off at the mailroom.  Leaning up against the handbar in the elevator, she felt goosebumps cover her body as the cold metal pressed up against her bare bottom, but ignored it as a side-effect of her choice of workwear.  Once the door opened up, she walked down the sacks of mail and piles of paper that would be sorted on the coming weekday.  As she approached the mailroom office, she saw a head of blonde hair typing away at a computer screen, Janice, she remembered correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's those papers you wanted from accounting.\"  Wendy said as she offered the folder to Janice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Wendy, I'll...\" Janice's voice died in her throat at seeing the black-haired Godiva that stood in her office.  \"Wendy, did you forget something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy shook her head, \"Nope.  I made sure that's everything was in that folder you asked for.  I'll see you on Monday!\"  Turning around, Wendy gave Janice a beautiful view of her well shaped buttocks jiggling as she strolled out the door and back to the elevator to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice for her part started rubbing her eyes, \"I think my coffee's gone bad...\" she muttered, dumping the coffee in the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Wendy, she was smiling confidently at her completion of what she came here to do, and strolled through the buildings lobby, still unaware of what she was doing.  Emerging from the building to the glorious sunset, she stretched a bit in the sun, and began her long walk back to her car.</span></div></div>",

No biggy, she'd just have to go back up to her office, easy in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling back through the lobby, she didn't notice how the janitor sweeping the floor was staring at her while he swept the same spot over, and over again, watching her disappear down the hall to the elevator.  Absentmindedly checking her phone for the time, she saw that she still had time before her show came on, it'd be close, but if she didn't get distracted, then everything would be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in her floor, she made a beeline for her office, pausing briefly to double check that nothing was out of place on her outfit, she still had a nagging feeling that she'd forgotten something, but couldn't place it.  Spying her keys in the cabinet, she grabbed them and made her way back down, waving to the IT employee who'd come in a bit late to double check on Alice's computer problems.  Wendy didn't notice how the IT lady stared, mouth open as Wendy walked past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling like she'd forgotten something she tried to remember what exactly it could be, thinking back on everything while she rode the elevator down, she remembered!  She needed to pick up eggs on her way home!  So simple, how'd she forget that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent that she'd remembered what she needed to do on her way home, she walked by the same janitor, who ended up mopping his shoes as Wendy's heels clicked passed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she crossed the parking lot for the third and final time, she slid into her convertible and began to drive to the Price-Mart to grab her eggs.  She adjusted herself a bit in her leather seat, she didn't remember the drive to work being this uncomfortable, especially with the seatbelt rubbing between her breasts, but that was the 'price of fashion' she supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a few doubletakes from drivers and passengers, but she either didn't notice, or paid them no mind, focused on grabbing the eggs and getting home in time for her show.

As she was walking down the refrigerated aisle, she shivered a bit at the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must've turned the AC up in here.\"  She said, rubbing her arms to keep warm.  As she was checking the eggs to make sure that they weren't cracked, an employee nervously approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, ma'am?\"  He said, trying hard not to stare, \"Did you forget something?\"  He gestured to her lack of attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Wendy still didn't notice what he was talking about, \"Uh, no.  I just came from the office, I know I've got everything.\"  She said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor employee, for his part was trying to think of what kind of office had its female employees naked, and if he could get a job there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the boy was stuck in his fantasy, Wendy continued on her way to checkout when she realized something very, VERY important.</span></div></div>",
