It is just you and your other human partner in this line of work, and of course the starcraft's AI system, Mister Blue Sky, to keep you company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never set foot on another planet since you left Earth at the age of fourteen, having only been working aboard your own ship to start with, gaining enough experience to assist with on-board repairs of orbit satellites, starcraft in distress, to entire asteroid apparatus colonies and moon bases, by which point you had gained the experience to perform spacewalk repairs. Life in space became what you would eat, sleep, and breathe. The worlds you could see from afar meant nothing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking pride in what you do, having made your choice to devote your life to this occupation long ago, now that by all rights you are 20 years old, you have built a small but happy bubble of life floating in the endless expanse of space. However, a peculiar longing began to pull at your heartstrings. It might have been from all that memorabilia of old Earth collected from trades with space caravans or purchased at interstellar merchant stores. Perhaps this simple, and until now, what your thought was a fulfilling existence, just isn't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distress signal from an automated system aboard a deserted deep-space orbital station tasks you to embark on an expedition to repair damaged intelligence gathering machines on the surface of a hitherto unobserved and undocumented planet. Just the sort of excitement to take your mind off these feelings of late.</td>",
