You hardly notice the door sliding shut behind you as you gaze at the shelves, which are lined with some of the strangest things you\u2019ve seen in your life. Warped candles, strange idols, vials of multicolored liquid; at some point you see\u2026 what looks like a mummified monkey\u2019s hand? Shaking your head, you step further into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, a customer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jolt and turn as short, elderly man comes through a door behind the counter. He has gnarled hands, and his face sags with wrinkles, but at the corners of his mouth you see a smile, and in his eyes you see the sparkle of a younger man\u2019s energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, hello! Welcome to Everything Laid Bare, my humble shop of curios!\u201d The man steps out from behind the counter and shakes your hand. \u201cWhether it is out of desire, curiosity, disbelief: I am very happy to see someone in this store. Please, come take a look around , and I\u2019m sure you will find something that catches your eye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a variety of<b> jewelry</b> and other accessories. Gemstones that sparkle on golden chains, and what\u2019s more, they give you powers beyond your wildest imagination! Be warned though: these powers can be as much of a curse as they are a blessing. When you find yourself wanting them gone, you might not be able to part with them, and when you absolutely need them, they may fail you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe also have <b>potions</b> of all kinds. Potent things- I brewed them myself! If you have ever desired to change yourself, simply imbibe and benefit from their effects! Though I must say: as potent as they are, their effects will wear off, though whether that is a good or bad thing depends on both the tincture and the timing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe also sell <b>wands</b>, if that may interest you. The power to change the world around you, right at your fingertips! All it takes is a bit of focus and a flick of the wrist, and you will see for yourself. That being said, these things have a tendency to change hands very quickly, and you may lose your new toy. And be careful how you use them, or their next owner might turn the tables on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe store also carries various <b>relics</b>, ancient treasures with long histories. Each is said to harbor some sort of power behind it, and each is a marvel of history. You must be wary, however; some say they have minds of their own. Do not insult them, or you may find yourself at the mercy of your new purchase.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, if none of that interests you, I\u2019m sure I can find <b>something else</b> in the back room.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What you see here are just a few of the pieces we carry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a <b>Ring of Teleportation</b>, able to take you anywhere you desire in the blink of an eye\u2026 though you may find yourself leaving things behind as you go. It also has a very small band; I will not stop you from buying it, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend forcing it if it does not fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a <b>Necklace of Concealment</b>. It will cloak you in shadows, making you invisible to all. The gem itself is what holds its power, and as such it is nearly indestructible- the chain, not so much. I\u2019ve been meaning to replace it, but will happily sell it if you are interested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I\u2019ve forgotten what this one does\u2026 The label is smudged, I can\u2019t quite make out the first word\u2026 But what I can read says: \u2018<b>--- Luck Amulet</b>.\u2019 Ah, right, now I remember: Wearing this brings you a great change in fortune,  Fate itself working to affect you in exciting new ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this one is quite old- the <b>Emperor\u2019s Crown</b>. As the name says, it was once worn by a king. As I remember it, two weaver\u2019s promised this king a very special outfit, and as the king went about his kingdom, the way he was dressed was far more eye-catching than his crown. Now, it\u2019s made its way here\u2026 I cannot recall if it does anything, but in and of itself it is very valuable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere may be <b>other gems</b> I can find, if I dig around a little\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The store owner said it could teleport her, but it was obviously some cheap tourist trick. The ring itself consisted of a solid gold band capped with a shinning green stone. Vanessa could have easily paid much more for this, but she wasn't about to complain. Vanessa slipped it on her right ring finger..or at least tried to.<br>\r\nThe ring was smaller than Vanessa had thought and she really had to force the damn thing on. After about two minutes or struggling the gold ring finally got pushed past her knuckle.<br>\r\n\"Much better.\" Vanessa smiled, admiring her new accessory.<br>\r\nVanessa had to stop walking at an intersection and groaned. Her apartment was four blocks away and she had been on her feet all day, Vanessa honestly wished she could just jump straight there.<br>\r\n\"What do you say ring?\" She said to the piece of jewelry. \"Think you can get me all the way to my room with no trouble? No? Didn't think so.\"<br>\r\nShaking her head in annoyance, the intersection light turned green and Vanessa began to walk across, but was that light getting closer? In fact it seemed like the entire block was rushing toward her, with everything zooming by in a blur...and then it stopped, and she could hear rushing water.<br>\r\nVanessa had to catch her breath after she felt her feet stopped and she looked around. She was in her bedroom! But how?<br>\r\nVanessa raised her hand and looked at the ring on her finger.<br>\r\n\"No fucking way.\" She whispered. \"This can't be real...\"<br>\r\nThe rushing water suddenly stopped and Vanessa realized that her room mate, Suzie had probably been taking a shower. A few seconds later, Suzie emerged wearing a towel and nearly jumped after exiting the hallway and seeing Vanessa in the bedroom.<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Vanessa.\" She said. \"I didn't hear you come in.\" She coughed. \"I assume you want to shower next?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh...why do you assume that?\" Vanessa asked, still trying to wrap her head around this.<br>\r\n\"Well you look like you're getting ready for one...\" Suzies gaze looked away.<br>\r\nConfused Vanessa looked down at herself and saw that she was...</span></div></div>",

But past that, all she saw when she looked down was a patch of black hair between her legs; her jeans, panties, socks and shoes were all gone. She let out a short shriek, yanking the hem of her shirt down in the front to cover herself, before pausing at her roommate's confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You okay?\" Suzie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah!\" Vanessa gave her friend a sheepish smile, \"Yeah, sorry! I was getting ready to hop in after you, but, you came out before I could grab a towel.\" Vanessa forced out a small chuckle. \"My bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie didn't look convinced... but a second later, she shrugged it off, walking past her half-naked friend. \"Whatever. Don't take too long, not sure how much hot water is left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Vanessa almost breathed out, in a sigh of relief. She was keeping her expression calm in her friend's presence, but inside she was freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I-- I actually teleported! I can't believe it!</i> Vanessa's heart was racing as she opened the bathroom door. <i>But, wait. Why did I lose my pants?

Their eyes met and they looked at one another with curiosity and slight excitement, Vanessa subconsciously bit her bottom lip and began moving her leg slightly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled slightly as the guys changing made a few jokes about not meeting any nice, available girlfriends and Suzie chuckled softly as well. Their eyes both locked as Vanessa squirmed slightly and felt Suzie's breasts rub up against hers. Vanessa moved slowly but in an instant they had their lips locked, Vanessa felt the passion behind Suzies kiss and they began darting their tongues out of one anothers mouths. Vanessa then moves her leg and shifted her knee into Suzies crotch and began wiggling it, Suzie moaned softly into Vanessas mouth and began doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they embraced their juices began flowing and their tempo increased, rubbing up against one another quicker and quicker while Vanessa felt her arousal build more and more.

Their knees continued to ram up between each other's legs. <br>\r\nSuddenly, the jerking stopped and they found themselves standing in the open. Then they fell backward, Vanessa on top of Suzie, and continued what they had begun. <br>\r\nVanessa lifted herself up just enough to slip her hand in and begin kneading Suzie's breasts.

She wanted to enjoy this for as much as possible. <br>\r\nThen Suzie pulled her hand away, wrapped it around Vanessa's shoulder, and pulled her to the side. Now Suzie was the one on top, humping Vanessa's knee for all she was worth. Suzie pulled herself away and started rubbing both of Vanessa's breast's. This was it. This was the breaking point. <br>\r\nSuzie rammed her knee against her one more time and she started wailing. Suzie joined in, too, and for a few seconds, the two room mates laid together, embraced and climaxing. <br>\r\nWhen their orgasm finally subsided, Suzie fell forward on top of Vanessa and began taking deep breaths.

Pretty tacky of them\" <br>\r\n\"Emma, can we go home already?\" groaned the brown haired man sitting next to her, \"The park sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two were Emma and Rob and both were 25 years old. Emma was petite and dressed in a bright yellow sundress and white flats. Rob was taller and dressed in old jeans, old sneakers and a gray windbreaker jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob!\" exclaimed Emma, \"The park doesn't suck. You know what does suck? Being stuck in the apartment in all day!\"<br>\r\nRob shook  his head. \"Nothing interesting ever happens here at the park that's why barely anyone ever comes out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was so distracted by her revenge on her ex that she didn't even notice these two's debate over the merits of going to the park vs staying home when she accidentally walked over. That's when she started laughing. This of course caused the couple to look over in her direction right when the crystal fell off. In her shock, Emma stood up suddenly and the two stared wordlessly at the stark (naked) raving madwoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa eventually stopped her laughing when she calmed down and noticed them. <i>\"What's with these two? What are they looking at?</i> Vanessa thought. Their stunned silence really started to annoy Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"They can't see me, so why do they keep staring this way? </i> huffed Vanessa internally. <i> \"I'll give them something to stare at!\" </i> and so Vanessa quickly walked up and flipped the skirt on Emma's dress. The sudden gust of wind  raised the skirt  above Emma's hips, revealing lacy black panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BAP!</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma immediately responded with a quick swing of her handbag giving Vanessa  a dizzying bump on the noggin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disgusting PERVERT!\" screamed Emma, \"How dare you?!\"<br>\r\n\"Ow!ow!ow!\" whined Vanessa rubbing her head, \" What's going on here? How come you can see me?\"<br>\r\n\"Do you get your sick kicks like this? Showing off those boobs out in public like this!\" shouted Emma with another swing of her handbag. \"Of course I see you, I have to if I'm going to kick your bare ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Vanessa managed to dodge the swing, and Emma lost her balance for a moment almost falling over. That's when Vanessa saw her reflection on the surface of the duck pond. Naked as the day she was born. She reflexively clamped her hands to her breasts and crossed her legs together as much as possible. Blushing a deep crimson, Vanessa let out a scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know Emma,\" said Rob, \"I guess stuff really does happen at the park.\"<br>\r\n\"Rob!\" cried Emma, \"Don't look at that pervert!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I wasn't! I was only looking at you, Emma! Honest! I love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this brief distraction, every instinct in Vanessa told her: GET OUT OF THERE NOW BEFORE MORE PEOPLE SHOW UP!<br>\r\nShe turned around readied herself to sprint home naked when a glimmer on the ground stopped her. It was the crystal of invisibility! Being invisible would certainly help with her naked situation. So like a cat, she leaped for it and pounced on the crystal.

Examining the engraving revealed four humanoid shapes, looking closely it seems that two of the people are clothed while the other are nude.  Shrugging Daniel pulled it on, wondering if it really does have magic.  However as he walked down the street he didn't feel any different, no more lucky than usual.  After a while of nothing he smirked, \"thought so, no magic at all\"  But instead of discarding it Daniel decided to wear it, all in all it looked stylish despite having oddly shaped naked people engraved on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYawning Daniel pondered on what to do the rest of the day.  It was only a little after lunch, and Daniel had the whole day free.  Leaning back he thought up of some places; the beach sounded nice, a good opportunity to show off his gold.  There was also the local park, Daniel could always go there and relax.  Finally there was the party the Jack was hosting, an old friend of Daniel's thought about holding a pool party later if Daniel wanted to help out.  All these choices sounded good, though as he went through his thought the amulet's ruby glowed softly.  With his thoughts organized Daniel.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she wandered along the street, she realised she was just around the corner from the mall.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe had seen a dress in her favourite department store that she thought would match the charm quite well.  Maybe it was a bit extravagant to buy an expensive dress to match a stupid cheap rock, but she could at least try it on, then buy it in the next sale\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe department store was not far from the entrance to the mall and it didn\u2019t take Vanessa long to find the dress she was after.  It helped that there was a manikin posing near the end of the aisle.  She sifted through until she found her size, then wandered towards the changing rooms.  <br>\r\nThis area of the store was undergoing renovations, so some temporary stalls had been set up with a mirror at the end.  She chose a stall, closed the curtain and started to change.  Her shirt and jeans were hung on hooks, then the dress went on over her head.  She slipped her feet back into her shoes, then left the stall to check it out in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleeveless dress had a strap that tied at the back so it nicely hugged Vanessa\u2019s waist, yet floated over her hips ready to blow in the wind.  It had small, dark yellow flowers which almost perfectly matched the stone in her new necklace.  \u201cI\u2019m sure this is why I bought it\u2026 must have reminded me of this dress\u2026 hah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow wondering if she could muster up the money to buy the dress right away, Vanessa walked back to her stall to change back into her own clothes\u2026  \u2018Empty\u2026  Shit, must be the wrong stall.\u2019  She tried the stall next door, but it was also empty.  \u2018Someone\u2019s taken my stuff while I\u2019ve been busy daydreaming over this dress!\u2019  <br>\r\nVanessa panicked, checked every stall, just in case.  She glanced up and noticed the CCTV camera covering area and decided if she was quick, they might catch the culprit before they left the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlustered, Vanessa approached the young attendant at the counter and explained that she\u2019d just had her clothes stolen, as well as her bag with all her money, id and credit card.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">\u201cHold on\u2026\u201d  the girl said non-chalantly, she seemed in no rush to help catch anyone\u2026  \u201cI\u2019ll just call my manager over.\u201d</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Manager arrived, an older, stern looking woman.  <br>\r\nThe attendant spoke to her in a rushed whisper before the Manager turned to Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">\u201cWhat\u2019s your story?\u201d  The stern voice asked.<br>\r\nIt was clear she was taking no nonsense.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa explained what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">\u201cFunny.

What little breeze there was would funnel through the buildings, endangering her to exposure each time she crossed a street.  It was from just the wrong direction that she had to hold the skirt closed, making it difficult to walk and no-doubt drawing more attention to her than was needed.  She only hoped that no-one she knew would recognise her, see the dark blue stain, then put two and two together.

He wanted to be the first to see the effects if there were any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put it on and the crown transformed into a baseball hat, but not just any baseball hat but a hat that perfectly matched the hat he had ordered online and was still waiting for. It had the emblem of his favorite baseball team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasted my money ordering that hat. If I had known this crown could duplicate it, I would have waited. If this crown duplicates a hat I want, can I get it to change to a different hat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel tried and it took some concentration to get the crown to change but it changed into a British cap. Then he changed it to a cowboy hat, then a beret, then an Australian hat, then a Jewish hat, and then a football helmet. It could be any hat he wanted to wear. Then he tried changing it into something other than a hat and that worked too. The crown turned into a shoe resting on his head. He lifted the shoe off his head and it turned back into a crown but as soon as he put it back on his head, it became a shoe again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to wear it on my head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel pulled up his shirt and put the crown on his belly but it remained a crown. Then he tried a different approach. He put the crown on his head, changed it to a shoe, and then tried to think the shoe to his feet. This worked. The shoe slid off his head and down his body. It ran into problems with his shirt but then slipped under his shirt. It needed skin contact. It could not slip under his pants so it just stayed there hanging off his belly. Daniel tried to lift the shoe off his belly but the shoe would not budge. He had to move it back up to his head before he could take it off, and it turned back into a crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes get in the way.\" Daniel stripped off his clothes and put the crown on. The crown clothed him completely and changed into whatever clothes Daniel wanted to wear from casual to formal. It could even become luxurious clothes like a king would wear or it could become a superhero costume for halloween. \"I never have to buy clothes again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some limits though. The crown only did clothes. When Daniel tried making a watch, it looked like a watch but it didn't tell time. Also, the only clothes it could do were those close to the body. When he had tried the superhero costume, the crown had trouble foming a cape. The crown could only do towels if Daniel wore them but if they got away from his body, they turned back into the crown. The crown also had problems with long flowing scarves, trench coats, tuxedo tails, bell bottom pants, and bath robes. But the crown could easily create ordinary shirts, pants, shoes, gloves, hats, and underclothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Daniel could tell, these clothes were real. They looked real and felt real. In fact, they were always his size and a perfect fit. They were the most comfortable clothes he could imagine. They seemed real to him but they were all in his imagination.</span></div></div>",

If she happened to look down at her body, she would see whatever she thought she should be wearing. And finally, the crown itself vanished from sight, to complete the look (and prevent Vanessa from freeing herself from its influence.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when Vanessa arrived at the party with her bouncing breasts and ass on full display, she drew more than a few stares.

With the way he talked about all his merchendise, it sounded as though he really believed all these thingamajigs were as magical as he was claiming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he was just acting a little too character. Honestly, Vanessa didn\u2019t know what this shop was all about; it was the first time she had ever seen it, actually. But whatever it was, it just wasn\u2019t her scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, her eyes caught sight of the jewelry section. Never before had she seen such exquisitely crafted jewels. The golden metals glowed in ways that were unreal and the finely-cut gems shimmered with unearthly light. But what seized her attention the most was this lone bracelet sitting around a long wooden peg. Rather than being a solid band of gold, it looked more like it an intricate tangle of vines that danced and curled around each other in subtle harmony. Dotting their tips were these fiery red gems that looked much like rubies. Curiously, Vanessa checked out the price tag. She couldn\u2019t afford such a precious thing, but still she had to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty dollars?\u201d she had said incredulously. It had to be fake. It just had to be. Something like this would cost thousands. Still, she couldn\u2019t help but admire it. Even when she looked at it closely, it still seemed so genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa turned the bracelet over in her hand, she heard the clerk say something. She paid his words no heed, though. All she could pick up was something about a \u201cgodiva,\u201d whatever that was. She was just too engrossed in the bracelet to listen to any more of his mystical mumbo-jumbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d she finally said. Fake or not, it was just too pretty to pass up, and she would probably end up regretting it if she just walked out of the store without it in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy your purchase,\u201d the clerk said. \u201cI can tell it\u2019s going to suit you very well.\u201d And so, here she was, out in the streets with her lovely new bracelet in a paper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how it looks out here,\u201d she said, pulling it out. She expected to finally see the obvious forgery out in the sunlight. To see that the gold was really just bronze-plated tin. That the rubies were little more than plastic beads. And that there would be a little label carved into the metal saying that it was \u2018Made in China.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there wasn\u2019t. The bracelet looked just as brilliant in the sun as it did in the dim lighting of the store. \u201cJust what is this thing?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Still a little surprised it was so cheap, when it was quite ornately engraved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping it onto her arm, Venessa held it out to admire. Both directly, and in the nearby mirror for a second view. Her arm itched instantly, erupting as if engulfed by an army of ants crawling over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatting the sleeve back down into position, she hoped it'd restore the blood flow, or whatever was causing the intense sensation of pins and needles. Instead it spread to the whole of her body. It flashed from that one arm, to every extremity of her body in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe itching was from head to toe... But, Vanessa felt it most intensely in a couple of quite particular locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking in her clothes, she tried to dislodge whatever was irrittating her skin. Kicking of her shoes, she ripped the socks from her feet. Her bare feet were red raw.... But as watched that intense flush faded. Against the background itching, the sudden ease from her feet was a balm, as if she'd dipped them in soothing cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was intensifying, even as she thought about stripping off, the urge to experiment and confirm grew by the moment. The buttons flew from her blouse as she pulled it off too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe itching only faded once she started to remove it. The blouse hung inside out, the sleeves still keeping it covering her hands. Standing on the wildly flapping item, she ripped her arms from the sleeve. Again the relief was instant. The itch fading from her skin, and the lobster red colour fading back to her normal tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all the confirmation she needed, as she worked with eager fingers to loose her skirt... Then moments later, shimmy it down her legs. Stepping out of it, and giving it an angry scuffing kick to send it skidding across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising she was standing in the public area, in just her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa...</span></div></div>",

Standing their completely naked, quaking from the top of her head to the tip of herr toes. Eyes darting about still hunting for signs of some itching powder or any other cause of this unbearable torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa bent over ruffling her fingers through her hair. In case, that was the source of the itching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her skin fades back to it's normal hue, she couldn't help but take in her naked reflection. With nothing hidden, she felt every insecurity exposed, every imperfection revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant arrived, giving the curtain a shake to show her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay... ma'am?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure how to answer, and not wanting to risk her opening the curtain, she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... just...\" excuses failed, and she fall silent. Assured that at least she knows this is your changing room, and not to open the curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curtain doesn't reach down too far, and Vanessa was sure she could see the frilly nothings on the shop floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward hitch in the assistant's voice. \"I've brought your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand snaking around the edge of the curtain to hold it in place, she slipped it just wide enough to pass through the rest of Vanessa's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she couldn't stay here, Vanessa accepted the clothes, with a timid \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill eyeing them suspiciously, she didn't want to risk the return of that horrific itching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blouse was in tatters,  with the sleeves only held on by a few stray threads at the shoulders. It felt like the easiest thing to experiment with. The quickest to remove if that was necessary. There weren't any buttons left on the cuffs of the sleeves, as she slipped her arms in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it onto her shoulders, it was there only a moment before her back erupted in pain. An army of ants marching up and down her spine. Fingers curling into claws she pulled it back off. Sending it to the floor to join her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind whirling Vanessa hunted for a way out... out of the changing room... out of the shop... this degrading situation...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa quickly stowed the bracelet away back in its bag. As tempting as it was to put it on right now, it just seemed pretty pointless. She still had a few errands to run, and she was wearing a coat to deal with the fairly chilly November weather. It\u2019s not like anyone would be able to see it on her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went on and Vanessa finally returned home to the dorms. She lived in a fairly small place, but it was cozy, and best of all, she had it all to herself. After spending her entire freshman year sharing a room with a right bitch named Hillary, Vanessa was absolutely through with shacking up with random strangers. So for her second year of college, she went straight for a single room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging her jacket up in the closet, Vanessa stretched her arms out and yawned. Finally! All her work was over and she could now finally enjoy the weekend. Eyeing the paper bag, she smiled, knowing precisely how she was going to begin doing just that. She pulled her bracelet out, and for what had to be the umpteenth time that day, she took another close examination of it. Once again, she could find no fault with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if this thing is fake, whoever made it was an absolute genius,\u201d she said. She would probably have it looked at later just to see what it was really made of. But until then\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no point in putting it off anymore! Time to see how good it makes me look!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that, Vanessa wrapped the band around her wrist, carefully clasped it so that it was secure, and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next, Vanessa couldn\u2019t explain. It seemed that a white light suddenly flashed and engulfed her. She tried to look away, but it was all around, brilliant, bright, and blinding, as if she was in the middle of a supernova. And Vanessa couldn\u2019t help but feel a gentle warmth permeate across her very being, as though two arms belonging to the kindest soul in the world had wrapped it up in a loving embrace. It was\u2026it wasn\u2019t really all that unpleasant, to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as fast as it began, it came to an abrupt end. The light was gone, the warmth had fizzled out. Vanessa now stood in her room, just as she left it\u2026with all of her clothes reduced to a pile of rags at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what the hell?\u201d she yelped, jumping in the air in surprise. Looking down, she could see that she was naked, completely bare-assed naked. Everything she had worn was gone, even her shoes had been completely destroyed. Without thinking, she ran to her dresser to get something to wear. She grabbed a pink shirt and a pair of jeans. Normally, Vanessa was not one to neglect her underwear, but after the sudden weirdness that transpired, she knew she needed to get something on herself quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa wasted no time in putting the shirt on. But before it even reached her breasts, it fell to pieces. She was left holding only two tattered rags in her hands while the rest fell uselessly all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried the pants next. She pulled them over her bare legs, but just as they reach her thighs, she felt them suddenly grow limper and lighter. She looked on in horror as the waistband split apart and broke, as the denim rapidly frayed in a way that looked like it had aged by ten years in five seconds, and as the legs just tore away from the rest and fell to the floor. Soon enough, all that remained of Vanessa\u2019s jeans was a pile of unusable rags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t happening!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled more clothes out of her drawers. Socks, dresses, bras, panties, shorts, more shirts, more pants. No matter what article of clothing it was, no matter how it looked, how old it was, whether it had been expensive or cheap, all of them tore themselves to pieces within seconds of slipping onto her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to me?\u201d she cried, turning to her full-length mirror. A young woman looked right back at her with frightened eyes, long black hair that stood out against her pale flesh, and bare C-cup breasts that jiggled from her sudden jolt. \u201cI\u2019m dreaming, I have to be dreaming. I got to wake up. I have to wake up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised a hand to pinch her cheek so that this nightmare would end. But nothing happened. This was no dream at all, no matter how unreal it was. But Vanessa did notice one thing she still had on. \u201cThe bracelet!\u201d she exclaimed. It was still on her wrist, completely unaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo and two fit so close together. \u201cThis all started when I put you on,\u201d she said to the thing with pure contempt. \u201cThat light I saw wasn\u2019t imagined. You\u2019re the one doing this to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuriously, Vanessa ripped the bracelet off her wrist and threw it into the wall. \u201cYou destroyed a bunch of my clothes, but this ends now!\u201d Her spleen properly vented, Vanessa stomped back to her dresser to see if she could dress herself again. She first pulled out a bra, but then thought better of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter start with something small first,\u201d she muttered, taking a few deep breaths to calm herself down. She decided to settle on a pair of socks. If they broke apart like all the other clothes did, she wouldn\u2019t miss them. Taking a seat on her chair, Vanessa closed her eyes, took a few more deep breaths, and un-bunched the socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere goes nothing,\u201d she whispered, and with slow, measured movements, she wrapped the sock around her foot and pulled upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes more or less broke through the fabric and the rest of it disintegrated as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d she whispered as a sudden cold chill swept over her naked flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to put the other sock on. It had the exact same result. \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately, Vanessa grabbed the bra she had just pulled out and thrust her breasts straight into the cups. They all but split apart, the straps snapped to pieces, and the garment fell to the floor in pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She carried it in her hand and, satisfied with her work, walked over the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door to her dorm and peeked outside, making sure no one was around.

What Fran knew, that Dan didn't, was Fran's door had been busted for a short time now, and had a tendency to swing slightly back open if not held shut for a moment. So, as Dan started to disrobe, the door opened just a sliver, enough for anyone out in the hall to have a view into the mirror... Unaware, Dan sloughed off his shirt, holding it out to assess the damage, before dropping it onto the floor with a sigh. He brushed his chest, finding it damp but not wet, and looked at himself for a moment in the mirror. He didn't look to bad; he wasn't muscly or anything, but he was well built, in shape, if kind of lean. His gaze drifted downward, and he shifted uncomfortably again as he saw the splotch of soda spilled across his jeans. He didn't <i>want</i> to take them off, but... the chill was driving him crazy, and if only for a moment, alone in the bathroom, it'd be nice to get rid of that sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping them down to his ankles, and kicking them off to the side, Dan was happy to find the soda had not crept through to his boxer briefs; they were a bit cold, still, but barely damp. Of course, they left little to the imagination, and already feeling chilly, Daniel again shivered as he stood, near-naked, in his friends bathroom. Looking around, he didn't see any towels in the bathroom, and while he'd never deface someone's house like that, he couldn't even take her shower curtain if he wanted to; it was a sliding, frosted glass door. He hoped Fran had something for him to cover up with, or at least had a quick washing machine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking close to the door, Dan's heart jumped as he saw he'd left it open slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fran?\" he said quietly, taking a peek out of the crack, and then around the door. Fran wasn't there, and Dan relaxed a little, knowing she probably hadn't seen him undressing. Not that Fran was the sort to peep on people... right? Regardless, Dan needed to talk to her now, so poking his upper body out, he called again. \"Fran? Hello?\"</span></div></div>",

I've been pretty lazy with laundry so I don't have any clean ones at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan sighed. \"So much for covering myself... I was going to ask if I could put my clothes through a quick wash... but if you don't have any towels...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still do that!\" She interrupted. \"I, uh, I don't mind if you walk around in your underwear... it's like wearing swim trunks, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan looked down at his boxer briefs. seeing that it'd be more like he's wearing a speedo instead of trunks.

He figured if it was okay with her, then it can't be all that bad. He gathered up his clothes and stepped out of the bathroom, holding his shirt in one hand and jeans in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness...\" Fran whispered, looking down at his boxer briefs. \"Tighter than they first looked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, Dan covered his boxers with his clothes. \"Your washing machine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... follow me.\" She started to walk off, looking over her shoulder. \"We just need to go through the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan followed her, keeping a bit of distance between them and keeping his boxers covered from her view. She kept looking back at him, making quick glances before looking forward again. Dan felt she was acting very odd today. Almost as if she was enjoying seeing him half-naked. He wondered if maybe she'd return the favor... but discarded that idea. She may have not been too shy to see him, but she was definitely too shy to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made it to the very small laundry room. It seemed large enough for the washer, dryer, and maybe two people. \"Let me just move my laundry into the dryer and free up the washer for you.\" She said as she opened the washer lid. She finished transferring the clothes and stepped aside, giving Dan space to walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan walked over to the washer and dropped his clothes in. With his back turned to Fran, he could feel her staring at him, feeling a little uneasy. \"Fran? Where's your detergent?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under the sink in the kitchen. I'll pour you some.\" She squeezed past Dan, her hand running against his lower back. He could almost swear he felt a finger tuck under the band of his boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... you feelin' alright, Fran?\" He asked as she grabbed some liquid detergent from under the sink. It was missing the cap, so she resorted to pouring it into a measuring cup. \"You don't seem like yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" She said looking over at him, and at his boxers again. She absentmindedly filled the whole 3 cups of the container with detergent, while some spilled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The detergent...\" He pointed at the overflowing cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" She looked and stopped pouring immediately. \"Oops! Well... I'll clean it up later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that too much soap for a shirt and jeans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine. Can't get TOO clean...\" She started walking over, cup in hand. \"Gah!\" She tripped, again, and spilled the contents all over Dan's chest, stomach, and boxers. \"Oh no! Not again!\" She said, voice half dismayed, half delighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan groaned. \"Just isn't my day...\" He looked at his now wet underwear, which was dripping with soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well! Let's just wash 'em with the rest of your clothes!\" She said hurriedly. \"It's shouldn't take long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I have nothing else to wear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... I mean! I know what will help! Why don't you take a shower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will that help? I still won't have any clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can shower that detergent off while my laundry dries. I have a towel in there so by the time you're done, you should have a nice, dry towel waiting for you. I'll just bring it right to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan thought about it. A shower would be nice at this point. And he would be away from Fran's eyes for a while. \"Sounds good to me. I'll take that shower. I'll head back to the bathroom and leave my boxers out the door for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you can just take them off here and drop them in the washing machine.\" She said, rather bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What?\" Daniel was in awe at what he heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... you're here already... and that soap is dripping off you. I don't want you to slip and hurt yourself. Go on and take them off. I'll cover my eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan wasn't sure if he could believe her or not. A few minutes ago, he had to rationalize walking around in his underwear, now he's been given the option of getting completely naked in front of Fran. Even with her eyes closed, he's not sure if he can do it. Her idea did make sense from a logical standpoint... and he could at the very least convince himself she wouldn't peek at him. He gives it a little thought...</span></div></div>",

Never mind that her grin seemed a bit <i>too</i> pleased. Or that, as close as he looked, Daniel couldn't be 100% certain there weren't gaps between her fingers.... He'd just have to trust her. Taking a deep breath, Daniel hooked his thumbs in the waistband of his boxer briefs and slowly slid them down. Having his cock exposed in front of his good friend felt strange, to say the least, but he kept glancing at her as he picked them up and if she was looking, he couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you good yet?\" Fran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Not yet, just hold on!\" Dan turned and walked over to the washing machine and, hesitating only a moment, dropped the soap-soaked shorts in. Taking a deep breath, slammed the lid shut, and turned back to his friend, hands firmly clamped over his crotch. Strangely, Fran seemed to be fighting that over-eager smile from coming back to her face, and her cheeks looked flushed. Dan waved it off as being part of the awkward situation. \"Alright,\" Dan said, \"I'm gonna head to the bathroom now, and-- Fran!\" Fran startled at Dan's exclamation; evidently he hadn't expected her to uncover her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" She said, her hands darting back to her eyes, and that smile coming back to her face, \"Sorry! Sorry! When you said 'alright', I thought that was cue to uncover my eyes. Sorry!\" Dan shifted awkwardly, hands pressing tighter around his dick. He made his way over to the door- crab stepping around Fran as he stayed facing her, and carefully moved his hands to stay covered as one of them reached for the doorknob. \"I'm headed to the bathroom now!\" he said, and quickly scampered out the door and down the hallway, not even uncovering himself until he was back in the bathroom, where he let out a deep sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan started up the shower; it didn't take long for the water to get hot. Hopping in, he let the hot water run down his body, distracting him from the soda, the soap, and his friends suspicious behavior.

The steam from the hot water didn't help matters either, casting a haze over the shower door and her own glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Fran wanted to see more, having gotten to see him undress thanks to the broken door and even got to see him without his boxers, albeit his hands covering his lower region.

She saw just how busy Daniel was with washing himself, that she simply sneaked over to the shower door and slid it open a crack. In her mind, a little peek was harmless. A peek that could last a full minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly wiped off her glasses and looked inside the shower, seeing Daniel's bare back and ass. Her eyes were fixated on his ass for a while, nothing how firm and smooth it was.

She wiped her glasses off again in frustration, the steam hazing them again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments, a thought crossed Fran's mind.

That shop was creepy, maybe it was just regular soda and called a potion to keep up with the stores gimmick? Yes that had to be it, because Vanessa honestly couldn't believe that this was meant to be an actual potion, what did the guy call it liquid courage? Ridiculous.<br>\r\nRegardless Vanessa popped off the cork and took a sniff. The aroma was..alluring, it smelt natural and sweet. She guessed it was some kind of fruit drink, but for the life her she couldn't identify what it was.<br>\r\n\"I could use a does of courage.\" She chuckled to herself, taking a sip. Vanessa was nearly taken aback by the taste. It was incredibly bitter, but with an oddly sweet after taste. It certainly wasn't like any other beverage she had before.

As he opened it, and laid out his towel, he couldn't help but notice the wand he had packed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\", Daniel muttered, sitting down on the towel and examining the wand, \"why'd I even bring this thing?\" Dan held it up to look more closely, when the sight of something past it drew his eyes away. The woman from earlier either didn't notice or didn't care, but she had her towel laid out nearby Dan's. As embarrassed and slightly guilty as Dan had felt for staring before, he couldn't help but stare again as she stood there, facing away from him, rubbing suntan lotion onto her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of this stranger filling his head, Daniel leaned back, the wand held loosely in his right hand, pointed in her direction. For a moment, he felt perfectly relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he felt a jarring sensation up his right side, like pins and needles, but gone almost as soon as it started. When Daniel looked down at the wand, he noticed a faint glow along the patterns carved into the wood, and his eyes almost bugged out, as he looked up just in time to see the same glow playing across the fabric of the woman's suit. The glow faded, when suddenly, </span></div></div>",

He'd be uncomfortable wearing something this tight in public normally, but he had it even worse at the moment. While it had just been a bulge in his swim trunks, his erection was almost outlined against his leg in the clingy material. He pulled his t-shirt down past his crotch, though it didn't stretch very far. Looking at the wand, he just caught the glow fading out. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Dan thought of the word 'karma', but pushed it back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around nervously, Daniel tried to reason with himself as best he could.<i> I can just change them back, right?</i> He looked up at the stranger, who was examining her own altered attire, and at the other people around him.

This totem is of an ancient god of a forgotten culture. It was said to have stood for passion and energy.

She carefully pushed the door open a crack and peeked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the transparent shower certain, she could make out Suzie's form, running her hands all over her body as she showered. The sight alone was enough to start driving Vanessa mad, her vagina getting hot and wet. However, the curtain only showed her roommate's form and none of her features. Vanessa wanted to see more, no, everything, and waiting any longer would surely drive her insane. She decided she wasn't going to wait and go right for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could sneak inside the bathroom and peek around the curtain just long enough to see Suzie in all her glory. If she waited while Suzie was distracted, she could steal a few views, leave, and finish pleasuring herself with a fresh memory of the nude beauty. Surely, it would satisfy her craving and let her go about her day in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would be more fun, Vanessa thought, would be to join Suzie in the shower and be fully naked with her. They had just been in only towels together not too long ago, so why not take it to the next level? But would Suzie be okay with that? It seemed like a long shot, but what if she allowed it? Vanessa would just need to take that chance to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined, Vanessa pushed the door open and...</span></div></div>",

She closed the curtain behind her and looked at Suzie, or rather Suzie's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa couldn't stop gawking at her roommate's ass. The tease of it she got earlier didn't do it justice at all. She watched it move as Suzie began lathering up her front, her body tense from now having her friend as a shower partner.

She was still fighting her urges at the moment, not wanted to spoil them when more could be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sneak peek of Suzie's naked front was enough to make her want to see more of it.

This totem holds a great power that many lust after, many have searched for it and some have even given their lives trying to grasp it's capabilities. The rest of this pamphlet is magical, it will only reveal sections to you once you have experience them or they are needed to you. This totem bonds to a single person, this bond will last the rest of your mortal life and the totem will never leave your ownership unless under very extreme circumstances. This bond allow the totem to release continuous sexual energy to the owner that can only be dulled when the owner has reached their ultimate peak in pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa felt a shudder in her loins, the pamphlet explained to her that she would be constantly horny unless she reached some sort of super-orgasm. How she would manage that she would never know but the feeling that she would spend every waking moment unresistingly randy sent her stomach into knots, whether they were good or bad knots was undecided yet. She read on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First symptoms of bonding to the totem will be the inability to wear clothing, the owner will find clothing to increase their bodily temperatures and make them extremely sexual, if you wish to achieve your ultimate peak in pleasure in order to control the totem's energy you must remain completely unclothed for an entire day, if you do not reach this peak within a day of being bound to the totem the sexual energy will increase. Making you even more horny and unable to control yourself in the midst of others, if you reach a week without pleasuring yourself then your body will release all the sexual energy at once causing you to meet an orgasm more powerful than humanly possible. This however will leave you with no chance of controlling the totem and dire consequences as you will be unable to come into contact with clothing without feeling extreme arousal. Hopefully you can master this totem before it masters you, you will not be able to reach normal orgasm before reaching your ultimate peak, use the totem to help you. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa threw the pamphlet to the ground, she was not going to let some ancient rock carving turn her life into a sex-fun house.

She immediately let out a moan as the sexual energy struck her body right where she needed it most, her limbs went insane as they jumped around in arousal, she felt her body build up faster than it had built up ever before, her moaning was now continuous as the sweat ran down her face. Her back arched and she pressed the totem firmly into her sex, feeling it throb and jolt she closed her eyes tightly and rocked her entire body back and forth on the seat of her car...</span></div></div>",

Her long blonde hair had always seemed to be an attention-grabber. She had a curvy figure, somewhat on the larger end, and with a bit of belly fat, but not enough to make her unattractive. With her tight jeans and tanktop that showed off her cleavage, she was not cute but not stunningly attractive, and showed off her assets enough to draw some glances- which was intentional, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop had been worth a visit, and she'd managed to snag that interesting totem. She wondered what the history was behind it? \"An ancient god of a forgotten culture,\" the man had said. That was probably a lie he told people to try to sell it, Cindy thought, feeling a little smug for seeing through it. But it did look old and weird. Maybe she would go back and ask about it? There was no reason to pretend it was such a mysterious object anymore, now that she'd already bought it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you ugly little god,\" she said, addressing the totem. \"Go on then, do your thing. Bring me good luck, or excitement, or whatever it was you're supposed to do.\" Giggling a little to herself, he dropped it into her bag and continued to lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk, Cindy arrived at her college's sandwich store, conveniently located in the middle of campus. At this time it was usually pretty crowded, and today was no exception. It was a nice day out, but Cindy felt a little hot by the time she got there. \"Huh. Maybe I should have dressed for warmer weather,\" she said under her breath, wiping a little bit of sweat off her brow. Cindy waved happily to a few of her friends she saw in the constantly coming and going crowd before getting in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line was moving slowly, and Cindy's thoughts started to wander as she looked idly around the building. The boys here looked... unusually attractive today. And the girls too, she realized, blushing a little. She stared at one tall boy sitting with his friends who particularly appealed to her, and the feeling of heat intensified as her mind drifted off. Her body started to tingle a little, particularly between her legs, and she unconsciously started rubbing her body with her hands.</span></div></div>",

There was quite a bit of surprise from the onlooking crowd as she undid her bra and let it fall to the ground, but there were even more cries when her pussy popped into view as she slid her pants and underwear down her legs around her ankles. In a matter of seconds Cindy had gone from masturbating quietly beneath her clothes to total exposure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy started furiously touching herself now, to a mixture of disgust and amusement from the crowd. A few people looked like they wanted someone to stop her, but no one wanted to be the one to do it, so Cindy continued publicly masturbating<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was creeping closer and closer to orgasm, as everyone could tell, until...</span></div></div>",

She could feel the heat radiating out of her body and the sweat slowly sliding down. Her hands faltered, uncertain what they should be doing anymore. She blinked. \"Where...? What just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then awareness of her situation came flooding back. A nearby group of girls giggled. \"Looks like nudie's finally noticed us!\"<br>\r\n\"Well? Don't stop now,\" the boy who'd been in line behind her said, grinning. \"You didn't look like you'd finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream started and then died in Cindy's mouth as her eyes went wide and realized that people had been watching her, FILMING her, for several minutes now as she stood in plain sight, naked and sweaty, pleasuring herself. \"STOP IT!\" She screamed, bending down and hastily scooping up as much of her clothing as she could quickly get. Clutching the wad of clothing to her chest, she sprinted for the nearest door. \"Don't look! Stop laughing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe burst through the door outside. Her noisy exit drew the attention of a few dozen students milling about, whose eyes followed her as she dashed madly toward another building and into a bathroom, the laughter of a hundred other people still ringing in her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time for her to finally get dressed again with her trembling hands. \"Why... why would I <i>ever</i> do that?\" she groaned in dismay. \"They all saw me... they took <i>pictures</i> of me! Oh nooooo...\" She had left her bra behind in the rush, but she had everything else. Unfortunately her white tanktop was damp and pretty see-through. She had to hold her bag awkwardly to her chest to keep her nipples from being clearly visible. The wetness in her underwear also made her uncomfortable. She decided to take the long way home to avoid as many people as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting back, she slumped on her bed, exhausted and miserable. Her best friend and roommate, Sandra, noticed her obvious unhappiness and asked her what's wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>really</i> don't want to talk about it, Sandy.\" Cindy said, her face buried in her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to cheer her up, Sandy suggested that tonight...</span></div></div>",

Cindy became a little bit fearful, knowing that her little tease from earlier would make this time worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy shifted in her spot on the bed, unable to keep still and fighting the urge to return her hand to where it kept wanting to go. No one had noticed her behaving strangely. The room was dark, and she was sitting behind everyone else, legs dangling off the side of the bed. Cindy gave her breast a quick squeeze and almost made a very embarrassing noise, but she choked it down at the last minute. No! She couldn't start that again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet... this was much safer than before. She wasn't in public. This wasn't the middle of the day. She was in a dark room where everyone else was distracted by the movie, and her blanket protected her from view. Just because it had been a bad idea before didn't mean it was a bad idea now.

She sighed audibly, but the noise was lost under the sound of the movie. Just being able to touch herself was a relief all its own; sitting there and resisting had been agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body quickly grew hot again, especially under her blanket. Feigning interest in the movie, Cindy grabbed the waist of her jeans and wiggled her hips out of it, sliding it down to her knees and hastily returning her fingers to her throbbing pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention was jerked away by laughter from her friends. Something very funny must have just happened. Cindy laughed halfheartedly as well, wanting to seem like she was still watching. Her laugh sounded strange and high-pitched, and she stopped quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy checked her blanket for signs of movement, and was grateful to see that there were none. There would be no sign of what she was doing if someone glanced over at her. Now Cindy wanted her shirt off, though. She watched her friends carefully, waited for a moment when she was sure no one was looking, and then pulled it off over her head and stuffed it back into the blanket at her side. She looked at her friends again nervously, but no one had noticed. She had a slight problem, though. The jeans she had pulled around her knees had now slipped off and were sliding down her legs. She tried to stop them with her feet, but they slipped through and fell. Her jeans and underwear were now crumpled up on the floor. Cindy was totally naked, with only her blanket preventing her friends from seeing everything, including her hands working away at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetrieving her clothes didn't concern Cindy at the moment, though. This wasn't like before, at the store. Her arousal was much, MUCH greater now. Her hands were glued to her body- someone would have had to pull with all their might to stop her from touching herself now. She was so turned on now it was almost painful. Sweaty under her hot blanket, Cindy began begging her body to cum. She would give it whatever it wanted, she said to herself, just please cum soon! She had never been so consumed by a desire for something. If it weren't for the complete humiliation it would cause, she would have asked for one of her friends to help her. Her friends. She had almost forgotten about them. Now she begged to cum even harder, before someone noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy barely stifled a moan as at long last she felt orgasm approaching, when all of a sudden the lights went on. The movie was over, and people were standing up. No! Not now! There was no way she could stop! She did not cum just yet, though. Instead...</span></div></div>",

Afraid that her friends would see her discarded clothes, she hastily kicked her jeans under the bed and stuffed her shirt down the crack between the bed and the wall. Not really thinking ahead to how she would get dressed again, this seemed like the safe course of action. Now if only her friends would leave, she could try to figure out why she kept getting tantalizingly, achingly, <i>cruelly</i> close to orgasm without finishing. If that happened again, she really would scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, fate had other plans for her. While her other three friends walked slowly towards the door, Sandy came back to her. She grabbed Cindy by the arm over her blanket. \"Come on, Cindy!\" she said, laughing and rolling her eyes. \"You're coming, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy had no idea what she was talking about, or why she had to come, but if she resisted right now Sandy would easily pull off the blanket and rob her of her very last piece of clothing. So she let Sandy lead her off the bed, out of her room and into the hallway- farther and farther away from her clothes stashed under the bed. \"Sandy, hang on! Can you just give me a minute to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To what? Wallow in self-pity over whatever awful thing happened today? Absolutely not!\" Sandy continued to drag her along. They were out in the hallway now. A few people were milling around, and at the end of the hallway their three friends were waiting by the staircase. They were walking briskly, and Cindy felt her blanket billowing out around her and clutched it tightly to her body. She looked around nervously. Someone could have easily seen that she was naked underneath, but it seemed she was lucky this time. Just about the only time that she'd been lucky this whole day. \"Tonight's all about you, Cindy! You're going to have fun and forget about the rest of the day. Trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy groaned. Of course she trusted Sandy, but her overzealous friend was making things even worse for her. Cindy doubted she would talk her out of it, though. Sandy was in one of her stubborn moods. There was something foreboding about what Sandy had just said. All about her? Was there about to be a whole lot more attention thrust upon her? Since refusing to go seemed out of the question, there was just one thing to do. \"Uh, so where exactly are we going, Sandy?\"</span></div></div>",

I didn't even try to make you leave behind that silly blanket you're so attached to right now.\" Cindy silently thanked her friend for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were outside now, and Cindy wasn't entirely sure how it had come this far. No one had noticed that she had been out-of-her-mind horny back in her room, that she'd been masturbating only a few feet away from everyone, that she was, and remained, completely naked and covered in what she was pretty sure was no longer just sweat. Her arousal was still completely gone, which was frustrating and maddening in its own way, but it made Cindy afraid of more than just her lack of clothes. Her body was acting downright weird today, like she had no control over it. She had the awful feeling that the unexplained arousal would come back, and as before it would be even worse, as she'd been denied any kind of release twice now, pretty awfully the second time.

She smiled meekly, trying to be polite and hoping inwardly that she could escape before too long. This was a supremely bad time for her to be out in public, surrounded by people at a party. If she thought it had felt strange to be naked under her blanket in front of three of her closest friends, she obviously had no idea she would shortly be standing in front of several dozen people in a similar state of undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then something happened that <i>did</i> take her by surprise. The crowd parted, and another friend of hers, Jeanne, came through bearing a cake with candles on top. The crowd started singing. \"Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy noted the confusion on Cindy's face. \"What's the matter, Cindy? Forget your own birthday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe actually had forgotten her own birthday. Whether she knew it at the beginning of the day and merely forgotten after its unusual events, she couldn't say at this point. The song finished with claps and cheers, and Cindy blew out the candles. She did her best to appear appropriately gracious and cheerful, hoping to slip away once the hubbub over her arrival died down. If anyone was taken aback by her being dressed in a blanket, they didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the room music started playing, and most of the crowd started to dance. Cindy blended in, chatting to whoever wanted to wish her a happy birthday, but slowly inching her way toward the exit and giving the dance floor a wide berth. She was just a few yards away when Sandy appeared, apparently determined to keep Cindy from maintaining a low profile. With horror, Cindy saw that she was leading Jake along behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands started to shake, and she almost bolted for the door. Instead she stuttered, \"J-Jake! Uh, hey! How is... I mean, how are you?\" Cindy thought she heard him say, \"Not bad,\" followed by something else, but her mind was racing too much to really process his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy,\" Sandy said, interrupting her thoughts, \"wasn't there something you wanted to ask Jake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, no!

Still shaking a little, Cindy tied her blanket on, took his hand, and let him take her over to the dance floor, despite it being the last place she wanted to go right now.

Her fuzzy blanket made the skin all over her body tingle, making her crave to be touched more. She squeezed and rubbed her thighs together, trying to alleviate her desire to reach down and touch herself, but it only succeeded in making her hornier, and worsening her need to be touched. The warmth in her pelvis just seemed to keep growing and growing. She was tingling everywhere, and she felt a rhythmic pulsing throughout her whole body, feeling as if it were directed into her groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy desperately tried to get a hold of herself, but to no avail. She just kept getting more and more aroused, and none of her efforts to distract herself had the slightest effect. The throbbing throughout her body was growing in strength every time, each time demanding for her pussy to be touched- and each time making Cindy miserable with a desire to comply. She was squirming on the spot now, incapable of standing still, and breathing unevenly. Her clitoris, swollen, poking out of its hood, and more sensitive than it had ever been before in her life, accidentally bumped into her blanket and sent shivers up her spine. It was too much- just the slightest pressure on her pussy felt so good... she had to be touched, and now! Unless she could summon the will to stop herself, she had taken enough teasing that she was going to do something drastic about her situation.</span></div></div>",

He looked around, but no one was paying attention to them now. \"Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n\"Peachy,\" Cindy whispered.

Whether they knew it or not, she was currently masturbating in full sight of four of her friends, completely naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right? You don't look so good.\" Sandy continued, walking toward Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was torn. Her body still ached, and she was rapidly approaching climax, but if she came right now everyone would see her. There would be no way that they would have any doubt about what they'd seen. She had a bad feeling that waiting would make it even worse for her, though, and in any case she couldn't bring herself to stop, not when she was on the verge getting the orgasm she'd been dying for all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy was getting too close now. She held up a hand to Cindy's forehead and started. \"You're burning up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was past the point of no return now, and she knew it. However conflicted she felt about orgasming where she was, she couldn't stop it. \"I-I'm alright...\" she panted, willing herself not to moan with pleasure. \"I swear...\" She was going to get caught whatever happened now. Any second someone would notice her pants on the floor, or she would let out a moan, or she would go ahead and cum. She could feel herself getting close...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not!\" Sandy insisted. \"Come on. I'm taking you to a doctor.\" She reached for Cindy's blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandy, DON'T! My blanket...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late. Sandy ripped her blanket away, and suddenly Cindy was completely naked, exposed, and masturbating in front of everyone in the room, including two of her male friends. One hand was gripping a boob while the other rubbed away at her clit, face flushed and body dripping with sweat, her skin getting goosebumps at its exposure to the air. Cindy was completely mortified at having her privates on display to her friends. She begged to be able to stop touching herself while they were watching, but her hands couldn't help themselves. She continued to masturbate as <b>everyone</b> watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds Cindy just masturbated on the bed, no one knowing what to say, then she felt a sensation building up inside that terrified her. Cindy let out a moan full of desire. At the worst possible time, she was finally approaching climax. Her body tensed as she reached the very brink of orgasm. It was about to happen! At the last moment she tried to fight it back. What was she doing? She had to stop! She was about to cum in front of <i>four</i> people while they watched! Her body feeling hot and tingly, Cindy gasped, wrything gently on the spot and struggling to hold back. It didn't work, though. She had ruined it for herself by trying to stop, but she was going to suffer all the humiliation of cumming naked on her bed in front of two boys anyway. In desperation, she moaned, \"N-No..! Don't look, I'm gonna... I'm... GONNA...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's mouth went wide and her body twitched, once, twice, three times. As she twitched for the third time she moaned, and two tiny spurts squirted out of her pussy. Humiliated, and still naked, Cindy looked up to see...</span></div></div>",

The moment she made this decision however her arousal built, she let out a sharp gasp as her pussy continued begging for her fingers. She sat sweating as her body burned for her touch, every inch of her body began sweating for every moment that passed she remained under the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy decided to compromise her situation, stripping herself naked might alleviate her horniness and it would definitely stop her from sweating so much. Under the blanket Cindy carefully moved her hands down under the sheet and ran her hands down her waist. She shuddered erotically as her fingers moved closer to her pussy. \"If I get even close to my pussy I'll lose control\" Cindy thought as she began sliding her jeans down her legs, without being able to move her hands near her crotch Cindy squirmed more as she attempted to remove them without unbuttoning her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she successfully slipped her pants and underwear down her thighs her body sighed with relief and Cindy let out a small high pitched gasp she attempted to pass off as a cough, luckily no one was paying attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's pussy now begged for attention, with the loss of clothing between her fingers and pure arousal she had to maintain her strength to move her hands up from her waist. The sweat began seeping through her thin shirt and Cindy's body begged for her touch, her arousal felt as if it was spilling out of her, she felt her pussy moisten as she became hornier. Cindy quickly sweeped her shirt and bra off of her head without making too much noise. Carefully Cindy reached down and grabbed her pants and undies and bundled all her clothes up on the bed next to her. She lay back on the pillow and tried to concentrate on the movie but the tingling sensation within her could not be forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts heaved in her breath and her nipples hardened further as they rubbed against the blanket lying on her. Cindy moaned silently, she heard the film grow louder and louder as a fight scene began and her friends began oohing and aahing in awe of the scene. Without thinking Cindy's hand dived between her legs as she let out a hard moan, her other hand moved to her breasts and she felt her arousal peak as she finally gave over to her body's needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked away at her pussy her fingers dived inside and Cindy was amazed at what she was feeling. It was as if she was drowning in pleasure, the pleasure she felt in the shopping centre was almost nothing to how she was feeling at the moment, her back arched sharply as she drooled out the corner of her mouth. The noise from the movie topped over any moan she let out and her friends were oblivious to her waist pumping away at her fingers. In a moment of clarity Cindy decides to...</span></div></div>",

Multiple phones were recording Cindy's debauchery for posterity. A few spectators had started searching for a hidden camera, there was no way this wasn't some sort of show, they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't. And with a final guttural moan, Cindy squirted all over the floor, rolling her eyes back enough to show the white of her eyes to the assistance. Her orgasm lasted for quite a while, and as she was coming like never before, she finally realised exactly what it was she was doing and where she was doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe surveyed the room, her fingers still deep inside her, her body still convulsing in pleasure, and locked eyes with every single person there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god, no!

But the humiliation somehow added to her pleasure and got her started on a multiple orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell on her back, her legs having lost all strength, and kept squirting everywhere for a few minutes before it finally ended.</span></div></div>",

She quickly scooted up behind the person ahead of her in line again. What was that about? How long had she been doing that? And how obvious was it? She looked pointedly at the back of the person in front of her, not really wanting to know the answer. Her anxiety got the better of her though, and she looked around, dreading that dozens of people would be staring at her. It came as a relief to her that everything looked normal, people sitting, eating, and chatting, and people walking through on their way to class. She hadn't done anything too bad. She'd just gotten distracted, though she wished she had some idea of what had brought it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body still felt very warm, and Cindy was really starting to wish she'd worn shorts or a skirt. Beads of sweat were appearing on her cleavage now, and her shirt was starting to show wet spots. Her legs felt very tight in her jeans. Cindy checked her phone, trying to distract herself. The tingling between her legs was more noticeable now. Cindy rubbed her legs together subtly, growing more and more impatient with the pace the line was moving at. Twice she caught her hand drifting between her legs. Unless she was actively using her hands to do something that seemed to be where they wanted to go. What in the hell was going on? Was this still because of that boy? It must be, but she hadn't realized she'd been <i>that</i> attracted to him. She just had to calm herself down. Cindy closed her eyes, took a few deep breaths, and managed to wait it out until it was her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been such an effort to wait in line that Cindy was now seriously considering going to the bathroom to \"relieve herself,\" rather than sitting down to eat as she'd been planning. She was frustrated at the thought, though. Somehow it felt like giving up. She didn't want to admit that her libido had that level of control on her.

They began a pleasant conversation. Anne seemed like a nice girl. She looked a little older than Cindy, but it was hard to tell her age. Anne dominated the conversation, Cindy finding herself unable to speak very eloquently, but Anne didn't seem to mind. Her body was amazing, and Cindy found it difficult not to admire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" Anne asked, noticing Cindy looking. Cindy's face went white, thinking she'd just blown her chance with Anne by her lack of subtlety. She looked at her face though, and was glad to see that Anne was smiling. Anne leaned in close to Cindy. \"Me too,\" she whispered in her ear, and giggled quietly, looking at Cindy's body appreciatively. \"In fact...\" Anne bit her lip and paused. Cindy waited with baited breath for her next words, hoping they would be what she thought they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh... nevermind, you wouldn't want to.\" Anne finished, looking a little sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me! You might be surprised.\" Cindy responded, perhaps a little too quickly, she thought. It barely even crossed her mind that Anne was a girl. Even if it had though, she'd always been a little curious about exploring her sexuality, and she'd never thought she would get to with someone as beautiful as Anne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Anne bit her lip again. \"I know I'm a girl and all, and this seems a little weird... but I was wondering if you wanted to come back to my place with me?\"</span></div></div>",

As they walked along the sidewalk Cindy gave in to her arousal and started rubbing her body with her free hand again. Anne noticed this and smiled coyly. \"Eager, huh?

Why don't I help you get them off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea!\" Cindy said, a little breathless. Cindy wanted nothing more right now than to strip off and rub her body, any part of her body, against something else. She watched as Anne tugged her jeans down her legs and pulled them off, throwing them in a heap in the corner of the room, and helped by unhooking her bra and pulling her tanktop off. Anne eyed her breasts appreciatively and crawled on top of Cindy, sliding a hand into her panties. Cindy's eyes went wide as her fingers touched her pussy, arching her back in pleasure. Anne smiled and kissed her briefly before pulling Cindy's panties off, too. Cindy's little triangle of dark pubic hair popped into view, at which Anne smiled a little wider.

Kneeling in front of her was a women.<br>\r\nNot just any women. She had a dark orange skin, long fire-red hair that seemed long enough to go past her back but instead danced around her head. Her make-up seemed heavy, with bright blue adorning her eyelids and dark purple lipstick over her mouth. She was what looked like several bead necklaces, round bracelets around her wrists and ankles, her shoes consisted of pointed boots and she had two earrings; one of the sun and another of the moon. <br>\r\nAside from these items, she was naked. He massive breasts bounced freely in the open air, her pussy was clean shaven, and her magnificently round bare ass seemed to stick outward as she stayed kneeling in front of Vanessa.<br>\r\nThe girl had to catch her breath and look around, the park was mostly empty and it seemed like her spot was secluded enough for nobody to see what was going on, namely that there was a strange naked women kneeling in the grass. Suddenly the women spoke.<br>\r\n\"I greet you mistress.\" Her voice was surprisingly deep, yet smooth. \"I am the Genie of the lamp, how might I aid you?\"<br>\r\nVanessa simply stared slack-jawed at what was going on. After what felt like an eternity, in which neither figure spoke Vanessa finally found courage to ask a question.<br>\r\n\"W-why are you naked?\" Admittedly, the nakedness should have been the least of Vanessa's worries, considering this 'genie' literally exploded out of nowhere, but Vanessa was to confused by the whole affair to think of any other questions.<br>\r\n\"I am this way because my previous master wished it.\" The genie replied stoically.<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Vanessa's mind continued to race but some proper questions seemed to finally be forming in her brain. \"Alright..uh so do you grant me a wish or something?\"<br>\r\nThe genie looked up at the confused young women. She had not been expecting her new mistress to be so ignorant.<br>\r\n\"That is correct. I will grant any wish that you desire, speak it at your leisure.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Vanessa took a deep breath. She looked at the naked genie up and down, part of her wanted this women to put some pants on. Vanessa also looked at her hot dog wrapper, she was till hungry. But it had also been a long day and Vanessa really wanted to go home...<br>\r\n\"Genies, I have a wish.\" Vanessa said, hearing this the genie stood up, making not attempt to cover herself. \"I wish that...\"</span></div></div>",

She was indeed still naked, and now, thanks to the genie, completely wet on top of it. Her eyes ran along the wide beach before them, an expression of utter shock crossing her face. She saw people, hundreds of people, men, women, children, plenty of families. She wasn't even lucky enough to have ended up at a nude beach, as the swimsuits all confirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about 10 feet away from the beach, a far enough distance so that no one would realize she was involuntarily skinny dipping. However she couldn't stay in the ocean all day, nor keep people from swimming towards where she floated.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Vanessa knew it, the park setting she was sitting in was switched to something a lot less outdoorsy and a little more private. She looked around and saw several lockers in front and behind her, her bare feet feeling the chill of tile floor, and her ass pained by the hard, plastic bench she was sitting on. \"She teleported me...\" She thought to herself, turning her head and seeing a room with open showers a short distance away. \"From the looks of it, this is a locker room...\" She also noted how quiet it was, meaning that she was currently the only person occupying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around once more and, feeling a little more assured, removed her hands and arms from her privates. Her breasts bounced slightly as she stood to her feet and her trimmed pussy was allowed to be exposed. \"Well... she didn't 'fix' my nudity...\" She thought to herself. \"But at least I'm in a place where I can be naked...\" She started to search the lockers. \"Still..., I'd rather not be here all day. I need to find something to wear and get out of here...\" She rationalized that while some poor woman would be losing her street clothes for some time, at least that woman would have work out clothes to continue wearing, while Vanessa was stuck with no clothes at all. She could just turn them into lost and found when she was done with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally found a black gym bag and pulled it out. She set it on the bench and examined it's contents. She found a large gray t-shirt featuring a heavy metal band she wasn't familiar with. Following that, a pair of jeans which, like the shirt, would be too big for her to wear. \"Must be a really tall woman...\" She whispered to herself. The last thing that caught her eye, and stunned her, was the pair of striped boxers at the bottom of the bag. After just a brief moment of thinking, it dawned on her. \"This is a man's bag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to another part of the locker room, stalls and urinals greeting her. \"This isn't happening!\" She said to herself as she approached the door, pulling it in slightly to examine the sign on it. Her face blushed beet red when she read it... 'Boys' Locker Room.' She looked outside and could see an empty basketball court with the team logo proudly painted in the center. A logo belonging to a local high school basketball team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the door and backed away from it. \"She... She teleported me to a high school boys' locker room?!\" She said in a shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa gasped in surprised when she heard the genie's voice again. She once again covered her breasts and crotch with her arms and hands and turned around. Standing before her, still wearing the clothes she lifted right off of Vanessa, was the genie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wished me to fix your nudity. While I couldn't grant you clothes due to my inexperience with your modern culture, I can teleport you to the closest location where nudity is acceptable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But why here?!\" Vanessa asked loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my understanding that this type of establishment allows for group bathing, so it is only natural that nudity would be permitted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! For boys! Not girls! Why couldn't you send me to the girls' locker room instead?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you, this is the closest location where nudity is acceptable. Are you informing me that males and females now bathe in separate spaces?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! They do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You humans have a tendency to over complicate things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me back my clothes! I don't care if you run around naked all the time, but I'm not going to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...\" The genie waved her hand, trying to return the clothes she wore to their rightful owner. \"... It seems we have a little issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what issue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There seems to be something about this building. It is greatly reducing the strength of my powers and making it impossible for me to grant your current wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need magic to do that! Just take them off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that. I can only grant wishes, and need my magic to grant said wishes. Any other action that would not require me to use magic is strictly prohibited, lest the very cosmos be devastated by such irresponsibility. Until my magic is returned to full strength, I cannot give you back your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you say we over complicate things...\" Vanessa scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rules are rules, mistress. I do believe if I was outside this dwelling, my powers will return and I can resume granting your wishes. Fortunately, I have enough power to teleport myself outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?!\" Vanessa whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will wait for you outside. Once we meet again, I am certain I can return you your clothes.\" The genie's body started to shine. \"I will see you soon.\" With a flash of light, she vanished, leaving Vanessa alone once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to get outside like this?!\" She shouted into the air. Without any other options, she realized that in order to get out of this mess, she would need to somehow get outside so the genie could grant her wishes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... I hate PE before lunch...\" A teen boy could be heard complaining outside. \"Nothing spoils my appetite more than seeing you freaks in the shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you're a sight to see...\" Another teen boy retorted. \"Let's just make it quick so we can get to the cafeteria. We beat the rest of the team here so we should be the first ones to shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa bolted away from the door, heading back to the lockers. Here she was, completely naked while an entire team of teenage boys were about to walk in and no doubt notice her. She thought up something to do to help her avoid that situation:</span></div></div>",

Afterwards I will need to rest for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For how long?\" Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know; I have never attempted such a task. I would estimate somewhere between an hour and a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa bit her lip.

Do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Genie waved her hand. Almost immediately she sagged at the shoulders and her breathing became heavy, like she'd ran a marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is done.\" she breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solid outline of The Genie became vague, as if she were fading somehow. Gradually the Genie began to turn into a cloud of smoke, and as she did so was sucked back into the lamp from hence she came. After a few moments Vanessa found herself alone in the room. Eager to see the changes herself, Vanessa threw open her wardrobe and gave a shiver of excitement as she realised it was empty. <i>I really have gotten rid of all clothes in the world!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the few short steps to the window, which had the curtains drawn. She took a deep breath, grabbed hold of the curtains and flung them wide open. She closed her eyes and savoured the warmth of the sun on her bare naked body. With a satisfied sigh she let out her breath and, feeling relaxed, opened her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately something on the street below caught her eye. Right outside her house on the sidewalk below stood a teenage boy with his bike. In one hand he held the bike chain, clearly trying to repair it, but what caught Vanessa's attention the most was that he was <b>fully clothed!</b> And he was looking right at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Vanessa!\" he shouted up, giving a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa stood dumbfounded, every inch of her body exposed to the boy, unable to move. After what felt like an eternity she threw the curtains closed, plunging the room into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart racing with panic, Vanessa picked up the TV remote and pressed the power button. The wide, toothy smile of a newsreader appeared on the screen. He, too, was fully dressed, but in a suit and tie. She felt a cold ball of fear settle in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done?\" she snapped at the lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...mistress?\" came a faint reply from within. Vanessa sat on the couch and peered into the lamp's spout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on? I thought I told you to get rid of the world's clothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... you asked that... nudity be... acceptable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand; what's the difference!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having blonde hair is... is socially acceptable, mistress, but... it is not mandatory. There will be those who choose nudity and those who do not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated with the situation, and her own stupidity with it, Vanessa threw the lamp at the couch in frustration. She leaned forward and put her head in her hands. <i>So all I've done is get rid of my own clothing.</i> she thought bleakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked up sharply. She hadn't heard her mother climbing the stairs, and now she stood in her doorway dressed in a yoga pants and a t-shirt staring at her daughter with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess...\" Vanessa replied, feeling a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother's gaze moved between the open and empty wardrobe and her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you looking for your clothes?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa replied that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come? You don't normally wear clothes during the summer. Are you feeling well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother sat on the couch beside her and placed her hand on her daughter's head. \"You don't feel cold...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... wait, you mean I wear clothes during the winter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course dear. You'd freeze to death otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa felt a surge of elation run through her. \"Where are they? My winter clothes, I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the garage, dear; where we always keep them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa couldn't help but smile. Clothes! She could grab them, get dressed and then go explore the city, see which type of people partook in nudity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But wait...</i> she thought. The garage was detached from the house, meaning that she'd have to walk out onto the front lawn, visible from the entire street, and get into the garage that way. That would be pretty embarrassing, but... what was her other choice? Just stay in the house all day in the buff?</span></div></div>",

She waited there a few moments, her toes curling in the dirt and she nervously waited for somebody to pass by.

Just one person to cry out, to ask her what she was doing, or to gawp at her wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she stepped out onto the sidewalk, the concrete hard and rough beneath her feet.

It was embarrassing, yes, but also a little thrilling. Maybe she didn't need to go back inside straight away. Maybe she could take a little stroll around the block. After all, as far as she was concerned, there was nothing wrong with that...</span></div></div>",

The late-morning Sun and cool breeze kissed her skin and, for the first time since picking up the Genie's lamp, started to feel good. Glancing back at the lamp, Vanessa decided to take advantage of one wish before accidentally ruining it with another, and left it sitting in the garage as she strolled, buck naked, down her driveway. The Genie needed a few hours to fix the situation, after all; the lamp would be there when she came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blacktop was a little uncomfortable under her bare feet, but Vanessa got used to it soon enough. Besides, she had other sensations to worry about- her pounding heart, for one, and the summer air on her naked skin for another. The neighborhood was empty at this sleepy point in the morning; if it wasn't though, Vanessa would have seen her mistake, ignorant as she was to the Genie's unconscious condition. More luckily for her, there was no one there to see the naked pedestrian either, though Vanessa's heart still fluttered a bit every time she thought she saw movement silhouetted in a window. No, Vanessa didn't see anyone, and if anyone saw her exhibitionist excursion, she didn't know about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiddily grinning to herself, and putting a shimmy into her stride, Vanessa was enjoying this newfound freedom from fabrics, when she suddenly found her heart dropping, as...</span></div></div>",

The lamp she bought was an impulse buy, although as somebody who appreciated fine arts, Ivory admitted she really liked it. She, 42 year old Ivory, her shopping done for the day went home to her empty house, it was the long weekend and her kids were with their lowlife cheating father, as much as Ivory loved those kids she admitted the quiet weekends felt really good and relaxing especially after a long week.<br>\r\nThroughout the rest of the evening Ivory went about her normal routine. Cooking, eating, washing and cleaning...but throughout the whole time she constantly had the lamp with her. Ivory couldn't explain it but she felt an odd attachment to it, and had the strangest feeling that it felt the same way. Even after finishing up and drawing herself a bath, Ivory felt the need to bring the lamp into the bathroom with her.<br>\r\nAfter pouring the water and filling the bath up with bubbles, Ivory stripped down. before stepping in she glanced at her naked self in the mirror. Her D-cup breasts still full, yet starting to show signs that gravity was taking over. Her stomach was not as flat as it used to be and had a noticeable jiggle to it. Her ass was big and round, to some impressive and her muff full and bushy (she gave up keeping it neat and shaven after the divorce) and her legs were still long and slender, yet Ivory still felt it wasn't enough. It was a body many younger girls would clamor for, but for Ivory it was just age getting ready to catch her.<br>\r\nFinally Ivory stepped into the hot bath, the bubbles covering her completely. After a couple minutes of soaking she picked up the lamp again and examined it.<br>\r\n\"What are you.\" She mumbled. \"Why do you keep bugging me.\"<br>\r\nAs if in response to her question, the lamp glowed slightly. Then whether taken by surprise, or simply mishandling the met object with wet hands, the lamp slipped from Ivory's fingers and splashed into the bath water.<br>\r\nBefore she could react the water glowed blue and one loud BANG later, the blue jet of energy emerged from the underwater lamp and landed with yet another loud BANG on the bathroom floor. In one instant there was nothing but checkered tile. In the next, there was a young beautiful naked women standing over Ivory. Her massive mane of bright red hair seemed to dance all over her body, her skin was pale and white, her eyes a magnificent shade of blue, her breasts massive (two cup sizes higher than Ivory's at least) and her whole body unblemished and perfect.<br>\r\n\"Wowee!\" The strange women exclaimed, cracking her neck. \"I've been stuck in that thing for a loooooooooooooooong ass time.\" Really makes you stiff.\"<br>\r\nIvory's jaw dropped, and it stayed that way as the women began doing stretches.<br>\r\n\"I'm the Genie by the way.\" She said as she stretched. \"Genie of the lamp, granted of wishes, powerful immortal Demi-God. All that jazz. And \"<br>\r\n\"G-Genie.\" Ivory repeated. \"Like from Aladdin?\"<br>\r\nThe genie let out a laugh. \"Oh please, don't compare me to that sellout. I have principles, and don't get paid to be voiced with Robin Williams that's just embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n\"So you have to grant me wishes now...right?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course. Being that you're my new master and all.I already like you, the last three guys were all 'get down on your knees' before I said a word. Still got the pains\" Genie rubbed her backside. \"But I did it anyway cause I had a connection to them and they to me, just like now.\"<br>\r\n\"Connection?\" Ivory blinked \"We don't have a connection.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure we do!\" Genie exclaimed, getting on her knees and sitting next to the bath tub. \"You felt it. It's why you carried the lamp everywhere after you bought it,and why you have no problem talking to me knowing full well I can see all your lady bits. Nice bush by the way, don't see the natural look very often.\"<br>\r\nIvory realized at that moment that she was indeed still naked and that most of the bubbles had vanished after he Genies stunt. She quickly covered herself with her hands underwater.<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it!\" Genie said, slapping Ivory on the back. \"You look great, and frankly most of my masters were nude when they first met me. Anyway You got a wish?\"<br>\r\n\"I can wish for anything right?\" Ivory asked, still uncertain. \"Three times?\"<br>\r\n\"Three? That is so cliche.\" The genie rolled her eyes. \"You get five from me. But there are rules. The first is no wishing for more wishes, second, you cannot use a wish to undo the previous wish. So no asking for blonde hair and then trying to change it back with the wish after, doesn't work that way. Although you could wish for blonde, wish for red, and then wish for natural again but that would be a waste of three wishes. Finally, I can't grant the ability for other people to make wishes.

It was no secret that many male (and some female) students hoped that she would one day volunteer herself as a nude model.<br>\r\n\"Miss crane!\" Dan said, entering the classroom and weaving himself through the unfinished sculptures and almost snagging himself on a pointy end..<br>\r\n\"Ah, Daniel.\" Miss Crane said surprised, looking up from her papers. \"This is a surprise. What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could check out some art for me.\" Dan said, taking out the statuette.<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Miss crane took the small art piece from Dan and examined it, her eyes wide with curiosity and...attraction? \"Where did you come across this?\"<br>\r\nDan told her where he found it and strange tale that the shop keeper told and how much he paid for it. After he finished, Miss crane burst out laughing.<br>\r\n\"Oh my dear boy, you did not seriously pay that much for this thing did you?\"<br>\r\nDan blushed slightly. \"Yeah, well the story behind it...\"<br>\r\n\"Is just a story and has no impact on the value of art. despite what some of my associates will tell you.\" Miss Crane continued to turn it around in her hands. \"Of coarse there is something...alluring about it.

After getting dried off, her long hair in twin pigtails, she strolled into the kitchen wearing cargo shorts and a red t-shirt, no need to dress fancy, they had yard work to do today.  Lilly and Alicia were dressed similarly, with a white and purple shirt respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they discuss who's doing what for the yard, Vanessa noticed a little blue glowing figure flutter up by Lilly's arm, a yellow one not far behind it.  At first she thought that she was imagining them, but when they ripped Lilly's left t-shirt sleeve off, she knew that she wasn't just picturing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think Vanessa?\"  Alicia asked, snapping Vanessa back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia rolled her eyes, \"Do you think we should start out front, or out back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa, not thinking clearly as Lilly's other sleeve was ripped off to join its twin on the floor simply answered, \"Out back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding the two roommates led the way but as Vanessa made to follow them, a green light buzzed up b yher face, and she could see that it wasn't a creepy light at all!  It was a fairy!  A glowing fairy.  A naked, glowing fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy simply winked and motioned for Vanessa to follow her roommates, and remembering the old man's words about the runestone, she realized that these must be the trickster fairies!  Now eagerly wanting to see how this progressed, she hurried out to watch the fun.</span></div></div>",

Strange wonders line the shelves: jewels, potions, wands, relics and more. Customers leave the store with these magical artifacts and find that, in time, the cost was far greater than just bills and coins. One day, while walking through the city, a certain young customer finds the store, and is exposed by the magic of whatever they may have purchased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel is a 19 year old boy, 5\u20198\u201d with blond hair. He has a slim build, and is endowed a slightly more than most men at 8\u201d. He is skeptic of magic, and walks into the store hoping to prove it a hoax. He finds himself proven wrong, and finds himself having trouble keeping his clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa is 20 years old girl, 5\u20195\u201d with black hair. She has an average build, with a C-cup chest. She doesn\u2019t have a strong interest in the occult, but is bored enough to give the store\u2019s inventory a look. She very quickly gets far more excitement that she ever wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: This is an ENF/ENM story. No death or gore, No incest or rape, No Scat or Vore. Shrinking/Growing is only allowed in the section specified for it, and no going crazy; the size change is temporary, no one is growing bigger than a house, and no one is shrinking smaller than a mouse. Obviously there\u2019s going to be nudity/sexual situations, but let\u2019s not get actual sex in here. Finally, the introduction/set-up chapters will be in second person perspective, but once Daniel or Vanessa is selected, the story will be in third person.<br>\r\n</td>",
