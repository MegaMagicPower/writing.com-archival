Wheres that koopa in the coat gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recently recruited several koopas that were smarter than most, giving them lab coats to distinguish them from the others. One walks in with several potions and stands in front of Bowser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..yessir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those liquids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master...these are what you requested...possible ways to defeat Mario\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser grinned, looking at the four colours with imagination as the koopa starts talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir...we also looked at mechanical and technological improvements to yourself\" Bowser glared, not happy with being called imperfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S..sir I understand your anger but what we have looked into are ways to make your body perfect!\" The koopa was close to being crushed but Bowser's curiousity kept him from being so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what do these potions do?\" Bowser demanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir...one makes you grow, one improves your phisique, one causes weight to increase and one causes you to change into any living thing at will\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser was VERY happy as he laughed menacingly, deciding what to try.</span></div></div>",

Right before the scientist's eyes Bowser grows larger. Bowser felt a weird but pleasant sensation as he expanded outwards with fat. His stomach bulged forward, his legs stood farther apart as they put on heft, his arms lost definition, and his neck merged with fat rolls as his face grew rounder. After an hour of growth Bowser stopped growing fat. Subconsciously Bowser hefted his heavier stomach with pudgier hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Chunkiness, should we fetch a scale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Bowser said as he sloshed his belly. \"Also bring a mirror and some food afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the scientists to find a scale.

He tried to look past his stomach, but couldn't see past it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the number on the scale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one of the scientists looks at the scale and tells Bowser that he weighs...</span></div></div>",

Bowser was shocked at merely doubling his weight, but somehow it felt strangely right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the mirror? I need to know how I look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just got it. The mirror was just so large that our assistants had to be careful not to drop it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much longer that the scientists' assistants arrived with the mirror. The mirror was much larger than Bowser, like five times his current width and height to be precise. The rim of the mirror was decorated in elaborate gold and silver and the surface glistened brightly. After some struggle the assistants managed to erect the mirror without breaking it, surprisingly. Bowser then took a few heavy steps towards the mirror, his belly sloshing as he took each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does His Royal Fatness like his new look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser took his time flexing and posing in front of the mirror. Bowser noticed several changes that his body has undergone that he couldn't believe that was the same Koopa just an hour ago. Bowser's face was flabby with huge fat cheeks and a noticeably softer jawline that still showed some intimidation if Bowser got into a bad mood. He also noticed that his choker was broken and just clung to his flabby neck due to the fat rolls. His chest showed no definition, but his pectorals were noticeably softer and bigger. His arms lacked his signature armbands, for they have broken off during his growth and therefore fell off his thick arms. His fat rolls on his back were pushing against his shell and may break his shell if he gained as much as one more pound. Bowser's legs were as thick as trees and supported his massive rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it. I just need larger clothes. If I break my shell I'll be naked. I don't my subjects to see their mighty king indisposed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Lord Bowser. That would be most embarrassing. We just got word that the chefs have cooked a meal for you. Unfortunately they couldn't bring it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser sighs at the inconvenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures they couldn't muster the courage to bring some food. Hopefully they have enough to feed me. If they don't then I'll make them work triple overtime without pay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser then proceeds to the dining room.</span></div></div>",

Bowser's double chin is almost a stunning triple chin, his flabbier cheeks give him a less menacing appearance to which ladies would call cute, but if angered he can prove quite the contrary. Bowser's flabby neck bears a new adjustable spiked-collar that can be adjusted a several sizes larger. Bowser's arm are now flabby but they still have massive amounts of muscle hidden which helps the tubby king workout before eating his humongous dinner feasts. Likewise he wears adjustable spike-metal arm bands. His belly sticks out quite a good distance and often growls whenever Bowser is not eating. Bowser's legs like his arms are flabby but are strong enough to support his weight without any issues. Also his tail has gotten thicker with fat but can still pack quite a punch. Overall Bowser has gotten quite fat but with a mighty presence. Now Bowser was getting ready for lunch, but was meeting the koopa scientists that he hired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, your added bulk doesn't seem to be interfering with your health.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good and dandy doc, but I can't go about my day without being so hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That side effect should wear off in about a month or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Now all I have to do is eat and gain weight than the Mushroom Kingdom will be mine. Bwahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser than leaves for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be good. I can already imagine the food right now. Yet once I have Peach I'll be dining like an emperor. Bwahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser continues his day like normal.</span></div></div>",

Now weighing 620 lbs. the Bowser from three months ago would look skinny from his now sumo sized body. Bowser now sports acomplete triple chin and huge basketball cheeks. His horns are now sitting upon the bulk of his circular head. Bowser's are now as thick as tree trunks and tend to jiggle when doing any activity like eating or working out. His belly now spreads out very well giving him a more rounded body shape. His meaty legs are three times as large then three months ago. When it comes to moving about Bowser would often create small earthquakes due to his sheer size. Bowser's shell has now grown too tight for his body and in dire need of replacement. Lucky for Bowser his new shell should be ready today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more month and then I'll pay the mushroom kingdom a visit. Those fools would just bounce of my stomach if they had the guts to Jump on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Lardiness your new shell is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser puts on his new 5X spiked green shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's more like it. Plenty of room to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, we magically enhanced your shell so it will grow larger if you start to outgrow it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that will save me from shell shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also have news for you.\" Due to how much of the potion you drank it seems like your metabolism is gradually dropping. Once it completely drops there's no way that you'll return to your original size if you wanted to. Our reports also point out that your muscle mass is growing slightly given to your daily workouts but once you reached a certain size you won't be able to work out as much, but we can rectify the problem by giving you the muscle growth potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice and all but why would I want to lose this belly. I never realized how useful it could be. I can now store stuff that I need using my belly rolls and also this girth gives me an advantage when it comes to comfort. I'll let you know if I want to make a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to anger their corpulent king the koopa scientists leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what to do?\" said Bowser rubbing his fat chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it! I'll get myself a pre-workout snack before pumping some iron.\", said Bowser flexing his flabby arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowadays what Bowser calls a snack is more like a meal. A meal that lasts for about an hour or two. During these \"snacks\" Bowser will devour whatever his chubby hands could find. This also explains how he managed to gain more than 100 lbs. a month. Back when Bowser was 500 lbs. he would often eat his snack his new reinforced throne and would use his belly to balance two plates at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Bowser eats his snack and then goes workout which is more or less similar to a sumo wrestlers routine but with added weights. After that Bowser continued his week like usual. </span></div></div>",

Bowser's tail was now surrounded by flab. Every time he would try to shake it his large rear end would jiggle.

Outsmarted him at every turn. Bowser intensified his eating and workouts to ensure his success. This caused him to double in weight. Bowser had several chins that moved as he opened his wide mouth, his arms had an ample supply of muscle hidden by an enormous amount of fat. His belly stuck out to almost twice his height. His massive legs full of muscle and fat helped offset his protruding gut. He still wore arm bands and a choker which helped define his figure somewhat, while his arms bands were now designed to expand as he grew heavier. He would always let Jr. uses his belly as a trampoline since it helped him digest faster while allowing him to play with his genius toddler. Today Bowser heard of an abandoned temple that is said to give him godlike powers, but Bowser didn't realize that those powers are not immediate and instant, but take time to develop and he must pass any trials within the temple. Bowser than spotted the temple. He told his men to stay outside while he goes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! The power to defeat the Mario Bros. Only requires me to enter this temple. Huh? An inscription? 'To become a god one must be born a god. If you seek godhood you must complete the rebirth ceremony and learn the ways of the gods.' \"Interesting sign. The sooner I get this done the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser then enters the inner sanctuary, a large room that has the power to stop time in the outside world.

Bowser excelled in all his classes and was about to show his classmates the world he created. Bowser created a paradise planet called Emparadiso. The planet was successful except for some of the defiant humanoids that resembled the Mario Bros. and Princess Peach. Despite not being the actual Bros. or Princess from the still time frozen world they were irritating enough to bring up repressed memories of his life as a mortal in the form of dreams. Dreams that could barely reveal his complete previous life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr... That Marion and his gang of rebels have defiled my temples long enough.

Your final grade for this project is an A minus. Congratulations on scoring the highest grade in the class.  Well done students and enjoy the summer.  I hope to see some of you in the Diety Training Academy next year.\" The Goddess of Life said as she dismissed the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Diety Training Academy was the place that Bowser had been hoping to to attend since middle school. The Diety Training Academy was the place where young God's would spend a hundred years perfecting their abilities and claiming abandoned world's to repopulate and shape to their own liking. Luckily God's stop aging when they reach their 20s. Instead of aging their power will grow and their strength will keep multiplying.

YES!!!\" Bowser moaned as his entire body rumbled, his cock becoming tremendously erect at the 12 feet it stood at. \"SO THIS IS TRUE POWER HM?!\" He said as his pecs blew out, he moaned as he flexed his enormous body, watching his biceps grow and grow, his 30 pack shifting, allowing room for even more all-powerful abs to grow. \"THIS IS MORE LIKE IT HAHA YESSSS!!!\" He screamed as he grew to 100ft, 120ft, 150ft. \"NOT EVEN THE CLOUDS CAN STOP THESE SUNS AHAHA THEY WILL MAKE ME GROW INTO A GOD!!!\" And that they did! He moaned in rapture as all of the muscles in his body pulsed with Godlike energy, sending more and more power to every single atom in his body, his cock flared out, as did his balls, his massive erection growing to 50ft, then 100ft, then 350ft in one heaving spurt!!! Bowser's growth slowed some as he reached 600ft and the suns lost there potency, his muscles still bulging in some areas. \"I CAN SEE EVERTHING NOW MUAH'HAHAHA\" He suddenly noticed peach's castle on the horizon. \"YES! SHE WILL BE MINE FOREVER NOW!\" And with that bowser began walking off to her castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bowser thought to himself for a bit, but then decided to grab a bite to eat. At his current state, he was already fairly strong, carrying one of the heavy boxes and dumping all the food that was inside it on a large round table. Apparently what was inside the box turned out to be all kinds of large fried meats and a couple different freshly-prepared desserts. \"Wow! Didn't think there'd be all this food inside there.\" Bowser grabbed a large chair and sat himself right in. He grabbed a large piece of a pork leg and quickly took a large bite out of it. After doing so, he set his right arm on the table to lean his head against his right hand, and then gulped up the meat he was chewing on. Bowser sighed, \"Great. Now what am I supposed to do? That lousy koopa didn't even inform me when the effects would start kicking in.\" All of a sudden, Bowser's belly began bubbling a little and making some gurgling noises. Could it be from the potion? Or is it from the food he had just eaten? Either way, it was making his stomach feel uneasy, \"Ugh... If that potion gave me indigestion, I'll shove that koopa's head so far down his shell, he won't be able to bring his head back out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser began rubbing his stomach with his right hand to try to ease the gurgling pain, but strangely enough, it seemed to have worked. \"Huh? ... Hey, my stomach doesn't ache anymore.\" Bowser held up his right arm, \"I must have the magic touch or something. Hah!\" All of a sudden, Bowser's hand seemed to start twitching a bit. \"What the...?\" After twitching a bit more, the ends of Bowser's fingers seemed to have stretched out some more, forming sharper claws. The muscles in Bowser's palm also began to bulge out a bit. Bowser wasn't sure of what was going on, \"Wha... My hand... !\" Bowser shifted his view down to his forearm. Suddenly, a few veins had popped up around his forearm. He could clearly see each of them pulsing and wiggling around. But then, they all seemed to have starting pumping, as if pumping blood into the muscles around his forearm. They did. Bowser watched as the bulge that was his forearm began tensing up a bit on its own, and then started to swell up a bit. It was clear that the potion was starting to work. But was it working on its own, or was he doing something that was causing it? Bowser thought of it for a bit, but then his eyes shifted down further, now staring at his bicep and tricep. Some muscle was already showing, but more muscle was on the way. Bowser set his arm on the table as a couple veins suddenly snaked around his entire bicep and tricep area. Once they stopped, they all remained where they were, all pulsing at once at the beat of his heart. Bowser watched as the veins kept beating for over half a minute, but then, all the veins seemed to have seeped into his bicep and tricep. Bowser waited for something to happen, then witnessed his bicep and tricep suddenly tense up, and the both bulged out. Bowser's eyes widened as he watched his now softball-sized bicep pulse out to the same beat as earlier. The look of it was quite impressive. Even more impressive than how his forearm now looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser slowly lifted his arm as he gazed at his new bulge. He gave it a small flex, but it peaked out pretty well. \"Heh.\" Bowser smirked as he gave his muscular arm a harder flex, making his bicep peak an inch higher while accompanied by a good vein. Bowser set the pork leg down as he began flexing his arm in a couple different ways. Watching the muscles tense and ripple with great strength. \"Holy... This is great!\" Bowser flexed his arm up towards his head, giving his newly-formed gun a kiss. \"Hee hee..\" For Bowser's next pose, he gripped his right wrist with his left hand, and then straightened his right arm outwards as he gave it another good flex. \"Hm?\" As Bowser was holding that pose, he shifted his left hand to his right rippling forearm. It was as if the muscles in his forearm, possible the rest of his arm muscles for that matter, were swelling out more and more. Although it was very minimal, it was enough to get Bowser hyped up. \"Aww, sweet!\" All of a sudden, there was a knock on the door. Bowser relaxed his arm muscles as he set them both on the table, \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, i-it's me sir.\" It sounded like the koopa scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you. Come in here. I've got somethin' to show ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried about what it was, the koopa slowly opened the door with caution. \"Y-yes...sir? !!\" The koopa's eyes widened as he stared right into the first thing he saw, \"Sir, your...your arm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Is that really the first thing you noticed? Heh. Well, anyways, that blue potion stuff is really startin' ta kick in.\" Bowser stood up and set his right hand on the table to lean against his right muscular arm. Bowser then began flexing his arm again, making his bicep and tricep area bulge in and out as he pointed at his bicep with his left hand, \"Check out this bad boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, impressive sir. But, may I ask, what caused your arm to become that of a weight trainer's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser shrugged his shoulders, \"Ya got me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, surely you must know what caused your muscles to expand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that happened in here was that I emptied one of those crates of food, and then took a bite out of one of those pork legs. My stomach ached for a bit...\", Bowser flexed his right arm upwards as he showed with his left hand the beating muscle that was his bicep, \"...and then this happened.\", Bowser said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist was scratching the bottom of his chin, \"Hmm... Intriguing.\" Suddenly, the koopa may have gotten an answer, \"! I think I know the answer!\" The koopa pointed at the pork leg Bowser had already taken a bite out of, \"It must be the food! The food must be what's causing the potion to give you strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser stared at the chewed-up meat, \"Mmm... I don't know... You really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not take another bite? It wouldn't hurt to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser picked up the barbecued meat with his muscled arm. He stared at it for a few seconds, but then just shrugged it off and took another large bite out of it. Bowser chewed it up a bit and then quickly gulped it up. Suddenly, the same feeling he got from earlier was immediately happening to his stomach again. \"Augh... Hm? Well, at least it's not as bad as last time.\" A twitching feeling suddenly came on to Bowser's left shoulder. It twitched out pretty much, and then it began throbbing as the muscles inside it were expanding out. His left bicep and tricep were also starting to twitch and bulge out. It continued on to his forearm, and then his left hand. \"Oh ho ho...\" Looking at his left arm, all the muscles were now even with the muscles on his right arm, but all his left arm muscles were still pulsing a bit after their recent growth. Bowser set the pork leg down and said as he flexed his arms downward a bit, \"Now THIS is what I'm talkin' about!\" There wasn't much effort put into the pose, but it was enough to cause a couple veins to show from all around. Bowser said as he began feeling his left arm, \"I can sure get used to this\", Bowser said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, just curious, doesn't the growth hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! In fact, it was quite, pleasureful, if ya ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So...what now?\"</span></div></div>",

Gotta give each muscle group a quick test run you know.\", Bowser explained with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh, okay. I, suppose you'll want me out of your hair.\" the koopa assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I'm gonna need someone's opinion every so often.\", Bowser said. Bowser walked back to his and sat down. \"You should sit down on the other side of the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, the koopa scientist quickly sat at the other end of the table. He was just following his orders. \"Y-yes sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser got back to his twice-munched-on pork leg, picking it up with his left hand. He stared at the large meat for a bit. Bowser grinned, and then tossed the entire thing in his mouth. The meat almost entirely filled up Bowser's mouth as he was chewing and munching on it. After chewing on it a bit more, Bowser raised his maw as he gulped the whole thing right up. \"I gotta say, this food tastes really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\", the koopa just said. Suddenly a weird sound caught the koopa's ears, \"What's that strange noise?\"  The koopa looked around, then ending up in view of Bowser's stomach, which was making gurgling sounds once again. \"Sir! You're stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah calm down. It'll go away.\", Bowser assured. Suddenly, Bowser felt as if something struck him from the inside, \"! Ah... My neck... Aurgh...!\"  Bowser raised his head up so his neck was in view of the koopa's eyes. His neck was starting to stretch out in length a bit, but then his neck muscles from all around slowly began to fill with blood and pure muscle. Bowser grunted, \"Urrrgh... Oh yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Sir\", the koopa asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser gripped the table with both hands as he lowered his head down. \"Wait, I'm starting to feel something else... Urgh...\"  Bowser was gripping the table even harder, as the muscles on both his arms were starting to flex and bulge out some more. A fairly large vein was slowly snaking from his left shoulder and down to his wrist. In the process, each muscle group in his already pumped arm were gaining a little more muscle mass. The same thing was happening to his right arm, only the growth was causing his right arm to flex and grow more on its own. The growth wasn't a lot, but it was something, as Bowser's arms were being flexed on their own. Bowser was suddenly taken aback as his arms were still throbbing against the table, \"Aurgh... Now my chest is starting to hurt... Ahhh...\"  Bowser's chest didn't show much at first, but that all changed. Bowser's left pectoral filled up a bit, and then his right, and then left some more, and then his right some more. Finally, both his pecs swelled and tightened right out on to his chest. After his muscles throbbed a little more, the growth came to a stop. Bowser was left panting a bit after his ordeal, \"Heh. Heh. That, felt, GREAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Koopa stepped back a bit, \"Uh, so, how do you feel now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser held his pumped arms out over the table and locked his hands and fingers together to do a hard flex of his arms and chest. His arms were showing impressive amounts of shredded meat as they were accompanied by a vast amount of pulsing veins. Bowser's enormous pecs were also bulging out with power. \"I'm startin' to feel like a pro bodybuilder! ... Hmm...\"  Bowser relaxed his muscles, and then grabbed a large cake with vanilla frosting and strawberries topped on top of it. Bowser immediately gobbled up the entire cake and munched on it a few times, and then he gulped it all down. Bowser said after he slurped his lips, \"Mm! For once, all this junk food is actually healthy for me. Nngh!\"  Bowser placed a meaty hand on his left pectoral once he felt a minor pain. \"Ah... Just hope it's not giving me heartburn... Nnngh!\"  Bowser arched his chest forward so his pecs were sticking out as they started to tense with surrounding veins. Suddenly, both pectorals began to puff out some more, and then they both flexed on their own, becoming pumped and hardened slabs of meat. After that, the pain soon went to Bowser's midsection, causing Bowser to stick out his abdomen. In a matter of seconds, a row of abdominal muscles were filling out under his large pecs. And then another. And then another. And one more row, giving Bowser a well-defined 8-pack as hard as steel. Though I imagine it would be, due to his large shell. Bowser closed his eyes and set his arms on the table once the growth seemed to be coming to a stop. He said to himself, \"This...feels...great.\", he grinned, \"I wouldn't mind experiencing his any day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe koopa scientist still stood same spot. He was pretty awestruck what with seeing Bowser's new growth. Although, the koopa also felt pretty awkward just watching him enjoy himself. \"Uh, sir? Do you, really need me to stay here at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser opened his eyes halfway, \"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I can leave if you want me to.\", the koopa said, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm...\"  Bowser says to himself, \"What's this...strange sensation I'm feeling...?\"  Bowser opened his eyes a little more, realizing the muscles in his arms were starting to throb and shift around with large veins accompanying. This feeling he was getting out of it was actually starting to affect him, 'down there'. \"Thisss...feelsss...kinda nice. !\"  Bowser heard something lightly hitting the table from underneath. He looked down, and was shocked to spot his member half-erect and sticking out under his well-earned abs. \"What the...!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser's member was already long enough to be seen by the koopa. \"Intriguing. It seems the potion can cause growth effects to your member as well. Then again, your member IS a muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind!?!\", Bowser screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe koopa turned away while covering his eyes, \"AH! I'm sorry sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser began growling at the koopa. But then, looking down at his not as erect member, an idea bounced into his head.</span></div></div>",

The scales covering his body began to merge with one another as his formerly colorful body began to turn lighter. His face reshaped itself as it lost it's saurian features, becoming more mammalian. His eye sockets cracked and shifted as they shrank in size, tears pouring out of his eyes as they shrank as well, their internal structure snapping apart and forming back together as their color changed to deep blue pools. His much smaller head extended away as his neck grew in length, narrowing as his voicebox shifted and contorted. His shoulders slimmed and rounded as his back curved outward, then inward dramatically, shoving the twin masses of fat on Bowser's chest outward. The massive spiked shell shimmered as it too morphed, shrinking and curving until it fit perfectly against Bowser's new spine structure as the spikes shrank lengthwise but grew in width, now only a handful covering the new shell. His hands, once incredibly large shrank down, slimming as his fingers split apart into five smaller ones as his claws thinned and narrowed. His powerful legs slimmed as well, leaving two powerful yet delicate looking legs as his feet shrank and reformed into those of a human. His tail, once short, club-like and powerful grew outwards, shrinking in overall width as it gained length and dexterity, twitching on it's own accord as the nerve endings running through it fired off uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser's mane of fiery red hair at it exploded in length, running everywhere as it doubled in length and size as it became fuller, lusher, brighter as blonde hair chased the red to the very tips of his new luscious locks. His horns shrank and repositioned themselves as well, losing most of their curve as they shrank to just above Bowser's new hair. Last but not least, Bowser's male anatomy melted away as a very feminine slit appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes ceased, all that was left of Bowser was a large breasted Koopa version of Princess Peach, laying unconscious on the cold stones of Bowser's castle, draped in large, spike covered leather bands that lay comically over the /very/ female body he now possessed. Several minutes passed before the coldness of the stone floor seeped far enough into Bowser's changed body to rouse him back to consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHH\" Bowser screamed, jerking himself upwards and finding himself horribly tangled in the spiky bindings he had worn just a few moments ago. \"AAAAAHHH!\" Bowser screamed again, confused by the high pitched sound of his own voice and how weak he felt, staring down at how changed his body was. He had expected to to look different, but to /feel/ so different scared the Koopa King. After a moment of being comically tangled, the newly female Bowser managed to extricate himself from the ruins of his wardrobe and pull himself to his feet, admiring at how complete the process was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...It worked!\" He, she screamed in triumph, and then covered her much smaller ears in pain as her new voice echoed off the high walls and ceiling of her castle. After the echo faded away, she released her ears slowly, feeling them out with her new, much smaller fingers before sliding them through her voluminous hair, before running them across the mountainous breasts that now dominated her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" She whispered to herself, but just as she was about to call her plan a complete success, she felt a painful twinge in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...NOOOOOO!\" She screamed as the pain returned in full as her body began to swell and change, her breasts caving in as fat was redistributed into muscle, the burning pain as her skeleton began to lengthen once more, the intense itchiness as her fair, unmarred skin began to devolve back into individual scales. It was too much, and Bowser feel to her knees once more as the pain overtook her brain and forced it to sleep as the massive reversion to her body commenced in full. Bowser's sex reverted as his male genitalia sprouted from the female slit, his fingers and feet swelling as bones merged back together. His skull cracking apart frighteningly as it grew once more into a saurian snarl as the shell on his back swelled to it's former deadly prominence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the reversion was complete, and Bowser lay there, sprawled on the castle floor for nearly an hour before a wandering Goomba bumped into him, causing his eyes to snap open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRAROOOOOAAAARRR!\" Bowser once again roared, rearing up and letting loose a column of fire, the Goomba wisely waddling away as fast as it could of it's two stubby feet as Bowser slowly picked himself up off the floor of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...It worked! But it needs to be longer!\" Bowser snarled, gazing back down at his natural body in disgust.\"What's the use of changing bodies if it doesn't last more than a few minutes!? And the pain! The unacceptable pain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser stomped back over to the potions, the lab-Koopa nowhere to be seen as the various chemicals bubbled and sizzled away in their vials.  Bowser ignored most of them, searching and finding the flask that held the glowing green potion that he had ingested earlier, prompting his change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" he growled, picking the entire flask up and swirling it's contents, small crackles of magical energy popping from the liquid's surface within, \"How can we make you work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could go to his court sorcerer Kamek. Perhaps some additional magic would make the potion work? Or maybe the dose he drank simply wasn't enough, perhaps Bowser had to consume the entire potion in order to make it last longer. Or maybe if he combined the potion with another one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser was, admittingly, not much of a scientist, but he was prepared to take the chance in order to defeat MArio once and for all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bowser sneered at the bubbling concoctions. He could easily down the remaining potion, or try his hand at alchemy himself, but the Koopa king knew better than to risk it. He was a ruler, a fighter, he did not have the scientific knowledge to try his hand at changing the spell to make it last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he knew someone who could. Cradling the large flask in both of his huge claw tipped hands, Bowser made his way out of the lab and through the castle, Goombas and Koopa Troopas scattering before him for their own safety. Eventually Bowser made it to the tower where the Koopa Court's sorcerer, Kamek, resided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll fix the potion. Or else\" Bowser growled as he pushed open the heavy wooden door and made his way up the long, spiral set of steps, eventually stepping up into the magical reptile's study, which was adorned with all manner of strange items and novelties. Kamek himself was asleep on a hammock that was held aloft by two of his numerous floating broomsticks, his large blue cap pulled down over his eyes and beak as he snored loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHEM!\" Bowser said loudly, and tried not to chuckle too heartily as the much smaller Koopa jerked upright in surprise, unbalancing the floating hammock and tumbling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who dares!?\" KAmek snarled as he extricated himself from the floor, but his angry demeanour changed the instant he saw Bowser looming over him. \"Oh! Oh, my lord Bowser! What a pleasant surprise! I was...um, just testing out a new type of broomstick when I must have, uh, accidentally cast a sleep spell on myself!\" Kamek dusted off his blue robe and straightened his cap before shuffling over to a massively overcrowded desk and grabbing his magical wand. \"What can I do for you today, my lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser rolled his eyes as he carefully set the glowing green potion on the tower floor. Kamek immediately waddled over and peered into it's contents, the flask reflecting off the Magikoopa's goggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This potion will allow me to transform into a disguise that I will use to infiltrate the Mushroom Kingdom and finally defeat it and that cursed plumber once and for all!\" Bowser boomed, his voice shaking the small chamber of novelties and magical items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why have you not consumed it and gone about your plan?\" Kamek asked, giving the flask a gentle shake and analyzing the sparks of magic that frothed within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it only lasts for a few moments before I change back into my glorious self!\" Bowser flexed an enormous arm for Kamek, who seemed unimpressed. Bowser frowned and ceased flexing, crossing his arms together and staring at the magikoopa, \"So I command you to make the potion last longer. Forever, if need be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forever, my lord? Surely you jest\" Kamek scoffed, frowning up at Bowser, \"But when would you change back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's plenty of other potions, plus the new lab-Koopas can make more of this, if need be. You can help them\" Bowser growled, losing his patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I could most likely create the effect you desire...But I'd have to brew up a entire new potion from scratch. Those lab-Koopas you brought on, they're unskilled in the magic arts, I'm surprised it worked at all! I will need a week, at best, to make what you need\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Bowser roared as he reached forward and grabbed Kamek by the scruff of his robe, \"NO MORE WAITING. FIX IT OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! At once my lord!\" The much smaller Koopa screamed, trying his best to sink into his robe and shell, \"Just don't stomp me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser dropped his sorcerer to the floor and grinned, \"That's more like it. So, how do you plan on fixing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamek coughed and dusted himself off once more as he regained his composure, tapping his goggles with his wand as he struggled to come up with an idea to please his master. Re-creating the potion was the safest bet, but that would take time, and Bowser lacked the patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Kamek said, pacing around his study. Tanooki suit leaves hung dryly on the wall, a frog suit folded up in the corner, different Koopa sheels in various stages of dissection, a go-kart engine floating on a small cloud of magical geometric shapes. He stopped to admire a Super Mushroom, one that he was planning on trying to fuse with a super star to combine the ffects of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombine the effects of both...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA!\" Kamek yelped, grabbing the mushroom and racing back over to the potion flask, \"My lord, what does the potion turn you into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser felt his cheeks grow red as he remembered the feeling of massive breasts swinging from his chest. He couldn't tell Kamek what it did. \"It, um, changes me into a human!\" The Koopa King muttered, but that was all Kamek needed to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Well, if we combine the semi-permanent effects of a super mushroom...\" Kamek took the large mushroom, whose eyes almost appeared to be eyeing the potion nervously, \"And combine them with the potion...\" Kamek ripped the super mushroom's stem off and tossed it into the potion, cackling with glee as the stem melted away instantly, turning the potion yellow before shuffling off towards a collection of random items with the mushroom cap. After a moment of sifting through the collection of what Bowser took to be junk, Kamek pulled out a small golden crown, with eyes of it's own staring blank ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we combine this with the crown\" Kamek shoved the mushroom cap into the crown's interior and waved his wand at it, a low WOOP WOOP WOOP resonating through the chamber as he fused the two items together. \"Ahh, perfect! Now all we have to do is...\" Kamek raced back to Bowser and the flask, trying comically to lift the glass container despite the fact it was almost as large as the mage himself. After a moment of furious grunting, Kamek staggered back and pointed at the flask with a dull claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, if you would help, my lord?\" The magikoopa asked, giving Bowser a sheepish looked. Bowser merely rolled his eyes and picked the flask up, staring at Kamek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good good!\" Kamek squealed, setting the fused crown on the floor of the chamber, \"Now my lord, please pour the potion onto the crown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this will make it do what I want?\" Bowser grumbled, tipping the flask over so that the potion began pouring out. The two Koopas stepped back to avoid any splashes, but the crown seemed to absorb the yellow liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! You see my lord, potions are edible, they fade through the body as your body processes it. But as we all know, costume items only fade when they are removed via blunt force. So by combining the super mushroom with the crown, we made it a costume, and by letting the mushroom absorb the potion, the effects of the potion will now last forever! Or until something hits you hard enough. But yes, FOREVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remnants of the potion trickled from the empty flask an onto the crown, which began to glow for a moment before turning inanimate once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there you have it, my lord Bowser, your disguise is ready! A rather ingenious solution, if I do say so mysel-\" Kamek boasted, but was interrupted as Bowser let loose a roar of triumph and swiped the crown from the floor, knocking the magikoopa backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINALLY! MY MASTER PLAN IS FUFILLED!\" Bowser roared, and placed the crown on top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POOF*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, in a matter of painless seconds, stood the incredibly buxom beauty that Bowser had been before, massive breasts swaying gently, magnificent rear and tail sticking out from beneath an elegant form fitting shell, red tipped golden locks flowing almost to the floor, and slim fingers sliding up and down their new body with ease. The only difference was that now, Bowser was fully clothed, a long black dress, a dark reflection of Princess Peach's, flowed outwards as heavy blue gems accented the outfit, Bowser's signature spiked leather bindings and chokers fitting securely around his slender neck and wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...My lord!?\" Kamek said, before fainting from surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser...or rather, Bowsette grinned, a single fanged tooth sliding over supple lips as he...she felt the power of her new form course through her, this time for good.</span></div></div>",

His/her brain was fighting to choose which pesonality would keep the control and which other would die. Flashes of memories going through his/her brain finally make realize something... Bowser always was going to lose not because he was not strong enoguh nor his plans were frustated by the plumber  and his green brother all the time, it was the fact he was a big jerk everytime he speaks.<br>\r\nIf he had been more..friendly or at least humble in the best of the cases he wouldn't have failed in his previous conquest and kidnappings if just listen to his/her own minions/people.<br>\r\nThe part of bowser was in the edge to disappear when suddenly the realization hit him like a train this was facts that describe his enemy,that is the reason peach always liked him instead of him, he was kind, thoughful with the peolpe around him, a little chubby but strong enough to battle him all the time without drop a single sweat drop in the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was shocked..wait did he just called himself a female. For a moment the body of Bowser/Bowsette make loudly sounds while she/he demands to kamek: \"Leave me alone and not call anyone near me for now!\"<br>\r\nKamek only nods and runs away, meamwhile she/he was battling inside their mind about the new topic one the King were pissed only to think about while her other part seems to have no problems Mario. It was no doubt that his..femenine side seems to like Mario when she put the new light over him, his mind try to shut that thoughs until a sudden sensation ends up realize in something he was getting wet for thinking in him, he never felt a heat feeling thinking about peach and he just think about his enemy was enouh to make his new body like that. Bowser couldn't help the teasing in the breast and lower part of his transformed body, he could only stare and watch while his female side take over the control of his body and touch themselves roughly enough to make them moan in pleasure, bowsette try to tease her maaculine side with him thinking about the plumber teasing their body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser couldn't stop the thought and let many toughts of mario playing with her until it was late for bowser to realize that his femenine side is trying to fuse his mind with hers to make him dissapear slowly but permanently, in the end of the climax Bowser's last thought was his koopalings and Jr, and how much he wanted to have a mother like peach the emotional reason he wanted to marry her so badly. The orgas was so exciting that Bowsette let a flame go trough her mouth to the air in a beastiality demanour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the last remain part of bowser in her brian fuses with the other part, with her fully on control she tries to readjust her new dress, and thinking about the last thought of her masculine side \"it wasn't a bad idea\" she thought. Bowser was obviously not the farher of the year but he always try to make them happy...even if was in a bad terms of the words but at least is the last thing she could do for him before his side disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So after a little talk with the kids about the new \"situation\", I will have to visit a certain red handsome guy\" she says to herself while licking his lips in the last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she has to agree to admit is in that she wasn't ready or have experience being mother figure she always wanted to their children, this gave her the conclusion that even if the needs changed and their kids needs now a father figure now (which is going to be mario, and will be out of discussion) she needs someone else to help her in that long path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't know how is going to work since her mind was recovering of the fight with herself but she feels that she will find a way \"Huh..\"she mumbled\"So this is new...it's the first time I think with the heart.. and I start to like it!\"she finally said with a genuine smile it was official.<br>\r\nBowsette the new Koopa Queen was Born!</span></div></div>",

Or at least long enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his eagerness though, Bowser did hesitate for a moment. What he was about to down was almost ten times what he'd consumed before. Casual logic suggested the effects would last ten times as long, maybe longer, but there was the possibility this would have side effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bah! Who cares about side effects?</i> Bowser reasoned. If it was anything minor he'd work it out later. He could tough it out. And so with barely another thought, Bowser chugged the remainder of the bottle. Bracing himself, the koopa king expected to pass out again, but instead he felt fine. A little 'oogy' from drinking the large bottle at once but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his stomach clenched and Bowser couldn't help but grin. He could feel it, starting in his stomach as it pulled inward some, followed by a heat rushing to his hips as they swelled out, growing thicker and more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this feel-\" *Cough-cough* *HACK!* Bowser fell into a coughing fit as his vocal cords suddenly pinched, and when he could speak again it was in a feminine but still somewhat deep rumble, \"This feels weird...\" His hands tingled as a fourth finger grew out from the end of his palms, but something wasn't right, it was claw tipped, and his scales had yet to vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe still changing monarch hurried over to a mirror, unaware of the added swish to his hips as his rear end swelled into a prominent booty. <i>Yeep!</i> Bowser held down a high-pitched yelp as 'his' privates suddenly inverted into a feminine sex. <i>She</i> now looked in the mirror to see her features softening, her muzzle narrowing, her hair growing out and becoming a thick mane of fiery red, and a pair of prominent melons swelled out of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was not human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((A nice reference image. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/28797930/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/28797930...</a> ))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser waited, and waited, but as the tingling began to fade the monarch had to admit the effects were done. The former koopa king was now a somewhat pudgy, <i>Very</i> hippy, and somewhat curvy, Koopa <i>Queen</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arg, what the hell!?\" she roared, in her new baritone voice, a level up from her old one to sound feminine while loosing none of her former strength, \"Why!? Why this!? Arg, useless, worthless. No one's going to be fooled if I just look like myself but female. Ugh, why did I have to drink all of it? I'll probably be stuck like this for hours... or longer...\" A worrying thought crossed Bowser's mind, \"What if I never change back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately (or not) she didn't have time to dwell on that as a gurgling feeling rolled through her stomach. For a moment she was hopeful this was the reversion she wanted, but it was far too soon. That meant only one thing: Side effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1 - 'Bowsette' feels hungry suddenly. Starving. Ravenous. Without explanation she charges her way to the main hall and demands food. She wants a feast and she wants it now. The potion has kicked her digestive system into overdrive and she wants tons of food. However consuming so much is sure to pack on the pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2 - Same as 1, only rather than getting fat Bowsette begins to grow, getting bigger, heavier, thicker, a giant koopa queen to dominate the lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3 - The gurgling moves from Bowsette's stomach to her breasts, which begin to swell. Seems she's beginning to generate milk and her production levels are through the roof. She'll need to be milked regularly or risk her breasts growing to immobilizing sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4 - A sudden fog comes over Bowser's mind as 'his' thoughts are suddenly shoved to the back of Bowsette's head. A new female personality emerges with no memory of how she got to this strange place. Bowser can only watch from her subconscious as Bowsette flees the castle and heads for the Mushroom kingdom.</span></div></div>",

The rest she could not remember, fully slipping into the darkness....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a female Koopa woke up, the only thing she could recall was her name: Bowsette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around herself in confusion.

Once you put the hose into your mouth I'll turn on the machine. The way this works is the speed and flow of the liquid determines how much you gain. It also depends on how long your session on the machine. The longer your feeding session the more weight you gain. Before we begin I need to know how much you weigh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"600 lbs. Why do you need my weight again?\" Bowser sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason why I needed your weight is so the machine can not only determine how fast to pump out the liquid, but to also record your new weight. The feeding machine creates a history of the user's weight. Any weight gained outside of the machine will have to be recorded manually. The same applies to any potential weight loss too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good to me! Let's get started already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser picks up the hose and puts it into his mouth.

Bowser shrank himself down with the mushroom and used the cloud to hover next to an open window in the castle upon entering the castle it was only a matter of time before he was able to sneak his way into Peach's room. Seriously though he had had raised this castle so many times and they always rebuilt it the exact same way everytime. Making his way quietly to bedrooms Bowser eventually found Peach's. However before he could go he also heard other voices coming from the other rooms. They sounded a lot like the other two princesses Rosalina and Daisy. Looking back at the odyssey  hat Bowser pondered to himself. He decided to wait till everyone was asleep before he made his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lights were all out Bowser too the hat and looked at rooms.

It didn't matter though because now  he could finally capture Peach....well capture her in a different way. He noticed the princess sleeping peacefully in her bed with her crown, resting a top her night stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" He thought as he took aim and flung the hat onto Peach's  soft golden hair. Almost immediately the Koopa King felt himself get lifted into the air before he was pulled towards Peach. However his body began to slowly faded and shrink as he was sucked into the hat and into Peach's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser felt his world go blank before he was bombarded with surge of memories. He saw many of the memories were if Mario, himself and the various Toads and other characters of the mushroom and koopa kingdoms. He even saw the various other activities like go kart racing and the party games passing by. Eventually a bright light soon emerged and overwhelmed  him. When the light faded, Bowser found himself staring up at the ceiling  of a castle bedroom. He noticed a strand of blonde hair hanging in the corner of his vision.  Lifting up a hand to remove the strand he immediately  noticed the difference. No wonder was his arm large, cold and scaly, instead it was now small, soft and delicate. He immediately  jumped out of the bed and went to the nearest mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked.\" He said to himself in his new feminine voice. He stared at the mirror seeing only Peach's  face stare back at him. An evil smirk formed on the once innocent princess's face. However upon closer examination Bowser noticed a few other details that he might have missed earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters Peach was still wearing her light pink lingerie that did nothing to hide her lithe figure. It accented all her curves well, showing just of beautiful  the princess's body was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever before he could mess around with his new body he noticed something. Just like the koopa had told him the odyssey  hat had altered Peach's  body when Bowser captured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach's usual neat blonde hair was now a lot wilder and messier much like Bowser's. In addition to that Bowser's  horns were sprouting out amongst  her golden locks, although they thankfully were not that different colour to make them stand out. Peach's manicured finger nails were also a lot longer reminiscent  of Bowser's  own claws, but supposedly the biggest indication was the shift in eye colour from the sapphire  blue eyes the Princess  had to the now burning Red eyes of the Koopa king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily  Bowser had just the solution for this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bowser walked into his room and opened his closet. Its wasn't full of clothes as one might expect just various equipment and gear the Koopa king had collected over the years and stored. Like from the time he battled the dark star and what's his face. There was even a tuxedo he had bought for special occasions like maybe when Junior got married in next something heard. However what he was really looking for was a dark pink box he had stored in the back of the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box was relatively easy to find. It was all the way in the back of the closet behind all his junk and it only took a a half of an hour to find. And then pulling out of the box with his now smaller frame was also nothing too hard. He wondered if some of his strength  had also transferred  to the Princess  after all he had horns and a tail. If he lost his fire breath and his strength then he really would have gotten the short end of the stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling out the box, the Koopa human carefully dusted off the label that said 'For Peach' and promptly opened the box. Inside it was a neat assortment of dresses that were tailor made for the Princess's body. They were a gift that Bowser had ordered for when he finally captured Peach and won her over. And today he did capture her...although not in the sense he had probably wanted so many years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one of the dresses Bowser walked over to a mirror noticing his now feminine body once more. His physical features had taken away the sweet and innocent look of the princess and had replaced it with a wild and feral look.  Some would even say it was a bit intimidating. Add on the fact her body also looked more toned and slightly more developed in certain areas and you would have yourself a Koopa girl that almost anyone from any kingdom would want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser did his best to imitate Peach's innocent smile as he held up the dress but the result was not the same sweet smile as the princess but rather a slightly more sultry and dominating one. \" For me Lord Boswer. You shouldn't  have.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser changed out of the lingerie  and into the dress. It was a blackened version of Peach's dress with a few minor tweaks here and there like the fact it was strapless. The dress also wasn't too short as to hide the Princess's smooth legs and black heeled shows. However Bowser  felt something was missing as he stared back at the mirror. Until  finally the thought hit him. He was missing his spiked bracelets and collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing back to the closet Bowser stumbled on himself having not been used to both his new body and the heels. He reached the closet and retrieve his accessories. He was thankful they could adjust there size for whoever wore them no doubt due to Kamek's magic. They were a signature part of his look and his look would have failed if whenever  he grew  to his giant forms that his spiked equipment would break. Slipping them on he noticed how they shrank down to fit Peach's leaner frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the look was complete Bowser stared at Peach's body in the mirror. He then remembered what Junior had told him. 'Since your in mama shouldn't I call you mama.' Initally he had told his son to not think to much about it but then it dawned on him he really didn't know what to call himself now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see where Junior was coming from. His father had practically changed species and gender over night. The titles of Bowser the Koopa King didn't really fit well with this body and demanding for the title to be kept could cause confusion not to mention bring the Mario bros to his door step. The last one he could do without for the moment but no doubt people would assume it was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing by Princess Peach of the Mushroom  kingdom  also didn't have the desire effect. S/he would need a new name.  Maybe Beach, Powser, Queen Koopastool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end he decided to go with Bowsette after. He thought it similar enough to be a female version of himself but not enough to draw attention to the Peach aspect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfteing being satisfied with both name and appearance  the new Queen Bowsette decided to she had another issue to deal with.</span></div></div>",

Making sure no pesky lumps was around first, Bowser then proceed to flutter jump onto Rosalina's bed. The Cosmic princess was sound asleep probably for the first time in centuries after not having to deal with those pesky lumas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser was about to throw the hat when he realized something. The Princess  still had on her tiara. Knowing the hat wouldn't work while she wore the crown the Koopa king jumped on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking care not to disturb her to much. Bowser used his still present strength to lift the crown of  the princess and threw it to the side. The crown understandably landed with a loud clang on the ground beside the bed. Unsurprisingly the noise caused the princess to stir awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser held on for there life as he felt the princess's head rise from its resting position against the pillow. Realizing he had little time left, the mini king pulled out the hat and slammed it onto the Cosmic Princess head. Almost instantly he felt the hat start to pull his entire body as the world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser felt himself fall forward landing with a strangely soft thump. He was use to falling when ever he fought Mario whether intentionally  like when he tried to jump to land next to the plumber or when he was...cheated in battle. Those  times his landings no matter how close to the ground he was, were always loud. This time he barely heard a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get this feet Bowset noticed several things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) His body felt a lot lighter, if not weird in some places<br>\r\n2) He could actually feel the coldness of the floor, something he previously didn't notice before.<br>\r\n3) He felt something tickling his now shell-less back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising a hand to his face, the king's  eyes widen as he noticed the small slender hand he now possessed. Running to the nearest mirror, the king's  mouth now hung agape at the sight before him. He was now staring at none other the Cosmic Princess herself, except it was him in control of her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was no way he'd really be able to trick someone into just putting it on themselves.There may be plenty of strange objects with eyes scattered around the kingdom, but he was sure his hat would arouse suspicion. No, he'd have to find another way to get it onto someone's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could always just throw it at someone. He had some confidence in his throwing ability, and was pretty sure he could get it to land on someone's head. However, that posed another issue. He could land it on their head, sure, but what about their own headgear getting in the way? Anything they were wearing on their head could mess up his throw, and he didn't even know whether the hat would work through another hat (not that he'd even tested the hat by itself yet). That ruled out most citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom. His nemeses, the Mario Bros, were never seen without their trademark caps, and Peach and her other princess friends always seemed to be wearing their crowns. There were always the toads, but Bowser had never been able to tell whether the mushroom was a hat or part of their head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be someone. Someone who had access to Peach, or who could catch Mario off guard, but didn't have the same complications that Mario or Peach had. Then suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, it hit him; Pauline, Mario's ex-girlfriend from New Donk City. Being the ruler of his own kingdom, he was naturally aware of the goings on in the rest of the world, and last he'd heard of her, Pauline had become the mayor of New Donk City in the Metro Kingdom. Surely Peach couldn't deny a visit from a foreign ruler, right? Admittedly, Bowser didn't know whether Pauline typically wore anything on her head, but mayors didn't wear crowns like princesses did, and last he'd seen of her, she didn't wear a hat when she visited the Mushroom Kingdom for the opening of an amusement park. She was the perfect candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis plan settled, Bowser began to stomp towards the room's exit. \"Your highness? Where are you going?\" the koopa scientist called out from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin on his face, Bowser turned back for just a moment, and said, \"I'm going to New Donk City!\"</span></div></div>",

While the New Donkers weren't exactly known for their defenses, Bowser was still a little cautious. Any sighting of his forces was likely to be reported back to Peach, ruining his plans entirely, and though he'd never invaded before, the mayor was certainly familiar with him, thanks to her prior relationship with Mario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, instead of directly invading, Bowser decided to opt for a different strategy. Once his airship was in the skies above New Donk, obscured by the cloud, Bowser headed blow deck to get his Koopa Clown Car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kamek, do the invisible thing!\" he demanded, waiting impatiently inside his vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your highness,\" Kamek, grumbled, waving his wand around, unhappy that Bowser had chosen to use something the scientists had come up with instead of one of his plans. Using his magic, Kamek turned Bowser's Koopa Clown Car, with him still inside it, invisible. The spell wouldn't last for long, however, hence why he hadn't used it to snatch away Peach, but if he worked quickly, it would last long enough for him to use the cap on Pauline without causing a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's precisely what he did. Flying out of the airship, Bowser quickly descended down towards the streets of New Donk, keeping an eye out for Pauline. Thankfully, she wasn't too hard to spot, her bright red suit standing out amongst the dull greys of the regular city folk. Unfortunately, it seemed she was wearing a hat after all, but Bowser's Clown Car soon took care of that, the propeller keeping it in the air blowing the hat right off her head. Pauline looked around, confused at where the sudden breeze had come from, before hurrying off to try and catch her hat. That was just the opening Bowser needed, grasping the hat off his head, and tossing it right at Pauline before Kamek's spell could wear off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even with his car and body made invisible by Kamek's spell, Bowser's aim was true. His cap turning visible as it left the confines of the Clown Car, he watched as it flew through the air, landing squarely in Pauline's head. It seemingly adjusted its size, becoming a perfect for Pauline's human head, even though it had been a fair amount larger when it had hit, before Bowser felt a sudden tugging on his body. Unable to stop himself, he suddenly found himself being launched through the air, zooming towards the hat on Pauline's head. For a second he thought he might simply collide with her, but instead, he was somehow absorbed into the hat, and soon felt himself falling down a hole of what he assumed to be Pauline's memories. He barely had any time to even see any of them, as a bright light engulfed him, and he was returned to reality, although something definitely felt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little disoriented, held up his hands, only to see they were not his own. In place of the large, scaly claws he was used to, Bowser saw the small, dainty hands of a human woman. He glanced down, seeing the svelte figure that replaced him Bulky frame, clad in a red, woman's pantsuit and a pair of black heels. His plan had worked. The hat had allowed him to possess Pauline's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he could already see he wasn't himself anymore, Bowser still felt the need to verify his accomplishments. Unfortunately, he'd neglected to bring a mirror with him in the Clown Car, so he'd need to find one on his own. The invisibility spell on the Clown Car would be running out soon, but with Pauline's small frame, Bowser doubted he'd be able to drag it out of sight before it became visible, so he opted to simply leave it where it was as he ran over to collect Pauline's hat, stumbling a bit in her heels. Doing his best to hide his cap under the hat, Bowser headed into the nearest building, in search of a bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how different Pauline's body was from Bowser's own, he felt oddly comfortable in her body, presumably a side effect of the cap. Perhaps it was so he'd instantly know how to control whatever body he found himself in. Quickly locating a bathroom, Bowser was thankful to find it was a single-person bathroom, and so he quickly locked the door behind him, and looked towards the mirror above the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser's heart sunk as he lowered Pauline's hat. His possession of Pauline's body was not without consequence. Instead of her usual blue, the eyes looking back from Pauline's face in the mirror were red, just like Bowser's, and protruding from the sides of her head were a pair of horns. Perhaps this was another effect of the cap; it allowed someone to possess anyone that wore it, but with alterations made to show who was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Damn this stupid hat!\" Bowser grumbled, sounding far less intimidating with Pauline's voice. This wasn't ideal. For his plan to work, he'd need to look just like Pauline so Peach wouldn't suspect a thing and would let him into the castle. This, on the other hand, wouldn't fool anyone. The moment anyone saw the horns on his head, it'd be clear for all to see that he wasn't really Pauline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser sighed, placing his hands on his hips and tapping one of his feet. What was he to do now? Perhaps Kamek or one of the koopa scientists could find a way to hide his horns, but then there was the issue of how long it would take, and Pauline disappearing for that amount of time. With his Clown Car almost certainly visible by now, there was no doubt he and his kidnapping ways would be blamed for any disappearance, which would ruin his plans regardless. Perhaps it would simply be better to take off the hat for now, start from scratch, and come up with a new plan. Although, he was somewhat intrigued by the hat's ability as is. Even with the horns clearly giving him away, it still allowed him to take over the body of whoever he pleased. Perhaps he could find some use for Pauline's body, even if he couldn't use it for deception.</span></div></div>",

As pleasing as it may be to examine the female form from this angle, the whole point of using the hat was to find a way to deceive Mario or Peach, and finally thrash him once and for all. While he could wear coloured contact lenses or something to cover up the change in eye colour, but there was no real way he could hide his horns. For the time being, it might be better to go back to the drawing board and figure out a better use for the hat, or a way to fix its flaws. And so, despite having claimed it just minutes prior, Bowser reached up with Pauline's dainty hands, and pulled the hat from his head, completely neglecting to notice how small the bathroom was in thanks to how much smaller Pauline's body was to his, and what might happen if his real body came out here.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Bowser removed the hat, expecting himself to be ejected from the mayor's body, something strangely unexpected happened. With a strange shimmering light, Bowser's horns slowly faded from view, and his eyes shifted from his usual red hue, to the softer blue that Pauline's eyes usually took on. Bowser's jaw dropped as he watched the event taking place in the mirror. By the time it was finished, taking little more than a few seconds, Bowser was staring at a perfect replica of Pauline, the mayor of New Donk City, holding a vaguely Mario-esque cap above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser couldn't help but stare vacantly for a moment, barely believing what he was seeing for a moment. He slowly lowered the cap back onto his head, just to make sure he wasn't just seeing things. Sure enough, his horns shimmered back into existence, and his eyes turned red once more. The cap was removed again, and just as before, everything that denoted him as Bowser vanished again. Slowly but surely, Pauline's ruby red lips twisted into a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is perfect!\" Bowser shouted, sounding less evil and more joyous than he'd intended thanks to Pauline's voice. His distinguishing features gone, there was now no telling him apart from the real Pauline. He didn't even have to worry about hiding the cap itself. His plan could go off without a hitch! There was only one issue that crossed his mind as he plopped Pauline's hat back atop her small, human head. He'd assumed that removing the cap would remove him from the body of whoever he was possessing, but now that it didn't, he wasn't entirely sure how he was supposed to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, I can worry about that later.\" Bowser was never really one to sweat the small stuff. Once he'd put his plan into action, and captured Peach and stomped Mario once and for all, then he could worry about pulling his mighty Koopa form out of this woman's body. A smug smirk on his face, Bowser left the bathroom, the Odyssey Cap now tucked under his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bowser headed through the building, back out to the street, he considered how to proceed now. The obvious thing would be to simply schedule a visit to the Mushroom Kingdom, so he could gain an audience with Peach. Of course, he'd need a decent reason for doing so. He may have had underlings to take care of things whenever he ran off to invade the Mushroom Kingdom again, but he didn't know exactly how the leadership structure here in the Metro Kingdom worked. Hopefully he'd be able to come up with something. Perhaps he could even use the Odyssey Cap's design to his advantage. It did look a lot like Mario's, so perhaps \"Pauline\" would like to ask Peach how exactly something like that how wound up in New Donk City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he was planning on simply heading back to town hall, his attention was caught by a commotion occurring outside of the building he was in. As expected, the invisibility spell had run its course, and a crowd had gathered around his now visible clown car. Thankfully, the nearby New Donkers were too distracted by the car itself to notice the mayor's lack of surprise at its appearance. Instead of a surprised gasp, a thoughtful hum came from her voice. With the Koopa Clown Car having appeared, Bowser certainly had good reason to arrange a meeting with Peach now. After all, if his forces were seemingly attacking the Metro Kingdom, surely \"Pauline\" would want some advice from someone who'd survived his attacks before, no? Even if she didn't wish to meet, perhaps she'd send Mario over to help, and then Bowser could trounce him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car also gave him another idea, however. With all the tech inside of it, he could easily get in contact with his forces hovering high in the sky above the city. Perhaps they'd be able to send someone down and figure out why the cap was acting the way it was, and how exactly he was supposed to get out of Pauline's body if removing the hat didn't do it. All he'd need to do is take the clown car somewhere private where he could get contact his troops without any onlookers. The nearby New Donkers should be more than willing to do that for their mayor, no?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Bowser had expected, the moment he removed the cap from Pauline's head, his body was forcefully ejected from her's. His large, Koopa form now took up the majority of the small, single-person bathroom, just barely managing to avoid breaking anything as it fell back onto the toilet seat. Once again, Bowser and Pauline's bodies were separate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one thing Bowser hadn't counted on, however. Wedged in the corner of the bathroom, between the sink and one of Bowser's legs, was the real Bowser, still stuck in Pauline's body. He was doing his best not to panic right now, being trapped in such a small space with such a large monstrous form around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on!?\" Bowser demanded of no one in particular. He took the hat off, his body was back, so why was he still in Pauline's body? This didn't make any sense. He was suddenly regretting not testing the hat in a more controlled environment before rushing off to test his plan. A quick glance in the mirror confirmed that Pauline's appearance what now what she usually looked like, if a little shaken up. And of course, why wouldn't she? Bowser's body wasn't inside of her anymore. In a sense, this was exactly what Bowser wanted, to look exactly like Pauline so he could fool Mario and Peach. But at the same time, this was very obviously wrong, as his body was sitting over there, and he wasn't in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser needed to fix this. The cap was the cause of this, so surely the cap could fix it too. Maybe if he put it back on, his body would go back inside Pauline's and his scientists could figure this out? Or maybe if he put it back on his own body's head, his mind would go inside? Or would that just make Pauline's body go inside his, and then things would be back to normal if he took it off again? Unfortunately, Bowser no longer held the cap in his grasp. The sudden movement of his body reappearing and him being shoved into a corner had jostled the cap from his hands, and it had landed on the other side of the bathroom. With as much room as his body was taking up, there'd be no way to retrieve the cap without clambering all over it. Bowser gulped, suddenly realising how fragile the feminine human form he currently possessed was. If his body suddenly sprung to life, he'd be a goner. He needed that cap, though, or he'd be stuck like this for good. So, steeling his courage, Bowser began to climb over his body's leg, Pauline's heels giving him a bit of difficulty.</span></div></div>",

It was a strangely coloured double cherry. Unlike the usual double cherries that were red, these were a lighter shade almost pink with little tiaras on top of them. Bowser walked over to the pile and picked up the cherries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" The king asked the scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Lord. This is one of my latest and still in testing creations. I have set to actually name it but it works like this. It works like a double cherry in the sense that when its consumed it will make a clone of the user, however  the clone made by this power up in particular will be a sort of female hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Female wabrid?\" Bowser asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hybrid. I have infuse the grown with the DNA of none other than Princess Peach herself. If you were to eat the power up then you would create a clone of Peach with various traits from yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you tell me I eat this and I won't have to worry about kidnapping peach and dealing with Mario?\" The King asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not exactly. Like I said the clone will look a bit like Peach but she will have your memories and possibly a few personality traits. She would only be similar to Peach in looks alone and even that is still an iffy aspect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser looked at the cherry and ponder for a moment wondering if he should eat. He would no longer have to worry about capturing the Princess and having to repel Mario and Co. But the clone would technically be a second version of himself. Bowser wounded how he would feel if he suddenly turned into a woman without warning. Would clone cooperate  or would it try to overthrow  him? It was taking some of his personality and Bowser knew just have bad he could be if he lost his temper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it takes my personality and memories right?\" Bowser asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my liege.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

After he swallowed it he waited as did everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..that's  not as gross as I thought it would be..\" Bowser muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My liege what did you do?\" The Koppa scientist cried. However before Bowser could respond, his body started to glow as he was engulfed in a bright light. The Koppa scientist shielded his eyes as the light enveloped  the whole room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser meanwhile was trying his best to focus. He had used the double cherries before when he made copies of himself to tried to capture the fairies but this was different. While those clones were literally duplicates of himself that he controlled like a hive mind, this was different. He could feel like his own power and life force was being split to make this one. Alongside the shared life force he also saw memories of himself start to surface and flash before his eyes. He almost panicked wondering if he was losing them before something told him to calm down. His memories were only being copied for his new clone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser had sincerely hoped this would work and he didn't make a mistake like that vacuum mushroom incident with Fawful. He had eaten the Cherry not just so he could have his own version of Peach, but so that Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings would finally have a mother figure. He had tried and hoped Peach would be a good one but that plan flopped. And there really wasn't anyone else he could really trust, Rosalina nah last time he messed with her he got stuck in a black hole.  So perhaps maybe the best person to help him raise the kids was himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the light finally died down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bowser's world was still black after the light died. However he was beginning to regain his sense of awareness. He felt himself lying on something soft, hopefully his bed. It wouldn't be the first time he's been injured and had woke up there without any memory of what happened. However this time Bowser could have sworn he was hearing a soft voice calling him back to the waking world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wake up.\" The voice said as it grew louder and louder. Bowser however pushed that voice out of his head. He still felt drained and exhausted from the previous day. However his exhaustion didn't matter as a small fire ball exploded on the side of his bed throwing him out on to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRRRAUGH.\" Bowswr roared as he stood back up to find his attacker. However the enraged King's temper was calmed when his eyes caught sight of his surprise  attacker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser was in his bedroom, that much was certain however Kamek had actually  added a second bed in it. In that second bed was what Bowser hoped was the result of the clone cherry otherwise he was going to smash some shells and stomp some goomba when this was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next bed was an attractive young woman, who was the near spitting image of Peach. She was covered with the blanket but Bowser could definitely  tell from how it wrapped around the girl that she was the same shape as Peach if not more defined in certain areas. She had Peach's  gold hair, however the clone's was a lot longer and wilder with two horns sticking out in front much like his own horns.  The clone also had the same blue eyes as Peach a stark contrast to Bowser's  own red ones. Another thing he noticed was that the hands of the clone that held the sheet were well manicured with claw like nails much like his own. The clone caught him staring and was about say something but quickly closed her mouth against it, though the Koopa King did notice she sported a few sharp and fang like teeth like his own while also having a decent amount of human teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Bowser said. He wasn't quite sure what exactly he was suppose to now. Did she already know what he was going to say since she was a copy of him or did the whole Peach DNA thing affect the personality. Bowser carefully walked over to her. She kept her eyes on him the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Bowser.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" She answered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I know everything about you remember.\" She continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right.\" Bowser answere. \"So I suppose you know why you're  here?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. To be your wife and help raise the Koopa kids.\" She answered nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. You are taking this really well.\" Bowser mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you technically had the plan in mind before you ate the Cherry so I didn't just wake up here surprised.\" She told him with a smile. \"We're  smart like that I suppose.\" She chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwahaha.\" Bowser laughed. \"I was right. I am so likeable that even my Cline's get along with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold up. I'm not just some clone  mind you.\" The clone said as she got out of bed. No longer covered by the bed sheet, she stood firmly in front Bowser. Her body on full display. Bowser immediately stopped laughing as he stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Clone still kept Peach's height, but the Koopa woman did not keep the same innocent and helpless demeanor. Despite being shorter than Bowser her gaze was just as intimidating  as it would have been had it been Bowser himself.  The koopa king was initially taken back by the sudden outburst, having been use to Peach for too long, however he quickly composed himself..at least he thought he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that.\" Bowser stuttered at the sight of nude women's body. The clone's face turned a scarlet red as she immediately  tried to cover herself up. Bowser snapped his eyes shut as he realized his mistake. After a few minutes of waiting the clone finally told him it was safe to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Kamek had thought ahead and prepared a dress for the koopa girl to wear as she was now clothed. The dress was a black recoiled version of Peach's dress however it lacked the gloves and was actually a shulderless and strapless. Instead the clone wore Bowser's signature spiked wristlet  as well as a choker. Her hair was still messy but that would be fixed later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will never speak of this again.\" The clone told him. The king merely agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could continue there conversations however  they interrupted  with some one entering  the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
