            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mary Jane Watson made her way through the busy city street, looking up as a looming tower came into view. Purple lettering reading Oscorp Industries ran up its front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn anonymous source sent her an email to her Daily Bugle account, and she had to admit that it enticed her. The message said that the company was secretly developing something that could change the world. Knowing Oscorp, she wasn't sure if it was a change for the better or worse. Of course, she had to check it out. Though they had never done anything wrong, Mary Jane never fully trusted Norman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, she was able to get into a tour of the facility, along with some high schoolers and children. Eventually, they reached the developmental labs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are our laboratories. Our best and brightest scientists are hard at work building a better future!\" the tour guide said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the laboratories could be seen through glass walls, but one lab had blinds covering the glass, making it impossible to see inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be in there...\" MJ muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, miss?\" the guide asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just wondering what was in that lab,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...that's top secret,\" the tour guide said with a smile. \"Now, do we have any more questions before we move on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Mary Jane, there were plenty of questions, so she had time to check out her surroundings more. Suddenly, a scientist exited the lab, and the door locked behind him. He was walking her way. MJ spotted a key card on his belt, and saw that he was getting closer. She made her way to the outer ring of the tour group, closest to where the scientist was walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he got close to her, and she quickly swiped it from his side. He didn't notice, and walked away. The tour group had finished, and had begun to head further down the hallway, away from the closed-off lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane broke from the group, and began to approach the door of the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary Jane Watson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ turned around, jolting after hearing her name. She tensed up when she saw who the voice belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman Osborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you, my dear?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Osborn! I...I'm good. how are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busy as always. What brings you to Oscorp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane sighed. \"I just...wanted to take another tour. For old time's sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're group's getting away from you,\" he said, nodding towards the group that was walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to use the restroom,\" she lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. It feels just like yesterday when you, Harry, and Peter Parker took a field trip here. How is Peter, by the way?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. We...broke up a few months ago, actually. I haven't spoken to him in a while. But he's...keeping busy, I'm sure,\" MJ explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman nodded. \"Well, I'm sorry to hear that. I thought you two were good together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We're both just really busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure. Must be nice to work at the Bugle now that Jameson's off spouting conspiracy theories on his podcast,\" Osborn chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a lot less stressful, that's for sure. How has Harry been? I haven't heard from him in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman's eyes dropped, finally breaking contact with Mary Jane's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's keeping himself occupied. The work over in Europe for Oscorp has been a lot more than we originally thought. I'll let him know that you were asking about him. I know he misses you and Peter. Anyways, I've got places to be, people to see. I'm sure I'll see you around, Miss Watson,\" Norman said, heading in the direction that the group was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later, Mr. Osborne!\" MJ said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed a sigh of relief, happy to finally be alone. That was close. She swiped the keycard on the door's scanner, and it unlocked, allowing her to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised at how sparse the lab was. there were some computers, but that was pretty much it. Except for the vial in the middle of the room. It was filled with a striking neon blue liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? This is what's supposed to change the world?\"</span></div></div>",

It shimmered blue and almost seemed to glow in the dim light of the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is kinda underwhelming\u201d she mused to herself, checking for any notes or details about the vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the computers to see if she could find anything of use on them, but most of them were heavily encrypted and protected, beyond her hacking skill, and the ones that she could look around on had nothing useful, just notes about the conditions of the room or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent over to inspect the vial, and reached out her hand, gently grabbing it and pulling it towards her face to look at closer. She held it up to the light and looked at it from every angle to see if there was anything special about it, maybe some nanites, or some other complex science crap that was well beyond her knowledge. But all she could see was that it was a blue liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard the door start to open, the beeping of a card swiping at it to get inside. It startled her and she dropped the vial, smashing it on the pedestal and sending most of the liquid splashing onto her, soaking through her clothes. Before she had time to complain she ran to hide underneath a desk, praying that she wasn\u2019t found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Bill, i swear i had it earlier\u201d she heard a voice, assuming it was the man she \u2018borrowed\u2019 a card from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw what the hell!\u201d The other voice exclaimed, noticing the smashed vial. \u201cMounting must have been unstable. That took weeks! We need to inform the others and get working on a new batch\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men left hurriedly,  and MJ crawled out of her spot, dropping the card onto the desk and making her way out of the lab, slipping out the door and back into thw main atrium quickly. She rushed to the bathroom and attempted to dry her clothes, before giving up and making her way to the exit, hiding her wet shirt under her jacket.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was glad that nobody else was on it, and rode down to the ground floor. \"Well, that was a bust...\" she muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, she left Oscorp and headed to the nearest subway station, returning to her apartment for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane's head began to spin as the subway started to move. It was almost as if she were suffering motion sickness, but she'd never had an issue with riding on the subway before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lucky that she didn't live too far from Oscorp, and got off on the second stop. As she walked up the stairs to her apartment, a wave of nausea ran over her. MJ fiddled with the keys, trying to unlock it as fast as she could, and stumbled inside. She ran to the bathroom and vomited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time she'd been sick in a while. Usually she tried to make sure that she was in tip top shape, so this was unlike her. Mary Jane flushed the toilet and wiped the sweat from her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" she moaned, her head hanging over the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Peter got sick when he got bitten by that spider. Please don't tell me I spilled the liquid form of a radioactive spider bite on myself in the lab...\" MJ grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly half an hour of vomiting, she finally felt good enough to stand, and headed to bed. As she fell asleep, her head was still spinning and it felt like her stomach was doing flips. With as miserable as she was feeling now, she desperately hoped she'd be better in the morning.</span></div></div>",

She looked at her phone, qnd rubbed her temples, the bright screen giving her a headache. Checking the time she saw that she had time before she should head into work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of bed slowly, making her way to the kitchen to grab some breakfast, if she could keep it down. She grabbed an apple and a glass of smoothie, eating slowly to make sure she didn\u2019t vomit. After eating she headed for the shower, taking her time under the hot water, tiredly washing herself. She stepped out and dried off, grabbing her clothes and getting dressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah, my boobs feel so weird\u201d she moaned, as she put on her bra, which now felt like it was digging into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished dressing, although her bra was still irritating her and it felt like her shirt had shrunk. As she left her apartment she felt her stomach rumbling, and stopped at the nearest coffee shop to her, buying a muffin amd a box of donuts, chowing down on them on her way to work, still feeling a little hungry when she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout her day at work she was nursing a headache, and worked through her projects slowly. When the office began to empty, she started to work on a side project, to find out what the liquid she found at oscorp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching for what seemed like hours she found next to nothing on it, save for that it was a secret project, which she already knew, and that it wasn\u2019t easily weaponised, which surprised her for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOscorp have a track record for military contracts, so this is new\u201d she said to herself, noting it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long she began to grow tired and signed out, heading home after what felt like the longest day of work. As she sat on the subway, her stomach grumbled loudly and she looked up, embarassed. She pulled out her phone and placed an order for two large pizzas to be at her apartment before she got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She liked to go the gym a few blocks away two or three times a week. Since she had missed out going earlier because of her illness, she made sure that she wouldn't miss out today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly changed into her regular workout attire, which were leggings and a spots top. MJ pulled the leggings up, her hand running along her thin yet fit butt, and was pleased that her top showed off her toned midsection. She smiled, happy that her bout with whatever she was sick with didn't have much of an effect on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the gym was brief, and Mary Jane always loved the cool morning air of New York, even if she knew it would heat up as the day went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the gym, she went through her usual workout. First, were squats. They went fine, but she did notice that she had much less energy than usual. And she picked up a sweat faster than normal, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more exercises, MJ jogged on the treadmill for about half an hour. Again, the fatigue hit her much quicker than she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to call it quits a few minutes early, she got showered and changed into her work clothes. As she got dressed, her stomach groaned and gurgled, nausea hitting her once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ducked into an empty stall and vomited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I thought I was finally past it...\" she moaned under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure she was finished, Mary Jane headed to the Daily Bugle, vowing not to let her nausea get the best of her. On the way, she picked up some bagels for herself, surprised that she was hungry after being so sick not even ten minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the Bugle, MJ sat at her desk, looking at the emails on her computer for any possible leads to follow. Betty Brant, the secretary, approached the desk with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, MJ! I didn't have a chance to ask you yesterday. Are you feeling any better? You usually never take off work,\" she noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks. I'm doing a lot better,\" Mary Jane replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! So, Robbie wanted me to tell you about a possible article for you to write,\" Betty handed her a press release and walked way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane grabbed the sheet of paper and read over it. Apparently, Oscorp had just struck a deal with the NYC government to set up research stations throughout the city. They would monitor air, water, and electrical statuses all around New York, ensuring that they worked to the best of their abilities. According to the release, the stations were to be managed by Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, I have no idea how Norman could be your father,\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, she began to write the article.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she stepped onto the train she added to her grocery list, making sure she had a lot more food to buy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back to her apartment, she dropped her stuff and got straight to cooking herself some dinner, deciding on pasta, cooking all that she could find in her apartment. She wolfed it down hungrily, baffled at how she could stand her appalling cooking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating she ambled her way to bed, tired from work, and full from her very large meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ woke up groggily. She sat up, and slowly opened her eyes, before swinging round and sitting on the edge of her bed. She felt her stomach start to grumble and groan, and immediately lunged towards the bathroom, retching into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust have eaten way too much last night\u201d she groaned, waiting for another round to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen another bout failed to come, she stood up and started to wash her face off. She looked in the mirror and her face changed from tiredness to confusion. She backed up and then looked at herself straight on, then turned to the side and then back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre my boobs bigger?\u201d She wondered, cupping them in her hands and inspecting them slowly. They felt tighter and sorer, and looked like they were bulging out of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got dressed, still concious of her new bust, which made her bra and her shirt feel way too tight for her comfort. Her pants felt tight as well, the buttons feeling constricting on her hips. She sighed and put on her jacket, grabbing her stuff and leaving. On her way to work she grabbed some breakfast from a coffee shop, her stomach grumbling through it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ walked into the office and waved to a few people as she made her way to her desk.

She took her seat and waited for it to start, preparing to present her stories. It took a while, but eventually the attention was on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMJ, what have you got?\u201d Asked Robbie expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI followed up on the new Oscorp project, and it came out to be a dead end, nothing noteworthy. But I\u2019ve just finished an article on the new research stations, and i can keep updating on them over the next few months\u201d she replied, showing her article from her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, keep us posted on that. On to you, brock...\u201d he began, as MJ started to zone out, stifling a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the meeting ended, MJ felt her stomach grumble, and she left to take her lunch break, heading to a nearby pizza place by herself. She ordered a large pizza and a medium, to save for later, and tried to tale jer time with them and avoid making herself sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the restaurant, feeling a little nauseous, and slowly walked back to work, and wondered about her illness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it keeps up, i should see a doctor\u201d she said to herself. \u201cMaybe i should check with aunt may, haven\u2019t seen her in a while and she always knows what to do\u201d she thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mary Jane was relived that on Fridays the Bugle closed an hour earlier than usual. She was beyond anxious to see Aunt May. Even though things could be awkward with her and Peter being broken up, she always loved her. And she knew that Aunt May absolutely adored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ took a bus that stopped in Chinatown near F.E.A.S.T. and walked a few blocks over to it, reaching the homeless shelter a few minutes before 5. Another reason why she was glad that the Bugle closed early was because Aunt May would probably have already left by the time she would have gotten off work normally. She was already cutting it close as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside F.E.A.S.T., she was surprised to see how well things were going. The last time she had been inside it was when she and Peter were still together, and it wasn't in the best of shape. Now, things really seemed to be running smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked through the cafeteria to Aunt May's office, she was approached by a man wearing a suit and tie with his sleeves rolled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, miss?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was looking for May Parker,\" she replied, blushing as her stomach let out a low rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded. \"Ah. You must be Mary Jane Watson. She's told me a lot about you. I'm Martin Li.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put out his hand, which MJ shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. It's nice to meet you, Mr. Li.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, too. May's office is upstairs. Can't miss it,\" he smiled, going back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane nodded and walked up the nearest stairwell. Sure enough, Aunt May's office greeted her as soon as she got to the second floor. Inside, May was reorganizing her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ stood in the doorway and knocked on the wall. Aunt May looked up and beamed when she saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary Jane!\" she rushed over to MJ and hugged her, nearly knocking the wind out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you too, Aunt May...\" Mary Jane giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's been too long. How are you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane sighed. \"I'm good. Daily Bugle's keeping me busy. Actually...I have been pretty sick this week. Just a lot of nausea, and I'm still feeling a little off. Do you have anything that could help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt May's eyes lit up. \"I have just the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the mini-fridge in her office and grabbed a bottle. She explained that it was homemade tea that contained all-natural herbs that would make her feel better in no time. To be honest, MJ didn't entirely listen to all of the ingredients that were in the tea, since her hunger was keeping her preoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Aunt May. I really appreciate it,\" Mary Jane said, bottle of tea in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time, sweetheart. I'll tell Peter that you're doing well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at her apartment, MJ took a swig of Aunt May's tea. It tasted great, and if it did help cure her nausea she was all for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, her stomach rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, why am I so hungry now?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her cellphone and dialed the closest Chinese restaurant. As she waited, she sat on her couch and watched TV, alternating between the news and a few shows. After what seemed like an eternity, it finally arrived. She put the bag on the coffee table in front of the couch, unveiling many boxes of noodles, rice, dumplings, and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as she could, she grabbed the chopsticks that came with the food and chowed down. Nearly an hour passed, and Mary Jane finally finished. She stifled a burp and was shocked at how much she ate, observing the dozen empty boxes that scattered the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I really eat that much? I need to hit the gym tomorrow,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another sigh, MJ stood up and stretched. As she did, she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was bloated. It wasn't too noticeable, but it was still there. She guess she couldn't be too surprised, with how much she had eaten over the past few days, but it still concerned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed a hand into her puffy tummy, feeling how firm it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Definitely need to go to the gym,\" she said with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling exhausted from a busy week, she threw the boxes away and headed to bed. As she lay down, her hand rested on her stomach as it gurgled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sat up and got out of bed, silently celebrating her now gone sickness, and making a mental note to thank Aunt may for her remedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up to go to the bathroom, and glanced at herself in the mirror. Her belly was bloated. Not massively but big enough that it was noteworthy. She prodded it and felt its firmness, remembering her promise to go to the gym and burn it off. If anything it seemed to be bigger than she recalled, though not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got dressed to go to the gym, putting on some loose sweatpants and a sports bra that felt far too tight on her boobs, and a gym top. She sighed as the top wouldn\u2019t pull all the way over her bloat, leaving a thin sliver o belly exposed. She grabbed a smoothie from the fridge and headed to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the gym she decided to start off with some ab workouts, to see if they would help with her pot belly. She tried crunches first, and felt they were helping, going on for a few more sets. After, she moved onto sit ups, finding them a lot harder given her belly was stopping her from properly bending over for them. She stopped, taking a break, and downing what was left of her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed to the treadmill, picking up a bottle of water on her way. She started off at a slow jog, and then eased the speed up till she was at a good running pace. She kept it up for a few minutes, and then started to run out of breath, to her annoyance. She could usually go for a lot longer. She turned down the speed to a fast walk, catching her breath as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her a woman started up, going at a similar pace to her. MJ looked at her and saw that the woman was heavily pregnant, her belly looking ready to pop at any moment. The woman looked at MJ, panning up from her abdomen to her face and smiled, confusing her. She smiled back politely, but confused. People didn\u2019t usually do that, and not least the pregnant members of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the gym, feeling starved and eager to have her breakfast, her stomach grumbling and empty. She got back into her apartment and started to make her breakfast, making toaster waffles and bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda defeats the point of going to the gym\u201d she noted, the smells in her kitchen driving her to keep cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat on her sofa with her breakfast in hand, and a mouthful of waffles, she opened her laptop to try something. She gave one last search, as thorough as she could be, into the syrum, desperate to find out about it. But like every other search, she found nothing.</span></div></div>",

How could it possibly change the world? Was it truly behind her recent illness, and could it be more serious for her than just throwing up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were too many questions, and too few answers. Usually, when something peaked MJ's curiosity, some investigation would eventually lead a solution. But with whatever was in that vial, she seemed to hit dead end after dead end. It frustrated her to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bright side, at least she wasn't vomiting anymore. Speaking of, that reminded her to check in with Aunt May to thank her. She dialed her number, and soon enough Aunt May picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Aunt May! It's me, Mary Jane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi! How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ stood up and started to walk around the apartment. \"I'm good, I'm good. I was actually calling you because of that. That tea you gave me really worked wonders. Absolutely zero nausea today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's great! I'm so happy to hear that, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ laughed. \"I don't want to take anymore of your time, Aunt May. Thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time! I'll talk to you soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ put her phone down. \"She is such a saint...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours and a shower later, Mary Jane was getting hungry again. She put on some clothes that would be presentable for leaving her apartment, pleased that it covered up her recent bloating, and headed to the one place she knew would never disappoint: Mick's Diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk from her apartment wasn't too far, and she figured getting some more exercise wouldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, she heard sirens and the revving of engines approaching. A car sped by, with men hanging out of the windows, firing at the cop cars behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, MJ heard a noise. A noise she was all too familiar to hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA web stuck to the back of the car, and Spider-Man launched himself to the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, boys! You forgot your speeding ticket! Come on, you can't be hiding anything too illegal in there, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd gone through this early a hundred times now, and made quick work of the criminals, stopping their car before it did any real damage. Before the police could catch up, Spider-Man swung away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane shook her head as she approached the diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always the showman...\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Mick's, MJ grabbed a booth near the window and looked out at the city. The waitress handed her a menu, and she raised an eyebrow when she read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did Mick's become an Italian restaurant?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress returned a minute later to take her order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I get for you?\" the waitress asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ's stomach rumbled, causing her face to go as red as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I'll have an order of the fries. Actually, make that two. Also, can I get a small pepperoni pizza and the chicken parm?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress nodded and smiled. \"Absolutely! I'll get that right in for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took Mary Jane's menu, leaving her to herself. Shortly after, her food arrived, and she dug in quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even fifteen minutes later, she was finished, leaving no plate unempty. Satisfied with the meal, May Jane paid for the food and headed back to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ opened the door of her apartment, her free hand cradling her bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...you can't stay in shape if you keep eating like this, girl...\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were spent watching TV, and she found herself exhausted, even after not doing that much all day. With a yawn, Mary Jane stood up from the couch and headed to bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>MJ woke up to the blaring sound of her alarm. She opened her eyes and reached over to shut it off. After a weekend of not doing a lot, the alarm was a rude awakening for her. She got out of bed and headed to her kitchen to make a cup of coffee, recalling what she had done yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had started with a morning run, and then a trip to rhe gym to trim her belly away. But again, her hunger got the best of her and she indulged in a full breakfast, reversing any work done at the gym. She went home and began writing up some notes on that weeks crimes stopped by good old spider-man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished making her coffee and headed to her room, sipping it. She noted that it tasted more bitter than usual, despite her adding more sugar than normal. She walked into the bathroom to shower, and started to get changed, and saw her reflection. Her belly was getting bigger, now sticking out even more than it had that weeked. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta stop eating so much\u201d she said, patting it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her shower she started to get dressed for work, grabbing some jeans and a button up shirt. As she pulled her jeans up she got to her waist, starting to button them up. She struggled with the last button, pulling as hard as she could, but it kept digging into her belly. She sighed, and then remembered a trick a friend taught her. She grabbed a a hairband and looped it around the button and through the hole. She smiled as it fit in, keeping her belly from busting her jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished dressing, her shirt just hiding her belly and her jacket helping with hiding it as well. With that she set off for work, grabbing breakfast on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt work, MJ started writing up the notes she had made on the endeavours of spider-man, noting a few recent sitings from social media, and the recent crime he stopped. She opened up a video of it happening and watched it a few times to get a good gist of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey MJ\u201d she heard Betty call \u201chow was your weekend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, didn\u2019t do much though\u201d she replied, turning around from her work<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh nice, me too\u201d she smiles \u201cwanna go grab lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ looked at the time. \u201cYeah sure, anywhere in particular?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheres a new mexican place down the road i wanted to try\u201d she smiled, handing MJ her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat in the restaurant and talked about the last week, and how things had been going. They talked about MJs new article on spiderman and how it was going,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith the stuff I\u2019ve said about him, Jameson would have had me fired\u201d she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, i always thought he was way too hard on him\u201d Betty replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. He does a lot of good, more than he does bad\u201d she replied, her private knowledge of him popping up in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate and talked for a while, before heading back to work, where MJ finished her article.</span></div></div>",

She got off a stop earlier than she normally would, and headed to the nearest grocery store, a small independent place that she liked to frequent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the grocery store, MJ picked up what she usually got when she went shopping every two weeks. As it turned out, she had to make her visit a little earlier in the week than she typically did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, her rumbling stomach made sure that her shopping cart was much more full than usual. She sighed as she picked up some noodles. She piled ice cream, which she usually tried to stay away from, chips, and frozen pizza into the cart. The weirdest thing she got was a jar of pickles. Normally, she detested them. But now, she actually really wanted to get some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally filling up the cart, Mary Jane paid for all of the groceries and left for her apartment, multiple bags filled groceries in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the apartment, MJ set the bags in the kitchen and began to unpack them. To make things more difficult, her stomach was constantly making noises, almost as if it was demanding that she ate the food she spent nearly an hour buying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane rubbed it slowly to try and quell the rumbling, annoyed at how tight and round it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go to the gym again. Maybe tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got everything put away, she began to make dinner. Pasta and bread were on the menu tonight. MJ wanted something relatively healthy that still tasted good, and even with her unpredictable cooking she could still find some enjoyment out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like it lasted forever, but Mary Jane finally finished cooking, and couldn't wait to start eating. She doused the pasta with cheese and slathered the bread in butter, again a break from her norms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ could only shake her head, but even that stopped when she actually took her first bite. She practically moaned when she tasted the food. She tried to savor it, but before she knew it she had finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a warehouse by the docks, a master plan was beginning to unfold. A van pulled into the parking lot, which was empty except for one other car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure this is safe?\" a man with a ski mask on asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. The boss knows what he's doing,\" the other man replied, who also had his face covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still wondering when you're going to let me meet this guy you're working for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might not get to. He's a very smoke and mirrors kinda guy. Doesn't do a lot of face to face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready.\"</span></div></div>",

She resolved to get out of bed, and threw her cocers off, immediately throwing them back on after seeing beneath. Slowly she peeled them off, revealing her swollen belly, bigger than amy other day so far. Her shirt had ridden up, baring the tight skin, and she could barely see her toes behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u201d she said, tentatively placing her hands on it, feeling the tight skin. \u201cI have got to stop eating, it must be giving me a bad reaction or something\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heaved herself out of bed, struggling with the new weight in her belly, swinging her legs off the bed, and standing uneasily with her hands on her back. She made her way to the kitchen, grabbing a pot of yogurt, trying to have a small breakfast before heading to the gym. She quickly grabbed another, soon after finishing the first faster than she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her room she laid out her gym clothes on her bed and stared at them, wondering how in earth she would fit in them. She started with her shirt, stretching it over herself and starting to pull it down, covering her breasts and starting on her belly, but reaching only above her belly button. She huffed in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll have to do i guess\u201d she says, grabbing her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a far harder time pulling them on, struggling to bend over and pull them up. She managed to, but when she reached her hips she found it once again a struggle to hoist them up over her hips, feeling tighter than before, and pulling them up left them far too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d She said, huffing slightly out of breath. \u201cScrew the gym\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled off her shirt in frustration, and shimmied her way out of her pants, grabbing some clothes for work instead. She put on a large loose t-shirt to try and cover her belly, before grabbing a pair of jeans, using the hairband trick to make them stay comfortable around her belly. She pulled on her jacket, put on a scarf, and slipped into her shoes. She stopped in the kitchen and grabbed a croissant and some snack bars for breakfast before heading off to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt work she resigned herself to her desk, worried that someone would see it and get suspicious about her condition. Luckily for her it hid her belly. Unfortunately she kept having to go to the bathroom, which became a risky mission to hide her belly on the way. Her morning was spent between her desk and the bathroom, which left her starving for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left for lunch to a deli nearby, grabbing a sandwich and plenty of snacks, for lunch and to keep her going through the day. She had a packet of chips by her side as she was typing up some notes on a new spidey article, breaking every now and again with a handfull of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey MJ\u201d she heard, as Betty walked towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Betty!\u201d She panicked, finishing her mouthful of chips and turning to her, at angle to hide her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying your snack\u201d she laughed back, MJ giggling in reply. \u201cRobbie has a new story for you, sounds interesting\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh tell me about it\u201d she smiled, pausing as she felt a flutter in her stomach, passing it off as gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty handed her a small folder. \u201cA small scale lab had a whole bunch of tech stolen from a warehouse by the docks\u201d she said, showing her the file. \u201cSounds right up your alley\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the file and read through it, something about the robbery pricking her memory, reminding her of something. \u201cI\u2019ll get right on it, I\u2019ll head down there now\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun\u201d Betty grinned, knowing MJs reputation for \u2018crazy stunts\u2019 as robbie had put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warehouse wasn\u2019t too far away, a few stops on the subway, and MJ arrived, ready to investigate. She had her jacket done up slightly to hide her belly, but it wasn\u2019t doing the best job if she was honest. She walked up to the police line and flashed her badge, gaining her entry into the scene. She looked around and snapped a few photos, before moving onto conducting interviews with the workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Mary Jane Watson for the daily bugle\u201d she said, approaching a man who worked at the warehouse. \u201cMind if I ask you some questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh sure\u201d he replied, with a noticeable Brooklyn accent. His eyes darted to her belly quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you tell me what was stolen?\u201d She asked, trying to keep focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh nothing major, just a lot of our basic components and stuff\u201d he replied, still distracted by her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can we stay focused please\u201d she snapped, trying not to sound too demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man answered a few more questions, and then she thanked him and moved onto other workers, gaining a picture of the scene.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Getting everything in order, Mary Jane took note of everything she could. She thanked the people that she interviewed, and headed back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Bugle, MJ piled over the statements she got. It honestly didn't really make sense. If what one of the interviewees said was true, then only some minor components were stolen. Usually in theft cases like this, they'd usually go after items that would be more valuable. The components stolen in this case would barely get you $50.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless the thieves aren't trying to sell the parts at all. Maybe they're using them for something else...\" she mused, a hand on her round, swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane scoffed and removed her hand, shaking her head. She was doing that a lot lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind ran through the possibility of what the thieves could be up to. Were they actually using the parts for their own needs? Was she wrong about that? Was it possible that this wouldn't be the last time that they struck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that last question, MJ figured that her only option was to wait and see. For now, she chalked it up to a one-off that wouldn't ever resurface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane's thoughts were interrupted by Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, MJ,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ looked up, subconsciously scooting her seat forward to hide her belly. \"Hey, Betty! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, me and a few friends are going out clubbing tonight. I was just wondering if you were interested in coming along!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go clubbing in the middle of the week?\" Mary Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty nodded. \"Yeah, we have a great time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I really appreciate the offer, but I've just been exhausted the past few nights. I'm already a little worn-down right now. I think I'm going to pass, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay! I'm sure Robbie would prefer that his best reporter didn't come in with a hangover tomorrow anyways,\" Betty laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Thanks, though!\" MJ said as Betty returned to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Mary Jane packed her things and started to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Betty,\" she said as she passed the secretary's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night, MJ--\" Betty stopped herself when she saw Mary Jane's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jacket had no chance of hiding it when she was walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She was huge! She almost looked...pregnant,</i> Betty thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be seeing things,\" Betty said, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the subway, it was surprisingly packed. Normally, Mary Jane would have no trouble finding an empty seat, but no such luck today. She stood, one hand on a railing with another on her back, subconsciously accentuating her belly even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, a man stood up and motioned towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, ma'am? Feel free to take my seat,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? Thank you...\" she replied, happily taking his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ sighed when she entered her apartment. She was right when she was talking to Betty earlier. She was exhausted. After putting her jacket on the coat rack, she leaned against the door and tried to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane looked down at her stomach. It was getting big. She held it gently in her hands, feeling the pale tight skin. Another squirm, like the one she felt earlier, moved underneath her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't get rid of it if I don't do anything about it!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ made her way to her bedroom as quickly as she could to change back into her gym clothes. With the state she was in, she didn't want to be seen in a gym, but she could still do some workouts at her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in the mirror once she got dressed and turned to the side. Her butt was huge. When did that happen? And of course, her breasts were still swollen. If her belly hadn't grown, maybe this \"illness\" was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the belly really put a damper on things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the living room, Mary Jane sat on the floor. Her first option was to do some crunches. She couldn't even do that. Her stomach was so big that it made it nearly impossible, and extremely uncomfortable even when she could sit up all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, MJ slowly stood up and headed to the kitchen, upset that she couldn't even work out properly anymore. Vowing to eat healthy, she grabbed some salad from the refrigerator and ate, but not before putting plenty of dressing and croutons on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Mary Jane headed to bed, her stomach rumbling with hunger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>MJ woke up to the sound of grumbling and a slightly pained feeling emanating from her stomach. She opened her eyes, surprised to see that it was still dark out, with very little light illuminating her bedroom. She turned her bedside lamp on, and slowly got out of bed. She stood up and held her hands on her back, supporting it. A glance at the clock told her that it was about 1:45 in the morning. MJ started walking to the kitchen, noting that her belly felt heavier and, if anything looked bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to the kitchen and immediately went for the fridge. MJ scoured it for snacks, absent-mindedly rubbing the bare section of her belly. She grabbed some sushi, some pickles, and a bunch of toasted meals as well as some stuff for the microwave, rushing around the kitchen to prepare it all. The smells coming from around her drove her hunger further and she became far more excited to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the microwave pinged and the toaster popped up MJ grabbed her food and began wolfing it down, wanting so badly to savour it, the taste feeling amazing on her tongue, but she just ate quickly, filling her empty stomach. She grabbed a pickle and wolfed it down with some sushi, the combination somehow appealing to her, so much so that she tried it again, and again. As she ate, drips and crumbs dropped onto her belly, running down the bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate she felt squirming from her belly, strange movements across her bump. It came and went, popping up between mouthfuls or stopping for a bit and the suddenly coming back later. In her current state, MJ put it down to her stomach reacting to finally being full, and digesting loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her midnight feast came to an end, but by that point MJ felt too full to eat anything more. She sat for a bit and rubbed her full stomach, massaging the tight orb before heaving herself up and heading back to bed, this time with a full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ woke up again, this time to her alarms loud declaration to wake up. She groaned and slapped it off, opening her eyes to bright light shining through her window, and threw off her covers. Standing up slowly, she walked to the bathroom and saw in the mirror that her belly had gotten bigger, protruding off her frame like a beachball. Her tank top was now more of a crop top, or more of a bra, only covering her now generous bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u201d she mumbled, pressing her hands into the tight skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane sighed and walked to her wardrobe, searching for anything that might fit her. Her search turned up dry, resolving for a pair of jeans and a releatively big button up shirt, hoping that it could cover her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with the jeans, she struggled to bend over and pull them up, and even clearing that it was a further struggle to fit them around her hips and booty. When they finally were one, MJ neglected the hairband trick, fearing it would make the jeans even tighter. Then came the shirt, which started off well over her breasts, but strained dangerously over her belly, digging in a little, and each button pulling apart, creating little windows to her swollen belly through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna have to do\u201d she sighed, frustrated<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane threw on her jacket and a large scarf, trying to cover as much belly as possible. With one last glance in the mirror, she headed off to work, grabbing a hearty breakfast on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt work everyone was already in the meeting, talking about their weekend plans and other things. Except Robbie, who was sat at the head of the table wondering where his top reporter was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetty where is Mary Jane? Shes late\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo idea. She\u2019s been kinda off the past few we-\u201c she started, cut off by the sudden entrance of Mary Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry im late\u201d she said, flustered and looking a little red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked a right state, blushing profusely, and her shirt tight onher belly. The belly that no one had noticed for a week. Her shirt was practically showing it off, letting them all see her tight pale skin beneath it. Some noticed her jeans weren\u2019t done up, but dared not to speak up. She sat down on a chair and looked ready to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay miss watson?\u201d Robbie asked, concerned about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah im fine, just a bad reaction\u201d MJ replied, rubbing her belly underneath the table as she felt the squirming again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm fine, i swear\u201d she snapped. \u201cCan we just get on with this please\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we can\u201d Robbie replied, a little shocked. \u201cMiss Watson, that lab story you\u2019ve been doing? There was another break in, different lab but similar conditions. Look into it\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded at him and noted it down. He moved onto the next person, and MJ began to zone out, distracted by the feeling in her belly. Like a squirming or something. It persisted for the rest of the hour long meeting, putting her off when she should have been paying attention. When the meeting ended, she was the first one out, rushing to the bathroom as fast as she could. When she was finishes, MJ grabbed her bag and set off to the new scene of a break in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked towards the lab, flashing her badge to the officer outside, lifting the police line and entering. It was a similar scene to the previous break in, equipment moved about and thrown around, storage lockers opened and rifled through thoroughly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ walked around and began her interviews, starting with a woman in a lab coat, who smiled at her as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Mary Jane Watson for the daily bugle, mind if i ask a few questions?\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d replied the woman, smiling. \u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat sort of stuff was-\u201cshe felt a grumble and blushed. \u201c-stolen\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLow value materials, wiring and the like. There were a few machines that were ripped apart for some materials as well\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, and do you-\u201c another grumble, followed by a squirm \u201c-think anything dangerous can be made from the stolen items?\u201d She blushed harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the most capable hands yes, but it doesn\u2019t appear that the theives are the most capable\u201d she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ went to start another question, but another strong squirm put her off and she blushed in embarrassment. \u201cI am so sorry about this\u201d she said, her belly grumbling. \u201cIts just so distracting\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts okay, I completely understand\u201d replied the woman, smiling knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ smiled back and carried on the interview, with a few distractions from her belly dotted throughout. She moved on and conducted interviews with several other workers, all telling her similar stories. As she finished her last interview, Mary Jane noticed a slightly ajar door, and her curiosity took over. She snuck in and found the security room, screens all over the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha, maybe this will reveal whos behind this\u201d she grinned, finding the security footage from the previous night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought it up and watched, switching from screen to screen, following the thieves around the lab. She sped up the footage, partly because she didn\u2019t want to be caught where she shouldn\u2019t be, but partly to suss out where the thieves went after they left. Switching to the outside camera, the robbers could be seen running to a van with their loot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBingo\u201d MJ grinned, saving the clip to her hard drive to scour over later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at work, Mary Jane was sat at her desk, the security footage on loop on her laptop, noting down every detail she could find. The van had no license plate, but there was a scratched up logo on the side, that looked like a pack of cards. Her stomach gave a sudden loud grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she got up, and made her way to the vending machine, pulling several notes out of her wallet. MJ grabbed a few chip packets and some sweets, returning to her desk, already snacking on her mini feast.</span></div></div>",

All the while, she munched on some cookies. The chewing was so loud that she could barely hear Betty approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey MJ...\" she muttered, a little intimidated at the sight in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi. What's up, Betty?\" MJ asked, her hand resting on top of her increasingly rounding dome of a stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I was just wondering...if everything was okay? With you?\" Betty wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane's stomach rumbled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...you've been a bit...off...all week? I just want to make sure that you're doing alright,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You mean this?\" Mary Jane asked, patting her stomach, which gurgled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty, I'm fine. Thank you for checking on me, but I promise I'm fine. I've just been eating terribly for a few weeks now, and I think it's catching up to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty nodded, a look of dismay on her face as she stared at MJ's protruding belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gurgled and groaned, and Betty swore she even saw it move. Mary Jane winced, but smiled to try and alleviate the secretary's fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Betty could say anything else, the button on MJ's jeans popped off. It was a miracle that it closed in the first place, so it wasn't really surprising that it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane gasped and looked down, a hand fondling for the now-removed button. She looked up at Betty, her face red as a beet. That was also happening a lot lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty also blushed, and finally looked away. \"Oh! I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty covered her face and hurried away. MJ, finally recovering from that embarrassing moment, grabbed a rubber band from her desk and used it to button her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is happening to me?\" Mary Jane asked, a particularly strong squirm in her belly making her rest her hands on the bump once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was uneventful, and Mary Jane stuck to her desk until it was time to leave. Quietly and as quickly as she could, she headed back to her apartment, not bothering to say goodbye to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally back home, MJ buried her hands in her face. Something was seriously wrong with her, and she had no idea what. She looked down at her massive stomach and watched as it heaved in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was huge, and felt like it was getting bigger every time she looked. For all she knew, maybe she actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could be the cause of this? She couldn't be pregnant, she knew that. A bad reaction surely wouldn't cause her to balloon as big as this. Could it be a tumor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane placed her hands on her round bump as it quivered and groaned. Whatever was wrong with her, she needed to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbuttoning her shirt to breathe easier, her massive belly hung out in the open as she grabbed her phone. She contacted her doctor, requesting a checkup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ didn't really go deep into detail about what the issue was, because to be honest even she wasn't entirely sure. Able to slip in an appointment for tomorrow morning, she sighed in relief. Even if something was seriously wrong with her, at least she'd find out in due time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe changed into some more comfortable clothes, consisting of running shorts and a t-shirt. The shorts hugged her larger bottom, while her t-shirt revealed a sliver of her belly. She rubbed her hands over it, feeling that her belly button was nearly flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a fast but large dinner, Mary Jane trudged to bed, ignoring the stirring in her stomach as she drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sudden stirrings in her stomach woke MJ up. She groaned as the stirrings became more intense, forcing her to wake up properly, opening her eyes and glaring at her belly. She threw back her covers to access her grumbling stomach, but was caught off guard by the it. It had grown overnight, bulging off her skinny frame like a beachball, her skin pulled tight and sore over whatever was inside her. She saw something ripple on her belly, subtle and small but there, squirming and stirring in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u201d she groaned as she heaved herself put of bed, scared of what was happening to her. Even can't trying to push herself up got her out of breath, and she leant against her dresser to steady herself, unaccustomed to her new centre of balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled her way to the bathroom, the light feeling bright as it flickered on. She watched herself in the mirror as she stripped off, staring anxiously at her body, feeling self-conscious despite being the only person there. Turning around to the shower, her belly brushed against the countertop, knocking off some toothpaste and some makeup. She sighed, knowing how much of a struggle it would be to pick up, and ignored it for the time being. MJ stepped into the shower and felt some of the tension in her body soften as the hot water ran down her rounded belly. Hesitantly, her hands washed soapy water over her stomach, feeling and seeing flutters ripple across her belly, and she felt tears drip from her eyes, feeling scared and alone. She wept quietly, letting the shower wash the tears away before wiping her face and turning off the water, struggling to dry her frame with even two towels. She turned and bumped against a cabinet, shaking it and threatening to knock it over, steadying it with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the bathroom, her hair still drying in a wrapped up towel, MJ laid out the most loose-fitting clothes she could find from her closet. Sighing in resignation at the idea that anything would fit, she grabbed her pants, a pair of loose black slacks, that she hoped would cover her. She sat down on the bed and stepped into them, now faced with the daunting task of pulling them up. Struggling, MJ bent over and grabbed the waistband, hoisting them up her legs, fitting fairly comfortably compared to other items. She stood up and began to button them up, barely even making it up the first button, resigning to the hairband trick again. However, it proved less successful, still leaving a small window to her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came her shirt, a flowing white tee, that she tended to use as pyjamas, or when she lazed about her apartment. An attempt had been made to get a bra on, but her breasts had grown significantly from her normal cup size, none of them even reaching around. She pulled her top over her head and over her growing bust, managing to yank it over them, but some cleavage being left on display. Her belly was a different matter, the shirt making it just over halfway before it would no longer pull down, leaving the bottom few inches open to the elements, the shirt just hanging off her bump. She grabbed a dark blue flannel shirt and put it on, hoping it would distract from the bottom portion of her belly hanging out of her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over herself in the mirror, Mary-jane felt she looked presentable, although she knew that she looked funny, her belly sticking out painfully obviously. she kept trying to pull down the hem of her first to try and cover some more of her belly. She slipped into a pair of slip-on shoes, glad she had bought them all those weeks ago, saving her from the effort of having to try and tie her laces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey to the doctors had been quick, MJ not wanting to spend more time being seen how she was than was absolutely needed. She waddled to the desk and signed in with the sweet older lady who usually manned the reception, who congratulated MJ to her confusion. Tired, and her belly weighing down on her, MJ grabbed a seat in the empty waiting room. She struggled to sit comfortably in the chair, however, her hips digging into the armrests, and her heavy belly filling her lap entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dMiss Watson?\u201d called one of the nurses, poking her head out from the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHere\u201d MJ stated as she started to stand up. Her hips had other ideas, as they were now fairly jammed into the seat, the armrests digging uncomfortably into her thighs. She grunted as she tried to stand up, and blushed with intense embarrassment when the nurse walked over to help her out of the seat, levering her hand between her hips and the chair to let her move. Thanking her profusely for her help, MJ walked into her doctors office, nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGood morning miss wat-\u201d started her doctor, who was cut short upon turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dyeah I know\u201d she replied quietly as she sat on a, thankfully spacious, chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHow did this happen? I saw you two months ago and there were no signs of any sort of growth\u201d he stated in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dit started about a week ago, and it was preceded by really bad flu\u201d she said, unconsciously cradling her belly. \u201dintense vomiting, that sort of thing\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer doctor pulled put a pair of scales and set them down on the floor. \u201dif you would please step on the scales\u201d he said politely, still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heaved herself up, eased by some assistance from the doctor and stepped forward onto the scales. She looked down to try and peek at the result, but her mountain of a belly blocked her view, covering anything going on below her. \u201dhow much is it?\u201d she asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dabout 170lbs, up from your previous weight of 120\u201d he said, grabbing a tape measure. \u201dcould you pull up your shirt please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ obliged and slowly pulled up her shirt, tucking it under her breasts and baring her belly. He started by gently squeezing it between his gloved hands, on the sides, then from top to bottom, with a few prods and pokes between, and then lightly shifting it from side to side. He then began to measure it, first from top to bottom, then scribbling down the result. He began to go around her belly, starting at her flattened belly button, but a sudden squirm made him stop in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dcould you lie down on there please\u201d he said, gesturing to the bed in the centre of the room, before leaving to grab something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ lay down on it, her nerves getting to her as she began to fear the worst, his sudden change in method spooking her. She held her belly as she waited for the doctor. He walked back in with a large machine trailing behind him. He flipped a few switches and it buzzed to life, and as it warmed up he began to further poke and prod her belly, testing it for more flickers or squirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dthis will feel quite cold\u201d he said, before squirting some gel onto her belly and picking up a wand from the machine. That told MJ that it was an ultrasound. And as the wand made contact with her belly she realised what might be happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWell miss Watson it seems-\u201d her doctor started, \u201d-that you are expecting\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dh-how? And how am I so big?\u201d she stammered, confused and even more scared at the prospect of being pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGive me a second\u201d her doctor said, trailing off as he concentrated on a screen, moving the wand all over her bulging belly. \u201done\u201d he said, quietly as if to try and hide it from her. \u201dtwo, three, four\u201d he said, the numbers going up, making MJs heart start to race. \u201dfive, six\u201d two more, and she tightened her grip on the bed, scared. \u201dIt appears that you are carrying seve-no, eight foetuses\u201d he finished, making sure he had been right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe revelation hit MJ hard, as her mind raced through every possibility, from how it happened, to how she was carrying eight babies, or why everything had happened so fast. She sat up and wiped off her belly as her doctor gave her some information about pregnancy, handing her some pamphlets and the number for an OB/GYN, but most of what he said fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ made her way home in silent resignation. She was in shock, and her belly felt somehow more alien than before, as if she was afraid to touch or rub it. She unlocked the door to her apartment and stepped inside, collapsing on her sofa. She looked down at her belly, deep in thought, and tentatively pulled up her shirt, starting to caress the bare surface. She wondered what she would do, and how she would explain it to her boss, all while caressing her taut pulled and pale skin, as she felt tiny flickers beneath her fingertips.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mary Jane's head spun as her hands rested on her pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPregnant. She was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith eight babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was this possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was so cluttered at the moment, full with thoughts on the pregnancy, the job, and this recent series of break-ins, that she couldn't focus on just one thing. At least she didn't have to go to the Bugle today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked on helplessly as her belly shifted and bulged, the lives within her moving and growing. Mary Jane could only shake her head and look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ needed to take her mind off of things, or at least clear her mind somewhat. That's when the thought crossed her mind. There was a park nearby. It was almost always quiet. That'd be a perfect place to go to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem would be getting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Mary Jane rose to her feet, her legs wobbling under the weight of her belly. Finally getting upright and finding her balance, she waddled to the front door, but was stopped by a loud growl from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been so preoccupied with the doctor's appointment that she completely forgot to eat. On the way to the park, she stopped by a local bakery and grabbed a dozen donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the park, MJ trudged towards a bench and sat down, her belly completely filling her lap. She placed the box of donuts beside her and ate quickly, her hunger overcoming her. Within minutes, the box was empty, and she stood up to throw it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next thirty minutes, Mary Jane waddled around the park, taking in the sights and sounds of the peaceful area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she expected, it was a nice break away from everything, except for the occasional passerby who couldn't keep their eyes off her massive belly as they walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she walked around the park, MJ was exhausted. Her belly heaved in and out as she tried to catch her breath. That signaled that it was time for her to head home. It'd been quite the day so far, so some rest was much-needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling a few blocks back to her apartment, she suddenly stopped when she saw a van. It had a familiar design on the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pack of cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould this be the same van that was at the recent break-ins? Mary Jane had to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as she could now, she followed it, thankful that the crosswalk lights were on her side for once. She kept a careful distance, not wanting to look suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it looked like the van was slowing down, as if it were close to its destination, and luckily it wasn't too far from her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen MJ heard it. A thwip of a web. She looked up and saw Spider-Man swinging above, perched on top of a building, looking down at the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane quickly hid from his view. He couldn't see her like this. No way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he tracking the case as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I'll let you handle it this time, Pete...\" she mumbled as she turned around and waddled back to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was uneventful, as she spent the hours eating and prodding her belly, still trying to wrap her head around this sudden massive pregnancy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>MJ was sat up in her bed, watching her belly. She had been, rather rudely when she thought about it, woken by some fairly intense squirms and kicks, and had been watching the taut surface for a good twenty minutes. Occasionally she would poke it when the movement stopped, only for a flurry of kicks to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dthis is so strange\u201d she mused as she watched a new wave of kicks ripple across her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she sighed, realising that she needed to get up eventually. She knew it was going to be a struggle, given how much her belly kept growing every day. Since the previous day its growth wasn't significant, but it was definitely getting bigger, taking up a sizeable portion of her lap when she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pivoted herself to the edge of her bed, the action taking the wind out of her, rubbing her belly as she quickly caught her breath. She swung her legs out, knowing she wouldn't be on her feet by the first try, but hoping she could get some momentum to help her up. A few more swings and she heaved herself up onto her feet, steadying herself against her bedside table, her balance being shifted further each day. Yawning she stretched for a moment and set off to her kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set up her laptop on the worktop and set about getting some work done while she made herself breakfast. Cautiously she pushed it far from the edge, conscious that her belly had a dangerous tendency to bump into anything standing in its path. She grabbed a pack of waffles from her cupboard, packing all of them into her microwave, her brood driving her to hunger. While MJ waited for the telltale ping to sign that they were done, she began to do a quick search for information relating to the van, trying to find the company logo. The sudden ping followed by beeping distracted her, however, and she turned her attention to perfecting her waffle masterpiece, topping it with whipped cream and assorted fruits from her fridge. Satisfied with her work, she carried it to the sitting room and set it down on the coffee table, returning to fetch her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the sofa, glad to be off her feet. She leaned forward, trying to grab her breakfast, her belly proving as a barrier to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201doh come one\u201d she moaned as she sat up from her comfortable position to grab the plate, resting it on her shelf of a belly. \u201dwell there's a good use of you I guess\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she feasted on her indulgent breakfast, she continued with her work, discovering a little more about the logo, mostly only that the company had been a stage company, until a few years ago they were bought out by an unknown buyer. That alone was enough to peak her curiosity. However after a morning spent digging for more clues, she began to draw up less and less. She opened her phone and ordered herself some lunch from a local burger joint, her stomach growling for more food. She ordered hastily, stacking up her order with several large meals, her hunger overpowering any sense to order slightly more conservatively<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer food soon arrived and she heaved herself off her chair, rubbing the sliver of underbelly bared by her too-small shirt absentmindedly. she opened the door to see the delivery man, who looked at her briefly, in slight shock, before handing her the bag and leaving. She shut her door, blushing, not only because of her appearance, but also due to the speed she grabbed the bag from his hands. Her stomach grumbled as she sat back down on the sofa and opened the bag, the smells driving her wild with hunger. she unpacked her meal and began to chow down, moaning in satisfaction at the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"at least this belly means a lot of food\" she noted, rubbing her immense bump, as she felt some gentle squirms. \"silver linings i guess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept eating, as she set up a film on her laptop, deciding to take it easy for the rest of the day. she lay on the sofa, caressing her belly slowly, enjoying her afternoon. <i>maybe this whole pregnancy thing isn't going to be all bad.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ had decided to get into work early. She strode through the quiet office, her pale green jumper only just covering her belly, a pale sliver of skin bared at her waistband. She dropped her stuff off at her desk, before making her way towards Robbie's office, mentally preparing herself to break the news to him. she stood outside the door for a moment before she finally built up the courage to give it a knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in\" he said, looking up from his desk as MJ walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Robbie, I uh... I need to talk to you about something\" she said, slowly walking to his desk and sitting opposite him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" he said, sounding slightly suspicious \"what is it MJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im pregnant\" she blurted out, hoping to get this ordeal over soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked her in slight shock, then down towards her belly, noting the very large swell of her belly. \"well you've certainly kept it under wraps for a while\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah, i guess you could say that\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well I'm happy for you\" he smiled at her. \"But you're going to have to keep coming in till we can properly file for your maternity leave. Had you told us earlier it would have been easier\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"I understand, i guess i just got stubborn\" she lied, a little annoyed that she would still be working. \"how long will it take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About two or so days, four at most\" He said. \"I'll send you the files you'll need to sign soon. Congratulations again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" she smiled, thinking to herself how much better that went than how she'd anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way out of Robbie's office, a slight spring in her step, and a hand softly cradling her belly. All of a sudden she felt a pair of hands reaching from behind her, holding her belly and rubbing it excitedly. MJ turned around swiftly to see Betty fawning excitedly over her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations! Why didn't you say anything sooner?\" She said, both hands all over her bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" MJ replied, smiling, masking her annoyance. \"I just wanted to keep it under wraps. How did you find out anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was listing in on you and Robbie\" MJ shot her a look. \"what, its a habit\" she grinned cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"don't you have work to do?\" she asked, smirking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"aw boo\" betty laughed back a little. \"i'll see you around MJ, maybe we could grab some lunch together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah that would be nice\" she smiled back at her, heading back to her desk.</span></div></div>",

She was able to make out the name yesterday, lucky enough that she was able to quickly write it down while she was on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick search online didn't reveal too much at first glance. She rubbed her belly slowly, trying to quell the kicks inside as she looked through the webpages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing particularly noteworthy or interesting, until something caught her eye. It appeared that the company had been bought recently, not even a month ago. She tried to find out who had bought it, but the source appeared to be anonymous. Whoever it was had to have a decent amount of cash on their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane vowed to look deeper into it tomorrow, and saw Betty approach her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Ready to head out to lunch?\" Betty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ's stomach rumbled. \"Yes. I thought you might have forgotten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty helped her up, and the two headed to a nearby deli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got their food and took a seat, Betty spent most of her time watching Mary Jane eat, nibbling on her own food in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ was too occupied with her food to pay any mind to Betty. Suddenly, she felt pokes and prods to her massive belly, and saw the secretary feeling the round flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing, Betty?\" she asked, a little flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to get the babies to move!\" Betty exclaimed with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babies? How did you know there's more than one in there?\" MJ wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at the pregnant journalist.  \"I mean, come on, MJ. You're huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, how did you hide this so well?\" Betty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane shrugged. \"It sort of just snuck up on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Bugle, MJ spent the rest of the day eating, heading to the bathroom, rubbing her belly, and doing some work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs 5 o'clock hit, Mary Jane slowly rose from her chair and headed out, saying good night to Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the street, she realized that she really needed some new clothes. Her largest shirts and jeans didn't fit her now, so she needed something that would come close to covering her larger pregnant form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled to a nearby department store and went to the women's clothing section. She hated the look of many of the maternity wear, but found some jeans that were stylish. The maternity bras weren't too bad, either. For the top half of her body, which would be the hardest to cover, she found some larger shirts and blouses that did the job for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her mind, she could only wonder just how long they'd fit her. How much bigger would she be a week from now? Or even a day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trudged up and down the aisles, drawing looks from employees and customers that she ignored. After paying for the clothes, which came to a surprisingly high total, and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her night was uneventful. She grabbed dinner on the way home, and spent the last few hours of her day rubbing her belly and feeling the kicks of the eight growing lives within her. Maybe this pregnancy wouldn't be so bad after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>MJ woke up to her belly squirming and looked down, bracing for the inevitable. Her belly had indeed grown overnight, pushing her covers off it and baring it to the cool air. She sat up yawning and rubbing it absentmindedly. Sighing and starting the challenge of getting out of bed, heaving her heavy body up. She had started to get into the routine of things, and was starting to get to grips with her size, despite how much she kept growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling into the kitchen, she started to make herself breakfast, putting on several slices of toast in quick succession, munching them down quickly after they popped up, covering them in peanut butter. She looked down at her sizeable bust and brushed off the mess off crumbs, reaching into her cleavage to get rid of the crumbs between each breast. She headed back to her room to get dressed for work, still munching on a slice of toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary-jane picked out a pair of dark blue maternity jeans, a loose white long sleeve shirt and a deep red flannel shirt. She pulled the jeans up her legs, finding her new jeans far easier than her non-maternity jeans, thankfully. She got them to her waist and was massively thankful that she could actually button them up, with a small underpart on her belly. She pulled on her shirt and again found it far more comfortable than regular clothes. It managed to reach over her belly and breasts, leaving only the tiniest sliver of underbelly. She pulled over the flannel shirt and admired the outfit in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dhuh. These maternity clothes aren't half bad\u201d MJ smirked, posing a little for herself. \u201dhere's hoping they'll last for a while longer\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her bag and phone, and left her apartment, heading to work with a slight spring in her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt work, MJ spent her morning doing some writing up of her current case, sprucing up her notes and turning them from simple scrawls to a readable article. She yawned and grabbed her bag, pulling out some sandwiches she had bought from a nearby deli. While eating the first, she thought about heading out to keep investigating, but part of her knew that Robbie wouldn't let her,  given how pregnant she was. She finished her lunch and had an idea, standing up and brushing off her shirt as she waddled to Robbie's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHey Robbie?\u201d she said, leaning in and knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dCome in MJ\u201d he replied, glancing up from his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dActually I can't stop now, I was just coming to say I had a doctors appointment,\u201d she said, hoping her lie would hold up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh right, yeah that's fine\u201d he added, smiling at her. \u201dyou'll be back later, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah I think so\u201d she smiled back, putting on her signature denim jacket. \u201dI'll see you later then\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she turned and left, picking up her bag from her desk and waving bye to Betty. <i>Worked like a charm</i> she smiled to herself, stepping out into the street. She looked down at her phone, checking the address she had found, and started towards the nearest subway station, wanting to save her energy if she had to sneak around upon arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped into the subway car, holding her bulging belly, and searched for a seat, finding them all full. She sighed and looked to the speciality seats, seeing them full as well. She was about to resign herself to standing, but thankfully an older woman stood up and offered her a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI've been in the same spot dear\u201d she smiled at MJ. \u201dBeing on your feet all the time starts to hurt\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ smiled back to her. \u201dthank you, yeah this belly is way too heavy\u201d she joked, patting it for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dmay I feel it?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201duh sure go ahead\u201d She replied, considering it briefly in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman carefully rubbed her bulging belly, admiring it and how big it was. MJ smiled softly as she patted it and caressed it. \u201dwow you've got some strong babies here\u201d she beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dyeah they are, keep mama up all night with it\u201d she laughed, glad of the woman's kindness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the woman got off the train, saying goodbye and good luck to MJ, smiling sweetly. A few stops after that it was time for MJ to get off the train, balancing herself as the train stopped. She waddled off and out of the station, heading towards the address. She came to see a small dingy looking warehouse, with a few small lights flickering inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dBingo\u201d she smirked, heading towards it, trying to find a hidden way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had found a small hole in one of the walls, and squeezed her way through it. She hadn't anticipated how much her belly would have gotten in the way, which helped to explain the small tear in the hem of her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was crouched behind a stack of crates, trying to figure a way through the warehouse. The place was heavily guarded, and her belly made speaking around a lot harder than it used to. She saw a window as one of the guards turned around, and bolted to another stack of crates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped behind them, but froze up when she heard the crates shift as she pushed them too hard. She could hear footsteps approaching her and prepared herself, hoping she'd be able to get the slip on the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned the corner, and all of a sudden saw a fist flying towards his face, followed by one to his stomach and another to the face. MJ breathed a quiet sigh of relief as the guard fell unconscious. <i>those self defense lessons definitely paid off.</i> She looked out over her cover and saw that the doorway was unguarded, pacing rapidly towards it before the other guard returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the the room she saw a sight that came as a surprise to her. At one end of the room was a computer, where Spider-man himself was stood hacking it for information. From another corner of the room a guard was quietly approaching him with a stun-baton in his hand. He was getting closer and closer, and MJ started forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter had just successfully hacked the terminal, pumping his fist gladly. He turned around and saw a thug about to jab his ribs with a baton. Just as he swung down, a large object slammed into his head, knocking him out cold onto the floor. He looked up and saw<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dMJ?\u201d Peter said, confused. \u201dWhat are you doing he-\u201d he started, before noticing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWe should probably talk\u201d she replied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twenty minutes later, Mary Jane and Peter found themselves at Mick's diner sitting across from each other in a booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ had already finished her meal, while Peter had barely touched his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter couldn't keep his mouth closed or his eyes off of MJ's massive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...is it mine?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane shook her head. \"No, Peter. They aren't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Wait, then who is? Wait, did you say 'they'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ smiled lightly. Oh, he was so out of his element here. It was actually kind of endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no father. It's a long story. A few weeks ago I...took a tour at Oscorp,\" she started to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Peter said, not sure if he followed where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an unscheduled trip. I got an anonymous tip that something shady was going on there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the radioactive spiders not give you enough of a hint?\" Peter grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was different. I was able to get into a lab, one that looked top secret. Inside, there was this serum in a vial. I picked it up, accidentally dropped it and spilled some of it onto myself when some scientists stopped by. After that, I got sick. Then, the belly came. I finally went to the doctor yesterday. Somehow, some way, that serum got me pregnant. And it's progressing at a rapid rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's eyes were wide. \"How...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still trying to figure it out, too. I can't even imagine how you must have felt when you saw me,\" MJ said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. You...you said 'they' earlier? As in, there's m-more than one in there?\" Peter asked, fidgeting in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. There's actually eight in here...\" she replied, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm trying to figure out. Was it some type of fertility drug that hasn't been tested yet?\" MJ wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's being tested now,\" Peter added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why were you in the warehouse?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lately I've been following a series of break-ins. Really suspicious. They're just taking random computer parts,\" he noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I've been looking into that, too,\" MJ said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter raised an eyebrow. \"You find out who's behind it yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. Well, I can handle it alone from here. You shouldn't be putting yourself in danger. Especially in your condition,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, I'm pregnant. I don't have a terminal illness,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, these guys aren't going to care if you're pregnant. If they find you, they'll make sure you're out of the picture one way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle it. Plus, isn't pregnancy strength a thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ smiled, then yawned. \"Ugh. These babies are taking a lot out of me. I think I'm gonna head home,\" MJ said, slowly rising from the booth, her belly grazing against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Do you want me to walk you home or anything?\" Peter offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Pete. It's only a few blocks,\" MJ said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Well, I guess I'll see you around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it'd be a good idea to keep in touch if we find out anything else about this case. Maybe sometime next week we can meet up and try to piece this thing together,\" Mary Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter nodded. \"That'd be a good idea. My place or yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way outside of the diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. You're gonna make a pregnant girl walk all the way to your apartment?\" MJ smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can always get a taxi. Alright, alright. So your place. That sounds like a plan,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll even make some food. Better me than you. Those poor dumplings,\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're never going to let me live that down, are you? Good night, MJ,\" he said, walking in the direction of his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night. And Pete?\" she said, stopping from her waddle back to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good to see you too, Mary Jane.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>MJ turned and began the walk home. Well at this point it was more of a waddle if she was honest with herself. Lucky for her it wasn\u2019t a long walk, and she was home before long. She flopped down on the sofa, tired after a long day, especially after the warehouse. She pulled up her dirtied shirt, baring her enormous belly, andstarted slowly rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dthis does feel kinda nice\u201d MJ mused to herself, as she felt gentle kicks from in her womb. \u201di guess I'm starting to enjoy this more\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tucked her shirt underneath her breasts and continued to run her belly, stopping occasionally as a kick poked out or moved across her belly. She poked back after a few kicks, hoping to elicit a response, to some effect, the babies squirming back. It made her giggle slightly, which surprised her. She smiled sweetly at her belly as she resigned herself to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dgoodnight babies\u201d she whispered, drifting off to sleep, hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning MJ woke up before her alarm started blaring. She had sat in bed for a few minutes exploring her growing belly, which had expanded a fair amount overnight, so much so that her growth was beginning to worry her a bit, more than usual. After the usual routine of heaving herself out of bed, MJ waddled to the bathroom, warming up the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped inside and almost moaned at the feeling of hot water running over her swollen body, biting her lip at the last second. She cradled her big bump and let the water flow over it, soothing her tight skin, and starting to rub soapy water all over it. The shower was relaxing for her, a time for her to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dried herself off, thoroughly rubbing her bulging bump with her towel, trying to dry the entire thing. She struggled a little with the underbelly but managed to get it done eventually. She stepped out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her waist, and another tied over her hair. Grabbing a bra, she picked up her phone, calling her doctor to book an appointment. Her growth was starting to worry her, especially how much she kept growing each night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHi, can I book an appointment? Tomorrow is preferable\u201d MJ said, getting dressed as she spoke. \u201dTomorrow afternoon is great, thank you\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished getting dressed, a black pair of maternity slacks pulled just over a portion of her belly, with a blue and white striped jumper over a plain t-shirt. She looked over herself in the mirror, noting that her jumper looked to be struggling to cover her whole belly, much to her annoyance. Sighing she slipped into some shoes and left for work, grabbing some breakfast from a bakery on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork, for the most part, was uneventful, mostly just typing up her notes and a smattering of congratulations from coworkers. Betty had come over to chat to her a few times, talking to her about her pregnancy mostly, and complimenting her outfits as well, pointing out how they \u2019emphasised the belly, but in a good way\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ was sat at her desk, resting a packet of chips on her immense bump as she scanned over the information she had on the current case. Something about it was familiar to her, and it was bugging her. She rubbed her belly and picked up one of the photos of the van, scanning the logo, trying to work out what felt so familiar about the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dsomeone stealing tech, a show company,\u201d she said, annoyed that she still couldn't figure it out. \u201dmagic logo-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit her. It all made so much sense now, why it was so familiar to her. The tech, the magic, the special effects. She and Peter had been through it all before, a few years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dMysterio!\u201d she exclaimed, pumping her fists in the air, spilling her chips onto her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleared up her mess and immediately got to sending a text to Peter. <i>Its Mysterio! He's back, that's why so much tech has gone missing</i> she typed, hitting send. A reply came through shortly after ; <i>Of course! Makes sense, great job. I'll investigate some more tonight</i>. She smiled, proud of herself. Her pride was interrupted by a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHey, MJ. We've got a meeting now\u201d Said Betty from behind her, offering a hand to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh right, yeah\u201d She replied, taking her hand as both women heaved her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them made their way to the conference room, which was slowly filling up. Betty took her seat next to Robbie, and Mary-Jane went to take her usual seat opposite her. She sat down in the chair and found it to be very tight, not only on her hips but on her belly as well, squeezing both slightly. She shifted uncomfortably, bumping against the table and knocking over one of the glasses on top, spillkng its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSorry\u201d she smiled in embarrassment, picking it up and sitting still, hands on top of her bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dDon't worry about it\u201d Robbie sighed, smirking a little. \u201dWe\u2019ll start with you miss Watson\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWell I looked I to the robberies and found that they were all under similar circumstances, and upon further investigation, and a little help from my \u2019contact\u2019 I've been able to draw up a good article\u201d She said, presenting her story to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSounds good, keep at it but don't overdo it, especially in your condition\u201d Robbie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIm pregnant, not sick\u201d she quipped back, garnering a few chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhatever you say\u201d Robbie said, before continuing along with the meeting.</span></div></div>",

She was eager to see what the doctor had to say about her growth. She could have sworn that she'd gotten bigger over the last few hours. Her sweater definitely seemed tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty watched her waddle towards her desk as she made her way to the door. The secretary looked at the pregnant woman with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leaving, Mary Jane?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ stopped, hands pressing into the small of her back, which accentuated her massive bump even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Got a doctor's appointment,\" Mary Jane sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I hope the babies are alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ nodded. \"I'm sure they are. They're just getting big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane looked at her doctor as he pulled the sonogram machine towards her. She was lying down on the examination table, her immense belly bared. She looked at it, noticing that the vast dome luckily had no stretch marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not crazy, right? I'm definitely bigger than when you looked at me last week?\" MJ asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor looked at her as he turned the machine on. \"I didn't want to be the one to say it, but I would agree. No matter, we'll find out what's going on shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ's belly was covered in gel, and the doctor maneuvered the wand across the massive, tight skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the doctor frowned, his eyes squinting. \"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane looked up at him, trying to get a read on what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the...\" he trailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Are the babies okay?\" she asked, a hint of fear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor shook his head. \"They're actually looking very healthy. All eight of them. But they look much more further developed than they were last week. When I looked at you at the last appointment they were around 18 weeks along. Now they're nearly 30.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're fine other than that?\" MJ wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But I'd like to keep an eye on you from here on out. We should schedule another appointment for early next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ nodded. \"Okay. That works for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane took a moment to catch her breath once she arrived at her apartment. This belly was really starting to take its toll on her. She relieved her bladder and caught her reflection in the mirror. Her sweater was now holding on for dear life, struggling to contain the massive growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed it and threw it on her bed. MJ looked down and rubbed her belly as the lives within kicked and squirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sweater was by far the biggest thing she owned. Now what would she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Mary Jane cooked up a large dinner then went to sleep, the babies tumbling and pushing within her increasingly cramped womb.</span></div></div>",

She steadied her self against the wall and waddled to the shower, striding past a few shopping bags with her new maternity clothes inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had spent most of yesterday shopping for new clothes that would cover her belly, knowing that she\u2019d outgrow them sooner or later. After she had finished her shopping trip, she had headed home to her apartment, and had Betty over for a catchup. They talked pretty much exclusively about her pregnancy and how she was doing, and, at Betty\u2019s insistence, showed off some of her new clothes. Thinking back, MJ thought it had been a good day,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped into the bathroom and started to strip down, watching herself in the mirror, and looking down at her enormous belly, occasional kicks popping up now and then. She stroked it slowly as she turned on the water, rushing over her swell. It still blew her mind how fast this had happened, and how big she was. Sure she did have eight babies in her belly, but she never expected to get quite this huge so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water stopped as she stepped out of the shower, beginning to dry off herself, starting on her belly and working her way over her body, struggling because of her bump. She threw on a sports bra, as it was one of the only bras she had that could contain her growing bust, and a pair of sweatpants that hugged her newly curvy figure, almost emphasising her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick waddle to the kitchen, and Mary Jane got down to cooking herself some breakfast, making herself pancakes, bacon, eggs. The smell while she cooked made her even hungrier, as her stomach grumbled and her babies squirmed eagerly, hungry as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, im nearly done\u201d sje joked to her belly, patting it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settled on her couch, using her belly as a table, and dug into her hefty breakfast, turning on the tv while she ate, surfing through the channels. There was some news report on Spideys recent activities, some crappy looking reality show, a few quiz shows. She settled on an old rerun of one of her favourite shows growing up, listening to it absent-mindedly as she ate her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmh that hit the spot\u201d she moaned, rubbing her belly soothingly as she finished the last of her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw her laptop on the coffee table and decided to get some work done, and strained to reach for it from her comfy position, grunting as she tried to edge it closer. Sighing, she sat up and picked it up, resting it on her belly and shuffling to get comfortable again. She opened it up and resumed where she\u2019d left of with her work, building up the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone buzzed. She glanced at it and saw a message from Peter, asking \u201cWe still on for tonight?\u201d. She chuckled at his message, and replied quickly \u201cyep, make sure to bring snacks\u201d. She put her phone down and carried on working, waiting for Peter to get there</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter strode down the hallway of Mary Jane\u2019s apartment building, a bag of food in his hands. He had done this pretty often in the past, the two of them collaborating a few times when they dated, so it was just like old times. Except this time MJ was very, very pregnant. He mulled over how it had happened to her, with her sneaking into Oscorp and knocking it onto herself. It was weird, and he lived a pretty weird life if he was honest, having fought a weird and wonderful rogues gallery for a few years, and yet this still stood out. As he was deep in thought he came to MJs door, and hesitated for a second before knocking on her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d MJ called from behind the door \u201cI\u2019m a little busy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter reached for the handle and pushed open the door, stepping inside. He turned to the kitchen to put down the food he had brought and saw MJ turned away, cooking something on the oven, hunched over slightly. She was wearing a pair of very tight looking sweatpants that hugged her figure, emphasising her size, and highlighting just how much her body had changed in a few weeks. He drew his eyes away from her butt, and saw her mostly bare back, save for the straps of a sports bra. Peter gulped. This was gonna be a long evening for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Pete\u201d she called over her shoulder \u201cjust a second\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished whatever it was she was doing and slowly turned around to face Peter, revealing her enormous and uncovered baby-filled belly to him. He watched in awe as she turned, watching her belly quiver slightly as she moved. She was a lot bigger than when he had last seen her, and miraculously had no stretch marks marring the tight surface of her belly. Mary Jane watched Peters shocked expression start to blush as she showed off her bump, and chuckled quietly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-want any help?\u201d Peter finally stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a good track record in the kitchen, Parker\u201d She smirked, leaning against the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I\u2019m not that bad\u201d he replied defensively \u201cI-I can do some stuff\u201d he added indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I\u2019m just teasing\u201d she smiled, giggling at how flustered Peter was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his jacket off and rolled up his sleeves, stepping into the small kitchen, ready to help. \u201cWhat can i do?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can start by chopping vegetables for me\u201d she said, turning to grab a bag of carrots and peppers, and bumping her backside into Peter \u201cSorry, not much room these days\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter chuckled in reply, and got down to cutting up vegetables for her. The pair started to get into a rhythm, but it was soon disturbed as Peter reached for another bowl and felt himself pressed against the side of MJ\u2019s belly, causing both of them to blush a little. they returned to their jobs, both trying to avoid another collision, to no avail. <i>I'm too big!</i> MJ thought to herself, opening a bag of chips, as she felt Peter back up into her again, pushing her forward, her belly tipping over some jars <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"damn it\" she sighed to herself, snacking on a handful of chips \"this thing is like a wrecking ball\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter snorted to himself at the comment and continued chopping, arms tucked into himself. Every now and then he could hear MJ eating something and he rolled his eyes. After a few more minutes of very cramped work, and a few more bumps and accidents, they finished cooking, and began setting up their feast on the couch. Well more of a feast for MJ, Peter thought her appetite was even more than his, and he had an enhanced one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So got any new leads on the case?\" he asked her as he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmh Yeah\" she replied, finishing a mouthful of food \"I figured out who's behind all of this! It's Mysterio!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! It al makes sense! MJ you're a genius!\" he exclaimed, starting to reach for a hug, then settling for a high five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always was the brains of the operation wasn't I\" she smirks, returning the high five \"the tech is for something big, so he must be planning a heist or something. I'll let you do the science stuff\" she added, stuffing her mouth full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked away for a while as they ate, mostly about the case, their next moves, and the like. Then the conversation began to shift, to her pregnancy, and what she was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so what's the plan after you... you know\" Peter started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean give birth?\" she chuckled \"I don't know. I've been so caught up in the case, I never really thought much about it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe stroked her belly as she felt some kicks and squirms \"I guess I'll give them up for adoption. Im not ready to be a mom, and I do not earn enough to take care of eight babies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ looked up at Peter for a response, but found that he was just looking towards her belly, as it squirmed, an occasional kick poking out. She grabbed his hand and gently placed it on her tight belly for him, watching his face blush a little as he began to feel the kicks beneath his hand. He slowly moved it around, feeling more and more movement as he explored her belly, almost in awe of it, from the size, to the constant movement. A sudden loud growl broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sorry\" MJ said shyly \"still hungry\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter rolled his eyes \"I'll order you a pizza\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he dialled in the number and ordered a large pepperoni for her, Mary Jane could feel something in her stomach. she rubbed her belly, pressing against, all of a sudden letting out some gas, much to her and Peters embarrassment. She blushed deep red and shrunk away into the sofa, mouthing a <i>Sorry!</i> towards Peter. He finished ordering and sat down again, and after an awkward silence, the conversation pick up again, discussing what he should do to try and stop Mysterio before he could strike out. The doorbell ringing snapped them out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it\" Pete smiled, running to grab it, sparing MJ from having to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her the box, and upon opening it, she immediately began devouring the pizza, Peter watching and wonder whether to be scared of her or a little proud. <i>If she's not careful, she's actually going to pop</i> he thought to himself, as she finished off her seventh slice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mary Jane woke up with a smile on her face. It was nice to spend time with Peter again, even if they weren't together anymore. But it was for the best. When they were dating, she was always worrying about him, and he would worry about her. Those worries didn't completely go away when they broke up, but it was safer for MJ now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted as she tried to sit up. There was definitely a lot more weight in her belly than there was the day before. \"Serves me right for eating so much,\" she groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room was dark, so she couldn't tell for sure, but it certainly felt like it was much bigger. Mary Jane had always heard that women typically grew the most when they were in their third trimester, and since she technically was in the third trimester as well, it made sense for the growth to really ramp up now. The thought was fairly frightening for her. She was so big as it was. How much more could her body take?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally was able to stand after a five minute endeavor. As she got upright, her knees suddenly buckled from the weight. Mary Jane was able to recover before she fell, and took in deep breaths as she rubbed her belly. \"Hoo, boy. You all need to stop getting so big. I have a feeling that's gonna fall on deaf ears, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe babies moved around in response. MJ placed her hands on her back for support as she slowly waddled towards the bathroom to shower. She truly had no idea how she'd be able to work in this state, but she guessed that she was about to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe switched on the light and took a good look at herself in the bathroom mirror. Her belly was unbelievably huge. It was truly unnatural. The pale, round skin was stretched incredibly tight, but there still weren't any stretch marks. She slowly turned to the side to get another look at it and accidentally knocked off some makeup that was sitting on the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane sighed as her belly gurgled. She was still full from her feast last night. If she waited until later to pick up the makeup, she'd certainly be bigger, so she might as well get it over with. MJ spread her legs far apart and carefully squatted down. Any wrong movement and she'd fall, and she wasn't certain she'd be able to get back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got down as low as she could and picked up the makeup, she heard another unfortunately familiar noise escape her body. More gas. As gross as it was, she supposed it wasn't too much of a surprise. The babies were fighting for room with her insides, which meant that there was a lot less space than usual. She shook her head and stepped in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed would be interesting, since she had likely outgrown the larger clothes that she recently purchased. Pants with buttons were out of the question, so she opted for a stretchy long skirt and a blue and red striped long sleeve shirt. Even though she pulled the skirt up high, there was a good portion of her massive belly revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating a large breakfast, she put on her jacket and slipped on some flats and headed off to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane plodded towards her desk, trying to avoid all of the eyes that were on her. Betty looked up from her computer and smiled. \"There she is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...here I...am...\" MJ huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing!\" Betty exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane rolled her eyes. \"Really? I feel like a whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down at her desk, the chair creaking loudly. She was surprised that it could even hold her at this point. Robbie emerged from his office. \"Can I talk to you for a minute, MJ?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wished that he would have asked her before she sat down, but that was out of her control. \"Sure thing, Robbie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried and failed to get up. The whole office watched as she struggled to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a hand, Mary Jane?\" Betty offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pride would not allow help with this. How pathetic would it be if she couldn't even stand by herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No, I've got it. Just...just give me a second. I'll be right there, Robbie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take all the time you need,\" Robbie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane continued to try and fail to get herself upright. The weight of her belly was really starting to get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you've got this?\" Betty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ gritted her teeth and slowly stood with all of her strength, her legs shaking mightily. She panted and patted her belly. \"See? Easy...easy as pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled. She frowned and waddled into Robbie's office as he closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat, MJ,\" Robbie said as he sat down at his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd probably be best if I didn't,\" she replied, placing her hands on the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. So how are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very, very pregnant,\" Mary Jane said, smiling weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet. So I just got word that your paperwork went through. Starting tomorrow you'll be on maternity leave,\" he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? So this'll be my last day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie nodded. \"For a few months. But during this time, I want you to take it easy. Got it? You're...clearly dealing with a lot there, and I want you to be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane rolled her eyes, but nodded. If only he knew how close she was to cracking this case. \"You got it, Robbie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. That's all. Thanks so much for all you do, MJ. You've been a trooper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing,\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane turned around and opened the door, and saw all of her coworkers gathered around. A large banner reading CONGRATULATIONS, MARY JANE was draped on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURPRISE!!!\" they all yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ placed her hands on her chest as she welled up with emotion. \"You all did this for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nobody else named Mary Jane here, is there?\" Eddie Brock asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have shown so much strength throughout this process. We're really gonna miss you,\" Robbie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was largely spent chatting with her coworkers and eating cake and chips. As she swallowed a large bite of cake and Betty lovingly rubbed her monstrous baby-filled belly, MJ realized that she was happy. Tired, huge, but happy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>MJ left the office happy. It had been nice to see all her co-workers one last time before she left, and everyone had been so nice, Betty especially. She'd planned the whole thing in a few days, and shed done it perfectly. Of course, her joy was short lived as she waddled to the nearest subway station. The party had left her tired, and with her belly getting bigger every day, she was more tired than ever, and she was finding it increasingly harder to walk without having to stop to catch her breath every few steps. And the looks from strangers walking by did nothing to help either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally made it to the subway station, she slumped onto a bench for a moment, waiting for her train to arrive. she leaned back sighing, noting each ache in her swollen body. Her breasts felt particularly sore aching terribly, and her clothes felt like they were digging in, more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heaved herself up at the sound of her train, waddling as fast as she could to try and get a seat, much to her discomfort. The train was packed, and there seemed to be no free seats. Great, just what I needed today she sighed to herself. A woman sat in front of her stood up and tapped her shoulder, but by the time MJ looked up, an older man had snagged the seat, leaving her stood for the rest of the way, holding her belly to try and lift some weight away. Sudden kicks and squirms pulled Mary Jane from her train of thought, and she began rubbing her moving bump to try and soothe the occupants inside, who seemed to ignore her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she massaged, a slightly pained look on her face, she could feel something poking her underbelly. The problem was that the rest of her belly blocked her view, and there was no room to turn and see. She shifted a little bit as the poking continued, starting to annoy her more and more, and she saw a little girl staring up at her belly and poking it. MJ said nothing, too tired to bother, resigning that the poking wasn't that annoying. Thankfully the girls mother stopped her soon after, and scolded her, to the kids embarrassment. The mom apologised on her rather embarrassed daughters behalf, MJ replying with a tired smile. The poking had pushed her babies into another kicking frenzy, and this time they took aim at her bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, please!\" she spoke to herself, crossing her legs as the train pulled into her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled off quickly, desperate for the bathroom, not looking where she was headed. A man collided into her, thankfully not very hard, but enough that both were a little dazed. He quickly walked on, ignoring MJ, who was left standing catching her breath. All of a sudden she felt something wet seeping through her shirt. Praying that the man had spilled a drink on her, she looked down and blushed, seeing two little wet patches growing across her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damnit!\" she growled, pulling her jacket across her chest, trying to cover it as best she could, to little success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled around looking for a bathroom, and found her way into a nearby store. She approached the woman behind the counter, and asked her politely if there was a bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just down the hall there\" she pointed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, so much\" MJ replied, turning towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"she is way too big to be wearing those clothes\" she heard the Shopkeeper mutter under her breath \"let alone be out in public\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stung. A lot. with how her day had started going, it did nothing to help her mood, and she held back a tear as she headed for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what had felt like the longest journey of her life, Mary Jane finally arrived home. She shut her door and made her way to the bathroom, the babies adamant to use her bladder as target practice. MJ looked at her reflection in the mirror. She was a mess. Her hair was frizzed, and she could feel herself sweating the longer she waited. She looked away, not wanting to dwell on it any longer than she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her stomach grumbling, and almost ran to the kitchen, clearing the fridge of all she could find, carrying as much as she could into her room, and began to feast. <i>Thank god for leftovers</i> she thought, devouring some pasta from the night before with Peter. As she ate she swore she could feel herself growing, and put a hand to her belly, taking a deep breath as her mind started to race through everything that had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there is such a thing as too big\" she grumbled to herself, her belly feeling tighter than ever before. \"Maybe I might actually pop\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to worry, and the more she worried, the more she ate. Her meal began to run out, and she took another trip to the bathroom, before laying down in bed and attempting to get comfortable. It was a struggle, and she tossed and turned, feeling too hot or too cold in some position, or she couldn't breathe in another. then she had to keep heaving herself out of bed to the bathroom, thanks to the relentless movement from inside her belly, and trips to the kitchen for more snacks as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on her bed, holding her belly, crying quietly to herself. It was all getting too much for her. All of it, the size, the eating, the pains. she was starting to hate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ woke slowly. she felt awful, recalling last nights events, and her lack of any good sleep. She turned over and slowly sat up, breathing heavy as her belly nearly pinned her to the bed. Huffing to herself, she began the morning ritual of heaving herself out of bed, struggling with her newfound weight, something she had grown to expect with each new day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped into the bathroom and watched herself in the mirror. she pulled up what little of her shirt was covering her immense swell, and stroked it curiously. her skin was beginning to grow red, the strain of her constant growth taking an obvious toll on her body. Rubbing it, it felt so much tighter than before, and each movement inside was beginning to feel dangerous to her health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing in the bathroom, she headed for the kitchen, anticipating her stomach grumbling within a few minutes. Setting herself a hearty breakfast, she took note that she would need to restock her food soon, especially with her rapidly increasing appetite. As she ate, she opened her laptop and began doing some work on the case, taking a look at some of Peters notes, and her own, trying to work out Mysterio's next move. She began to see a pattern in the warehouses, and priced together a rough idea of where they might strike next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brains of the operation\" she smirked to herself, eating another mouthful of her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her meal, she stood up, and headed to get changed. She put on another stretchy skirt, with some more mobility around the legs, and a plain white shirt, which left a portion of her immense belly bared for all to see. MJ threw on her jacket, slipped on a pair of shoes, and headed for the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The warehouse wasn't too far from her apartment, but it was far too long of a trek to walk there. Instead, she hailed a taxi, ignoring the shocked look of the cab driver, and arrived to the warehouse shortly after. It was abandoned, and appeared to have been that way for quite a while. But if she was right, Mysterio's henchmen would be arriving at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pregnancy had affected nearly everything that Mary Jane took pride in, but her brains had hopefully remained as sharp as ever. She figured that she'd know one way or another soon enough. MJ found an unlocked door on the side of the warehouse and slipped inside carefully. She rubbed her belly as she took a look around. If her hands weren't on her belly at this point, they'd likely be on her back for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ grimaced as she took another look at herself. It was really impossible to believe how big she'd gotten. Her mind wandered for a moment, back to her trip to Oscorp. Why were they developing a serum that made women pregnant? And was the intent to get the consumer as pregnant as Mary Jane was? She would have to investigate that at a later point, likely after she had given birth. She was here for a reason, and she couldn't get distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane waddled around the warehouse, looking for any evidence that this was the right place. She found a shelf that was holding a cardboard box. Plodding over it, she carefully got on her tiptoes to grab it. Inside, she saw the same computer parts that had been stolen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo,\" she smiled, a few hard kicks to her ribs instantly making her grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, she could hear the screeching of tires. The henchmen were here. MJ put the box back on the shelf and looked for a place where she'd be out of sight. She found another shelf that was full of useless items. Hiding behind would conveniently conceal her but give her a clear sight of the henchman. She waddled as quickly as she could to it. As soon as she got behind it, four masked men walked in the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, take a quick look around. They should be here somewhere. We don't wanna be here too long,\" one of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men spread out and began to search the warehouse. MJ wasn't close to the box of parts, but she did have a good view of it from her position. Surely enough, they found what they were looking for, but right before the henchman that found the parts could respond, Mary Jane felt a strong flurry of kicks to her ribs and bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ immediately knew that she made a huge mistake and covered her mouth, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" a henchman asked. \"I've got the parts. You three go find our guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane wasn't too far from the exit. But she'd have to be quiet and quick in order to make it out, and in her condition that'd be a nearly impossible challenge. She had to try, however, so she began to make her way to the door. It was a precarious effort, her belly scraping against shelves and walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane froze and put her hands up. A henchman was behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around slowly. No funny business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow is about all I can do at this point,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ obliged and turned around, revealing her pregnancy to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy SHIT,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Yeah. That's how I thought you'd react.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the other henchmen had surrounded them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take her with us. Let the boss figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo henchmen grabbed her and led Mary Jane to the van. They helped her into the back, which was incredibly uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, boys. At least let the pregnant lady ride up front,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No chance. No funny. Got it? And you better not give birth back here, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ moaned as her massive stomach shifted and groaned. \"Ugh. No promises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe henchman shut the door, and soon enough the van took off. It wasn't a long ride to wherever they were headed, so Mary Jane was able to conclude that Mysterio's hideout was in Manhattan. Once the van stopped, she was taken inside, though with everything that she was dealing with, she unfortunately didn't get a great look at the location itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the lair, they sat Mary Jane down on a steel chair and tied her up. At this point, even if she wasn't tied she probably couldn't go anywhere. The henchmen walked into another room, leaving her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, boss. We found someone spying on us in the warehouse,\" one henchman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Why don't I have a talk with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane recognized the voice. It was Mysterio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMysterio walked into the room, his green cape scraping off of the ground. His face was obscured by the smoke-filled fishbowl mask that he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well. What have we here? I recognize you. You're that reporter at the Daily Bugle. I'm not surprised that you've been snooping around,\" he said, getting close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone that's figured you out, Mysterio,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Because it looks like I've got someone that's way in over their head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand drew close to her, but he stopped and retracted it. \"I would touch you, but I'm afraid you'll pop if I do. What exactly do you have in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane was about to respond, but whimpered as strong movements made her entire stomach stretch and roll. It was incredibly painful, and she did all she could not to break into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...know that you've been breaking into the warehouses! What are you planning?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMysterio cackled. \"Very well. The tech I've been acquiring will let me break into banks across the city at the same time. It makes decoy versions of yours truly. The police will be helpless as they try to stop me. Since the real Mysterio won't be in any of the banks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...why would you tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you won't be leaving here by the time my plan is sprung into action,\" he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that! What if I give birth?\" she asked. It was partially a threat, but it was also a genuine worry of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll be able to manage. Good luck!\" Mysterio said, leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to the room the henchmen were in. \"Boys, make sure she doesn't try anything. I'm leaving to begin the final preparations. I'll be back tomorrow before it begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how long she sat there alone. MJ nearly fell asleep until a TWHIP made her sit up. Was that...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA commotion broke out in the other room. Yells and collisions that Mary Jane could clearly hear but not see. It didn't last long. She could hear someone coming, and hoped that it'd be who she thought it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it was. Spider-Man stood before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurried over to her and cut her loose. Spider-Man helped her up and they hugged, her gargantuan belly colliding into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know if you were gonna come! Oh my god, Peter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Let's get you out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the warehouse, Peter changed out of his suit and got into his civilian wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" he asked, seriously concerned about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane was still catching her breath. \"I'm alright. Just a little shaken up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not talking about Mysterio. You're getting too big, MJ! Something isn't right, we need to get you to a hospital!\" he exclaimed, gesturing to her stomach that was really showing the strain of eight nearly full-term babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm fine,\" she insisted, though she wasn't sure if she actually believed it. \"We need to finish this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out of your mind? You STILL want to do this, even after you got kidnapped? This is exactly why we broke up in the first place! I can't keep having you in danger like this. You can't take this on by yourself!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't. But we can take him down together. I know what he's planning!\" she replied excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter sighed. \"I'm not gonna win this one, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"No chance, tiger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is he planning?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane's stomach growled. \"Talk about it at Mick's?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The situation was all too familiar. The two of them sat opposite each other over bowl of fries at Mick's diner. Of course there were a lot more than just fries, with MJ's appetite to thank for the huge amount of food on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking?\" Peter started, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. They'd had this talk a million times. \"You can't stop me after its happened\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can stop you from doing it again\" he retorted. \"or at least try\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed heavily. \"if I hadn't been there, I would never have heard Mysterio's plan\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter stopped looking so angry, a conflicted look taking over his face. \"what is it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to rob several city banks all at once, with the device he's building, which he'll be controlling remotely\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked thoughtful for a minute \"huh. I guess I could build something to help with that...\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've got a plan then?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beginnings of one. If I-we're gonna get the upper hand on him, I gotta go prepare\" he started, standing up \"I'll pay you back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled \"yeah sure. Keep me posted, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ finished her meal slowly, massaging her growing belly under the table. The babies had not stopped squirming since they arrived, but at this point she begun to get used to it, at least when they were light with their kicking. Finishing her food, she headed home, leaning her hands on her back for the long waddle home. She practically collapsed on her bed when she got home, to exhausted to focus on anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ woke to the telltale kicking. she opened her eyes and looked to watch her belly. <i>What the...</i> she thought to herself <i>Theres no way I'm bigger</i>. Her shirt, which had only just fit her belly, had ridden up further overnight, leaving a lot more skin on show. She rubbed her gravid swell slowly, taking in her new size, as the occupants within continued their kicking. It felt so much tighter now, and Mary Jane was now beginning to think she would genuinely explode. she heaved herself out of bed, leaning on the wall for support, waddling to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the mirror, anticipating bad news. Her belly had deepened its red tone, looking far more stretched, and a lot thinner than before. She could see veins stretched across it under the tight skin. It weighed a ton as well, and she could feel the strain on her legs and back. MJ could tell the end of her pregnancy was going to be soon, noting her belly was starting to drop a little lower, not a lot, but it was a sign that her body was preparing for labour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane waddled into her kitchen and threw together some breakfast, clearing her cabinets for something to eat, and settling on the sofa to eat, using her belly as a table. She checked her phone and saw she had a doctors appointment soon, so she sped up her meal, wolfing it down, with little regard to spills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled to her bedroom and rifled through her clothes for something to wear out, settling on another long, black skirt that she could pull (mostly) over her belly, and her stretchiest T-shirt, a blue and white striped design. Looking in the mirror, she sighed at how much of her belly was bared, stroking the sliver of skin ,annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I won't have to pull my shirt up for the ultrasound\" she chuckled to herself, slipping on her jacket and a pair of comfy shoes, heading for the door.</span></div></div>",

Death. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bad dreams came rushing back to her while she slept, like a strong river current. <br>\r\nThe bad dreams of that day. The day of fire, smoke, screams, blood, violence, and death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people of the world called it \"Herofall\" while other called it \"Age's End\" but it all meant the same thing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day when heroes and villains, the forces of light and the forces of darkness, clashed one last time, leaving a trail of death and destruction behind them, and a new world to be rebuilt from the ashes of the old one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't supposed to be that way. There was an odd truce between the heroes and the villains. The villains would attack and the heroes would defend. The good guys would win and the bad guys would live to fight another day. Yet, as time went by, the heroes, those sworn to protect, ended fighting each other, instead of those who were sworn to destroy and rule. Civil wars, the clash of two teams, it seemed like the heroes were imploding, turning their violence onto each other, unaware they were making themselves weaker, while others grew stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when HE arrived, it was the end. Neurothought was what he was called, at least by those who fought him. His real name was impossible to be pronounced by a human tongue, super, mutant, mystical, or otherwise. He came from a time beyond time, from a dying world, from the deepest darkest regions of the universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a ruler, a tyrant. His word was law, his power absolute, her strength unmatched. His people in stasis, he arrived on Earth with one simple goal: Take what his people needed, by any means necessary. But he arrived not with lasers, or armies, he arrived with a parasite, that when introduced into a human body, give him almost complete control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this parasite he enslaved nearly all of the world's mightiest heroes and villains, for one purpose: To destroy themselves, to destroy each other, to guarantee his absolute victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe studied the failure of all those who came to this planet before him, those who ultimately failed in their conquest by the might of the heroes. He would not make the same mistake. He would use the beloved heroes to his advantage, to annihilate, and when all was ashes, his people would repopulate and rebuild. They would have a second chance. HE would have a second chance, to fix the mistakes he made, which cost his people their old world, and nearly doomed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreamt of that day. She dreamt of fire. She dreamt of smoke. She dream of screams, blood, violence and death. Seeing Tony Stark, fall from the heavens trailing red, seeing Steve laying broken, and still on the road, Thor standing over him, blood dripping from his hammer. She saw Clint, fall and die, a pair of adamantium claws piercing his heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeurothought's brain parasites didn't infect everyone, that would have been too easy. No, Neurothought wanted to watch those not-infected race to save those were, waste their resources, and their time, while the infected heroes and villains destroyed each other and everything in their path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked better than he had hoped. By the end, estimates put the casualties on both sides at nearly 90%. It did not matter to him that they found a cure for his parasites, nor that the non-infected heroes and villains joined forces to stop him. No. It did not matter to him by the end, because he would be dead, and those left uninfected would be his judge, his jury, and his executioner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days following were dark ones. Many funerals, untold lives caught in the crossfire, entire cities leveled. When it was all over, those who remained, put aside their ideas of costume heroics and villainy, and instead, vanished into the shadows. What use would they be anymore? The world had seen enough.  They had seen enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never considered retiring. This was her life. This was the only life she ever knew. She had nothing else. SHIELD remained, more as a figurehead than <br>\r\nanything else, the world governments deciding to create their own unified task force, one not needing to be supported by costume characters. <br>\r\nHer days were lonely, her night even lonelier. She dreamt of days gone by, of old friends dead and buried, of the once bright future ahead of them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all she dream of was fire; and smoke, fire, and  screams and blood and violence. She dreamt of death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia \"Black Widow\" Romanova was awakened by the buzz of her communicator, it's single light illuminating every dark corner of her room on board the Helicarrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears of training kicked in, and she was alert and ready for action, milliseconds later. <br>\r\n\"What is it General Fury?\" Natalia asked, ready for a briefing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of her communicator screen, a bald, eye-patched older african american man, looked at her, hesitating to ask her something. <br>\r\n\"Do your ever think about them Agent Romanova?\" He asks, his face blank as slate. <br>\r\n\"General..\" She was hesitant to respond. <i>Why was he asking this?</i><br>\r\n\"Do you ever think about that day? What we lost? What the world lost? Why did we survive when some many others didn't?\" Fury asked her again, his voice monotone. <br>\r\n<i>Has he been drinking?</i> She thought. She couldn't blame him. Many of those who survived took up drinking after they took off their costumes. <br>\r\n\"Do you know what we fought for? We fought for a legacy. They died for a legacy. And what if I told you that legacy could continue?\" Nice Fury said. <br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Natalia asked him.<br>\r\n\"I'm talking about giving back some hope into the world. Those people out there, in the normal world, think they've seen the worst of what's out in the universe. We both now that isn't true. They're will always be another Thanos, another Galactus, another Nuerothought - - And they're coming. Maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow. But somewhere down the line, they will come, and the world will not be ready. It needs hope. It need hope that there will be people still around to rise up and fight that new darkness off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey need a legacy to hold onto; and a legacy is what I intend to give them. I've asked a lot from you Natalia, but what I ask of you might be more than I ever thought possible. I'm asking you to give up everything you know, everything you might ever know, to preserve a legacy, to preserve the chance that a hundred, maybe even a thousand years from now, we will be ready\". Nick Fury said, his voice never changing, his face deadly serious, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, do you have any idea what time it is? Couldn't this wait until morning?\" She asked. <br>\r\n\"Time is off the uptmost importance. Banner has just made the breakthrough we needed and this might be only chance. CHIMERA, has been sniffing around SHIELD files. This new world police usually only worries about it's own business, but word has been leaking out that we're up to something.\" Nick Fury said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHIMERA, the global international police force that now rivaled SHIELD after the events of that dark day. Their only mission was to protect humanity at any cost, including putting down whatever remained of the superheroes, should it ever come to that. <br>\r\n\"And why would CHIMERA think we were up to something sir?\" Natalia asked, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we are. What we're doing is in violation of international Suspension Of Super Powered Activities, which would make us International Enemy #1 But if we're successful, it will mean a brighter future for humanity when organizations like CHIMERA ultimately fail. But I need your help on this, you're the only person I obsoletely trust with this\" Fury stated looking at her with his one good eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Basically stated, Banner's been working on a serum, and just made the breakthrough an hour ago, and we need a female test-subject. Combining the absolute perfect genetic strands from the DNA profiles of current living and deceased superhero, once this serum reacts to you, it's going to create a rapidly gestating life form, based on the DNA in the serum and the genetic material of the female host.\" Nick Fury said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe what Fury was asking her to do. She didn't want to believe what Fury was asking her to do. <br>\r\n\"You mean to tell that you  - - - -\" Natalia said.<br>\r\n\"Yes Natalia, we want you to get pregnant with a new generation of superheroes.\" Fury said, his face showing no emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is he crazy?</i> Natalia thought to herself, staring at Nick Fury, his face an empty book, unable to be read. <br>\r\n\"I know it's alot to ask Natalia\" Nick Fury states. <br>\r\n\"That's literarily an understatement. Do you have any idea what your asking me to do? What your asking me to sacrifice?\" Natalia asked. <br>\r\n\"No more than anyone else. Steve gave his life fighting for what he believe in, so did Clint. They sacrificed their bodies to preserve a legacy, and now we're asking you to make the same, in a manner of speaking.\" Nick Fury states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sir? Pregnancy? Motherhood? Not exactly within my field of expertise\" she said. <br>\r\n\"We're all outside our comfort zone on this one Natalia. But this something that needs to be done. If you worried about your obligations, SHIELD is prepared to handle everything. We have a large monetary fund set up for you to handle everything you possibly need. Clothing, food, education. We will have nannies on call 24/7 should you wish to be hands-off, although I highly advise against that. I want these children to have a happy healthy upbringing. Christmases, birthday parties, after school sports - - It's all based of an extensive psyche report put together by our top shrinks: A good upbringing will make good heroes with a sense of right-and-wrong. I believe the late Peter Parker once said \"With great power, comes great responsibility\". Nick Fury stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Christmases? Birthday parities? Play dates? </i> Natalia thought to herself, entertaining his offer. <i>Children were never on the horizon for me, even before those bastards rendered me infertile.</i> She thinks back, to those days in the \"Black Widow\" program. The things they subjected her too, the Red Room's variant of the Super-Soldier Serum and Biotechnology, that made her the woman she is today. Stronger, faster, smarter, healthier, than any other normal human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, Dr. Bruce Banner, one of, if not, the world's smartest man, was given her a chance for the one-thing she thought she could never be: A mother. Someone somebody would look up to, be infallible, someone who would love her for just being her, not some convoluted plot of clones, double agents and brainwashing. She was offered a true piece of herself that no-one could take away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fury, I\" she paused, thinking this over. They CHOSE her. They didn't ask anyone else, as far as she knew, Fury chose her to be their Eve. A beacon of light for the future generations of the world that the guardians would not leave them, that no force on Earth or beyond the stars could take away their brightly colored champions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Natalia?\" Fury asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I agree to this - - -\" she said, hesitantly. <br>\r\nThis was it. This was her last chance. If she agreed to this, her life would never be the same. Gone would be the days of action, spying, and saving the world. It would be replaced with parent-teacher meetings, diaper changes, and motherhood. If she declined, which she could very well do, she could go on living her life as it was. One of the last of her kind, fighting and protecting, until the day she died alone, probably in some hellhole somewhere in the universe, trying to stop another threat from killing everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<i>This is it Natalia. Make you choice</i> She thought. Belly, babies, child-rearing, life. Bullets, bombs, world-saving, death. <br>\r\n\"Agent Romanova. Time is off the essence.  I need an answer\" Nick Fury ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter Parker's dying words echoed in her head. <i>Tell them, tell whoever comes after us - With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility</i> Well, they weren't officially his last words, they were the last words officially issued to the public at his funeral, turning him from outcast to hero. They even built a statue for him in lobby of The Daily Bugle, and his birthday was going be to an unofficial holiday. Most of her dead's friends birthday's were going to be holidays. Officially, all of the superheroes who died were going to be remember on Hero's Day, an official federal holiday, with television specials, fireworks, parades, days off from school; it was the least the world could do for them; everyone said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I - - -\" she paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want them to have a nice house. In a nice neighborhood. With good schools, no great schools. A nice little suburb somewhere, and a white picket fence.\" She thought, her decision made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to be a mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this?\" Nick Fury asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But this is something the world needs. They need a new generation to latch onto. If you take away people's hope for a better tomorrow, when the next bad guy shows up, they will bend their knee instead of raising their fist.\" Natalia says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Report to the medical bay in one hour. Banner will be ready for you. In the meantime, I'll have our shield agents find you your perfect house, and begin purchasing the necessary supplies. You're going to need cribs, baby clothes, food, toys, books - -\" Nick Fury said with a pause <br>\r\n\"And probably some bigger items for yourself\" He said finishing his thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, I didn't think about my figure</i> she thought, catching sight of herself in the full-length mirror in her room. <i>Well, we all make sacrifices</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be time for all that later General Fury, its - - - \" Natalia said. <br>\r\n\"Natalia, there is something you should now. This Serum, causes an accelerated pregnancy. You won't have nine months. You'll have nine days, maybe ten.\" Fury stare was blank and emotionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine days? You mean?\" Natalia asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's a month a day. But don't worry. The rapid growth is only in-uetero, once their born, they will grow just like an other happy healthy child.\" Nick Fury states. <br>\r\n\"Were you going to keep this from me?\" Natalia asks, the thought of motherhood in two weeks starts sending off alarm bells in her head. <br>\r\n\"No. We would have told you before we injected you with the serum. When I say time is off the utmost importance, we mean it. We don't have time to make new superheroes the old fashioned way. We need them, and we need them now. Our analysts predict another ELE level event like Herofall within a 15-to-16 year period at the earliest.\" Nick Fury states, the gravity of the situation becoming clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about Fury's word, hoping for an excuse to back out, but finding none. The world needed this, SHIELD needed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need this</i> She thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, you better get searching. I hear it's a buyer's market right now. Don't disappoint\" She said. <br>\r\n\"It will be the best house Stark's money can by.\" Fury said. <br>\r\n\"Stark? I didn't know he had a fund for SHIELD\". Natalia asks.<br>\r\n\"He doesn't. But, what's a few missing millions for him?\" Fury says with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n\"How's he doing?\" Natalia asks. <br>\r\nShe hasn't been to see Stark in weeks. She just couldn't bring herself to see him like that.<br>\r\n\"Pepper says that's he showing some very prominent brain activity. They think he might walk up from the coma soon.<br>\r\nBut enough about him.  Medical Bay - One Hour\" Fury said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK! Nick Fury's face disappears, leaving the communicator screen blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo turning back now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her choice, and she was going to have to live with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 18 years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hand on her flat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or girl</i> she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I existed, and to this person, I mattered.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pounded on the door, one more time, as hard as she could, nearly denting  a small section of the frame, when the lights came on in the medical bay, and a lone, meek, one-armed figure came shuffling out in a dirty t-shirt and sweatpants, wearing a lab coat and his glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Bruce Banner, one of the smartest men in the history of the world, and, after the events of \"Herofall\" he might have been the smartest man alive on the planet. He stifled a yawn with his one good (and only) arm, adjusting his glasses, and looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good morning Agent Romanova. I see you've been convinced to join us for a little project\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Not so little from what I've heard, although I'll probably find that out first hand - - - IF it works\" Natalia said. <br>\r\nNatalia Romanova was not a fan of Bruce Banner. He was smarter than everyone else and he knew it. He was cleverer than everyone else and he knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was more dangerous than everyone else, AND HE KNEW IT. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Bruce Banner is what happens when science and a lack of a human conscious run amok. Although, you wouldn't guess it by looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will work, Agent Romanova. All of my work is successful, you knew that.\" Banner says, stepping aside, showing her into the medical bay, a surgical table standing in the center, a large needle and a bottle of a glowing green liquid right next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except for the work you're doing to cure your little problem\" She says coldly, walking towards the table. <br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. Quite clever Agent Romanova, now if you would please lift up your shirt and lie on the table we can begin.\" He says, reaching for his missing arm to scratch it, but finding nothing but air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it still bother you Bruce?\" Natalia inquires, in a rare moment of civility between the two. <br>\r\n\"I swear everyday it gets worse. It's like I can still feel it there. I talked to Kurt about it, and he says it's going to get worse before it gets better.\" He says, prepping everything for the injection. <br>\r\n\"You talked to Kurt Conners?\" Natalia asks, knowing that Kurt Conners, also known as The Lizard, was one of the few survivors of Herofall, and also a sworn enemy to Peter Parker, AKA The Amazing Spider-Man, a fallen friend and former Avenger. <br>\r\n\"I know he's not the best company but there's not many members in the  \"brilliant one-armed scientists with a control problem that causes them to turn into a giant monsters\" support group; I have to take what I can get. Besides, without his help, we would not have been able to finish this serum. <br>\r\nNow lay down and lift up your shirt.\" Banner said without emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was switching into scientist mode, and when he was focused in his work, he was unemotional. He didn't risk his darker half coming out. <br>\r\nAt the crux of Herofall, when the mightest of Earth's heroes and villains clashed to the death, Bruce Banner, or, The Hulk more specifically, was hesitant to join the fighting, despite direct orders from The Avengers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was afraid. Afraid of what might happen if Nuerothought got control of him, a giant green rage made with unlimited strength and power. <br>\r\nIf it wasn't the end, it would be damn near close. The Hulk only joined the battle when his love, Betty Ross when being held captive by a mind-controlled Thor, coaxing him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Hulk arrived, hell followed behind him. Thor and The Hulk were supposedly the most powerful beings in the known universe, and when the two fought, the world shook in fear. The battle lasted for hours, Thor, pushed beyond his physical limit, nearly brought down the Hulk permanently, severing the green giants arm from his body with a series of devastating blows from his hammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany thought the Hulk's regenerative abilities were limitless. That day proved many wrong. <br>\r\nIt was only hours later, and the sacrifice of Captain America against Thor, was Thor finally able to break the spell of the brain parasite with the help of Mr. Fantastic. <br>\r\nThor, after seeing what he did to his friends, left the mortal world after the battle, and has never returned sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Widow laid down on the table, and lifted up her shirt, her perfect abs visible against her smooth skin. <br>\r\n\"Is this going to hurt?\" Black Widow asked, almost out a force of habit. <br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Dr. Banner said, readying the needle. <br>\r\n\"Great bedside manner\" she retorted, preparing herself for what came next. <br>\r\n\"I'm going to give you the cliff notes Natalia, because time is short. CHIMERA has found out we're working on this, and is probably going to be stopping by to shut us down. They'll take everything. The notes, the prototypes, the backups, the backups of the backups. We'll lose everything. Everything that was fought and sacrificed will be meaningless. This serum is going to change that. It's going to make sure people like us will still be around and still matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's going to rewrite parts of your genetic material, namely the sections of the Super-Soldier Serum knock-off you were given by Red Room in her early days in the Black Widow program. It's going to undo the damage that serum did, and allow you to have a child, while still preserving your abilities. It's going to hurt a lot, but it will work.\" Banner says, preparing to inject her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will I know when it works?\" She asks, knowing it's a stupid question.<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll know. Believe me you'll know\" And without warning, Banner pierces her skin with the needle, pushing down the plunger. <br>\r\nNatalia Romanova could feel it coursing through her, spreading a warm tingle through every section of her body. It felt good, like being wrapped up in a warm blanket on a cold winter's day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And done.\" Banner said, emptying the last of the serum into her, putting the needle on the table next to him.<br>\r\n\"That wasn't so bad\" she says, enjoying the warmness flowing through her.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's not the bad part. That bad part will becoming in thirty seconds if my calculations are correct.\" He says, looking at his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentle warmness turned into a raging inferno running through her. Every inch of her body felt like it was melting, her body suddenly becoming heavy with sweat. She trashed and convulsed as the pain ravaged through her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's been in some pain before, she was a spy, it came with the territory, but this was unlike anything she ever felt before.<br>\r\nShe felt as if she was dying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost over! It's almost over! Just power through it, and it will be all over!\" He shouted over her groans and moans. <br>\r\nSuddenly, just as it started, the burning turned back into a mild warmth, that seemed to dissipate all over her body, before settling in her belly. <br>\r\nThat too, lasted a few mere moments before vanishing completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tired, and sweaty. She weakly turned her head towards Banner.<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his watch, waiting for something to occur. <br>\r\nTime marched forwards, seconds turning into minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" She asked, growing annoyed. <br>\r\n\"You tell me. We should be finding out very soon.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit her like a truck, a sudden feeling of needing to throw up. NOW.<br>\r\nShe threw herself off the table, and with shaky legs, ran towards the bathroom in the medical bay as fast as she could.<br>\r\nShe barely made it as she felt her dinner make a reappearance from her mouth to the toilet bowl. <br>\r\nURK! was the noise she made, hurling once again into the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments passed any her stomach settled. She flushed the toilet, sending the sick to the Helicarrier's on board sewage storage tanks. She got up slowly off the floor, and left the bathroom only to be greeted by a smiling Dr. Banner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Natalia. It worked\" was all he said. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not of smoke. Not of screams, blood, violence, or death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreamt of joy. Of life. Of hope. Of a better tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreamt of a small blue two-story house, with a white door and a white picket-fence. She dreamt of a yard, littered with toys. She dreamt of children's clothing, hanging on a clothes line, gently swaying in the breeze of a warm summer's day. She dreamt of herself looking into a mirror, a medium sized firm bulge visible through her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreamt of a future, a far future, where humanity would stand and watch as her children fought alongside a new generation of heroes against a new threat beyond her imagining. She dreamt of a son and a daughter, lifting their fists high into the air, shouting the words \"ASSEMBLE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke, it was several hours later in the medical bay, and she was alone. Looking around, she found a note on a digipad from Bruce Banner. <br>\r\n\"Natalia, everything went well. I recommend taking it easy for the next few days. Bed rest and some serious calorie intake are doctor's orders! If you don't, you'll make me angry. And you won't like me when I'm angry. - Banner\" It ended with a little winking emoticon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia stood up, still feeling a little shaky from a few hours earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she took in everything that has happened to her, placing her hand on her (now) flat stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh Natalia, I think you're in a little over your head on this one</i> she thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the medical bay, thought she not alone.<br>\r\nShe would never be alone.<br>\r\nNot anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGROAN. A fierce yearning for food came from stomach. <br>\r\n<i>Hungry little one? </i> Natalia thinks to herself, the feeling of her quickly approaching motherhood washing over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, Uncle Banner recommended eating, and I'm starving. Perhaps we should go find something to eat?\" She says to her passenger, who gives no reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns the corner of the hallway, heading towards the mess hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her stomach was groaning loudly with hunger as she entered the mess hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer years of training as spy for both Russia and America had taught her to move without sound, blending with the shadows, being a walking ghost; no one ever knowing she was there until it was too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just the same as she crept into the mess hall, the clock on the wall reading 5:35 AM. While there weren't many active members of The Avengers aboard the helicarrier, Black Widow didn't want to risk waking anyone. The last thing she wanted anyone to see was her stuffing her face, I mean, she may now be an expectant mother, but she still had an image to uphold, even if just for a few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the fridge and began to dig through it's contents, trying to find something. Eventually she found what appeared to be several slices of pizza, with the word's \"Flash's Pizza. DO NOT EAT. I WILL KNOW IF YOU DO\" written on it in bright red letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Flash. I need it more than you do\" Natalia says with a smirk, taking a bite of the cold slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene \"Flash\" Thompson or \"Venom\" as he was know known as, was every bit the solider that Captain America was or Natalia currently was, even after losing his legs in Iraq. Of course, Project Rebirth 2.0 fixed that when they bonded him the symbiote, restoring his ability to walk and given him nearly identical powers to Spider-Man, which shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone, it still was the Venom symbiote after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another huge bite out of her slice of pizza, feeling the gnawing hunger inside of her dissipate some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So with the hunger issue solved, I think it's time to start coming up with more pressing matters</i> Natalia thought to herself. <i>So what do you think kid? Boy or Girl? Do I buy you a baseball or a doll?</i> She thought, chewing, looking at her flat midsection, hoping for some kind of response from her passenger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, I guess we can cross telepathy of the list of your potential powers</i> she thinks, taking a huge bite out of another piece of pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after \"Herofall\" as people called it, many of the surviving different superhero teams folded into each other or vanished completely. The Thunderbolts were invited to be folded into what remained of the Avengers. Flash accepted immediately, seeing as his powers could fill the void left behind by Parker's death, and well because, he was a soldier, and it was his duty. The same was said for Thaddeus \"Red Hulk\" Ross, who rejoined the team after Fury benched Banner after losing his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The world doesn't need a one-armed Hulk\" Fury told Banner bluntly. Natalia thought that Ross was more than a little too happy to replace Banner as the heavy hitter of the group, taking away from Banner something else he loved. Well, maybe not loved, but needed. <br>\r\n<i>Those two would never get along, even after everything they've been through</i> Natalia thought, scarfing down her third slice of pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to the fridge, and poured herself some orange juice, and started dunking her pizza into the glass. <br>\r\n<i>Orange Juice and Pizza. I must be pregnant</i> she thought, chewing her citrusy pizza. It was divine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank Castle AKA The Punisher was one of the few non-powered humans who survived \"Herofall\", although no-one has any idea how. He spat in Fury's face when told he could join The Avengers. \"I don't save the world, I punish it\" was all he said, and was never seen again. Most people considered that a successful meeting since nobody died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElektra as killed at \"Herofall\" one of the non-controlled who died valiantly in the line of duty. Her name was just one of many that lined the monument built at the old Avengers manor, which was now turned into a museum dedicated to teach young and old about the lives and sacrifices of some many who died that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Deadpool. Let's just say he didn't make the cut. He may have been a Great Lakes Avengers, but the man was certifiably crazy. Violent, deranged and a loose cannon, the world didn't need a hero like him. The Avengers didn't need a hero like him. However, he seemed to refuse to take no for an answer and moved into the Helicarrier anyways, declared himself the leader of the Avengers, and tried to change the name of the team to \"Deadpool And His Ass-Kicking Awesome Friends TM\". Yes, he would even say the world \"Trademark\", every single time he said the name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey even tried to make sure that he would never find his way onto the few missions that they ever actually went on, but somehow he always found a way to show up, making complicated situations a thousand times worse. Eventually they just gave up and let him stay, even if they told him twenty times a day he wasn't an Avenger, and to get the hell off the Helicarrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights suddenly clicked on in the mess hall, and within miliseconds, Natalia had dropped her food, assumed a battle position, and had her guns pointed at the person who just entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So a little birdy told me the good news Natalia, or should I call you Mommy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice belonged to one Carol Danvers, AKA Ms. Marvel, currently known now as Captain Marvel. She stood at the mess hall entrance in her bathrobe, holding a coffee cup in her crossed arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia let her guard down, returning her attention away from her friend and fellow Avengers back to her soggy Orange Juice/Pizza combo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about Carol\" Natalia said, finishing her third slice of pizza, and washing it down with the orange juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bullshit me Natalia. Fury told me direct. Said he was taking you off the active roster list\" Carol said. \"So how are you feeling?\" <br>\r\n\"Tired, hungry, nauseous, scared, excited, anxious. Take your pick\" Natalia confided to her friend. <br>\r\n\"I think you're going to be a great mother.\" Carol said, obviously lying. <br>\r\n\"You're a horrible liar Carol\" Natalia said raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. But what else am I supposed to say?\" Carol said walking over to the coffee machine, pouring herself a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't told anyone else have you?\" Natalia asked. <br>\r\n\"No. Fury told me, and I kept it to myself. It's your decision if you want to tell anyone else, although, I think they'll be able to figure it out on a few days\" Carol said, taking a huge sip from her cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A few days</i> the words echoing through Natalia's head. Amongst everything that had happened in the past few hours, she still hadn't let it sink in. She had days, not months to prepare for what was coming. Late night feedings, diaper changes, first steps, first words, parenting, motherhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt faint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you ever need any help, you got Sue and Jessica on speed-dial.\" Carol said, trying to be a good friend. <br>\r\n\"I know but still. I'm not quite sure I'm ready for this\" Natalia said, her hand finding it's way to her flat stomach. <br>\r\n\"I don't think anyone's ever ready for life-changing as that\" Carol said, drinking deep her coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\" Natalia asked.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter what I think. I'm the leader of team of what remains of able bodied superheroes who mostly just sit around all day doing nothing, except for the occasional PR event, or secret mission.\" Carol said with a dry tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol had become the leader of the Avengers after Captain America's and Hawkeye's death, Iron Man's coma, and Thor's disappearance. Natalia didn't want the job, instead passing on her recommendation as Carol for team leader onto Fury himself. She still believes she made the right decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the other hand, I think you're going to need some looser clothes, a skin-tight black leather catsuit dosen't make the best maternity clothes\" Carol said with a smart-ass tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia let out a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I'm going to get huge aren't I?\" Natalia says, looking at her flat-stomach. <br>\r\n\"I wonder if the Helicarrier is large enough to dock a blimp\" Carol says with a catty tone. <br>\r\n\"Laugh it up Carol, I'll make sure Banner doses you next\" Natalia says. <br>\r\n \"He tires that I'll take his other arm\" Carol says drinking her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How are you doing this morning?\" Banner asked, adjusting his glasses with his one good arm <br>\r\n\"Well, I just practically ate an entire pizza by myself and I'm still starving\" She said, with mild annoyance in her voice. <br>\r\n\"Not surprising. The rapid growth of your unborn child is causing a massive need for caloric intake. However, i'd advise against against pigging out on junk food as so many pregnant women are want to do. I'm going to create a menu for you for the new few days that's both delicious and healthy.\" Banner said.<br>\r\n\"So now binge eating on Ice Cream and Cheeseburgers?\" Natalia asks with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n\"The menu only there for your benefit. Feel free to do whatever you want, but just know that after the baby is born, the weight is yours to lose\" Banner said in an unusually catty tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I owe the pleasure of your call?\" Natalia asked.<br>\r\n\"I want you to come back down to the medical for a few more tests\" Banner states.<br>\r\n\"I thought you said everything checked out fine earlier\" Natalia said.<br>\r\n\"Yes. But that was a few hours ago. I want to run multiple tests daily to make sure everything is progressing well. This is untested medical science here Natalia. You want to make sure everything is okay with your child don't you?\" Banner said.<br>\r\nNatalia could see that Banner was appealing to her quickly awakening motherly instincts, and damn it, and it was working. <br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Natalia said. <br>\r\n\"Meet me in the medbay in an hour\" Banner said plainly, and then his face was gone off her communicator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seem odd to you?\" Natalia asked, her years of spying and information gathering telling her that something was off.<br>\r\n\"A one-armed scientist who turns into a giant green rage monster you used a super science serum to impregnate one of the world's greatest female secret agents wants to see you and you ask if something is odd?\" Carol asked raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n\"Odder than usual.\" Natalia corrected. <br>\r\n\"Banner has always been an odd one, but then again most geniuses are. I'm sure he's just concerned about your health. I mean, this project is his baby, pun not intended\" Carol said. <br>\r\n\"You're right\" Natalia said, her hand resting on the flat of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited around for an hour, finishing her impromptu meal, and leaving a note for Flash, telling him that was \"sorry about the pizza, but it was an emergency. Ask Banner or Fury about it.\" <br>\r\nShe then walked down the hall to the medical bay, and entered, Banner sitting there with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n\"Please take a seat. This will only take a little while\" He said, pointing to a chair. <br>\r\nBlack Widow sat down. She was met with the familiar pinch of the needle entering her arm, as Banner drew the blood.<br>\r\n\"So how are we feeling?\" Banner asked.<br>\r\n\"You've already asked me that\" Black Widow answered <br>\r\n\"I know. I just want to make sure that you're fine. Your body is going to be going through quite a lot of change over the next few days. I want to make sure you're healthy mentally as well as physically\" Banner said, finishing up drawing the blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe removed the vial, and loaded it into a machine which fed the data into the computer. He typed a few keys on the keyboard and her bloodwork appeared <br>\r\non the screen. <br>\r\n\"Excellent. More than excellent.\" He said looking over the data. <br>\r\n\"Finding something interesting Doctor Banner?\" Natalia asked looking at the data. She may be smart, but everything on the screen looked like Greek to her as the saying goes.<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh yes. Everything looks great for the most part. Some of your levels are a little high, but it looks like they'll stabilize as your pregnancy progresses over the next few days. I want you to exercise when you get the chance but don't over do it. Also, I would recommend checking up with me daily, at least more than twice. I also have a dietary menu made up for you, some healthy tasty diet options perfect your rapidly growing unborn child. Now granted, this diet isn't Doctor's orders, but more of a guideline. If you want to pig out on junk food, the weight loss after the birth will be your problem\" Banner said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I go now?\" Natalia asked, sounding slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Banner said turning back to his computer screen looking at the blood work. <br>\r\nBlack Widow sighed and left the medical bay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - <br>\r\nBack In The Medbay<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanner looked at the screen , decoding the information. Tapping a note on his phone, he began to record an audio log. <br>\r\n\"Notes on the project, Dr. Bruce Banner reporting. The project is moving ahead faster than I could ever hope. My suggestion to use Natalia \"Black Widow\" Romanova as a test subject has proven to be the correct choice. Her body is strong enough to deal with the rapid changes being brought about by the serum. Blood work appears normal except for a few high levels that I believe will correct themselves in a few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject is reporting increased hunger as was expected to deal with rapid gestation. Moving forward with new revision of formula to begin Phase 2 testing. I will use my own genetic sequence as the catalyst. Once introduced into the female subject's blood stream, it should bond with her DNA to replicate the same effect as Subject 1. This should allow her to produce a child with the same gamma-based abilities as myself, minus the actual genetic birth defects that would occur if I was to produce a child with a woman naturally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI believe in theory this should allow a perfect mixture of the Phase 1 Serum and the Phase 2 serum to create the perfect gamma-powered super hero super solider and the next evolution of humanity. These notes must be kept secret from Fury who has forbidden me from using my \"Hulk\" as they call it DNA for any kind of this test. Beginning immediate work on Phase 2 and Phase 3 serums\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nBlack Widow<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked down the hall, Black Widow thought about the life in front of her, and more importantly, the life inside of her. <br>\r\nWas she going to be mother material? Would she tell her child the truth behind it's origins if he or she asked? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought....</span></div></div>",

After that Natasha helped Carol to her feet and made their way to the pool. Once they both got in, they would talk about the baby and life and stuff Natasha wants to do as a mother,\" To be honest Natasha, I don't think having a plumper body is bad, I actually like me being plump\" said Carol as she played with her pudge in the water.\" A plump body does sound nice, but as you can see I'm gonna be fat after this\" Natasha told her as she rubbed oil on her belly.

She then got out of bed and noticed that Carol wasn\u2019t in the floor, Natasha then walked out of the room and walked into the kitchen to find a nice big breakfast waiting for her,\u201d I figured you\u2019d be hungry, after all you are eating more than one\u201d carol said,\u201d aww carol, you sure do want me to get fatter don\u2019t you\u201d Natasha said in a cocky tone. Natasha then sat down at the table and started eating, carol who knew she was gonna walk away a little bigger than before decided to put extra sugar in her breakfast,\u201d better take notes from Natasha on her eating skills\u201d carol said to herself, after all she was fattening herself up just for Natasha to be happy. Speaking of Natasha who was stuffing her pregnant belly, which more looked like a pregnant gut, was starting to think that she definitely gonna need some bigger clothes,\u201d ugh my clothes are starting to get too tight, am I really getting that big?\u201d She said asked herself, so while carol was stuffing herself up, Natasha waddled to the bathroom to take a look at her body. When she arrived in the bathroom the first thing she noticed was how big her belly had gotten,\u201dgod, I\u2019m huge\u201d she said, as she looked like she was ready to pop, she looked like she was overdue with triplets. Next was her breasts, she looked how she could woe men with them but now,\u201d I think my days as a hero are over with\u201d she said. Next was her butt, which had gotten huge, she gave her big butt a slap and watched it jiggle, her butt had become a cushion for her now. Last was her face, three days ago Natasha\u2019s face was normal, but three days later chubby cheeks and a double chin,\u201d my god I am fat, there\u2019s no doubt about it, I did this to myself, I became a fat pregnant cow\u201d Natasha said as she shedded a tear. Then carol walked in, because she heard Natasha crying,\u201d hey it\u2019s gonna alright nat, your not the only one doing this, I am here for you, I know your huge, but I\u2019m gonna try and get just as big as you so you can be happy\u201d carol said as she showed her her progress on her weight gain, carol literally stuffed herself as much as Natasha did in the past two days, carol now weighs 174lbs. \u201c My goodness Carol, how did you get that big that quick?! \u201c Natasha asked her.\u201d Well, while you were stuffing yourself crazy, I was eating twice as much, I\u2019m glad I got into these sweats cuz my butt is huge, and I love my new belly\u201d Carol told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then, Natasha and carol both left the bathroom and sat in the living room for a little bit,\u201d ugh, carol, I don\u2019t know how much bigger I\u2019m going to get, I mean it\u2019s day three and I look like I\u2019m ready to pop at any moment\u201d Natasha told her,\u201d well with your food intake being high, you might end up immobile, so we might have to slow you down on the stuffing your gut\u201d carol told her. She looked at Natasha\u2019s belly and saw how round it was, carol thought about if it was her being the fat pregnant woman instead of being the fat friend.\u201d We probably need to get ready if we\u2019re going to go get some new clothes \u201c carol said. Natasha  would now have to squeeze into some leggings, she waddled to her wardrobe to find some clothes. She found some leggings and squeezed into them, stretched to the max she took them off and sat them on her bed, Natasha knew her boulders weren\u2019t going to fit into any of her bras, but she decided to get one and lay it out. Next was a shirt, this would be the first time Natasha would wear a shirt over bigger belly, she found a shirt and put in on, the shirt showed a little bit of Natasha\u2019s belly at the bottom, but she didn\u2019t really have anything else that fit her so she laid that on her bed, now that she had her clothes laid out, she needed to bathe. Meanwhile carol had just stepped out of the shower, examining her bigger body, she loved how big her belly had got,\u201d maybe being like this isn\u2019t so bad, then again I don\u2019t have a baby in my belly\u201d she said to herself. As carol stepped out of the bathroom and went to Natasha\u2019s room to get ready, she saw Natasha waddle out of the kitchen with a snack,\u201d how much food does she have to eat before she\u2019s actually full\u201d carol wondered. Natasha then waddled to the bathroom to get into the shower, on her way she let out a huge fart,\u201d sorry carol, comes with the pregnancy\u201d she said before letting out another fart. Natasha then got into the shower and started thinking about her fatness,\u201d ugh I\u2019m gonna be a cow compared to the other ladies at shield, at least I have carol gaining with me on this \u201c she said to herself. Natasha was taking longer than her usual showers, making sure to wash off every part of her body,\u201d almost done, now time to do my hair\u201d she said before washing her hair. Natasha then finished up in the shower and got out, she dried off and went to her room to get ready for some shopping.</span></div></div>",

The Guardians of the Galaxy had just pulled off a rescue mission for the Nova Corps, but not before they were attacked by raiders. They pulled it off, just barely. Pulling it off, just barely was basically the way they operated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough their ship was nearly destroyed, Peter Quill, or Star-Lord as he liked to refer himself as, didn't seem phased. He blasted music through the ship's speaker system. The rest of the Guardians, weren't exactly amused. They all sat in the cockpit, looking on as Peter sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch if you will, my stomach. Feel how it trembles inside. You've go the butterflies all tied up, don't make me chase you. Even doves have pride!\" he belted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuill turned around, watching the rest of the group look at him with wide eyes. \"Come on, now. Feel free to join in! Gamora, let's hear those pipes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Quill,\" Gamora said, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mantis?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do know know how to sing, Peter,\" she replied meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, guys! I can't believe none of you know Prince! I thought he would have been known galaxy-wide!\" Quill exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not familiar with this Prince. What province does he rule over?\" Drax asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter sighed. \"No he's not...he's not a real prince. Whatever, where are we going again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, Quill! I just told you five minutes ago! I've got a connection in Knowhere that can get this baby fixed as quickly as possible. She'll be good as new in the morning. And if we're lucky, he might hook us up with another job. It's like they don't got ears or something, Groot,\" Rocket replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot, who was now closer to a child in size rather than a baby, nodded. \"I am Groot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship arrived at Knowhere, the Celestial head turned outpost, and docked close to where Rocket's ally was. Rocket went out to catch up with his contact, and Groot followed suit. Drax took Mantis with him, showing her around and trying to impress her with stories. That left only Gamora and Quill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped her as she exited the ship. \"Where are you headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora turned around, rolling her eyes. \"I was going to hit the bar and drink a little. Maybe get into a fight if I'm lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I join you?\" Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped for a moment, pondering the request. \"Sure, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter and Gamora sat at the bar, taking in the sights and sounds of Knowhere as they drank. She looked at him. He seemed more...introspective than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's eating you, Peter?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Nothing's eating me! I am one hundred percent not eaten,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. I've never seen you not happy while you were drinking,\" Gamora stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuill sighed. \"It's just... I've come to realize that I've had less than ideal father figures throughout my life. The man who I grew up with was a murdering, thieving, bandit, and my actual father was a Celestial who murdered my mom and wanted to wipe out the entire universe. So, you know, both not great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora nodded. \"Yeah. Thanos killed half of my people, raised me as his own, had me and Nebula fight each other to near-death almost every day, and wants to wipe out half of the universe. I guess we have something in common.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey clinked their glasses together and took another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me something, Gamora,\" Peter began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to tell you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't we together? I thought that after everything's that happened, especially on Ego's planet, that you liked me. Thanks to Mantis, you already know how I feel about you,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't want to get attached. Okay? Doing that before has never worked out well for me. And I think that sooner or later, Thanos will come. And when he does, that might be the end. Of you, and me, and everything. And I don't want to...to have that feeling of what it'd be like if I lost someone close,\" Gamora explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked at the drinks that lined the walls of the bar. His eyes lit up when he saw one in particular. He got the bartender's attention and signaled for two glasses. The bartender filled it up with the alcohol and slid it towards Quill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Gamora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some liquor from back on Earth. Didn't know they had this stuff here. Way stronger than most of the stuff you'll find on Knowhere,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora scoffed. \"No way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter raised an eyebrow. \"You doubt it? How about you find out? Shot for shot with me. Right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora looked up at him.</span></div></div>",

He placed one in front of each of them a filled them up with whatever the liquor was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou're about to go down Gamora, \u201d Quill said, ready to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWe\u2019ll see about that\u201d Gamora poked back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey raised their glasses to the other and downed it. It tasted bitter and very strong, but not strong enough for Gamora to lose. She looked to Quill, who seemed to have shrugged it off just as quick, if not quicker than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The bartender poured another shot. They locked eyes and drank it fast. Another. And another. Soon enough, four shots had blurred into several, but neither opponent had given in yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThree... T-two. One go!\u201d Quill managed to say, slurring his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI-I can't. You... Youu win\u201d Gamora struggled to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWoo! Haha! I, I am the b-best!\u201d Quill responded, celebrating with another shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dN-no no Peter, no, no more drink,\u201d Gamora said, trying to stop Peter from overdrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhy?! I-I won?\u201d he exclaimed, a little annoyed that someone was stopping his fun. \u201dIs it be-because you Love mee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWh-what if it, if it was?\u201d Gamora said, unable to control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuill leaned over to her and kissed her. It would have been more romantic had neither of them been drunk, making it a very sloppy kiss. But it was a kiss nonetheless. And Gamora returned the favour, kissing him back as well. They stopped for a second and locked eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThe ship?\u201d they both asked simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got up and ran drunkenly to the ship, stopping for a bout of random giggling or vomiting every now and again. Eventually, the Benatar came into view and the two figures stumbled up the ramp, undressing as they went. They kissed passionately, stopping to kiss before reaching Peters bedroom. Gamora pushed him down onto the bed, ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora woke up with a thumping headache pounding in her head. She tried opening her eyes but the lights were too bright for her, so they remained closed. She rolled onto her side groggily, bumping into something. Annoyed she tried to push it away before it grunted back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dStop it, I'm awake!\u201d she heard Peter groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was in bed with Peter and had been near blackout drunk the night before, then that meant- her train of thought was cut off by the overwhelming urge to vomit. She rushed out of bed into the bathroom and started chundering into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dLightweight...\u201d Peter mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have responded, but another wave of vomiting forced her down again. She had never felt the need to vomit this much. Maybe she was just a lightweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dPeter, what happened last night?\u201d she asked, her voice croaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dPut two and two together\u201d He grunted, still half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora blushed with embarrassment. Sure she had wanted this, and still did, but doing it drunk? That was less than ideal. \u201dPeter no one hears of this, Ok?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grumbled something unintelligible in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dPeter please!\u201d she said, before vomiting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYes ok! Fine\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora sighed, feeling awful. She stood up and started to leave, trying to avoid the others.</span></div></div>",

She carefully tiptoed through the ship, making it to the mess hall, until--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Gamora! Did you and Peter have fun last night?\" Mantis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, Rocket, and Groot sat in the mess hall eating breakfast. Gamora tried to cover up her underwear-clad body, then spotted her clothes lying in a pile on the floor. She leaped forward and grabbed them, quickly putting them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Quill just...had to show me something in his room, that's all!\" Gamora exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket nodded. \"Oh, I'm sure he showed ya somethin', alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't worry about it, Groot. Nothing that you need to be knowing about right now,\" Rocket replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't do anything!\" Gamora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket nodded. \"Sure! I believe you, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora sighed. \"Okay, good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora walked down one of the ship's hallways, towards her room. That was, until Drax exited his room right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Gamora! How was your lovemaking with Quill?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and continued walking to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not well, I take it,\" Drax said, joining the others in the mess hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she entered her room, Gamora bolted to her bathroom and vomited again. She'd never gotten this sick from drinking before. Was Quill right? Was that really the strongest stuff available?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora tried to shake it off and slipped into some different clothes. Her stomach rumbled. She rubbed her hand over the flat, toned surface. If she were this hungover, some food might do her good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to the mess hall, and saw that Quill had joined them. He looked up and his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...Gamora...\" he trailed off, having trouble finding the right words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora headed to the kitchen and grabbed some food packets, more than she usually did. The rest of the crew looked at her as she gobbled down the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?\" Gamora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of them looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So last night, you know how I was talking about my contact hooking us up with another job?\" Rocket asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuill, Mantis, Groot, and Drax nodded. Gamora was too focused on her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket gave her the side eye and continued his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've got it, and it's a big one! We'll be so rich we won't know what to do with ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the catch? It's gotta be pretty complex if it's so lucrative,\" Peter noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is indeed, but nothing we can't handle. There's a vault on Xandar that has a gun, along with some other artifacts that we can steal if we have time. This gun can unlock any door that you aim it at. That'll be useful, since we have to break into Kyln. There's a prisoner there that we have to break out, and after that we gotta take them to Contraxia. There's a contact on Contraxia that'll give us info, but only in exchange for the prisoner. They'll give us the location of a convoy carrying all sorts of valuable items. Weapons, riches, the works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guardians looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rocket is right, it is a complex plan,\" Mantis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're the Guardians of the Galaxy, ain't we? Come on, what's the worst that could happen?\" Rocket asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we actually have a choice?\" Gamora wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. If you don't want to do it, then I'll just kick you off my ship!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter stood up and put his hand on Rocket's shoulder. \"It's my ship, but I agree with Rocket. This sounds like it could be worth it. I'm in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the crew agreed, and the plan was set into motion.</span></div></div>",

Gamora\u2019s nausea began to subside as the day wore on, and most of the day was spent in the bridge, on the way to Xandar. Everyone else was mostly quiet, save for Peter singing along to his music, and the occasional snore from drax. Groot was back and forth from his seat, to everyone elses, his curious nature drawing him towards everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the day was ending, and most of the crew were heading to sleep, leaving Peter and Gamora in the cockpit, Groot curled asleep on Gamora\u2019s lap. Despite what had happened last night, things between the two of they were fine. There had been a few awkward silences between them or the occasional irritating comment from one of the others, mostly Rocket and Drax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora carefully lifted roof out of her lap and held him up, resting his head on her shoulder. \u201dI'm going to take Groot to bed, and then head to sleep myself, \u201d She said quietly to Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNight then\u201d was Peters reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora leant down to him and planted a kiss on his cheek. \u201dGood night,\u201d she said, smirking as she walked away, Leaving Peter speechless<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay Groot down on his bed and turned off the lights. He looked at cute, just curled up on his bed. Gamora smiled at him and left for her own room. She turned and shut the door, and got undressed and ready to sleep, but felt a wave I nausea come over her and rushed to the bathroom. <i>Just as I thought it was gone</i> she thought to herself. When it was over she lay on her bed and closed her eyes, drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora woke up. She had grown accustomed to waking up early and quickly from her experiences with Thanos. But now she chose to lay in bed for a while longer. She sat up slightly, nothing some irritation around her breasts. They felt sore, and she felt them try and alleviate some of the soreness, but she could feel vomit building in her throat and stopped, running for the bathroom. She stayed in the bathroom for a while, higher over the toilet preparing for more vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she was confident enough that she wouldn't vomit and left for the mess area. Luckily for her, it appeared that no one else was up yet, and she grabbed several packets of food and made her way back to her room, getting started on a packet on her way. <i>Why am I so hungry all of a sudden, a minute ago I was vomiting my guts out </i> she thought she retreated into her bedroom with her pile of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGood morning!\u201d a cheery voice said, making Gamora freeze where she was stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGood morning, Mantis, \u201d Gamora replied through mouthfuls, trying to hide her stash of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAre you feeling okay today?\u201d Mantis asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat? Oh, yeah I'm okay today, just a little bit of sick, \u201d Gamora said, not wanting to talk for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh that is very go-\u201d Mantis was interrupted by the sound of Gamora\u2019s door shutting and the faint sound of vomiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora was once again hunched over the toilet, trying to hold her hair up, and vomiting into the bowl. Something was seriously wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOne minute I'm starving and the next I need to vomit, what is happening?\u201d she asked herself, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days had passed and Gamora was beginning to recover. The nausea was starting to go away, only coming back every now and again, but her craving for food had not yet subsided, and if anything it had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stood in her room getting dressed for the day and inspected herself in the mirror. She looked over her toned green skin, and the muscles beneath, before looking to her normally toned abdomen. Recently she had started feeling bloated, and she was. It wasn't noticeable by any means, but she could definitely tell that she was bigger than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking about bigger than normal, her breasts had started to get sorer and had grown a size up in the past few days. She cupped them, feeling how tender they had gotten, and grabbed a bra. As she was slipping the bra on, out of the corner of her eye she saw Groot wander into the room, with a slightly lost look on his face. Gamora dropped her bra and rushed to cover her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGroot, what are you doing in here?\u201d She asked him, crouching down, to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI am Groot?\u201d he replied, sounding guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora sighed. \u201dDon't worry, you're not in trouble, but someone is, \u201d She said to Groot. \u201dROCKET! Don't let Groot wander on his own!\u201d she yelled, continuing to get dressed.</span></div></div>",

But there's these things called locks, they help keep your door shut when you don't want people to wander in. You should try it!\" Rocket yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Rocket entered the doorway, Gamora angrily threw a food packet at him. It smashed against the wall, crumbling to little pieces of dust. Rocket immediately backtracked and exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good talk. See ya, Gamora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora walked over to the crushed food packet. The food was smashed, but still edible. She opened the package and dumped the crumbs into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the guardians sat around the table in the mess hall of the Benatar, eating dinner. They had finally arrived at Xandar, and while Rocket cased the arms dealer that housed the vault containing the gun, Drax and Quill went out to get food. They were going to wait a few days before striking, making sure that they were fully prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each were digging into a carton of food. Except for Gamora, who was already on a second carton. Drax watched on as Gamora ate and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Keep eating like that and you'll get fat! And we'll see who will be the strongest warrior after that!\" he bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, Drax! I'm not fat!\" she replied, stuffing more food in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis exchange was mostly ignored by the rest of the group. Peter looked over his food, a confused look growing on his face. He looked at Gamora's carton that she was currently finishing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I thought we were gonna split that one?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora looked down at her carton that was now empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Yeah. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later, Gamora stood in her room, looking at her reflection in the mirror as she got dressed. Luckily for her, the nausea had completely subsided, but the constant hunger persisted. She assumed that it was due to how sick she was throughout the past week, that it was her body's way of catching up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still bloated too. It wasn't anything that the others would see, but she definitely did. Frustrated, Gamora pressed a hand into the puffy mass that pushed out just a couple of inches. It felt firm. Hopefully this was just bloat, and not her starting to gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora put on her clothes and headed to the bridge, were the other guardians waited. Rocket had up a projection of the map of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here's the plan. As you can see, the vault is located in the center of the complex. Leave that to me and Groot. I'll sweet talk the dealer, and he should give me a tour. Once we see the vault, I'll break in while Groot keeps me protected. Now, outside there's a large air vent that leads to where you three are going to get into once you shut down the fans,\" he began, pointing to Gamora, Drax, and Quill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! What will I do?\" Mantis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, Mantis, will keep watch on the ship. A thankless and valuable job, I might add,\" Rocked said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis nodded excitedly. \"Okay! I will do that to the best of my abilities!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocked raised an eyebrow. \"Right. Now, back to the plan. Once you're in, you'll be close to a guard outpost. What you three are gonna do is beat the everliving crap outta them. Draw some heat off of me as I try to break in. Once you're done there, go left down the hallway and eventually you'll hit the security center. Take out whoever is in there, and help disable some of the vault's shields and control the cameras to let me know how much time I have once I'm inside the vault. I know we're there for the gun, but I wanna take as much as I can outta there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the members comprehended the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Ready?\" Rocket asked.</span></div></div>",

Gamora was in her room, staring at herself in the mirror, inspecting her bloated belly. She grabbed a packet of food and started eating, inspecting her side profile in the mirror. <i>It's not enough to throw off my balance, I'll be fine</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard knocks at her door. \u201dGamora, we're going now\u201d she heard Peter say from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dBe right out\u201d she called back, pulling her shirt down and finishing her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out to join the others and walked with them out of the ship. She looked back and saw mantis waving to them enthusiastically, and smiled back to her. The group walked towards the facility, conscious of looking suspicious if they were running. They had planned the heist for the evening so that they had some darkness to act as cover, but have the minimum number of guards active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket and Groot broke off from the others and headed towards the gate, while Drax, Peter, and Gamora headed towards the vent. They arrived at the vent only to find that it wasn't unguarded like they'd expected, and they quickly dived for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat do we do?\u201d Quill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI shall take them. They will never see me coming\u201d Drax answered, Starting to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNo, but they'll hear you coming if you do your war cry,\u201d Gamora said, anticipating Drax\u2019s actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dBut I need to do it. It gets me pumped!\u201d Drax retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIt also gets Rocket and Groot killed!\u201d she hissed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI got \u2019em, \u201d Quill called to them, the barrels of his guns smoking, and the two guards unconscious on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora and Drax both looked surprised, but carried on. They lifted the grate and climbed into the vent, hiding the guard's bodies inside. They strode warily through the darkened tunnel, heading towards the guard post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dLeft or right?\u201d Drax asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dLeft! Did you not listen to rocket? He said left like 50 times!\u201d Quill replied, already exasperated with Drax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI did listen to him! I know that we have to fight some people!\u201d Drax quipped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora and Peter looked at each other with a shared look of <i>idiot</i>. They pushed onwards and came to the end of the vent. Gamora peeked outside and saw the guard post, filled with guards coming and going from other parts of the vault. She looked to Drax and Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhats the plan now. There's a lot of guards?\u201d she asked the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are a lot, aren\u2019t there. If we sneak down and-\u201d Peter said, getting cut off by Drax bursting through the grate into the guard post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no point in trying to be sneaky now, and the two of them jumped out into the fray. Peter covered them from a distance, taking potshots at anyone who got too close, while Drax and Gamora we're both cutting through the guards like butter. Gamora, however, felt slower than usual. She couldn't focus. All she could think about was her bloating, her illness, her hunger. All these thoughts were clouding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Drax laughing, and sighed, annoyed. Annoyed that she couldn't keep up with him, even though she was always ahead if him. Suddenly she felt someone tackle her to the ground, and panicked, thrashing at the guard to get him off of her. She heard two gunshots and saw Peter stood across from her with his guns held up, smoke rising from the barrels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAre you okay? That guy got the jump on you pretty easily\u201d He said, helping her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI'm fine. I'm just having a bad day\u201d she replied, deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI have won!\u201d Drax yelled from the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora\u2019s mood did not improve. It also didn't help that there were now alarms blaring and footsteps approaching from all directions. The trio braced themselves for a second wave. They fought them off again, Drax mowing through them, Peter picking them off from a distance, and Gamora making her way through them. As they fought through them, gamora noticed a few of them peeling off, heading towards the vault. She tried to stop them, but only caught one of the ones at the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dPeter! Drax! Get them!\u201d she yelled, trying to stop them from jeopardising the plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them tried to get to the group, only managing to stop a few, leaving most of them to get to the vault, where Rocket and Groot were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dRocket, you've got guards headed your way! Do we chase \u2019em or what?\u201d Quill called down the comms line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dclear the security room, destroy the console, it'll make breaking this door down a whole lot easier\u201d Rocket replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOn it!\u201d Quill said, signalling Gamora and Drax to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran to the security room, taking out ant guards on the way. They cleared the room as fast as they could, destroying the consoles in the room with a couple of grenades. As they left the room, Gamora felt out of breath, which was strange because usually age never got out of breath this easily. Something was definitely wrong with her, because this definitely was not just a \u2019bad day\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the vault, Rocket was crouched outside the doors next to a small panel. He was busily re-wiring and reshaping the circuitry inside. A sudden surge of energy, followed by the loud groan of the doors opening told him that the others had destroyed the security room, which meant that the plan was going to shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGroot, come on we don't got a lot of time!\u201d he called to Groot, who was sat on the floor, bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI am Groot!\u201d he replied excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket ran through the vault, trying to find the gun. Outside the door, he could hear the echoes of footsteps, getting louder and louder. He ran past piles of credits, weapons and other expensive looking things, pissed off that he couldn't grab them. He found the gun that he was looking for and climbed up into one of the vents, with Groot following close behind. He made it onto the roof and saw the others running back to the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dboy am I gonna have words with \u2019em\u201d he growled under his breath.</span></div></div>",

They each caught their breath, Gamora especially, as she sucked in the cool air of the ship. Mantis watched on, a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Groot scrambled onto the ship. His eyes were wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Groot! Are you alright? Where's Rocket?\" Gamora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot...\" he replied, a sad tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait. Only Rocket can understand what he's saying,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pointless,\" Drax added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuill stepped up and put a hand on Groot's shoulder. \"Hang on, hang on! I've been paying attention to their conversations. I think I've got a pretty good idea   of what he's saying. Come on, bud. What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter stepped back, horrified. \"Oh my god! He didn't make it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot raised an eyebrow. \"I am Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible. I'm sorry you had to see that, little guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot just shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's obvious that Peter's translating skills are not very good. Let's just wait and see if Rocket shows,\" Gamora suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, there was the sound of patters ambling up the ramp. It was Rocket, soaking wet. His fur dripped water onto the ship's floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Jerk!\" Rocket yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is the jerk?\" Drax asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of yas! Except for Mantis, I guess. First, let's start with the distraction team, shall we? How the hell did you let that many guards slip by? There were so many riches in that vault! Second, thank you Groot for abandoning me on the roof! I had to jump from there to the fountain in order to dodge all the bullets flyin' at me. Groot's just a kid, so I can forgive that. But you three? Oh, boy, if you think I'm gonna hold back from tearing' you a new one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Gamora's fault!\" Drax exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora gritted her teeth. \"Me? You were the one who rushed ahead before we could set up a plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you let the guards slip by, giving Rocket less time!\" he fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora sighed and looked at Quill. \"Peter, back me up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...you did say you were having a bad day when that guard took you by surprise, but I think we all--\" Quill started, before being interrupted by Rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so it was her fault, huh? I shoulda known...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter stepped between Rocket and Gamora as he approached her. \"Wait a minute, Rocket. Drax did jump the gun early, and I missed some shots too. We all screwed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket waved him off. \"Nah, nah. I know you gotta stick up for her, but she's the one that's taking the blame for this. If she didn't let them get past her, we woulda been walking out rich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not taking the blame for this! We all could have done better, so the brunt of the failure shouldn't just fall on one person!\" Gamora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if Quill was right, and you're off your game, then maybe it would be best if you sat out the next phase of this job. The prison break's the most dangerous part, anyways,\" Rocket said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora scoffed. \"Is that so? Well, maybe I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stormed off and headed to her room, the slamming of her door heard from the mess hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been very angry lately,\" Mantis noted with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her room, Gamora threw herself on the bed and stared at the ceiling. A few seconds later, there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's Rocket, I'm going to kill you,\" she promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's...it's me,\" Peter said on the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Gamora huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter opened the door and stood in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that that just happened. But you know how Rocket is. Always has to put the blame on someone. He...he has a point, you know. You do seem off. Maybe taking some time off will do you some good,\" he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Maybe you're right. Peter?\" she asked as he was about to head back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for checking up on me,\" Gamora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuill smiled and nodded, then returned to the mess hall. Gamora sat in bed a little while longer, her hands eventually finding her bloated middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hopefully you'll go away soon...</i> she thought.</span></div></div>",

Normally she would have been up later, talking to the others, but she was in no mood for talking now, and she was far more tired than normal. She lay on her bed, curled beneath her blanket with a hand on her bloated belly, feeling the taut skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora woke up to the sound of her door being slowly opened, and someone walking in. The heavy footsteps told her that, thankfully, wasn't Rocket. It couldn't be Groot either, and Drax had no compulsion to come into her room, neither did Mantis for that matter. So that left-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHey, just wanted to say goodbye before we left, \u201d she heard Peter say quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled onto her side to face him, opening her eyes to look at him. \u201dbye bye\u201d she mumbled groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leant his hand on her and kissed her forehead, putting a small smile on her face. He felt the area where his hand rested, noting that it felt bloated and stuck out on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dEither you ate something real bad, or you have a pillow on you,\u201d he said, slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIs a pillow, \u201d Gamora groaned, too tired to think properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter left after leaving another kiss on her forehead and closed her door quietly, leaving her alone once more. After a few minutes, she sat up slowly, revealing her rounding stomach. It stuck out further now, still only noticeable with concentration, but still there all the same. She massaged it as she remembered how close Peter had just come to finding it, thanking herself for lying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dRight. I need to get rid of this\u201d she said to herself, running her stomach. \u201dtime for a diet, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach had other ideas, and let out a low rumble, telling her to eat. She groaned in frustration as she stepped out of bed and put on a loose t-shirt to cover herself with. She walked out of her room to the mess, where she grabbed a few food packets and a drink for her breakfast. As she ate, she noticed Mantis wander in, looking for something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGood morning Gamora! How did you sleep?\u201d she asked, sounding annoyingly cheery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dFine.\u201d Replied Gamora, not in the mood to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh, that is good. How are you feeling?\u201d Mantis asked, trying to make small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dFine\u201d Gamora said again, getting slightly more pissed off now. \u201dcould you just, go, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis looked kind of sad after that and left the room, dragging her feet along the floor. Gamora realised that she had come off as bitchy, but by now it was a little late to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left for her bedroom after breakfast, taking a couple of swings from her drink as she walked. She decided that she would try and work out, to try and burn off her belly, and maintain a good shape. She started with some sit-ups, lying back with her knees up. She tried one, but her belly stopped we from bending over properly.  She tried a few more but gave up and went to do some crunches, but found herself facing the same problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted in resignation and sat back against her bed, resting her hands on her belly. She poked the tight skin, and to her surprise, she felt something move back. She tried it again, getting the same result, a sort of squirming feeling from her belly. <i>Must just be gas</i> she thought.</span></div></div>",

For the next few hours, Gamora primarily switched between eating and trying to do whatever workout that she was able to do. The eating took up much more of her day than working out did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Gamora found herself in a similar situation that she was in earlier in the day. Her stomach was rumbling constantly. She wanted to fight it off. After all, she'd eaten enough for today. But she couldn't. She was starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora made her way to the mess hall and dug in, repeating the situation from this morning. As she dug in, she saw Mantis enter the room out of the corner of her eye. Once Mantis saw that Gamora was there, she immediately stared at the floor and turned around to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilt smacked Gamora in the face, and she spoke up before Mantis could leave. \"Mantis, come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped in her tracks and turned back around, still refusing to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to apologize for the way I treated you earlier. I wasn't in a good mood, but I still shouldn't have done what I did. Why don't you sit over here if you're gonna eat?\" Gamora offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis slowly walked towards her, grabbed a food packet, and sat down across from Gamora. She slowly ate her meal. Finally, she looked up at Gamora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are feeling better?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora nodded, then shrugged her shoulders. \"I'm not nauseous anymore. But...I still feel a little weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's good that you're a little better!\" Mantis smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I just realized that this is the first time that we're going to really get to know each other,\" Gamora noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis giggled. \"It is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora couldn't help but laugh too. Her childlike innocence was impossible to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were raised by Ego? What was that like?\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis fidgeted in her chair. \"At first I thought that it was a good thing. That it was normal. Then I met you all, and I knew that this was how a family was supposed to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora smiled. \"Oh, I don't think this is anything like how a family should be. But I guess I was in the same boat as you growing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you ever think of being a parent?\" Mantis asked, seemingly out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why? I...I honestly haven't really thought about it. Growing up Thanos only cared that Nebula and I were the best warriors possible. Anything else wasn't really brought up. It's honestly never really crossed my mind,\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora yawned as she finished the sentence. \"I think I'm gonna head to bed. I'm still reeling from the vault heist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis nodded, seeming to understand. \"Okay. Good night, Gamora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora undressed in her bedroom. As she headed to her bed, she caught her reflection in the mirror. Was her stomach bigger than it was in the morning? She stopped and looked at her belly carefully, running a hand over it. It certainly seemed like it was. Not by much, but there was some growth, to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora could only shake her head as she lay down in bed. She fell asleep slowly, trying to ignore the light squirming from her belly.</span></div></div>",

She woke up, inspected herself, went to eat, talked to mantis, tried working out, ate some more, etc. Except for this morning, Gamora stayed in bed a little longer. She was sat with her back to the wall, with her hands on her belly. It had gotten bigger over the past few days, sticking out far more than before. She looked at it in the mirror. It pushed her sort up a little, revealing a sliver of green flesh, and was probably big enough for others to notice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard her door opening and threw her covers over herself, trying to hide her bloated belly. Mantis walked in, with a little tray covered in food packets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI brought you some food so you don't have to get up,\u201d she said, smiling at Gamora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThanks, I guess,\u201d Gamora said, taking the tray from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dDid I do something wrong?\u201d Mantis asked with a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat? Oh no, it's fine. It's just strange having it brought to me\u201d Gamora replied, not wanting to hurt Mantis\u2019 feelings again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIt is just because you have been ill and tired, I didn't want you to hurt yourself,\u201d Mantis said, now smiling again. \u201dSee you later!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis left the room gleefully, leaving Gamora alone with her breakfast. She began eating, finishing off the meal quickly. She turned and sat with her legs off the bed, brushing crumbs off of herself as she stood up. She walked over to the mirror and looked at herself. Her belly was far more prominent on her now, sticking out about two or three inches from her body. She looked at her breasts, which had also grown, bulging out of her bra slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat is going on with me?\u201d she asked herself, looking at her body from all angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out of her room to grab a drink from the mess. She let her mind wander as she walked, trying to determine what was going on with her. As she turned a corner, she didn't notice Mantis walking around it as well, and the two collided, both of them falling to the ground. Mantis was up first and grabbed onto Gamora, pulling her up by the arm, an. Steadying her with a gentle hand on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAre you okay?\u201d she asked, sounding concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, I'm fine, just a little dazed, \u201d Gamora replied, rubbing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAnd the others?\u201d Mantis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThe who? What do you mean \u2019the others\u2019?\u201d Gamora replied, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis pulled her hands away from Gamora. \u201dIt was nothing, just a little mistake, \u201d she said quickly. \u201dI am sorry, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis walked briskly away, leaving Gamora confused as to what she had meant by \u2019the others\u2019.</span></div></div>",

Now that I hear all that, there's a whole lot of supposed in this plan. Are you sure about this plan, Rocket?\" Quill wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's foolproof! Trust me, Peter.

We saw her come out of yours last week. You don't have to hide it!\" Rocket said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. In fact, I've read that being open about your sexual relationships can be quite healthy,\" Drax added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuill raised an eyebrow. \"You read? Anyways, she's fine. Just an illness or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Quill. I think she's lost a step,\" Rocket said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrax nodded. \"I agree. And I suppose that means that I am the strongest warrior amongst us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" Drax repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrax put his hand on Quill's shoulder and laughed. For two minutes straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter finally shook it off and checked his watch. \"Alright, that's enough. It's time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora stood in a desert. No. She looked around carefully. This wasn't always a desert. It was a wasteland. All around her was a thick layer of fog that she couldn't see past at all. The flat, beaten ground around her was visible though, and what she saw shocked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, Rocket, Mantis, Drax, and Groot were all lying on the ground, sprawled around her. She didn't even have to examine them to know that they were dead. What happened? Where was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly had the urge to look down at herself, and instantly regretted it. Her belly was massive, sticking out at least two feet from her frame. She couldn't come close to wrapping her hands around it. It groaned and gurgled constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fog in front of her began to evaporate, and a large figure began to emerge from it. It was Thanos. As he approached her, Gamora stepped back. The back of her foot hit a rock, sending her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanos stood over her. \"Enjoy what time you have left with these fools, my daughter. For I will come soon, and you know what will happen when I do. One snap of my fingers, and everything you love will disappear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanos raised his hand, and snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora woke up in a cold sweat. She gasped, desperately trying to catch her breath. Her shirt was damp from the sweat that she'd acquired in her dream. Was that all a dream? It felt so...so real...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gamora was sat in bed, in slight shock at her condition. Only a day had passed since she had last had a proper look at herself, but a lot had changed since then. Her belly had swollen massively in a day, pushing out far further than it had previously, about seven inches off of her body. It was definitely noticeable now, even to the most oblivious of observers. Her green skin was stretched around it, feeling tight and having almost no give to it. The squirming had also gotten more frequent and felt much stronger and faster now than it had before. She put that down to her ever-increasing appetite, which had left her almost always craving some food. She sighed as she rubbed her belly, struggling to stand up off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror only further showed her growth, as her breasts and butt had also started having little growth spurts. She grabbed a loose white t-shirt and pulled it over herself, and looked at herself dissatisfied in the mirror. The shirt draped over her breasts and covered them fairly well, but when it came to her belly, it was less successful. The shirt only covered to about her belly button, leaving just under half of her belly exposed and open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked, although now it felt more like a waddle, out of her room to grab some breakfast. It had sort of become a routine for her over the past couple of days. Get up, have a look at herself, get dressed, eat, workout, etc. She stepped into the mess and grabbed a handful of food packets, and a bottle of water. She started chowing down on her food and was so engrossed in it that she didn't notice Mantis walk into the room, see her, and walk straight out again. Once Gamora was finished she walked back to her room to try and do some form of workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in her room, trying to decide what sort of workout she could do. Sit-ups, push-ups or anything like that we're completely out of the question, given her belly, stopped her from doing most exercises. She resorted to trying squats, and stood up to start. She tried a few, finding that she had to shift around to adjust for her belly, but for the most part, found it easy exercise. Eventually, she stopped, finding herself out of breath and starting to sweat, giving her belly a slight shine to the tight surface. She decided to hop into the shower and clean herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her shower, Gamora got dressed, putting on a larger shirt to try and cover more of her belly. As she finished up, she heard a ship landing outside, muffled chatter and the doors to the ship opening up. She walked outside to see Peter, Groot, Drax, Rocket, and who she assumed was the person they had broken out from the Kyln, all walking into the mess. She saw Peter point to an empty room and say something to the prisoner, who promptly left the others to their room. She walked into the mess, joining the others mid-conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh yas should have seen the look on his face! Ahh, it was priceless, \u201d Rocket said, recalling the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIt was glorious!\u201d Added Drax<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHey Gamo-\u201d Peter said, before noticing her swollen stomach, looking very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh hey!\u201d Said Rocket, turning to face her. \u201dWoah! Somebody's putting on weight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI am not getting fat! It's just bloating!\u201d Gamora replied angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah sure, \u201d he said. \u201dwhat do you all think huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI am Groot\u201d Groot said, slightly oblivious to Gamora\u2019s feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou are looking much rounder\u201d Drax said. \u201dpuffier too, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked at her sympathetically. \u201dI think she looks fine,\u201d he said, trying to emphasise the point to everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhatever, loverboy. What about you Mantis, you've been kinda quiet\u201d Rocket said, looking slightly annoyed at Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI, I need to go to sleep! Goodnight!\u201d Mantis said quickly, running anxiously to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora felt bad, thanks to everyone else comments, and walked briskly to her room, tears welling in her eyes. Peter looked at the others disdainfully.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rocket was really starting to get on her nerves nowadays. He'd always been a little annoying, but now it was ramped up to overdrive. Why was he acting like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments to herself, there was a knock at her door. Gamora quickly got underneath the covers as the door opened. Peter came in, a sympathetic look in his eyes. He approached her and sat down next to her on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told off Rocket for you. I know that he's really been acting like a dick lately, and you know how Drax usually is. I'm sorry you had to put up with that,\" Quill stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora smiled weakly. \"Thank you, but I can take care of myself. You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But someone's gotta have your back, right?\" he smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked each other in the eyes for a few moments, until Gamora looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be real with me, Gamora. Are you alright? You seem really distant lately. Like there's something wrong,\" Peter noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora sighed, then shook her head. \"Peter, I'm okay. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll see you in the morning, then,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter stood up and kissed Gamora on the top of her head, causing her to blush. He left the room, leaving her to herself. Though she didn't do much today, she was exhausted, and went to sleep minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora stood in front of her mirror the next morning, her jaw dropped. Her stomach had grown a few inches overnight yet again. Her belly button was no completely flat, threatening to pop out if she got any bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a cautious hand on the taut surface, feeling the squirms underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" she asked under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora thought back to the night she spent with Quill over a week ago. She was pretty certain that he didn't use protection, and she definitely didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould she be pregnant? She certainly looked the part. But there was no way that she could be this big so quickly, right? Unless there was something seriously wrong. She looked like she could give birth any second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts, racing a million miles an hour, were interrupted by a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Gamora! You alright? We haven't seen you all morning. Can I come in?\" Peter asked on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, that's okay. Just...thinking about some things. I'll be out in just a second,\" Gamora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Peter walk away, and she sighed as she sat down on the bed. Gamora remembered what Mantis said a few days ago when they bumped into each other. The comment about the other lives.

Not just yours but more, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSo, I'm pregnant, \u201d Gamora replied, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis nodded. \u201dThat is why I stopped talking to you and the others about you, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThat's fine now, \u201d Gamora said, pulling Mantis into a hug. \u201dWait, you said \u2019lives\u2019, as in there's more than one, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI felt more than one, yes, but I did not see exactly how many there are. I could check for you now if you would let me?\u201d she said gingerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora nodded at her and sat down on the bed. She pulled up her shirt to reveal the taut green sphere that was her belly. Mantis crouched down next to her and began rubbing her belly, her antennae starting to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI feel- two here, \u201d she whispered, concentrating on finding the babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dTwo. That's not so bad, \u201d Gamora said to herself. Twins were manageable, and she began planning in her head what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThree now, no wait five\u201d Mantis said, sounding more concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Five!</i> That was a shock. Gamora was now struggling to plan ahead for five, her mind beginning to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dsix, seven, eight, nine! There are so many!\u201d Mantis said, now sounding very anxious and worried for gamora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora\u2019s head was starting to spin. Nine kids. In one go. They were definitely going to have their hands full. She was starting to sweat slightly but tried to stop herself form outwardly panicking, trying to stop Mantis from having a breakdown. \u201dCalm down, Mantis, \u201d she cooed, stroking Mantis\u2019 head gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dTwelve! I-I count twelve total!\u201d Mantis called out, her voice riddled with panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHey, don't panic! I'm going to be fine, this will all be fine, \u201d Gamora said to Mantis, bringing her into another hug, trying to keep her calm, despite her own mind not being much better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis leant into Gamora, embracing her hug and holding on. She took a few moments to calm herself down, eventually sitting next to Gamora. She placed her hands tentatively on her belly, and gently rubbed it in little circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHow did this happen. I mean, twelve babies!\u201d Gamora said, calming down a little as her belly was rubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dMaybe it has something to do with Peters parentage. He is the father, yes?\u201d Mantis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYes, he is, but he doesn't know yet. What do you mean?\u201d Gamora replied, the thought of telling Peter getting pushed to the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHis father was Ego, so maybe during your bonding his Celestial DNA reacted with your body, giving you twelve children, \u201d Mantis stated thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora thought for a minute. \u201dMaybe the modifications made to my body, like a healing factor, is what it mixed with. That might explain the fast growth, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYes, that makes sense, \u201d Mantis added. \u201dAt the rate that they have grown since you and Peter-\u201d Gamora coughed \u201d- I think you have only a few weeks left, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora said nothing but looked down at her belly. She rubbed it as she felt a few squirms, trying to soothe the babies inside. A few weeks. That was all the time she had. She had to think about what to do when to tell the others, how they would manage it all. She looked at Mantis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dMantis, I need you to promise not to tell anyone about this. Please, \u201d she asked, looking Mantis in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI will try my best!\u201d Mantis replied, smiling a little, trying to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThank you, \u201d Gamora said. \u201dI don't know when I'll be able to tell the others, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed with Mantis a little longer, the two of them sat on the bed rubbing her belly. Eventually, Gamora heaved herself off the bed, Mantis helping her to stand up. She said a quick goodbye and thank you to Mantis, before waddling towards the mess. She looked around, trying to pick out anyone sat in the room. She saw that the others were all sat in their seats in the cockpit, listening to some of Quill's music. Quickly she opened up one of the containers and grabbed a bundle of food packets, using the music to mask her sounds. She walked back to her room and shut the door, beginning to eat her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending the previous day in her room, thankful that Mantis told the others that she wasn't feeling great and that she had brought her food throughout the day, Gamora opened her eyes slowly. She slowly sat up and looked down at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped quietly. Overnight her belly had grown out again, adding another inch or two to its size. She placed her hands on it hesitantly and massaged the tightly pulled skin. She could feel more kicks and squirms now and watched as they made little bumps on her belly. She sat there, rubbing her now larger belly.</span></div></div>",

Mantis walked in, holding a tray of food, smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI brought you some breakfast, \u201d  she said, setting the tray down next to Gamora and shutting the door. \u201dAre you alright today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThanks. Yes, I'm fine, just a little bigger is all, \u201d Gamora replied, digging into the food quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThat is good, \u201d Mantis said, watching her eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dMantis, you wouldn't mind checking on the babies would you? Just look at how they are doing?\u201d Gamora asked, finishing off a food packet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOf course! That is fine, \u201d Mantis said, moving her way towards Gamora\u2019s bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hands on it and began rubbing it gently, her antennae giving off a soft glow. Her hands explored the belly, rubbing all over the tight skin, occasionally poling a spot where a kick or wave could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThey are good!\u201d she said, enthusiastically. \u201dThey are growing nice and big, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora smiled, satisfied knowing that her babies were doing well. She rubbed her belly a little as well, trying to soothe a few kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThey are very active, but that is good. It shows that they are strong, \u201d Mantis continued, continuing to rub Gamora\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThank you Mantis, \u201d Gamora said. \u201dFor helping me with this, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou are welcome\u201d Mantis replied, smiling goofily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later Gamora was sat alone in her room, her shirt pulled up over her belly, leaving the whole enormous bump open. She was rubbing it affectionately, her hands massaging and exploring the surface. She enjoyed watching the little kicks and movements from inside her, pushing her belly around in different shapes. She would pat the kicks, and receive another kick as if it was a response to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden she heard her door opening, noticing it too late to cover or hide her belly. She watched as Peter walked in, looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI just wanted to see-\u201d he stopped when he noticed her belly, kicks and all. \u201dW-what is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora was quiet for a while. \u201dIts... I-I'm\u201d she struggled to find her words. \u201dI'm pregnant, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter stared at her for a minute, his face expressing looks of confusion. \u201dB-but when did it h-happen? You don't get that big q-quickly\u201d he stammered, trying to work out how it had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201da week or so ago. When we-\u201d Gamora said, starting to choke up. \u201dI didn't want you to find out like this\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSo I-I'm the father? How does that work?\u201d he exclaimed, his face looking even more confused and concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dY-Yeah, it's kind of complicated\u201d she replied, her voice wavering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dT-this can't be happening. It's just not possible!\u201d he said, trying to comprehend the situation. \u201dI- this is too much. I-I have to go, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dPeter wait! Please!\u201d she called to him, tears beginning to drop from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019m sorry, \u201d he whispered, shutting the door on her, leaving her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay back on her bed, tears falling from her eyes. She brought a hand up to her face and wiped a few of the tears away, only for more to replace them. Her hands rested on her belly as she sobbed away, a few kicks disturbing the surface. She rubbed a few little circles to try and calm herself down and relax. She started to drift to sleep, tears still falling from her eyes as her hands caressed her belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following morning, Gamora found herself waddling through the halls of the Benatar. She was bigger than she was the previous day, that was for certain. But she realized that carrying twelve meant that this would happen, especially if the pregnancy would only last a month as Mantis predicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora made her way to Peter's room, and she was surprised to find that it was empty. She looked around the pigsty, glancing at the posters adorning the walls. She saw a baseball mitt lying on the floor, and eventually came across his pair of headphones attached to the cassette player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tape already in it, and she picked it up as she sat down on Quill's bed. Gamora pressed play, and put the headphones near her ears as she heard the music play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, child. Things are gonna get easier. Ooh, child. Things will be brighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora listened for a few more seconds, then lowered the headphones. Carefully, she place them on her belly, letting the babies listen to the music. They kicked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard footsteps, and turned around to find Peter standing in the doorway. He swallowed and stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora didn't reply. Quill frowned and sat next to her on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't have acted that way yesterday. I was just...just so confused about what was happening. And I guess that maybe I'm afraid of being a father. I never had a good father figure in my life. How am I supposed to be one?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But we can figure it out together,\" she replied, kissing him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the baby likes the music?\" Peter wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora sighed. \"Yeah. But it's...it's more than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, really? How many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora looked away. \"Uh...maybe it'll be best if I told you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuill nodded. \"You should probably tell the others, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mantis already knows. But you're right. I don't think it'd be a good idea to hide it any longer,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora decided to tell Groot first. He was a little confused at first, but their brief conversation ultimately ended with him rubbing and hugging her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she went to Drax's room. She found him sharpening his weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Drax,\" she said, a little unsure of where this was going to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around. \"Ah. Hello, Gamora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I wanted to tell you something. Important. It's about me and Peter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrax shrugged. \"I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Congratulations!\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora raised an eyebrow. \"Really? You're not going to gloat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Why would I do that? The journey that you and Quill are about to embark on, you especially, is one of the most honorable ones a person can take. If you ever need any assistance or advice, I'd be happy to give it to you,\" Drax said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Thanks,\" Gamora said, turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That did not go the way I thought it would,\" she muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the cockpit, Gamora found Rocket. He looked at her and cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez! You're not even gonna try to get rid of that gut?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rocket, there's not really anything I can do about it. Quill and I are...we're having...\" she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? You're pregnant?!?\" Rocket asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora nodded. \"Yeah...yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket laughed and jumped from his seat. \"You shoulda said something! I would have gone easy on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he passed, he patted Gamora's large belly, which gurgled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. This is gonna be a fun few weeks...\" she groaned.</span></div></div>",

Now that she had been open about what was happening, and now that everyone knew about it, she felt much better about things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up slowly and opened her eyes, looking down at herself. Her belly had clearly grown overnight, although she had anticipated some growth. She pulled off he blanket and rubbed her belly, massaging the tight green skin. Her shirt had been pushed up over her bump, covering only her breasts, which had also grown as well, tightening her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning off of her bed she stood up, thrown off of her balance by her belly. She steadied herself against the wall and waddled towards her wardrobe, pulling out a large t-shirt. She looked in the mirror and sighed at the half of her belly that was left uncovered by her shirt. A part of her wished that it would slow down, and that she could savour it a little more. And not having to deal with rapid growth overnight would be a bonus to that as well. Pulling on a pair of loose pants, she waddled out towards the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind me why we have to put these stupid locks on everything?\u201d Rocket grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts so the babies don\u2019t die from whatever is in these\u201d Quill responded, sounding slightly exasperated with Rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora walked in, seeing Drax and quill starting to baby-proof the room, while rocket sat behind them, unpacking boxes with the stuff they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning\u201d she yawned, sitting at the table, near to Quill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning \u2018Mora\u201d Quill replied, smiling at her, placing a hand on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hand on his and smiled back at him, glad that he was with her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBleaugh!\u201d Interrupted Rocket, joking around. \u201cCome on, people are watchin\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora shot him a quick look, trying to frown, but a small smirk broke through her fa\u00e7ade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you just grab me some food, Peter?\u201d She asked, putting on her best begging face. \u201cPlease?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter got up, and brought over an armful of food packets, dropping them infront of Gamora, who smiled thankingly and dug in. She wolfed down a few packets, before noticing everyone ,save Drax, staring at her, looking slightly shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha.?\u201d She exclaimed, her mouth full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just ate, like, ridiculously fast. Like insanely fast\u201d Peter spoke, slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d She replied, a few crumbs spilling out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, just don\u2019t choke?\u201d Peter said. He shared a look with Rocket as she started digging in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quickly finishing her meal, and feeling relatively satisfied, Gamora turned around and watched the others, glad that they were helping along with preparing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNo not like that!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that didn't mean it was going to be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dwhat do you mean? That's what the instructions say!\u201d Rocket said, indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dno, it isn't! This part goes here!\u201d Quill said, pointing to the small scrap of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh come on, it's just a small shortcut, what's the worst that could happen?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuill held up the lock and tapped it gently, popping it into several pieces. \u201dthat, \u201d he said, throwing the pieces back to Rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dstop your arguing, you're putting me off\u201d Drax added, attaching one of the locks to a cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhere\u2019s Mantis?\u201d Gamora mouthed to Quill, getting more than a little irritated with their bickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWith groot, \u201d he mouthed back, before throwing another lock at Rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora pointed to Groots room and mouthed \u201dill be in there\u201d, heaving herself up and waddling to find Groot and Mantis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently pushing open the door to Groot\u2019s room, she saw Mantis with Groot sat on her lap, reading to him. Smiling a little, she shut the door to block out the sound of the others and went to sit by Mantis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHello Gamora, how are you?\u201d Mantis stopped reading, smiling at Gamora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot followed suit, grinning at her. \u201dI am groot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIm okay, and the babies are fine Groot\u201d she replied, picking Groot up and softly resting him on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI am groot?\u201d he asked curiously, pointing at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dof course you can, you can feel them here\u201d Gamora said, guiding him to the side of her belly where she had felt a kick or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot looked up at her with a look of amazement as he felt one of the babies kick, pushing him back slightly. He went back and poked at her belly, trying to get another response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora smiled at him, a feeling of joy rushing over her as groot curiosly investigated her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou will be a very good mother,\u201d Mantis said, putting her hand on Gamoras shoulder, the same feeling washing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou really think so?\u201d Gamora replied, sounding a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOf course! You are very good with Groot, and he is a child. He is good practice, \u201d Mantis said, placing her other hand on Gamora\u2019s belly. \u201dyour babies are very healthy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora said nothing, but leant against Mantis, a silent thanks for reassuring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crash, followed by \u201dFor god's sake that's idiotic!\u201d shattered the moment. Gamora sighed, picking up Groot and heading out to see what had happened.</span></div></div>",

They do not know what they are doing\u201d Drax said, to the annoyance of both Peter and Rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWell if that's the case, I'm gonna go. I have some important stuff needs doing\u201d Rocket said, walking to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora sighed and put Groot down on the floor, and sat down at the table, feeling a little tired. She rested her hands on top of her belly and watched as Groot started playing with Peter. She smiled at the two, seeing Peter with Groot giving her hope for their own children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGroot, go find Mantis, I'm sure she'll be happy to play with you\u201d He told Groot quietly. \u201di need to finish this up, then we can play\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot ran out of the room in search of Mantis, his feet carrying him as fast as he could go. Peter turned to Drax and the two began to carry on with their work, making good progress. Eventually, Drax left to go to the bathroom, leaving Peter and Gamora alone together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNeed any help, Peter?\u201d Gamora asked, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSure, just hand me the pieces from over there and I'll put them together\u201d He replied, gesturing to the jumbled mix of parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora walked over to him and started handing him parts as she sat down, trying to sift through the pile and find the right components. The two worked quietly for a while until Peter pulled out his \u2019Zune\u2019 or whatever it was and handed an earbud to Gamora. She put it in her ear and heard some of Peters music start to play, starting to recognise the lyrics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The sailors say: \"Brandy, you're a fine girl\" (you're a fine girl)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned her head against Peters shoulder, the two of them slowly working away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What a good wife you would be\" (such a fine girl)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a hand on her belly and felt a few kicks, and Peter putting his hand on her belly, trying to feel the kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora looked at Peter, finding him looking back at her. The two shared a kiss as they worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora was waddling back to her room for a quick rest after helping Peter with babyproofing. She trusted that he and Drax could get the job done, with minimal incidents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAh, Gamora, I was lookin for yas\u201d she heard Rocket say from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat is it?\u201d She replied, a little grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI just wanted to apologize. For being such a dick to ya. I made you this\u201d He said, holding up a round device, with a small screen on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThanks, what is it?\u201d She asked, taking the device from him and inspecting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIts a portable ultrasound. Figured you'd want to have a look at your kids at some point\u201d he said, turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora picked him up in a tight hug. \u201dthank you Rocket. Really, thank you so much\u201d she said, feeling a few tears start to brim in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAh, your welcome. Now can ya put me down!\u201d Rocket joked, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora put him down and thanked him once more, before entering her bedroom. She sat down on her bed, and pulled up her shirt. She looked at the device in her hand and switched it on. It hummed to life and a small display popped up on the screen. She placed the device on her belly, and saw an image of her womb on the screen. She could make out a couple of shapes as babies, and moved it around, trying to find more. She saw them moving and kicking and could feel small tears of joy running down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of playing with the device, Gamora set it aside, satisfied with it for the moment. She lay down on her bed, resting her hands on her belly and began to drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle knock at her door woke Gamora up. She slowly opened her eyes and saw Peter walk in and sit next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201djust wanted to check up on you and tell you we\u2019re approaching Contraxia\u201d he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dmmh okay\u201d Gamora grumbled, still half asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dRocket told me about his gift. I take it you enjoyed it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dit was wonderful\u201d she said. \u201dyou should try it with me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI will, when we finish up on Contraxia.\u201d he patted her belly and kissed her forehead. \u201dill be in the bridge, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora nodded and rolled over, starting to drift off again.</span></div></div>",

You said you wanted to come with us, right?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, yeah,\" she said, nodding. \"I've been cooped up on this ship for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora slowly threw the blankets to the other side of the bed. Peter's eyes bulged when he saw that her belly had gotten bigger overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you look bigger than you did a few hours ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a reason for that. I'll tell you why once we get back on the ship...\" Gamora grunted, trying to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter noticed her struggling and helped her up, using more strength than he had anticipated. Once Gamora was upright, Quill rubbed her belly, and their quickly growing children kicked and moved in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Gamora grunted as she felt a particularly strong kick. \"I think they like you. More than they like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. Don't be so hard on yourself,\" Peter smiled, leading her out of her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got this for you. It's cold out there, so I thought you'd need it,\" he offered, handing her a large fur coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora grabbed it and put it on. Somehow, it was able to cover her massive stomach. \"Thanks, Peter!\" she said, giving him a peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guardians were greeted by a wave of cold wind and snow as they stepped off the ship and onto the surface of the neon-coated outpost on Contraxia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, our contact should be meeting us in ten minutes. Gamora, Mantis, would you two keep Groot occupied? He's been a little rambunctious today,\" Rocket said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket, Drax, and Quill lead the prisoner to the middle of the outpost, leaving Gamora and Mantis at the foot of the ship alone with Groot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis looked at Gamora and smiled. \"You can go and relax, Gamora. I can take care of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I appreciate it!\" Gamora replied, finding herself trying not to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora went her own way, exploring the outpost, while Mantis chased after Groot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Gamora found herself on an empty balcony outside of a building overlooking the center of the station. She slowly waddled to the railing, hands on her back, and watched as the guys negotiated with their contact. It seemed to be going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gamora?\" a voice called out. It was familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned, and saw just about the last person she was expecting to find here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nebula?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Nebula asked, approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we're doing a job. Why are you here?\" Gamora wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNebula sighed. \"I'm supposed to meet someone. I'm hoping they can help us find our loving father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at the outpost in silence for a few moments. \"I'm going to kill him, Gamora. I had...a dream. At last I think it was. He's going to destroy everything,\" Nebula said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora nodded. \"I saw the same thing. Just be careful, okay? You know, it's rare that we run into each other without fighting until we're both almost dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's...pretty nice...I guess. I should go. The longer I wait here, the more time Thanos has to prepare,\" Nebula said, turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Gamora said as she grabbed her sister's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked, an eye going wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora took a deep breath. \"I have something to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her coat, exposing her enormous belly to the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNebula's jaw dropped. \"Gamora are you--you're pregnant?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora nodded. Nebula approached her sister and placed a hand on the rounded surface. She gasped when she felt kick and squirms push against her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Are they Quill's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora sighed. \"Uh...yeah. They are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNebula got up. \"Well, at least they'll have you as their mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sister's hugged, and Gamora wished Nebula luck on her journey. Gamora headed to the ship, where the rest of the Guardians were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter wrapped his arm around her as they went inside of the Benatar. He noticed that she seemed somewhat sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Just thinking about some loved ones.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two of them walked back into the ship, heading towards the mess. Gamora took off her heavy cloak, setting it down on a chair and sitting down slowly. She put her hands on her belly, feeling her children kicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to go set our course with Rocket, be right back\u201d Peter said, placing a load of food in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora started eating, working her way through the packets quickly. She opened a packet, tearing it open, dropping food onto her belly. Going to pick it up, she watched as one of the babies kicked, rolling the food across her belly. She smirked as another kick flung a bit of food off her belly onto the floor. She finished off the packet and dug into another, using her belly as a shelf to hold her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard giggling. \u201dThats clever\u201d Peter quipped, walking towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThis belly is handy for some things\u201d She replied, giving her bump a pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them played around with the babies for a while, watching them kick food off of their mommas belly, and even trying to get a kick to land a piece of food in her mouth, with some success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dDo you want to go have a look with the ultrasound? See your kids for the first time?\u201d Gamora asked, catching a rogue piece of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, why not\u201d Peter replied, stammering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Peter stood up, Gamora raised her arm, struggling to stand. He pulled her up, wheezing quietly after. The two made their way to her room, closing the door behind them. Gamora lay back on the bed, holding the device in her hand and switching it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAre you ready?\u201d She asked, handing the device to Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAs I'll ever be\u201d he replied, grabbing the device in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated for a second before placing it on her belly, the display lighting up with the image inside her womb. He stared at it as he moved it around, in awe of her. She looked at him and smiled, feeling her eyes start to water a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThis is... Amazing\u201d Peter said, still in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, yeah it is\u201d Gamora replied, sniffling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHow many are there?\u201d Peter asked, more to himself than Gamora. He moved the device around, counting under his breath. \u201dthere are 12. 12 babies\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dif it helps I was just as shocked\u201d Gamora added, laughing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, we are definitely gonna have our work cut out aren't we\u201d Peter replied, laughing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stayed like that for a while longer, both feeling immensely happy, watching their children move and kick and squirm in real time. Eventually they left the device to the side, rubbing her belly slowly, together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dcould you just give me a back massage? Please?\u201d Gamora asked, quietly. \u201dCarrying this belly is hard work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOf course I can\u201d Peter said, sitting up, Gamora following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat with her back to him and he began massaging, slowly easing up her muscles. She let out the occasional satisfied moan as she could feel her back getting less and less tense. She shut her eyes and let Peter continue, beginning to feel sleepy. She lay down on her side, and felt Peter lay behind her. She felt him reach his arm over her, resting it on her belly, and she put her hand next to his as they both drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora woke up to the feeling of movement in her belly. A lot more than she had previously felt. Sitting up, she pulled the covers away to reveal her massive belly, the overnight growths now getting bigger and bigger. She had stopped wearing shirts as she slept, as they started to feel hotter and hotter the larger she grew. Her hands explored her tight green skin, massaging and soothing the babies inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dCome on now, stop kicking\u201d she whispered to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered that most of the others had left earlier on a quick supply run to a station, to stock up for the imminent birth of the babies, and for the next part of the job. Slightly annoyed that she didn't have anyone to help her stand up, she heaved herself out of bed, taking a couple of tries to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a t-shirt from her wardrobe and started to put it on. She pulled it down over her chest and tried to go further, but had no such luck. The shirt looked like a crop too that was far too small for her, just covering her enlarged breasts, but still showing off a lot of cleavage. Sighing in resignation she grabbed a pair of pants, sitting down to put them on. She started to struggle when she reached her thighs, having to pull and pull to get them up she struggled more to get them over her butt, which had grown much larger over the course of her pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she managed to get them on, but they felt incredibly tight. She grabbed another shirt, that was much stretchier than the previous and pulled it over herself. This time she barely managed to cover her belly button, and she knew that throughout the day it would begin to ride up her bump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the mirror to look at herself. \u201dEh, this will do I guess\u201d she said to herself, grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned around she heard a loud rip, and saw in the mirror that her pants had torn at the seams, baring her thighs in the open. She lost it. She collapsed onto her bed in tears, annoyed that her clothes no longer fit, that she had nothing to wear. She was annoyed that every part of her was seemingly bigger, her butt, her boobs, and especially her belly. She wiped the tears from her eyes, only for another load to start coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI am Groot?\u201d she heard a quiet voice from the doorway. Groot was stood with a sad look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh, hey Groot\u201d she said, trying to stop crying. \u201dIm okay, just a bit emotional\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot walked towards her bed and climbed up sitting in front of her. \u201dI am Groot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dDon't worry, you won't understand. It's a pregnancy thing\u201d Gamora said, trying to smile for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot nervously held out his hand, and slowly a little flower started to grow, blossoming in front of Gamoras face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora picked it and began to cry again, but now they were tears of joy. \u201dThank you Groot\u201d she sniffled, pulling him into a hug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI am Groot\u201d he replied gladly, grabbing the flower and placing it behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora smiled at him and hugged him once more.</span></div></div>",

She scooped up Groot and carried him, using her huge belly for support, and waddled towards the ramp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora saw the other Guardians hauling cribs, toys, and more up the ramp. Rocket, meanwhile, dragged a crate with dozens of weapons for the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all stopped to get things for the babies?\" she asked, tears building up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Peter began, kissing Gamora's cheek, \"it was about half for the babies, and half for the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also got some larger clothes for you. It seems like you're running out of things to wear,\" Mantis noticed, gesturing towards the fact that Gamora was only wearing an ill-fitting shirt and underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think I ripped the last pair of pants that would even come close to fitting. Thanks, Mantis!\" Gamora said, setting Groot down, who ran after Rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis shook her head. \"Actually, it was Drax's idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora raised an eyebrow. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Hovat was carrying Kamaria, she quickly outgrew her clothes. I noticed that you were growing rapidly, so I thought it would be a good idea,\" Drax said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well, thank you!\" Gamora said, hugging Drax, her massive belly colliding into him. He awkwardly patted him on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Gamora and Quill had finished setting up the cribs in the room where they had previously held the prisoner. Gamora stood in front of one of the cribs, holding onto it for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter approached her from behind and rubbed the sides of her stomach. She placed her hands on his, and together they sat in silence as they felt their babies move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how fast this has gone by. They're almost here! All...twelve of them...\" Peter trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora smirked. \"You're telling me! How do you think it feels to carry them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter chuckled. \"Yeah. I know that you've got super strength and all that. But still, that's a lot. I'm worried that it might be too much for you. You're not gonna...explode are you? It's just that it would take a long time to clean all that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora jabbed him with her elbow and slowly turned around. \"Well, since you're worried, I'll try my best to stay in one piece,\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter leaned his head forward and placed it on hers. \"Are you ready for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think so. At least I have the best team you could ask for behind me to help,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right!\" Peter said excitedly. He poked Gamora's belly playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora placed a hand over it as it gurgled and groaned. The babies began to kick and roll. \"Ooh...Maybe don't do that...I think I have to go to the bathroom again,\" she sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plodded out of the room. \"Wait! You just went two minutes ago!\" Peter yelled after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gamora exited the bathroom, she was stopped by Drax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Gamora! Just who I was looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora stopped. \"Where you waiting outside of the bathroom for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrax tensed up. \"What? Oh, of course not! I was just...looking at the wall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a bad liar. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrax reached into his pants pocket and pulled out a knife. \"I wanted to give you this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora took it and rotated it in her hand. \"Alright. Thank...you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It belonged to Kamaria. I gave it to her when I took her for her first hunt. When your children are born, I'd like you to give it to the child that you prefer the most,\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll have a favorite child, Drax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrax smiled. \"You will.

She assumed that the others had started planning for the assault on the convoy, and that she had woken up fairly late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and looked down at her belly. She had again grown overnight. But this time the growth had been huge, her belly now sticking out around three feet.She put her hands on the tight skin, feeling how taut and stretched it was. She noted that it was starting to lose some of its give. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to sit up, but the weight of her belly held her down, and bearing down on her body. She moaned slightly as she tried again, the weight starting to get more and more uncomfortable for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Rocket could make me something to take the weight off\u201d she grumbled to herself, finally sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started the struggle to stand up, swinging herself slightly for momentum. She grabbed onto her dresser and pulled herself forward, throwing herself off the bed, onto her feet. Taking a moment to adjust her balance, she steadied herself against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled towards the bathroom, her hands resting on her back, and started to run a shower. She stepped in, feeling the warm water run over her swollen body, easing some of the tension in her muscles. She rubbed in the soapy water, trying to spread it across her belly, but still missing a few spots around her bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora stepped out of the shower, drying herself off, draping a towel over her belly in an attempt to dry it. She stepped back into her room and had a look at the clothes that the others had bought for her. She pulled out a long black skirt and a grey t-shirt, deciding to wear them for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw her towels to the side and grabbed a bra from the shopping. She started putting it on, but noticed that it felt tight around her, and saw that her breasts were bulging out of the top. Sighing, she started to pull on her panties, tugging them up her legs, struggling to get around her belly. She pulled them up and felt them digging into her hips slightly, accentuating her butt a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the skirt and put it on, pulling it up her legs. She pulled it over her butt, and looked at it in the mirror. It wasn\u2019t too tight and fit fairly well, but she knew that she wouldn\u2019t be able to wear it for much longer. She grabbed the shirt and pulled it on, stretching it over her swollen form, managing to pull it over a fair portion of her belly. She made a mental note to thank Drax for getting extra stretchy clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her stomach grumble, Gamora started to make her way to the mess to find some food. As she walked she felt the babies start to kick, and rubbed the spots to try and soothe them. The kicks kept going, and began to get more intense. She sat back down on the bed as the kicks started to hurt, not causing huge amounts of pain, but repeatedly kicking and squirming. She fell back trying to calm them down, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, just coming to che-\u201c Peter started, walking in to her room. \u201cWoah whats going on?\u201d He said, running to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabies kicking, hard!\u201d Gamora groaned, rubbing her belly in futility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter started to rub with her, trying to help as best he could. \u201cStop kicking your mama!\u201d He said, trying to lift her spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora smiled a little, but soon went back to cringing in pain. She moaned in pain, and rubbed her belly with Peter, desperate for it to stop. \u201cIt feels like they want out!\u201d She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGamora..?\u201d Mantis walked in, looking anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMantis! Come help\u201d Peter called to her, ushering her over. \u201cTry and stop the babies or something\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis walked towards Gamora nervously, holding out her hand towards her squirming belly. Her gand made contact and her antenna began to glow as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleeep\u201d she whispered, closing her eyes in concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she spoke the squirming, and the pain subsided. Gamoras belly was still again, and she sat up, with a look of intense relief on her face. She looked at Peter and Mantis, who both seemed equally relieved that she was fine again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mantis\u201d she said, breathing heavily. \u201cI think, you should probably stay close to me now. To stop that from happening again\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis nodded in agreement, rubbing her belly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, the group was in the mess, talking, save for Gamora and Mantis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah im sure its possible, just might lose a limb or tw-\u201c Rocket said, stopping because of the others surprised looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to see Gamora walking in. Or Gamoras belly, followed by Gamora. Her bump was completely exposed, with nothing covering it, but that had come to be expected. What wasn\u2019t was that the rest of her wasn\u2019t covered either. Her legs were completely bare, her belly just covering her crotch from view, and her butt exposed. Her large breasts were also exposed, resting on her belly. As she sat down, they could see that she had a slightly embarassed look on her face, and that she was blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, did you lose ya clothes?\u201d Rocket quipped, trying to joke around, and immidiately began to regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust shut up Rocket. You try being this f@*cking big and having any clothes that fit, or don\u2019t tear. I\u2019ve had it up to here with your sh*t if I\u2019m honest, so just zip it\u201d Gamora yelled, starting to get worked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis stepped in and placed a hand on Gamoras shoulder. \u201cCalm\u201d she whispered, soothing Gamora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora breathed in and out slowly, calming down from her rage. She looked at The others, particularly Rocket, and saw them all with their mouths slightly agape. \u201cSorry, hormones\u201d she said, and began to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had finished eating and had talked to the others for a bit, Gamora had retreated to her room for the night. Though she felt tired, she wanted to try something before bed. She rolled out a mat on the floor, and stood on it. She stretched for a minute or two and then began to attempt some stretches, to try and keep relatively fit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and then bent over to try and touch her toes, getting nowhere near because of her belly, but still stratching out. She repeated it a couple more times befor changing positions. This time she put her legs apart slightly and started to squat. She felt her belly hit the floor and rub against her legs a little, and grunted as she heaved herself up again. She tried a few mire before moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more stretches and positions, she settled herself into bed and drifted to sleep, rubbing her belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next few days, Gamora had spent most of the time in her room. When she wasn't there, she was in the babies' room, making sure they had everything they needed before she gave birth. She'd heard of the term \"nesting\" once or twice, and assumed that this was what she was experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of birth, she figured she had to be getting close. Gamora knew fairly little about pregnancy, but it certainly felt like the babies were getting ready to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora retrieved Peter's headphones and brought them back to her room. The babies were being particularly active, and she hoped some music would calm them down. She sat down heavily on the bed, it creaking in the process, and brought the headphones near her belly. This would be difficult. Her stomach was much wider than it was the last time she tried to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora pulled each ear pad down, extending them a little more. She hoped that it would do the trick. She tried to put it around the sides of her belly, but it stopped at the very top. Gamora tried to pull them further apart, forcing it down the sides of her monstrous stomach. It stopped again a few inches down, the headphones beginning to strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora pushed them down again, and the headphones suddenly snapped in half. She held them in her hands and started to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis stood by the doorway, coming when she heard her struggling earlier. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I broke them...\" Gamora cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis approached her, patting her on the back. Gamora continued to cry. Mantis placed her hand on Gamora's head. \"Calm...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora stopped crying, her mood brightening. Gamora hugged Mantis, her belly pushing into the small woman. \"You're gonna be around for the birth, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Gamora was sitting in her room munching on food. Lost in her own thoughts, she almost didn't see Drax come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gamora,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh, hi Drax,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quill suggested that I talk to you. The babies will be here soon, correct?\" Drax asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora shifted. \"Uh...I think so. I hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He thought that it'd be a good idea if I talked to you about what comes after. After the very painful birth, I mean,\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Thanks. I guess it would help. I haven't read any parenting books. I don't really know what I'm doing when it comes to being a parent,\" she said, hands resting on her belly as her babies kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrax shook his head. \"You don't need any books. They're pointless. All you have to do is what you feel is right. You'll do what's best for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora smiled, and turned her head as Peter entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna reach the convoy tomorrow morning. Rocket thought it would be a good idea if we had a big dinner tonight. Never know if it could be the last one we have together. That sound good?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could answer, Gamora's belly let out a huge rumble. There was silence for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take that as a yes,\" Peter said.</span></div></div>",

Drax noticed him struggling and started to help, pulling her up with ease, leaving Peter with a slightly annoyed look on his face. Gamora simply smiled as she left the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them left the room, Drax and Peter trailing slightly behind the Gamora. They entered the mess and saw that Rocket, with help from Groot and Mantis, had set out a large meal on the table, with a lot of the food towards one end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThank you, Rocket. This is amazing\u201d Gamora said, feeling herself start to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAh, I thought I\u2019d do something nice for ya, and before we go for the heist\u201d Rocket replied, jumping down from a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group all sat down at the table, Gamora sitting down at the end of the table, to leave room for her belly. Quill sat next to her and patted her belly playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dDig in\u201d Rocket said, grabbing some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began eating, slowly grabbing bits of food from the table. Gamora, on the other hand got into the food immediately, grabbing food from all over the table and quickly wolfing it down, grabbing more afterwards. The others had grown used to it throughout her pregnancy and paid little attention to her messy eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSo what's the plan for tomorrow?\u201d Gamora asked between mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWe\u2019re leaving early, and taking the pod to the rendezvous point, \u201d Peter started, recounting the plan. \u201dThen we wait for the convoy to arrive, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket carried on. \u201dWhen it arrives, that's when the fun begins. We gotta attack it quick, take out the guards and get our loot fast. If we're quick enough we can do it before backup arrives. If not...\u201d he stopped, trying to think of what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWe shall fight our way out of it\u201d Drax added, smiling at the thought of a good fight. \u201dWe will be back in no time at all, we fight well. Well, I do\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHey! I'm a good fighter, I can hold my own in a fight\u201d Quill replied in slight annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dEhhh, you could do better Quill, \u201d Rocket said, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked around with a look of exasperation, as everyone else giggled and laughed, including Gamora. She patted his shoulder as he joined in laughing.  The rest of the evening was spent telling stories and jokes, laughter echoing through the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meal, everyone began to head back to their rooms, to get ready for the long day ahead of them, until the only two people left in the mess we're Gamora and Peter. She was leant against him, the two of them rubbing her large belly together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had Rockets device with them, and they were looking at the display on the screen, exploring her belly. They counted each baby, but still couldn't work out the gender of each, so they would have to wait till she gave birth to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI think you're coming to the end\u201d Peter said, looking at the screen. \u201dThe device says that they're fully developed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI think so too, it's getting pretty tight isn't it\u201d Gamora added, patting her belly for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI can't wait to meet them\u201d Peter said, kissing her on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stayed like that for a while, until Gamora spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI might head to bed now\u201d she said, standing up slowly. \u201dCare to join me?\u201d she added, winking at Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked at her and smiled, following her to her bedroom and quickly undressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThis has building up all this time, so lets make it count\u201d she said to him, enjoying his enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, lets\u201d he said, lying down on the bed next to her, ready to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up and kneeled over him, her belly just touching his chest. It was in that moment that she realised how much harder it would be with her belly in the way. She straddled him and began to move up and down, but stopped when she heard Peter huff loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dC-can\u2019t b-breathe, \u201d he stuttered, Gamoras belly crushing him against the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh my- Peter I'm so sorry!\u201d she said, trying as quickly as she could to get off him, letting him breathe again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dtry something else?\u201d he asked, catching his breath again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora nodded, and lay back on the bed, letting Peter take charge this time. He stood between her legs and moved to start, but found that her belly got in the way, covering her crotch slightly, but just enough to stop him from reaching it. He sighed in resignation and looked at Gamora, who was giving him a look of \u2019something else?\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried several more positions, but found each one awkward in their own way. Eventually they discovered a relatively comfortable position, and quickly got to work, giving Gamora a release that she had been crying for weeks. The two lay down in bed together, satisfied, and fell asleep rubbing her belly.</span></div></div>",

She looked at her belly, which had only slightly grown overnight, an watched as the babies inside kicked around forming bumps and bulges all across the tight surface. She rubbed the bumps gently and looked around to see Peter getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dMorning\u201d she yawned, holding her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dMorning, how'd you sleep?\u201d He replied with a cheeky grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot him a look and smirked back at him. \u201dOkay, babies didn't kick too much. How about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dPretty good, but I'm a little nervous about the Heist\u201d He said, pulling his shirt on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI wish I could help you\u201d Gamora said, sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI know, but we can't let you get hurt, and the babies are gonna arrive soon\u201d Peter said, rubbing her belly. Gamora pouted, annoyed. \u201dI\u2019ll be back before you know it, and maybe we can continue where we left off last night\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora smirked and kissed him on the cheek. \u201dMaybe we could\u201d she whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his jacket on and patted her belly, leaving to grab some breakfast. She sat up and rubbed her belly a little, noting that it felt tighter and that the babies were more active than usual, but not enough to cause her any pain. She heaved herself off the bed, taking a moment to catch her breath again. She waddled towards the mirror and had a look at herself. She rubbed her belly and noticed that it was hanging lower than it had previously and felt heavier than previously. She felt her stomach grumble, and began to make her way to the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mess, she found the others all quickly eating some food and making the final preparations for the heist. Rocket was assembling some sort of gun, while Drax was sat next to Peter, both eating some food. Mantis was sat opposite them, playing with Groot a little before they left. Gamora sat down next to her and began eating her breakfast rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIs everyone ready?\u201d Rocket announced, having finished building his new weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter and Drax both finished their meals and stood up, while Groot said a quick goodbye to Mantis and walking up to Drax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGood luck guys\u201d Gamora said. \u201dcome back in one piece\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter patted her belly gently. \u201dwe will, i promise\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group left for the pod and buckled in, Groot sitting on Peters lap. They waved goodbye as the pod dropped down and soared off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dits gonna be a long day, isn't it\u201d Gamora said, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours had gone by, and Mantis and Gamora had received a short message from the others to say that they had arrived. They had spent most of the day together, tidying the babies room, and rubbing her belly to calm the babies. Gamora had felt a few sharp pains throughout the day but had put them down to the babies getting more and more active. She was sat on her bed rubbing her belly, with Mantis sat in front of her, rubbing her belly as well. She felt another pain and moaned slightly. The pain was followed by a strange sensation between her legs and what felt like fluid running between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGamora, did you wet yourself?\u201d Mantis asked her naively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI-I don't think so. I think the babies are coming\u201d she replied, slightly in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women looked at each other and shared a look of panic. After a few seconds they sprung into action, Mantis running to grab supplies and Gamora clearing the bed to make room. She struggled as she felt a contraction, and her belly tightening. She soothed it and carried on. Mantis ran back in, carrying towels, and a medkit. She helped Gamora onto the bed, and started to rub her belly, trying to soothe the babies and slow them down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGet a message to Peter. Tell him to hurry up\u201d Gamora said, beginning some breathing exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOf course! I will be as quick as i can!\u201d Mantis replied, quickly running to the bridge to send the others a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora rubbed her belly as she felt another contraction coming on. She hoped this would be easy, but part of her knew that it definitely wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were sat in the pod, just outside the route that the convoy was taking. They were starting to get antsy, as the convoy still hadn't arrived, even though they were dead on time. Peter was slightly more anxious than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat if something goes wrong, what if they get hurt?\u201d He said, pacing back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThey will be fine Quill, they are both capable fighters,\u201d Drax said, trying to relax him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOne of them is heavily pregnant, and Mantis? A fighter?\u201d He returned, looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dQuill quit ya worrying. Trust me they'll be fine. If anything Gamora being pregnant makes her way harder to fight. I wouldn't wanna be on her bad side\u201d Rocket added, remembering when Gamora had snapped at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI am Groot!\u201d Groot said, in an enthusiastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI guess so, I just don't want her or the babies to get hu-\u201d Peter was cut off by a beeping sound from one of the consoles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dConvoys here, Let's move!\u201d Rocket called, cocking his gun and smiling. \u201dthis is gonna be good\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them leapt out of the pod and began their assault, just missing a message from Mantis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAAGGHH!\u201d Gamora screamed, pushing as hard as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou are doing very good! Keep pushing!\u201d Mantis encouraged, trying not to sound nervous. She rubbed Gamoras tightening belly and her antenna lit up, as she tried to ease her pain a well as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIt hurts!\u201d Gamora called back, through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou have already had one, only eleven more to go!\u201d Mantis carried on, trying her best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhere are the others, where's Peter?\u201d Gamora questioned, starting to push again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis gulped. \u201dI don't think they got the message\u201d she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora groaned as she pushed again, feeling the next baby come out, and Mantis cutting the cord. \u201dWhy is this so hard!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis simply rubbed her belly slowly and closed her eyes, concentrating as hard as she could to ease her pain. Gamora could feel some of her pain seeping away and made a note to thank Mantis as much as she could after this was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bore down on another contraction and moaned in pain. Her belly was starting to glisten with sweat, but she saw that it had shrunk slightly. She pushed again and felt the third baby crowning. She screamed and pushed again, feeling immense relief as Mantis eased the baby out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201donly nine more!\u201d Mantis smiled, as Gamora began to push again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThat was amazing! The look on their faces! Ah, Classic!\u201d Rocket laughed, recalling the heist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIt truly was glorious! And when their backup showed up! Ha!\u201d Drax added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket pulled the pod into the docking bay, carefully parking it back were it belonged. The door opened and the four of them walked out, confused as to where Gamora and Mantis were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGamora? We're back!\u201d Peter yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dPeter? I-In here!\u201d he heard Gamora yell back, sounding pained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran to her bedroom and burst through the door. He saw Gamora lying back on the bed, her belly significantly smaller and covered in sweat, and nine babies neatly wrapped up and sleeping on the floor. He immediately ran to her side and grabbed her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI am so so sorry I left! Why didn't you guys send a message?\u201d He asked, sounding concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWe did\u201d Mantis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realisation hit Peter immediately. \u201dShit, I am so sorry Gamora. I-I should have paid attention to the console and i-\u201d Peter started, getting cut off by Gamora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou\u2019re here now, Peter.\u201d she said, smiling weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter kissed her forehead as she started to push once more, moaning in agony. He encouraged her and helped Mantis to guide the baby out. Another few pushes and they were down to one final baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dCome on Gamora, one left, you can do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed as hard as she could, and screamed again, feeling the baby start to crown. She pushed and pushed and eventually she felt the final baby come out. She smiled for a second as she drifted to sleep, exhausted from her labour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamora woke up a few hours later. She slowly opened her eyes and saw that everyone was sat in the room, holding a baby or two. Peter walked over to her, cradling two of their babies and handed one to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWell done mama\u201d he said, smiling goofily. \u201d5 boys and 7 girls\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dTheyre perfect!\u201d she replied, feeling tears start to water in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNext time, maybe we should use protection\u201d Peter joked, getting a jab in the rins from Gamora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the scene around her and smiled. It was perfect.</span></div></div>",

Apparently, 16 souls were lost trying to find their way to the after life. They were lost becuase Death, the one who was supposed to claim them, dissapeared. Strange needed to keep the souls from wandering while he looked for Death, so he asked Tigra to act as a \"soul vessel\" for them. That meant the souls had to be transferred into her womb. Strange said that once he found Death, he would remove the souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was 12 months ago. Tigra, or anyone for that matter, hadn't heard from Strange since. And he was the only one who could remove these souls. So until he got back, she was stuck with 16 souls in her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTigra looked down, and was greeted by a wall of flesh. Her breasts had swollen to about ZZ-Cups and had burst out of her bikini top, so she had to get a new one. Her hips and thighs had also swollen to accommidate her, so she needed a new bikini bottom too. But what dominated her frame was her belly. It was the size of a yoga ball and incredibly heavy. Strange had used a spell to give Tigra the strength to move, but it was still heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTigra groaned as she heaved her massive body to the side to try and get out of bed.

So she decided to do something she usually couldn't do since she was on missions: use the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the stereotype of cats hating water, tigers, and by extension Tigra, were able to swim. And with her current condition, the pool was the only place where Tigra could feel like she was actually light. So, careful not to break anything with her belly, Tigra slowly made her way to the pool. Thankfully, the doors were incredibly wide, just in case Hulk or Thing paid a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she made it to the spacious pool. Slowly, she lowered herself into the cool water. Now, she had more free movement, since she was much lighter in the water. She decided to simply lie back and relax, rubbing her belly from time to time. The souls were oddly calm today. She started to doze off when she suddenly heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tigra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping her eyes open, she manuvered herself to see who it was.

Or it will be, to see if motherhood really does suit you.\" He said, whipping out a gun and firing it at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasps and tries to dive out of the way, but she's hit in the abdomen by a sickly green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>So boys and girls, was the good(-ish) doctors gun set to stun, or is Batgirl gonna need a fresh set of tights?

When the pressure subsided, Barbra looked down at her now exceptionally large stomach. It looked as if she'd swallowed a beach ball whole. Batgirl moaned as a wave of exhaustion hit her. Before she passed out, she looked over and found the source of the noise that initially drew her here in the first place.

She had just made he assistant vanish from a fairly standard sword cabinet, and was ready to make him reappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well folks, as nice as it is to have some peace and quiet for a change, I don't think the Temp agency will react well to me loosing another assistant.\" She joked, some people in the crowd chuckling. Wrapping on the side of the box, she gives a loud shout of \"Abra Kadabra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box flew open and out stepped a man in a white lab coat, dark red shirt, black slacks and boots with his face covered by an odd looking gas mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tada! The assistant has been transformed into a supervillain! Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I am Doctor Impregnus, and I'm here with a once in a life time opportunity.\" the man says, the croud gasping and rising from their chairs, only to find their servers were all suddenly armed with pistols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's that lunatic that knocked up Batgirl and the others. Maybe if I play it cool for a bit I can learn what his game is.' Zatana thinks, standing off too the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I realize this is a shock, but it's also a blessing in disguise! You see, I'm offering all the lovely ladies in the audience a chance to have their own bundle of super powered joy.\" the mad doctor spouts with psychotic glee in his voice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What are you talking about you quack?\" a woman in the audience jeers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent question, though the quack comment is a bit harsh. You see, I have a ray gun that through the miracles of science, is imbued with the DNA of some of the earths mightiest heroes. This allows me to use said DNA to create multiple super babies in a lucky ladies womb and for a small fee of five million dollars, you can become pregnant with your own set of super triplets. There's a bank account number on the bottom of the tacky little table topper in front of you, transfer the money, and step on up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother woman looks up at him \"How do we know this isn't a trick? Can you give us a demonstration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpregnus nods \"Another good question, and yes I can! For my first trick, I'll be needing a volunteer, and I just happen to have a magician in my midst!\" he said, pointing the ray gun at Zatana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat chance psycho. sdnib otni snopaeW!\" She shouts out. Suddenly, a bright light flashed and all the henchmens weapons were transformed into chains that bound them tight...except for Impregnus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, nice try, but I know that hoo-doo that you do and luckily for me, this isn't a weapon, it's a medical tool.\" he said, pullingte trigger and hitting Zatana with a sickly green light.</span></div></div>",
