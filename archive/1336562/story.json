A family dinner would be nice but then again trying to wrangle everyone together last minute could be a headache to say the least. So you decide on a romantic dinner for two. You cooking, a quiet evening at home, candles, wine. YES! This would be perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrowsing through the crowded isles at FOODLAND getting necessities for the birthday feast your mind starts to wander to the big night. This night is going to be just what the doctor ordered you think wistfully. After 5 years of marital bliss you were happy but lately things had been a little strained. You had sensed things just weren't right lately but chalked it up to the impending birthday. Another year gone by can throw anyone off a little. God knows you always got a little crazed when your birthday rolled around. Heading to the checkout you feel yourself cheer up a little as you leave you thoughts and re-enter reality. Everything would be fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 o'clock had seemed to creep up on you without warning and found yourself frantically running around the kitchen finishing everything up. Everything had to be ready to go before your beloved came home. There's nothing worse than a badly prepared birthday offering and you intend for everything to go smoothly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 6.30 the front door opens and you're thankful for that bit of extra time. You'd had just enough time to light the last candle and chuck that old lady floral apron out of sight to reveal what your spouse just loves to see you wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're waiting with a smile as your spouse enters the kitchen. Genuine surprise! Hadn't a clue!  Success! you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Happy Birthday baby</i>. You move nearer for a kiss but before you can get too close your spouse steps back avoiding your eyes. Not the reaction you expected. <i>What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know this probably isn't the best time but we need to talk..</i></span></div></div>",
