Thank god you give me so many chances to do it!\"  You feel her sharp nails gliding down your soles, seeking out your most ticklish spots.  Like Laura said, she's had a lot of practice doing just that, so she knows exactly where those sports are.  You immediately erupt with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE EHEHE EHEHEHE LALAUAUHAHEHE EHEHEHEHEHE LAAUUURAAAA HE EHEHEHEH PLLEEZZZZZ HE EHEHEHEHEH DONNTTT HE EHEHE TICKCKLLLEEE HE EHEHEH EHEHEHEH MEHEHEHEHEHEHE THERERERERERERE!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not there? Not where?  Down your arch?\"  Lauren asked, zipping an index finger down your instep, drawing out a peal of laughter, \"Or was that don't tickle the crease down the center of my foot?  A thumb pressed into that spot, wiggling digging into the tender flesh, \"Of course, i could just tickle them all,\"  With that, all five fingers rake down your sole from toes to heel, covering the entire bottom of your foot the tickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose it, laughing and screaming, your body shaking back and forth, trying to escape your own magically created bonds.  No dice.  Laura's got you, and there's nothing you can do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goochie goochie goo, little Kevin!  This must be so awful for you.  You've got to have the softest feet of any body I've ever tickled...and trust me, I've tickled quite a few.  They're even softer than some of the girls I've tickled!  Not very manly, Kevin. Of course, neither is squealing like a pig while I have my way with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey!  You're a sorcerer, not a performer of manual labor!  You don't build up many callouses sitting around reading ancient spell books all day!  And trust me, all those real men out there would squeal too if Laura got to their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE EHEHEHEHEEH OOOKOKOKOKKOO HE EHEHEHEHE OOOKKKKKKK AH AHAHAHAH YOUHUHUHUHUHU HA AHAHH GAWWTTTT MEHEHEHEHEHEH AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH YOUHUHUHU WINNNN HAHAHAHAHAH LAUAURRAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAH III GIVVEE EHAHAHAHAHAAH!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad, Kevin dear, because I'm not nearly finished with you!\"  Lauren began slowly spider walking her fingers up from your heels to your toes, dragging out louder and louder bellows of torment from you,\" Do you remember that time I got you in the library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could you forget?  You were carrying an armful of clothes to a side table for folding when Laura cast a spell increasing the mass of the garments by 100 times.  You crumbled under the weight, effectively pinned by your own laundry!  As luck would have it, only your feet and head were sticking out of the pile.  laura quickly removed your shoes and tickled your feet for hours, as you screamed and screamed until a teacher finally rescued you.  That was one of the worst attacks Lauren has inflicted on you and one of your worst memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember why I got to tickle so long?\"  Laura asked in a teasing voice, nails digging into the balls of your feet, forcing a throaty howl from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEHEHEHEHHEESSSSSS OOOHHHH GAAAWWWWWDDDD NOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO NAWWWTTTT THAHAHAHAHATTTTTT AHAHAHAHAHHA NOAAWWOWOWOWOOO!!!!\"  Even as the tears fill your eyes and sweat starts pouring down your face, a horrible understanding fills you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the school being a scene of constant tickle warfare, the instructors did keep a handle on things.  They could sense every spell being cast, and when someone was attacked by tickle magic, they would intervene...eventually, after they felt the victim had learned they're lesson.  They had been slowly to react to the tickle attack in the laundry, because Lauren's spell had been cast against the clothes, not you.  The instructors had thought it some entirely non-tickling prank all together.  They had actually appologized to you after finally freeing you from the clothing mound Laura had buried you in.  But that meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Laura said, her voice filled with glee, \"Right now all the instructors are busy refereeing the tickle matches.  And since this wasn't even my spell imprisoning, but yours, probably cast while you practiced for your first match.  The instructors won't have any reason to think you're in trouble, and you are in soooo much trouble Kevin, because...\"  At that moment, Laura slipped her fingertips under your toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE EHEHEH EHEHEHEH THEHEHEEYYYYY EHEHEHEHEHEHHEH GAWWDDDD NAWWOOWO TOOEESSH AHAHAAHAHAH PLEEEZZZ HEHE EHHEHEH NAWWOOOO TOEESSSSSSS THEYYEY HEHEHEHEHEH THEYEYEYEYYEY AREENN'TT HEHEHEHH COOOMINNGGNGN HEHEHEHEHEHEHEH THEYEYYY ARREENNN'T COMINGNNGNGN HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE NAWWWTTTTT TOOESSSS AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not until evening, at the earliest,\" Laura said in a voice thick with lust, \"Maybe then, one will remember you never made it to the tournament and come check up on you, but not a moment before, meaning...you are all mine for most of the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible despair washes over you.  Its true.  And there's nothing you can do about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, I'll bet I can arrange to tickle you even longer than that!\" Laura says, her voice perfectly evil.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Normally, the very idea of casting a spell while laughing your head off is a foolish one.  Magic requires pronouncing each syllable in a twisting, spidery sentence absolutely perfectly. Tickling pretty much rendered that impossible.  It's why the first tickling magic was invented.  But you aren't going to be your arch nemesis's tickle toy without putting up a fight.  Despite each and every twitch of Laura's fingers sending peal after peal of laughter ringing from your mouth, you unleash a spell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and mangle it horribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ahaha,\" Laura laughs mockingly, \"Did you really think anything was going to happen?  You can't cast spells even when your not laughing like a baboon!  Now you try and...\"  Her voice fell silent, and for the first time, her fingers stopped dancing on your soles.  A thin, red line formed in mid-air, right over Laura's head, about six or seven feet in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A split in the fabric of reality,\" she whispered in horror, \"Kevin, what have you done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there wasn't a line, but a hole, maybe an inch across and black as night.  Slowly it got wider, like a door or window opening.  You swallow hard, even as you catch your breath.  This was bad.  Very bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its your fault!\" you bark, lungs still hurting from the tickling, \"If you had just untied me instead of torturing me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fault!\"  Laura spat, \"It was your damn spell!  You're the one who...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, black tendrils started streaming through the opening in the fabric.  There were hundreds of them, each as thick as a man's arm.  They looked like octopus tentacles, except they were totally smooth, with no suction cups at all.  They quickly scoop up both you and Laura, lifting you high into the air.  Their touch must dispel magic, because the ropes holding you vanished like mist.  Unfortunately, with a tendril wrapped around each ankle and wrist, you have no more freedom then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You moron!\" Laura screams.  Looking over, you see that she is in exactly the same predicament that you are.  The creature (if that's what it is) effortlessly pulls her limbs spread eagle, turning her into a letter 'X'.  All she can move is her head...and, unfortunately, her lips, \"Its a tickle fiend!  You've unleashed a damnable tickle fiend!  I ought to he ehehe e eheheheheheeh nawwowooo youhuhuhuuu ahahahah baaststsrrddddd ha ahahaha a aahahahaha!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slender tendril, no wider than a finger, managed to snake under Laura's blouse, and you can see its outline wiggling through the clothing, tickling Laura's belly.  Her ticklish laughter, a sound you have heard far less often than she's heard yours, spills forth immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laughter seems to attract the tickle fiends attention, because more and more tentacles make there was to Laura, ignoring you completely for the moment.  Some join their mate and slide under her blouse, others slip beneath her skirt.  A couple try and sneak into her shoes.  Then, for just a second, they seem to freeze, even the one that had been tickling Laura's belly.  Your former tormentor's eyes open, wide with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap,\" Laura whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud, ripping sound, the tendrils tear her clothes into ribbons, leaving her in just a bra and panties. Tearing the cloth and leather seemed no harder for the beast than ripping tissues. Even her shoes are split in half.  The tickle fiends strength must be incredible!  Still, you can't help but marvel at the sight in front of you.  While Laura's seen you undressed countless times, this is one of the few times you have had the advantage.  You have to admit, despite your dislike of the woman, she has quite a body, with full breasts, firm legs and slender arms.  Her skin is a pale white, contrasting visibly to the pitch black tentacles holding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, all the tendrils start stroking Laura's body at once.</span></div></div>",

You continue to beg and whine, but no sound escapes your throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, much better.\" Says Laura, circling your helpless kneeling body with a look of pure evil on her face. \"I get so bored of hearing you whine and moan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to whine and moan, as per usual, but it's useless! You've been rendered completely mute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pleasantly surprised the Silence spell even worked.\" Laura laughs. \"I found it in a rather dubious book of magic in the library. I never would have had the courage to try it on a competent sorcerer. But luckily, I have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow insulting! You stop your silent pleading for a moment and begin silently expressing your indignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" chirps Laura, sinisterly kneeling in front of you as her lips curl into a devious smile. \"I'm going to tickle you until you ask me, politely, to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mouth \"Stop! Please stop! Ms. Laura, please, most mighty Sorceress, please stop!\" but, unsurprisingly, sounds continue not to issue from your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenacingly, Laura runs her glossy, jet black nails slowly from your stomach to your chest, before splitting and sliding toward your armpits! You begin to buck and squirm in your unrelenting hogtie as her fingers begin to dig and dance over your flesh mercilessly! You scream and beg but can't make a sound as Laura's evil cackling fills your room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a seeming eternity, Laura tickle tortures your underarms and prods and teases your bare nipples. Your head spins in a ticklish delirium! Just as you fear you're going to pass out from the assault you hear the door to your room creak open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stops her attack momentarily and you look toward the door, your vision blurry with the tears of agonized laughter, and you see Erica, a tall, athletic blonde fifth year sorceress and the mistress of your hall. Last semester she botched a Spectral Chains spell during finals, accidentally binding her own wrists and ankles. Professor Dweomer had found it so funny that he'd left her like that the whole rest of the day! Robbed of her shoes and socks, stretched taut with her arms above her head and her feet dangling several inches above the floor in the Hall of Restricting Magics, Dweomer had invited the rest of his classes to tickle and tease his hapless student. You, and countless other apprentice level students, couldn't resist the chance to assault the helpless feet of this advanced sorceress ... but did she remember you? You hope not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just doing my usual rounds before heading to the tourney and I thought I heard some evil cackling,\" says Erica, as Laura's face flushes with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just practicing before the tournament!\" Stammers Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mouth \"We're done practicing now!

Seeing how the younger sorceress had flushed when she had entered the room Erica thought for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, did you want to spend more time with your boyfriend?\" Erica finally says with a hint of a smirk appearing on her otherwise collected face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?!

She remembers me!</i>\" You think to yourself as you laugh involuntarily from the poke, a sense of panic starting to well up after what you just went through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your face take on a funny expression, she giggles softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm not looking for payback or anything.

So much so that she didn't look up until Erica and you were standing right beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you reading?\" You ask the sitting sorceress, unable to see the cover of the book from the position it was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha?!

That's when it hits you; why not MAKE them worse? You go back over to your old tome and flip over to a page near the far back of the book. Once there, you use what parts of the faded text you already translated to decipher a bit more of a certain spell you recall the description mentioning as \"the ultimate in sensitivity\"; you had not thought much of the idea at first, but as you make headway in the forgotten wording of the spell, you snicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in for a real treat Laura,\" you brag, closing the book. \"I just remembered I had deciphered not too long ago a spell that'll make your skin squeal with sensitivity!\" Laura merely grunts and rolls her eyes, obviously not too confident in your boast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waste no more time and cast the spell.

You continue to banter to her while you tie every single one of the straps around her individual toes, allowing you one hundred percent access to every nook and cranny of her feet. \"Every spot I touch on your skin for the next ten or so minutes will permanently become more than twice as sensitive to any touch. You'll be lucky if you can even wear socks after I'm done with your feet Laura.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's face would have contorted with anger if she wasn't too busy crying tears of laughter. With every touch on her feet, there is a soft glow, signifying the spell working it's magic. You happilly grin as you exert your revenge over your arch nemesis. While you do also use a bit of the spell on her upperbody, so that taking advantage of her armpits and ribs will be much easier in the future, you delight in making what was once a bearable, if still ticklish spot on your rival and turning it into such a weakspot she would be lucky to last ten seconds of tickling there in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes had passed, and the spell wore off from the tips of your fingers.

You've got to have the softest feet of any body I've ever tickled...and trust me, I've tickled quite a few. They're even softer than some of the girls I've tickled! Not very manly, Kayley.

You were carrying an armful of clothes to a side table for folding when Laura cast a spell increasing the mass of the garments by 100 times. You crumbled under the weight, effectively pinned by your own laundry! As luck would have it, only your feet and head were sticking out of the pile. laura quickly removed your shoes and tickled your feet for hours, as you screamed and screamed until a teacher finally rescued you. That was one of the worst attacks Lauren has inflicted on you and one of your worst memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember why I got to tickle so long?\" Laura asked in a teasing voice, nails digging into the balls of your feet, forcing a throaty howl from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEHEHEHEHHEESSSSSS OOOHHHH GAAAWWWWWDDDD NOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO NAWWWTTTT THAHAHAHAHATTTTTT AHAHAHAHAHHA NOAAWWOWOWOWOOO!!!!\" Even as the tears fill your eyes and sweat starts pouring down your face, a horrible understanding fills you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the school being a scene of constant tickle warfare, the instructors did keep a handle on things. They could sense every spell being cast, and when someone was attacked by tickle magic, they would intervene...eventually, after they felt the victim had learned they're lesson. They had been slowly to react to the tickle attack in the laundry, because Lauren's spell had been cast against the clothes, not you. The instructors had thought it some entirely non-tickling prank all together. They had actually apologized to you after finally freeing you from the clothing mound Laura had buried you in. But that meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Laura said, her voice filled with glee, \"Right now all the instructors are busy refereeing the tickle matches. And since this wasn't even my spell imprisoning, but yours, probably cast while you practiced for your first match. The instructors won't have any reason to think you're in trouble, and you are in soooo much trouble Kayley, because...\" At that moment, Laura slipped her fingertips under your toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE EHEHEH EHEHEHEH THEHEHEEYYYYY EHEHEHEHEHEHHEH GAWWDDDD NAWWOOWO TOOEESSH AHAHAAHAHAH PLEEEZZZ HEHE EHHEHEH NAWWOOOO TOEESSSSSSS THEYYEY HEHEHEHEHEH THEYEYEYEYYEY AREENN'TT HEHEHEHH COOOMINNGGNGN HEHEHEHEHEHEHEH THEYEYYY ARREENNN'T COMINGNNGNGN HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE NAWWWTTTTT TOOESSSS AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not until evening, at the earliest,\" Laura said in a voice thick with lust, \"Maybe then, one will remember you never made it to the tournament and come check up on you, but not a moment before, meaning...you are all mine for most of the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible despair washes over you. Its true. And there's nothing you can do about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, I'll bet I can arrange to tickle you even longer than that!\" Laura says, her voice perfectly evil.</span></div></div>",

Just submit!\" You tremble as you look at her. \"Never!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura beams as she stands up. Her beautiful naked body is on fully display. She opens her lips and finishes an incantation and all is momentarily silent. You begin to think perhaps the spell failed, but a sudden creaking under your bed fills you with unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crane your neck, looking over your shoulder at your bed and see a swarm of miniature, large breasted humanoids pouring forth, garbed in drab apparel, their greenish faces twisted into permanent masks of mischief: imps! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle pointlessly as you recall all you've heard about the tiny monsters; their appetite for trouble-making is insatiable whether it be tripping people up, or stealing small items, or - your eyes go wide with terror - tickling humans for their tears of laughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsters spread over your room, eyeing you with their evil long lashes, their tiny bodies dripping with arousal from their nether lips; you watch terrified and slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, to you anyway, the magic pinning you to the door relents and you drop to the floor with a thud, stunning you for fractions of a second, but that's all the time the imps need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura squeals with delight, clapping her hands together as the creatures nimbly wash over you in a blur of coiling laces and silk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura please, not this!\" You beg, feeling the imps drawing your feet up into a stringent hogtie. \"These things will be at it all night, I'll never survive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop that, you baby,\" Laura says, pouting. \"Imps have never tickled anyone to death ... that I'm aware of at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please it's too much! Can't I just be your equal girfriend?\" You become desperate as one of the imps on your back begins sliding one of your school ties down your face. \"Laura! Laura! Wait, I prmmMMmppphhh! Nrmmma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckles as the imp tugs the tie between your teeth and knots it tightly in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Kayla, I have no idea what you're saying.\" She teases. \"Any way I need to get to bed. It's late and we both have to be up for Elemental Magics class early in the morning. Let me know when you are ready to be my tickle slave and I will strap you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan at the thought of having to tackle EM, one of the hardest classes you have, with one of the sternest professors, after spending an entire night tickle tortured by imps! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll see you then!\" Laura chirps, bounding happily out of your dorm and closing the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle and strain hard, but the imps' restraints are unyielding! You feel several of the monsters weaving strings around your feet and toes, tying them into total immobility, which tickles something fierce in itself, eliciting wild, muffled laughter that only seems to drive the imps into a mirthful frenzy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the monsters begin in earnest: scores of agile little fingers savagely tickling the soles of your feet! You scream with laughter, and squirm feebly (as there's literally nothing else you can do), as the imps concentrate everything they have on your feet, whooping and hollering in a chorus of tiny voices. As your eyes fill with tears, an imp near your face daubs them with a small cloth, wringing it out into a little flask with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goes on for what seems like eternity, you laugh until you are hoarse and the room spins deliriously around you. The imps give you breaks every 20 minutes or so, but other than that, they tickle your feet all night long, filling several of their flasks with your tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the first light of dawn streams in through your window, the horrid little things relent for good, slapping you on the backside and thighs one-by-one, as they retreat back under the bed, returning to their own plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the little fiends don't bother to untie you! You're totally exhausted, after an entire night of sleepless tickling, and still soundly hogtied and class is about to start! You'll catch hell for being late, or missing class altogether, but you're so tired you almost don't even care at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you manage to loosen one of the knots binding your wrists after several determined minutes; if you work at it, you could be untied in under a half hour, you think. You'll be late for class, sure, but you may not miss it entirely!</span></div></div>",

You can hear Laura through her gag laugh mockingly at your floundering magical attempts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it!\" you reply, only to meet Laura's eyes, which were filled with a condesending glare. Eager to prove her wrong, you start to recall one particularily complex spell that you remember having unbinding in it's effects, so you rapidly call it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic instantly takes hold, your binds undoing themselves in an instant. \"Ha!

Ropes formed at both her ankles and wrists, first tying them both together, and then to the bedframe so she was stretched out. The gag had even remanifested in her mouth, as you could tell from her cries of frustration. However, within seconds of this process finishing on Laura, the exact same happened to you! You were also sent to your bed, wrists bound at one end and ankles at the other. As a gag manifested in your mouth as well, you recalled exactly what kind of spell you unleashed; while it did in fact unbind it's targets, it would also rebind them a few seconds later. It was developed in order to make tying a foe up in different positions easier. However, it could only target all bound targets in a room, as opposed to just one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBound tightly and literally right next to your arch rival, so close to each other you could lightly touch the sole of her foot with your own toe was not how you planned to spend your day.

Her blowjob technique is a bit hap hazard as she's only trying to satisfy you so that you don't stop, but it feels amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to working her clit with her toung causing her to humm out moans while she's sucking you off, that feels even more amazing. you love the feeling of having dominated your rival and making her suck you off. while you work on her with your toung you look up and get an evil idea, at the same time you eat her out you reach up and start tickling her feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe response is instant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMHMHMMH!\" with a pop she briefly removes your cock from her mouth and blurts out in one word....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oooh ticklemyfeetidon'tcare, do whateveryouwant!\" and she IMMEDIATELY starts sucking your cock again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou grin and start mercelously tickling her feet while your eat her out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she has to stop sucking you off in order to moan and groan (and giggle), but you don't care, you want to hear it and you increase the toung play and tickling as she gets closer to climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHFUCK! OHFUCKKEVIN!\" OHPLEZDON'TSTA... UUUUHUHUHUHU OHFUCK! OHMYFEE..OHIDON'TCARE DO WHATEVERYOU OOH OOH OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe RIDES your face as she has a massive orgasm! It seems to last forever until finally she's completely exhausted and can do nothing bu pant! You tickle her feet one last time, dismount her and stare at her. tied up, panting and defeated. you pat her belly and say \"Good Girl\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groans in half-hearted protest of your condisention but is too spent and still too much on cloud 9 to offer much resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't even notice your predicament!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy nightfall, both you and Laura are sweaty and sore and utterly exhausted. You nearly nod off but then you feel your gag loosen and vanish with a pop. Your wrist and ankle bindings quickly follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same goes for Laura as she slowly sits up, wincing and stretching. Your eyes meet, and although she looks completely worn out (just like you), there still seems to be a smoldering flame of intense anger in her dark eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to speak ...</span></div></div>",

Well, not really \"silent\", as you are currently laughing uncontrollably due to these two girls, tickling the sensitive soles of your feet.<br>\r\nRegardless, you hope that not answering yet might give you a few seconds to come up with a plan to get out of this ticklish situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Kelly asks you with a salacious tone in her voice, whilst using her index finger to scratch the incredibly soft skin in between your pinky and fourth toe.<br>\r\n\"There is no way around it. You have been a bitch and bitches get punished. Your only choice it to make it a <i>little</i> easier on you...\" She continues, now having moved to the space between your third and fourth toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Becky has almost entirely stopped tickling your other foot, apparently being too amazed by the sadistic handiwork of her partner in crime, to continue her part of the job.<br>\r\nThe only one more amazed at the tickling talent of Kelly however, seems to be Kelly herself, who doesn't seem to notice the little window of opportunity Becky has unknowingly opened for you.<br>\r\nShe is far too occupied with enjoying each and every second of playing the angel of revenge, punishing the stupid boy for his hubris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this rate, despite the masterful tickling currently done by Kelly, you should be able to free your other arm!<br>\r\nAnd you know just the right spell to cast, once your arm is free...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've just recently learned about this amazing bondage spell, that is capable of creating a ribbon out of thin air, that gets longer and longer, wrapping itself around the victim until the whole body, starting at the ankles and ending just below the nose, not only immobilizing but also silencing them, is covered by it only to then get hard as steel, making an escape impossible. Oh so impossible...<br>\r\nYou know that since the spell backfired the first time you tried it, leaving you helplessly lying on your belly in your bed with your feet resting on the slightly raised foot-board, waiting for someone to find and rescue you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person who did, of course, was Laura, who obviously didn't consider rescuing for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she watched you for a few seconds, analysing the situation and then, without saying a word slowly walking to your desk, taking your chair and carrying it to the foot of your bed, then returning to the desk and taking the writing feather on it as well, putting it behind her ear, for later use...<br>\r\nThe pure horror you felt back then was indescribable. She sat down and started to untie your shoes. The ribbon, now as hard as concrete didn't allow you to wiggle much, so you just had to lie there and endure it. Once both shoes were off, you heard Laura, who still hadn't said a word, sniff your feet and then uttering a disgusted, yet very quiet \"eew...\", implying that your feet had an unpleasant scent to them. A lie (probably) to humiliate you even further, you thought at first, but there was more to it as it turned out. <br>\r\nShe walked out of the room, just leaving you there, helpless and now barefoot, alone with your thoughts. Were your feet really that stinky, that even Laura didn't want to tickle them? Something to keep in mind you thought to yourself, when the door opened once more...<br>\r\nEntering was Laura of course.<br>\r\nIn her left hand... A bucket. In her right hand... An awfully tickly looking bath brush. Behind her ear.. The feather still, but that one didn't worry you anymore. It was the brush that caught 100% of your horrified attention. She wouldn't do that, would she?<br>\r\nYour feet didn't smell (probably) she was just toying with you, making up a reason to run that brush up and down your sole and up and down and up and down, all whilst not saying a single word.<br>\r\nA few minutes that felt like months later, she had another deviant idea. She---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up!\" Kelly shouts, interrupting your though process and now tickling the arch of your foot with all five fingers<br>\r\n\"You little bitch had your chance and now it's torture time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the new intensity of the tickling there was no way you could free your arm now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Torture time, bitch!\" Becky repeated after her, excitedly clapping her hands, obviously eager to help make you suffer an extended tickle torture with her seemingly now best friend. You---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClapping her hands?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arm is free and no one seems to notice!

In a flash, your mouth is filled with what feels like yards of ancient bandaging. You've miscast the gagging spell on yourself! Why did you rush?! All the professors constantly make a point that keeping a level head can be even more important than keeping a big spell book. You pry at the mouth-filling gag, but the powerful magic keeps it firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stumble back, battling the gag, Laura finishes her intricate spell. Your cotton night shirt slides up your body with an irresistible strength, forcing your arms up over your head. Once the bottom of the shirt clears your armpits, it begins to constrict, pinning your arms helplessly to the sides of your head! With the shirt tight over your arms and face, and the gag in your mouth, your breathing is ragged and difficult, and you're effectively blindfolded!  You struggle around on the floor as Laura quietly giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A much better wizard indeed,\" she says. \"Let's put a stop to all that pathetic floundering, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mmph desperately as your rival Laura begins to chant what sounds like the same spell as before, but in a lower timbre. Your blood chills as you feel your night shorts slide down your kicking legs, stopping over your ankles with that same constrictive force as your shirt! Great, now you're fully exposed and gagged alone in a room with a magically gifted sociopath! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's giggling turns to sinister laughter as you anxiously attempt to roll over onto your stomach with all the skill and efficiency of a floundering fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are pathetic,\" Laura scoffs. \"Lucky for you, I've got better things to do than watch you flop around in your birthday suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt and struggle blindly, wriggling onto your stomach in an attempt to hide your most ticklish spots from your sadistic tormentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Ever Silent Gag should wear off in two or three hours, and the constriction spells should fade before that. Which should give you enough time to rest a bit before the tournament. See you then,\" she hisses, as her footsteps retreat to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief as you hear her leave. You don't know how much rest you'll get bound up like this on the hard stone floor, but you're thankful for the mercy. Maybe Laura's not as bad as you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Laura says, halting near your door, \"I nearly forgot. Here's a little spell I've been working on recently, Relentless Phantom Fingers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENNNNN, MPHG, ENNNNNN!\" you shout into your gag, struggling to press your armpits and chest to the floor and balling your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura finishes her strange chanting and leaves the room, closing the door behind her. For a moment, all is stillness. Then, almost imperceptibly, like a breath of wind, you feel a finger over the sole of your right foot. You jerk your leg back, but at the same time what feels like two other hands dig into your inner thighs, right below you bum. You scream laughter into your gag as still more hands seek out your most ticklish spots! You roll back and forth in a frenzy as what feels like thousands of fingers needle between your wriggling toes, jab into your exposed armpits and feet, swim impishly between your legs and over your stiff and increasingly sensitive nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou buck and squirm violently, your agonized laughter muffled by the huge gag aching your jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was the most flamboyant of the four, he could also perform magic without saying or doing anything, save for snapping his fingers.

I'm completely naked!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't completely naked\" He responds \"You just don't have a shirt on\".

All she can do is stand there with her hands clasped behind her head and take it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly and methodically works her armpits like he's massaging shoulders, this is way more than Laura can take and she quickly beings begging and laughing hysterically!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam completely ignores her and changes tactics, resorting to lightly raking his nails up and down her pits like he was playing the guitar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura degenerates into silent laughter but she has no choice but to keep her armpits on display so long as she's wearing the collar. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nEventually he stops, and after she catches her breath, he says \"Okay so your armpits are your worst spot, what else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndespite her self she repeats her mantra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\" he says \"I can't really get to your feet....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly send instructions to the spectral collar and you see Laura lay on her stomach with her knees bent, her bare feet pointed up toward the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keven! I'm going to kill you for this! My armpits are my worst spot! my feet are my second worst....AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam starts playing with her feet which she holds completely still for him. Again, it's more reminiscent of a massage, but it tickles unbearably! After a few moments of silent laughter she takes in a deep breath and blurts out a plea for mercy as if it were all one word...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noplzdontplaywithmyfeet!...\" She screams the cutest little giggle of a scream you've ever heard! Adam begins lightly rubbing her toes with both hands! Laura is in completely silent laughter but you can tell this is the worst torture she can imagine! Adam just grins as he gently... almost sensually rubs her soft toes. Tears stream down your rivals face but she has no choice to hold her feet up and take it. Finally he starts raking his fingers up and down her bare feet, again like he's playing the guitar, he even inflicts extra humiliation by holding her leg like it 'is' a guitar and strumming away on her feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he's finished the collar makes her stand up and face the door again, all the while she's babbling incoherently for adam not to tickle her feet again! Looks like adam might have make her feet even worse than her armpits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\" Adam replies \"Since you mentioned it, I might just have to give your feet some extra attention later but for right now... what did you say your other weak spot was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reply makes you smile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin please I'll do anything!

Uh oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel as if the whole world lurches inside-out as the world goes dark! You have the sensation of tumbling as the deep laughter echoes all around you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your senses return you realize you are in some dark and dank cavern, hanging from your wrists with your ankles manacled and bolted to the unseen floor below. Laura is in the same predicament, facing you,10 feet away. She struggles  and strains against the cold iron of the manacles. A soft phosphorescent glow from somewhere overhead illuminates naked body. Her hard nipples jut from her quivering breasts and the hard V of her pubic hair thrusts defiantly as she fights the chains that bind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done, you idiot?!\" She shouts, writhing, suspended in her bondage. \"Where are we?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang, dumbfounded, as a booming voice fills the cavern. \"You are in my Realm, little mages. The Realm of Astrenax, the Punisher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder as a huge six-armed figure rises up from the void between you and Laura. It's face cunning and malicious in the dark glow of the cavern. Several snake-like tongues writhe in its smiling mouth between rows of pointed teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This dimension exists for the torment of evil wizards who have transgressed against the Academy!\" Boomed the voice of the six-armed beast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't evil!\" shouts Laura, flailing in her chains, her pert breasts heaving. \"This fool ported us here accidentally!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant beast hisses and turns its heads towards you, smiling. \"Meddling with magics one doesn't understand ... IS a transgression.\" it says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod from the creature your clothing vanishes and you are hanging, completely naked, flailing in your bonds just like Laura!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to business,\" purrs Astrenax, as stiff feathers grow from each of his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" Shouts Laura as three of the hands arrow toward her, seeking out her most ticklish spots. She screams desperately as the the feathers dance evilly over her nipples, into her armpits, over her wriggling toes, and between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same instant, the other three hands go for you! Feathers attack your feet and nipples, running over your armpits and stomach. You writhe and scream as they torture the shaft of your stiffening cock. The creature notices this and sadistically concentrates on that area, laughing evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder and buck in the jangling, cold iron chains, screaming fits of laughter as the beast tickles rock-hard member. Through the tears, you see Laura being worked over as well, the feathers of one hand teasing between her thighs while the other two hands dart over her helpless armpits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the screams of laughter that echo through the interminable cavern you hear the voice of your tormentor, \"C'thaulghauhg ach gl'inthauglhag. Say these words and I will end your torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'HAHAHAHAHA, NNN-NNN-NOOOOO! Don't! It's a trap!\" Shouts Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough your bleary vision you see Astrenax whip his head to face you, smiling. The feathers attacking your cock, slide down the shaft, between your legs, ringing around your incredibly sensitive ass. You scream and jerk! You may die from laughing!</span></div></div>",

Then everything goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are awoken by a multitude of screams and laughter and desperate pleading. As your eyes adjust to the darkness you are gripped by horror! You are in a cavern of unimaginable dimensions, and everywhere you see grotesque and monstrous creatures torturing a multitude of men and women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nude, darkly complected woman dangles helplessly over a pit, her wrists overhead in manacles and her large feet in weighted irons, she screams desperately, her body covered in a sheen of sweat as countless tongues from the pit dart over her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo men your age are bound hand and foot in iron stocks as impish creatures tickle their rope-clad penises, bright and swollen, aching for release. The two face each other, screaming wide-eyed into their giant, black gags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pale, muscular man is bound by chains, stretched out on his stomach, while two vulture-like monsters scratch strange runes into the soles of his feet with feather pens. He writhes, laughing breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA train of women and men, in carts on their backs, with their wrists bound to their ankles and their feet in the air, move dolorously past on the whining rails. The huge metallic gags that fill their mouths allow nothing more than languishing groans and tags, outlining their most sensitive spots and the duration they should be tickled, flutter from their toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance you see Laura on a ledge, severely hogtied, her wrists bound directly to her ankles in rough rope. A monstrous beast sits behind her with its tongue darting feverishly over her feet and between her toes. Between bouts of gag-muffled screams and laughter she stares daggers at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang in chains horizontally.Naked, your arms and legs spread eagle, stretched to their limit, beads of sweat drip from your straining body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate being the puppet of wizards,\" laments a deep voice from behind you. \"I love tickle torturing you mortals, but it's only ever for a few hours at a time,\" said Astrenax, walking up beside you, running two of his hands down your back as you shudder. \"But I found a little loophole. That's what this dimension is,\" he said, motioning with his hands to the various scenes of young wizards being relentlessly tortured by all sorts of creatures and devices. \"Each time you fools renounce the material world for this world by chanting  'C'thaulghauhg ach gl'inthauglhag', you are bound here, and I grow more powerful.\" The agonized screams of thousands of other poor wizards and wizardesses punctuate this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my little tickle slave,\" laughs Astrenax, \"here is my thanks to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel a cold and slimy tendril against your thigh. Looking below you, you see a large amorphous creature with hundreds of tentacles lashing and swaying on it's back. Several of the smaller tentacles begin tickling over your belly and chest, flicking at your nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are filled with dread, and through your rising laughter, breathlessly you plead, \"Wait, wait! Awhhahahwahnnngh, ngh, wait! I promise, I'll -\" as one of the beasts' tentacles dives into your open mouth! You gag reflexively as it begins to swell and pulse, reducing your words to muffled nothings. More of the vile tentacles slide into your exposed armpits and toy evilly with your hard nipples. Other tendrils flick and slide over your aching penis. The stimulation is enough to knock you unconscious, but you remain awake! Your head swims as you writhe and scream. Another tentacle slides effortlessly into your butt, while still others tease around your thighs and asshole. Your vision swims and you jerk and convulse desperately against the tentacular onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shouts and pleading of other tormented students of magic fill your ears as you are mercilessly tickled by this aberration. The slow laughter of Astrenax receding into the darkness lets you know that you will never leave this place, and you will never have rest ...</span></div></div>",

As the bush is so small, it takes the whole 10 minutes to coat your feet in oil. You\u2019re a giggling mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo my little tickle victim! Are those cute NAKED FEET of yours ready for fun!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura,\u201d you wail, pleading with your captor. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this, I know what I did and I\u2019m sorry. I really am. I\u2019ll do anything you say, please let me out!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet ready, Sweety,\u201d Laura purrs, adopting a mocking, teasing tone. \u201cHere come the magic fingers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins slowly playing with the bottoms of your feet, gently flicking her long index fingernail against your arches and wriggling along your toes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel Laura\u2019s nails flitter and scribble over the bottoms of your feet like hyperactive spiders. They barely graze the skin, just enough to tickle like the very devil! You instantly howl with laughter, your toes curling up reflexively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! OH GOD!! OH GOD!! OH GOD!!! OH, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTickle, tickle, tickle,\u201d Laura teases, in a high singsong voice. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna break sooner or later, bitch, you know it and I know it. The only thing you have any control over is, when? Tickle tickle tick-ull!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe position of your bondage makes it impossible to bend your knees, or move your feet in any way but the slightest wiggle. Laura keeps up a non-stop assault of your feet, sending electric surges of tickling sensation through you. All you can do is laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s wriggling nail-tips work ferociously on your foot-nerves. She targets underneath the ball of your foot and the tender flesh underneath your toes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Laura begins using her mouth to tickle your feet. She nibbles along your arch, around the ball of your foot and under your toes. She then slides her tongue in between your toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! AHHH! Y-YOU B-BITCH HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! EEEHEEHEEHEEHAHAHA!! S-STOP THAT ON MY TOES!!\u201d you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness,\u201d Laura sneers, not letting up on the ticklish torture even for a instant. \u201cSuch naughty language for such a sweet boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you find it difficult to struggle as you're sapped of energy from all the laughing! You begin shaking all over, laughing constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to believe how intense the tickling of Laura\u2019s tongue was, or how humiliating. You have no idea how long his torture will last. You think you might faint as Laura alternates between wriggling fingers and torturous nibbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, you feel real pressure from your abdomen, as the tickling threatens to cause you to lose control of your bladder. You remember studying this in class - \"Urge incontinence\". The tickling was affecting your nervous system so much you were losing control of your bladder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura please...I need to pee!\" you warn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she respond, \"You really are pathetic! Well that'll really teach you not to mess with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismounting, she grabs your desk chair and faces your feet. \"NO....pleeaase...\" you beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura begins wriggling her fingers up and down your soles. She tickles around your heels, along your taut arch and under the ball of your foot. She allows herself a sinister giggle as she returns to the most ticklish spot; the soft flesh just below your toes. With one hand, she pulls back your toes, exposing the area. With the other, she wriggles her fingers intensely, rapidly gliding each nail across the vulnerable flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twist this way and that, pleading for relief. Your constant giggling is punctuated by shrieks and silent laughter. It is utter ticklish agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahaha!\" you laugh, as you arch your back and tense your abs to hold the pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKootchy-kootchy-koo!\u201d Laura cooes, as she rotates her fingertips in between your tender toes, lightly pinches your heels, scratches lightly at the ball of your foot and clawes along your arches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the piss gushes from your penis, pouring all over your belly and bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughs evilly, a glint in sadistic eyes. She brings her face close to yours and whispers \"Who owns you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do.\" you whisper back, feeling completely spent and utterly humiliated.</span></div></div>",

The black wooden wand ends in a spray of bright red feathers: stiff feathers at the center, and fluffier examples around the edge. Not only does the duster look perfect, you also feel a deep connection to it. If Laura wasn't totally compliant right now, you realize it would be mortifying for her to see this. What an odd feeling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Laura says from the bed, propped up on her elbows to peer at your duster. She seems interested and more than a little enticed. You'd never given much credit to the theory that opposites attract, but maybe it's true. You're more than willing to find out, circumstances what they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a solid exclamation point of arousal digging into the side of your leg (you're glad to find the manifestation of your libido as a physical object doesn't affect its typical internal operating), you begin dusting Laura's soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura starts laughing at once, but makes no effort to pull her feet away. In fact, she's wiggling her toes in a distinctly amorous fashion, enjoying the tickling. The more energetically you feather her feet, the more frantically she wiggles her feet and toes about. You let out a choked gasp of intense passion, which would have had Laura in stitches if she was in her usual frame of mind. Except Laura's lying there, eyes closed, with something between a wince and a smile on her face. It's the most intriguing expression you've ever seen from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to pause for a moment, because you're getting so horny yourself that it's starting to hurt. Perhaps it's some sort of feedback loop, or an expected consequence of the embodiment of your desire being in direct contact with a pair of ticklish feet. Laura apparently needed a rest as well, her face extremely red as she gasps - and not entirely from ticklishness. The flush spreads down under her t-shirt, and you realize she's as aroused as you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder which of us will break first?\" you ask her, feeling this could turn into a very strange variety of tickling tournament. The urge to drop your duster and hop into bed with Laura is strong, but not overwhelming. You'd prefer snapping her with a thorough tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it really matter?\" she responds, before doing a very Laura-like thing and scooting down the bed a bit to try and press at your crotch with her right foot. <i>That</i> would have brought you off at one touch, but you dodged! Under the submission spell and simmering hormones, she's still Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah?!\" you shout, going back to work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Continuing your feathering of Laura's feet, there's now the added spice of competition. In half a minute, you're both back where you left off, flushed and breathing heavily - though Laura's a little more winded than you are since she's still laughing with ticklishness, no matter how excited your feather duster is getting her in other departments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you reach a point of equilibrium. You're both gritting your teeth, trying not to give in to the overwhelming pleasure. You've been shifting the duster between Laura's soles, ankles, and the tops of her feet, which has left you as much on the edge as her. She's got double fistfuls of bedspread and an expression bordering agony, biting her lower lip between all the gasps and giggles. How best to push her over?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitchie kitchie koo, Laura!\" you say, with sudden inspiration. \"Tickle, tickle! Who's a ticklish arch rival? Who likes to sneak around barefoot and peep through keyholes until she gets caught and tickled senseless?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue with the verbal teasing, and you can see it's sapping Laura's resolve. She's actually trying to pull her feet away now, though not very effectively. You experimentally change tactics, getting off the teasing about her ticklish vulnerability and instead paying a few compliments as to how cute she is in her helplessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackpot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unnnngg<i>GHHH</i>!!!\" Laura manages to get out, sounding as though she's been dealt a mortal shock. She curls up, gasps several times, and then splays out on your bed, squirming around in the ecstasy she at last couldn't help surrendering to. <i>This</i> unmistakably sincere bout of rapture leaves you with your duster dangling, feeling your blood pounding in your temples. And other places. You're rooted to the spot, mesmerized as Laura writhes with pleasure in your bedclothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn half a minute, she's pulled herself together somewhat and doesn't seem at all miffed with this turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>That</b> was...\" Laura starts to say, gleeful at having survived the spasm of delight. She breaks off at once, eyes wide in amazement, and squeaks with a mixture of dread and anticipation. Having sat up, she now flops back down and resumes her earlier performance . . . with a lot more squealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo <i>this</i> is how it is for girls! You keep playing statue for several minutes as Laura continues on the roller coaster of bliss, complete with whimpers, a whispered mantra of \"omigod!\", and the occasional shout of astonishment as she discovers her own capacities. There are evident peaks and valleys in her experience, which seems sort of unfair. You only get one trip to the top, and then it's all downhill! On the subject of which, you're feeling the need to relieve some pressure yourself, and watching Laura's gymnastics isn't helping. Then you start worrying that someone will hear her from the hallway (it seems impossible they haven't already), and then she's apparently back on terra firma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid to get up!\" she tells you, looking extremely pleased with herself. Her forehead's damp with sweat and her hands are at her belly in an almost defensive gesture, but she's wiggling her feet around contentedly and favoring you with a wrung-out grin. It must have been exhausting, having that much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think I did all that just by tickling your feet,\" you tell her, grinning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mellow mood evaporates instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are <b><i>so</i></b> vile!!\" she shouts at you, launching out of your bed and stomping for the door. Is she genuinely offended, or did the submission spell just now wear off and make her despise you for what she'd been through while under its effect? She scowls furiously at you as she steps past, then spins on a bare heel and makes a grab for your head, pulling you in for a bruising kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" you complain at the forcefulness, though it wasn't all that bad. You couldn't have imagined <i>this</i> happening when you woke up today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're still considering this development, Laura shoves you back onto your bed and hops back on herself, standing to tower over you. Thinking you're about to get your guts stomped out, you tense as she brings her foot down and . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Unnnngg</i>GHHH!!!\" you grunt, feeling your eyeballs bulge with the release. You grab Laura's ankle and push against the sole of her offending/merciful foot, but she just laughs and doesn't try to yank away. She laughs maybe a little too much for your liking, but then that's Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last touch!\" she says teasingly, flicking you on the head with a finger before she walks out. You glance up long enough to confirm there's no tittering crowd in the hallway, and then she's slammed the door. You dropped your feather duster when Laura pushed you onto the bed, and you see it's starting to fade away as you make a futile grab for it. OK, that's something to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you toddle off to the ensuite for a freshen-up, but decide to leave the bed in disarray as a sort of trophy; against all expectations, your little encounter with Laura really hit the spot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressing question might be, \"Is Laura still my arch rival or . . . something else?\", but you get around it by pursuing another question entirely.</span></div></div>",

You spend a second hoping it won't matter, and that your intent will take precedence over the raw mechanics of magical phraseology. You realize you've been hoping that a lot lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What</i> am I not going to believe?\" Laura asks, and then jumps as a glove pops into existence on the floor next to your bed. It's one of those fancy opera gloves, long enough to cover a lady's entire arm, made out of something soft and shiny, probably silk. It's an intense shade of red, and it's also twitching a little. Uh oh . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the thing seems to break Laura out of her submissive lie-down. She looks between you and the glove with dawning horror, grabbing it up and shrieking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your <b><i>filthy</i></b> eyes off of it!!\" Laura snarls at you, looking like she's soon going to start throwing punches. She's got the glove pressed tight to her chest, trying to hide it. You notice the glove seems to be twitching around even more now that she's holding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, hang on, what's the problem?!\" you say, hands out. \"Look, I just messed up a spell, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As usual!\" Laura says, sneering. She's curious, all the same. \"Which spell? No, don't try to show me, you idiot, it's <i>your</i> spell book, not mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sheepishly put the book back down and give a basic description of the spell you just flubbed. Laura's got you uptight, waiting to be tickled one minute and then ready to clobber you the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she says, seeming to understand. \"Right. Well, I guess I <i>wouldn't</i> want you looking at that, would I? It feels very personal. I suppose <i>you</i> wouldn't mind waving around an avatar of your sex drive, but then you're a disgusting boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a nice color,\" you say, at a loss for a stronger compliment. The truth is, you don't mind looking at Laura's glove at all. It seems to put your innards on a roil, though you won't tell her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's electric crimson,\" Laura says, looking down at the animate glove. \"A twenty-button righty. That's some quality silk, too . . . weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura makes a face, realizing what she's critiquing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, I mean, of <i>course</i> it's quality, what else?!\" Now she's showing you the glove defiantly while still looking shy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks really fancy,\" you say to her, seeing she won't take any teasing about the glove. \"Why not put it on?\" You wish she would, because the thing looks like it wants to make your acquaintance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna put it on <b>you</b>,\" Laura says, looking as though she expects someone to burst in and tell her how naughty she's being. Once she gets comfortable with the idea, she hits you with a smoldery smile you could have done without. \"Hey, come shake hands with my glove!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass,\" you tell her, backing toward the door. You take one look at that glove, fingers wiggling with menace, and know you're not going to escape.</span></div></div>",

As you're reaching up to fumble at the door latch, you feel something snug around your ankles, cinching tight. Looking back over your shoulder, you see the glove's used its trailing end to bind you up and is now 'walking' its fingers back toward your bed, dragging you with it. You try clawing the floor to hold your ground, but your own digits aren't up to the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme go!\" you yell, making a grab for Laura as you're dragged past her. She laughs and jumps out of reach, and the glove arrives at your bed. It shoots forward and coils around a foot on the bed frame, further binding your own feet up in looped lengths of silk. Is the glove getting <i>longer</i>? It has to be, to tie you up in itself this way. You try yanking and kicking loose, but Laura jumps onto your bed to hold it steady. After wearing yourself out with this useless maneuver, you lay on your belly and catch your breath. It's not long before you feel silk fingers undoing your shoelaces, the casual precision aimed to titillate - on which count it succeeds, making you glad you're on your stomach. You don't need Laura to see the tent you'd otherwise be pitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning your head around, you see Laura's on your bed, mirroring your position with her feet kicked up behind her. You'd been expecting plenty of teasing over your predicament, but she seems entranced with the methodically erotic baring of your feet. You don't think she's a closet foot fetishist, so maybe she's getting some sort of kinky echo back from the glove. What does <i>that</i> feel like? If only you'd gotten the words right on the spell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you feel cool air and silk fingertips tracing along your feet. It tickles a little, but you know that's incidental; the glove's just probing for sensitivity. You don't want to let Laura know it's getting to you, but you can't help squirming around, trying to look annoyed rather than stirred up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept once the glove starts tickling, you let out a stupid yodel that no one with a brain could accept as a reaction of pure ticklishness. You hear Laura laugh a little at this, but it sounds breathy and distracted. She's tickled you plenty of times before, with magic and with her own hands, but she's never sounded like that. Where's the contempt of her rivalry gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thread of thought is lucky to slip unscorched through the overheated loom of your head. It's bad enough to deal with the standard sensations of being tickled, but the added tension of becoming progressively more turned on with each touch of the glove's silk fingers makes you feel like snapping. Add in the distant awareness of Laura knowing exactly what's happening and getting worked up about it herself . . . it's too much input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oooh</i>, stop, stop!!\" Laura commands her glove. Fortunately, it listens to her and gives you a break - both of you, by the looks of Laura. You catch your breath and enjoy her conspicuous discomposure. She's well aware of what's going on, but clearly hadn't expected this much fallout from rapport with her libidinal proxy. Despite being in no position for it, you can't help having a good chuckle at her expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you shut up!\" Laura snaps at you, getting off your bed and pacing around you, looking as though she's not sure how to proceed. \"Leave off with his feet, I've had enough of that. Try for his belly instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet are suddenly free, but Laura plops down on the small of your back, straddling you and preventing any attempt at slithering away. You groan for form's sake, but it's nicer than you would have expected to have Laura sitting on you. She seems more ambivalent about it, but fascination's winning out over aversion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Laura's glove has decided the easiest route bellyward, given your position, is straight up your right pantleg. The feel of silk running up your leg in one determined pulse marks the limit of your endurance, and that's that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrrcch!\" you comment, quite involuntarily, despite your attempt to stifle the embarrassing grunt. Your buck your hips (just as involuntarily), which Laura mistakes as an escape attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hrrcch!</i>,\" she says back in mockery. \"I'll 'hrrcch' you if you try making another break for it . . . Herkimer. I think that's your new name. Sit still and take your medi . . . what the . . . omi<b><i>god</i></b>!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're feeling a little drained, but it's still hilarious. Laura jumps off of you at once, and then starts trying to wipe away the phantasmal feel of whatever's on her hand onto your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S REVOLTING!!!\" she shouts down at you, seeing you're trying to hold back a laugh. She's still trying to clean off her perfectly clean hand when you feel the glove becoming insubstantial. Maybe Laura was so grossed out that it terminated the spell? You suggest as much, which puts the brakes on her freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" she says, still looking at her hand. \"Eww, it was all hot and . . . <b>ick</b>.\" She stands there looking at you with her face twisted up, trying to cram the ordeal into the appropriate mental slot. \"Nasty. And what do <i>I</i> get out of it, <b><i>Herkimer</i></b>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a fair question, and you feel a sudden kick of gallantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could try the spell again. I think I can get it right this time, and <i>then</i> . . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you'd just ruin it,\" Laura says, cutting off your eager plan of action. \"You ruin everything. I'll manage on my own.\" Giving you a complex look of consideration and resentment, she moves for the door, stepping out and slamming it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to just as quickly open it back up, poking her head in and scowling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so gross,\" she says conversationally, getting one last look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll owe you one, how's that?\" you ask. But she's still got that complicated look on her face and won't be cajoled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freak. Freak, freak, freak, freak. Freak forever, Herkimer, no redemption.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had the final word, she slams the door again and stays gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repair to the bathroom to address the aftermath, wondering when you'll next have the courage to try that spell.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You open the door and find it's Becky. You don't often see her without Kelly, so you wonder what she's up to. Has word about your most recent spellwork already gotten around? You can't believe Laura would have volunteered <i>that</i> information so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Becky says, looking around a little nervously. Maybe she's afraid someone will see her visiting you alone; Becky's nowhere near as brazen as Laura. \"Do you want to go to the library with me? I heard a rumor they released some rare stuff from the closed stacks, if you know where to look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet!\" you tell her, grabbing your pack and locking the door behind you. You're always up for a look at 'declassified' material, because you never know what's going to give you an edge in a tickle competition. Plus, all the library staff like Becky because she's naturally quiet and not a nuisance, so she can smooth the way for a more aggressive sort like yourself who's on the prowl for rarities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere aren't a crush of people in the halls today, so it's a quick walk to the stairs and then across the cloister to the library's north entrance. You get a cursory glance from the girl at the circulation desk and then follow Becky, who seems to know where she's going. There are plenty of short, parallel shelves and wire book racks here, the north end being the 'kiddy' end of the library sporting more fiction than reference titles. The middle of this section has carrel desks arranged in a large U shape with four reading tables at the center, the latter hidden from view of the librarian girl you just passed. There's laughter coming from many different directions, but it always sounds smothered in here; magical baffles liberally scattered in the aisles maintain a low noise level despite the laughing and shrieking going on in the maze of shelving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask her,\" said Becky, indicating the girl holding court at the table. You can see Becky's smirking, but you're not bothered by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia Amanda Boncaro. Affectionately \"Checkers\" to you (once), \"Bonkers\" to pretty much everyone else. The star student of anti-tickle magic in your school (and perhaps in the school's history), credits enough for an honorary M.Ma in countercraft . . . and held back from university placement because she refuses to tickle anyone. She has straight, short black hair (always immaculately combed) that's parted in the middle and grown precisely long enough to cover her ears. Dark green eyes that radiate blase indifference, never surprised by anything. An adherence to the dress code that would be annoyingly fastidious if not for the fact that her footwear consists exclusively of bright yellow over-the-knee socks. She's actually a year younger than you are, kicked up a level for precocity before everyone found out she was nuts. You'd had a monster crush on her a couple of years back, which she'd indulged enthusiastically, but it wasn't meant to be. \"Just friends\" had worked out all right for both of you. OK, so an untickleable girlfriend wasn't your thing, even though she'd let her guard down a few times. Hmm. You bet if it had been Cindy instead of Laura in your room a half-hour ago . . . that things would have gone even more disastrously wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, under the gaze of your bittersweet ex-bf's eye, a couple of first years are attempting to retire the mystique of Cindy Killjoy; a pair of gingers, probably brother and sister, the girl with plaits working Cindy's right foot and the freckled boy delving into her left armpit. Cindy sits holding a very old issue of The Modern Etheric inverted in her right hand, looking for secret signs from past masters that bolster her kooky worldview. None of the three have noticed Becky and yourself peering around the edge of a carrel yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickling is too narrow a focus for something as omniprevalent as magic,\" Cindy tells the young redheads, frowning slightly as though in deep thought over something she's seen in the magazine. \"A non-physical implementation of will to restructure reality, and we use that power to tickle one another. We should be ashamed of ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then <i>why</i> are you here?\" the girl asks, a noodle of pink energy extending from her index finger and wrapping around Cindy's foot. Zero response from Cindy, but the sock reveals a quick scroll of response, inky runes chasing across the yellow fabric before vanishing. Ginger braids is intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To improve my skills, the better to defend the magically challenged from domination by unscrupulous tickling sorcerors,\" Cindy says, and the kids both laugh. One of Cindy's stock responses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the sock off, then,\" the boy says, sick of spidering his fingers on belly and ribs. You admire him for trying to tickle Cindy without magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy promptly peels off her right sock, and you see she still doesn't use nail polish. Something quaint about that. The ginger twins pry her toes apart at once and try sawing a couple of 'plasmatic plumes back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's eyes grow round as she reluctantly snorts and then starts to giggle. She puts down her periodical and points at this between-the-toes attack with an expression of stunned disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HahahaHAHAHAHA!!!\" Cindy cries out, getting an equally stunned expression from her 'tormentors.' \"STOPSTOP<b><i>STOP</i></b> illdoanythingquitit <i>PLEAHEEHEEHEEASE</i>!!!\" Both hands fly to the arms of her chair, knuckles whitening as she tries to brace herself against the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not even trying to move her foot,\" braids says to her brother in an angry mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sorry,\" Cindy says, instantly dropping the act. \"But it was a valid attempt, and I do offer my 'Strategies in Agargaletics' pamphlet at a reduced rate to first years, so think it over and track me down if you ever get tired of being tickled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just . . . <i>boring</i>,\" the brother says, giving Cindy a dark look as she's pulling her sock back on. He and his sister stalk off, young egos wounded, and Cindy goes back to reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can <i>feel</i> you looking at me, Kevin,\" she says, so you step into view with Becky, both of you taking a seat opposite the unticklish phenom. \"And the only thing that dynamited you out of your spellbook or the arena was gossip about restricted matter floating about. Though you haven't heard any specifics yet, and you want more details.\" She puts the magazine down again and smiles at you, which means she'll probably help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you <i>know</i> anything specific?\" you ask. \"I've already picked up a strong combo today, so crawling all over the library looking for something iffy isn't real appealing. If you're interested, I'd really rather get your help as a practice partner.\" Now that she's right in front of you, the possibility of having Cindy in genuine ticklish distress has captured your interest. You've been down this disappointing road many times before, but you think the eroto-tickler spell would crack Cindy's defenses. Assuming you can get it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rain check,\" Cindy says, giving you a look from the corner of her eye. \"Anyway, I promised to help Becky with defense so, time permitting, I'm taken. And what I'm specifically looking for is a suppressed treatise of Ibn al-Haytham dealing with noumenal perception, which I know is in here somewhere. What <i>you're</i> going to be interested in is a fragment from the Tractatus of Primm that supposedly allows for near-total reality dictation in a limited personal space, meaning you can turn your room into the tickling seraglio of your dreams! Of course, even if we find what we're looking for, we're probably not going to be able to understand it, much less make use of it. But I can tell by the stars in your eyes, Kevin, that you're imagining every girl who breaks the plane of your door getting instantly outfitted in a genie costume, so I've lost you already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you say, distracted. You were just having a nice daydream, and Cindy does have a tendency to drone on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I want, then?\" Becky asks, thinking she's getting sidelined in this quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want . . . \" Cindy says, pausing to consider. \"<i>You</i> want to know if there are any unofficial sequels to the Golicati Girls books you still secretly read, and there are - and one of them's hidden right over here, because I just got done with it a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky squeals with delight, following Cindy over to the wire racks as they both chatter about guilty pleasures. You're left sitting to make a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to hang out, liking the sound of the cracked prim thing that Cindy had mentioned, whatever that is. Cindy and Becky soon return, still engaged in happy tittle-tattle about the ticklish adventures of some dumb chicks in an equally dumb series of chicks' books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Cindy, about the important stuff . . . \" you begin, but she just nods and sits back down. Becky immediately opens her paperback (#11, 'Pass your Dreadtime', which apparently keeps the G Girls in pjs throughout if the cover art's to be trusted) and zones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an angle,\" Cindy tells you. \"I've been watching the newest crop of first years pretty closely, since most of them pass through here at some point. In fact, some of them are <i>arriving</i> in the library and mixing in, given the sorry state of administrative records after that fiasco last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, 'arriving here'?\" you ask Cindy, too familiar with her strange theories not to know one when you hear it. \"First years always come over on pedalos, dodge tentacular things in the lake, try to swim to shore if they go overboard, all that. It's a riot! Strike that, it's a rite of passage. They don't just wink into existence inside the library, where's the fun in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>These</i> newbies are from outside,\" Cindy says, with a wink that suggests she won't be elaborating further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's an unbroken row of bookcases directly ahead of the carrels, acting as a wall, but it fronts a corridor that anyone venturing into the north section of the library is obliged to pass through. Cindy's waiting and watching, and you finally get sick of looking over your shoulder, getting up to take a seat on the other side of the table with the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here she is,\" Cindy says, and you roll your eyes. Her?! \"Desi, <i>pssst</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesi must certainly be one of Cindy's \"outsiders,\" because the poor kid's too homely to be a local. She wears glasses that are too big for her face, has braces <b>with</b> orthodontic headgear, and apparently fell out of the wrong side of the ginger tree: her dark, coppery hair is styled into mismatched pigtails, each stabbing out at their own peculiar angle, and it looks like she used her face to stop a couple of shells loaded with double-ought freckles - was, in fact, probably kissing the barrel at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Train's a-<i>comin</i>', whoo <b>whooooo</b>!\" you say, unable to help yourself. Desi ignores it, but Cindy and Becky both give you dark looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy, it's really working!\" Desi the red menace says, indicating a charm bracelet on her left wrist. She puts down the stack of books she's carrying and flops down in the chair you just vacated, eyes wide in hero worship. Cindy inspiring that reaction from anyone seems all wrong to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember to work on your laugh, and try to be a little more spastic when you're struggling,\" says Cindy. Great, Cindy's got another convert. Not that you'd want to tickle <i>this</i> kid, ever, no pending miracle of puberty capable of redeeming those features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure you'll <i>want</i> to look like any more of a spaz, Desi,\" you tell her, though you genuinely are trying to be helpful. Becky punches you under the table, quieting you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We went out once,\" Cindy says in a low, apologetic tone, quirking her head at you. That's enough of a voucher for Desi. \"But if you're up for it, I'm looking for something.\" Cindy dips into a pocket that probably shouldn't exist in her robe and retrieves a pen and pad, scribbling something down and passing it to Desi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that one just dropped this morning,\" Desi says at once. \"It's hiding in with the fifteeners. There's a big blue qaf on the front, look for that.\" You feel a little better when Cindy asks what fifteeners and qafs are, and a little worse when Desi explains the references and borrows Cindy's pen to draw something. Well, she had to make up for that face somewhere along the line, so a brain was the consolation prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you just <i>know</i> where books are in here?\" you ask, sitting up with interest as you figure it out. That could be useful. \"Hey, that's actually pretty cool. Some sort of branch talent of yours? Sorry about the train and spaz thing, all right?\" Your ambition is a little too transparent, and all three girls groan. Desi actually looks at you instead of pretending you don't exist, so at least you're partially back in her esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it <i>is</i> cool,\" you grumble. Women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's looking for . . . \" Cindy says, tapping at something else she's written down. She rips the leaf out of the pad and hands it off to Desi, who writes down what look like directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except you'll never be able to get to it, and you won't be able to use it even if you do,\" Desi says, looking at you with amused disdain. \"Seriously, not being mean. They're both pretty heavy texts, but hers is more like theory and yours is dense, practical stuff that even masters skim through and give up on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done OK with translating a pretty tough text so far,\" you say, naming the family grimoire you've been working out of. It was hot enough to have Laura begging for mercy earlier! You think you can manage with this prim thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that's an heirloom,\" Desi says at once, nearly losing some drool in her rush to be a know-it all. \"But I know, 'none of my business,' so good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, ooh!\" Becky chimes in, excitedly waving her G Girls book. \"What about more of these?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are so lame!\" Desi says, but her eyes say something else. \"You want the rare ones, right?\" Even Cindy nods, so Desi takes it more seriously. \"All right, I'll catch up to you later with those, they're easy. You guys can find the harder stuff yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy and Becky thank Desi, and you belatedly squawk out your own gratitude as the kid wanders off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>am</i> getting my Alhazen,\" Cindy says, just as you're opening your mouth, \"and I can't see that I really need you to do it. That's pragmatism, Kevin, not snarkiness. But the Primm tract could be incredibly useful for both of us, and I think I know what Desi means about it being a tough acquisition, so . . . I'm up if you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in!\" Becky says, automatically. She stops reading to look up with confusion, not sure what she just agreed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got the paper, so lead on,\" you tell Cindy, more than happy to be deferential if you get what you want.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow, it's spooky down here without anyone laughing,\" you say. You look around, seeing books stretching off endlessly on either side of you. The lighting's on the verge of being too bright, so this is the more serious part of the library. People aren't messing about while looking for assigned material or light reading, so it's also library-quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it nice?\" Cindy asks, smirking as she gets her bearings. \"OK, Desi has us going forward two more rows and then cutting hard right, and then we're in the general area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, that's outside the library,\" Becky says. She has a good sense of direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way,\" says Cindy, leaving it at that. She pads ahead, you and Becky following along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make the directed right turn, you notice something's off. The shelving still looks the same, nothing appears to change, and yet you've got the sense the aisle here is somehow pinched. You can't actually see anything, but space looks a little twisted, like a refractive trick where you poke something in water and see it bend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Becky asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can sense where the continua dovetail,\" Cindy says, squinting. \"I can't. Keep your eyes open; this area's only nominally a library.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask what you're looking for, a very large book suddenly tumbles over into the aisle, flopping down right in front of Cindy. It opens at once, spitting out a bunch of golden symbols on lengths of serpentine coils. Cindy gets looped by the coils around her elbows and thighs before getting dragged to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a colophonascus,\" says Cindy, sounding interested rather than concerned. \"You might want to stay back. I'm not sure how it'll respond if it can't get me to sing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just . . . exactly what you say, Cindy,\" says Becky, making a point of stepping back a good distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see and barely hear the little symbols buzzing like mad, going for a vibrational assault. Six of them divide between Cindy's feet, pressing against her yellow socks. When she doesn't start squealing with laughter, they try to drag the socks off and are completely frustrated, not getting them to budge one yellow inch. They try behind her knees for some time, and then continue climbing. You can be forgiven for enjoying the sight of metal strands snaking under your ex's blouse, and it <i>would</i> be kind of nice if she suffered a major wardrobe malfunction right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty,\" Cindy says, again with no concern. \"Trying to get past my underwear, but no dice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the socks?\" Becky asks, and Cindy nods. You'd wondered about that, but Cindy has naturally done a good job of proofing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still,\" you say, sounding keener on the point than you'd intended, \"you've got buzzy things right over your, uh, bosoms and . . . you know. Just a layer of cloth for protection, even if it doesn't tickle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin wants to know why I'm not groaning uncontrollably with pleasure right now,\" Cindy says to Becky, who squeals with laughter. \"Because, Kevin, my clothing in general - and dainties in particular - are enchanted to allow me conscious mediation of sensory input; if I don't feel like getting tickled or stimulated by 'buzzy things,' then it doesn't happen. Yes, there's a panoply of other wardweave involved, but that answers your particular question regarding this circumstance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, give in . . . it'll be fun!\" you say. It just slips out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiles, tries to compose herself, then goes back to smiling as she looks away from you. She's flattered that you're still concerned about her status in that department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the book gets sick of the unresponsive Cindy and withdraws its metal feelers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before it lunges at . . .</span></div></div>",

She tries to grab onto it and force it shut, but it shrugs her off and starts hopping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrink back, but it's not after you; it heard Becky's squealing laughter earlier and now wants to introduce itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, you guys, <i>help</i>!!\" Becky yells, pitching her paperback at the huge book. As she turns to run, the book launches a pair of markings at her, lassoing her ankles and bringing her down. Cindy has the presence of mind to cast featherfall, Becky settling gently to the tiled floor instead of smashing into it face first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's already laughing before she's reeled back into range, the metal buzzing at her ankles enough to set her off. The book promptly makes up for its earlier wasted effort, getting right to work as it shoots a couple dozen tendrils out, eeling right past Becky's clothes in its eagerness for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it stop!\" she cries out, laughing in a way that doesn't convince you she's being tortured. She sounds like she's having a good time, and you can see it in her eyes when she looks at you. She's got coils vanishing right down her socks into her shoes and boiling under her uniform blouse, but doesn't seem to be suffering any torment for the close attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's enjoying herself,\" Cindy tells you, smiling as she grabs one of the book's tendrils. \"Look at that! The alchemical symbol for antimony.\" She lets it go, and it returns to tickling Becky. Her eyes are closed and she's started to squirm around, but it appears to be a release of nervous energy more than genuine distress. She sounds a little nutty, but not enough to try your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we leave her here and keep going?\" you suggest. \"They're a cute couple. Come on, let's find this thing and get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin,\" Cindy says, giving you a look. OK, that's out. Anyway, you might need Becky to overcome a nastier obstacle later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky keeps right on laughing. And laughing, and laughing. It's wearing you out just to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm about ready to sit down,\" you say, plopping to the floor and leaning against a bookshelf. Becky's finally getting a break, but doesn't seem ready to push on just yet. Cindy shrugs, following your example and sitting on the opposite side of the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys can go ahead if you want,\" Becky says, trying not to sound too eager to get rid of you. Then she's back to laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No</i> way!\" you deny, shaking your head. \"If this thing gets back down to business, I want to hear you squeak.\" Becky's laughing too hard to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a charmer,\" says Cindy, looking at you with perplexed annoyance. \"You're going to be a model tickle sorceror, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that slight can turn into an argument, Becky flips onto her stomach and starts pounding the floor with her fists, then kicking with enough energy for the two of you to give her some space. Despite the frenzy, the sound of her shrieky laughter doesn't suggest she's being pressured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? We're so used to this sort of thing now that a friendly tickling can take <i>hours</i>! Benefits of an education in tickle sorcery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Kevin. Your logic is impeccable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a friendly tickler now, you know,\" you tell Cindy, playfully going after one of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not!\" she says, snorting with laughter: the incredulous type, not the ticklish kind. Cindy was always able to say a lot with a snort of laughter - and, as the disappointed kids noted earlier, she doesn't even move her foot away. \"It's always going to be about control for you, humiliation, dominance . . . you can't help yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just going through a phase,\" you tell her, winking. You don't care if she's <i>not</i> laughing or withdrawing her foot; it's still fun to make the motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy looks a bit melancholy, watching your fingers versus her sock. She stands up and retrieves Becky's schlocky paperback. \"Look, let's just grab her and keep going. We'll get your totally indecipherable book, I'll go back and get what I'm after, and we'll call it a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was sweet of you to insist on grabbing my book first,\" you tell her, but Cindy gives you a 'Whatever!' roll of her eyes. She grabs one of Becky's weakly flailing arms, and you grab the other. The book doesn't seem ready to stop tickling her, so you drag both of them along behind you. The floor's waxed, so it's not at all taxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way . . .</span></div></div>",

Which is why we're going after 'your book' first; I want this out of the way, assuming it's something we can grit our teeth through and move past rather than have to admit defeat over, which is also a possibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you're considering all the options,\" you say, frowning. How badly do you want to turn your room into a nonstop tickling orgy, really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I <b><i>can't</i></b> . . . \" Becky says, suddenly squirming around on the floor. <i>That</i> kind of squirming. It's lots of fun to watch, Becky's eyelids fluttering as she gasps and smiles, but Cindy drags you several rows distant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jealous?\" you ask Cindy. \"You could have been doing the same, earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just giving Becky her privacy instead of ogling,\" Cindy replies. A drawn out groan from Becky follows soon after, along with a very high-pitched giggle. Evidently, Becky <i>can</i>, with the right prompting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy blushes a little at Becky's enthusiastic moaning, but doesn't comment on it. \"Have you noticed anything odd about the books in this wing of the library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all in a weird language?\" you say, grabbing one off the shelf. It's a blue book in a red dust jacket, the alien alphabet a series of interlocking circles with patterned dots in the empty spaces. You open the book and can't tell what direction to start reading it in. Still, it's in a very familiar book pattern, so it probably suggests the narrative proceeds from one page to the next. No pictures. You put it back on the shelf and shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" Cindy says, breaking out her monocle. Oh, man! You thought she'd quit with that thing years back. It's nicely made, not a prop piece, both the chain and rim around the lens made of gold, but it's not the gimmickiness of the eyepiece or the fact that it makes her look like a nineteenth century robber baron - it's that she thinks she can <i>see</i> things through it. She grabs the book you just put back and opens it randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'. . . regarding . . . hesh . . . something-something . . ., which was seen to thoroughly caress hesh' - hesh, I think that's a pronoun - 'skexafuntish'? Even the monocle can't handle it. And while I can't get a complete translation, I'd make a bet on the content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. Maybe it does actually say that, who knows? But <i>you'd</i> bet on Cindy making it up on the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy continues, quickly scanning through a few more books. You can still hear Becky crying out with enjoyment, but she seems to be tapering off. You hope Cindy doesn't see how interested those vocalizations have left you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin,\" Cindy says, returning with her monocle tucked away, \"I believe we're in brown wrapper territory. It's an entire library of facetiae. Dirty books. Pornography, in a more literal sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has it done anything for <i>your</i> skexafuntish?\" you ask her, laughing when she nods eagerly. She's relaxing around you a little, revealing her sense of humor. Things are awkward since you stopped hanging out regularly to save face. Still, she dumped <i>you</i>, and you have to keep reminding yourself of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point being,\" she says, \"I think we can expect more of what Becky's going through. For all we know, this library's designed to use our erotic fantasies against us. It's just biding its time, seeing what makes us tick. Talk about an obstacle! The entire library's our opponent, but it's operating in a sneaky way meant to overwhelm our various, uh, coping strategies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pure conjecture!\" you bark, trying to sound scholarly. Good for a laugh from Cindy. \"You're saying we don't have much to worry about, then? A little of what Becky's going through? Sold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it's going to be <i>that</i> easy,\" Cindy says, looking around. Nothing jumps out at either of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she says, looking to be in even better spirits than when she first started out with you. She can't hide the fact she's had an itch thoroughly scratched. The book that did it to her is now much smaller, compacted into a standard hardback. You ask her if you can check it out, carefully handling it by the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Carmotically Yours' by Rubedo?\" you say, surprised as you find you can now read the spine. \"Hey, wasn't this thing in some language that looked like morse code at first?\" You're reminded of your spellbook offering up a legible spell, earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check the cover!\" Cindy says. Whoa! The title and author are there again, but with a picture of Becky's face on the front! Artistically done in watercolor, but there's no mistaking the resemblance. Behind her face, you can see others silhouetted and trailing off in a long line. There's also a photorealistic eye painted near the top left corner, the jacket puffing up around it a little as though someone's dealt it a shiner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope the thing's self-cleaning, Becky,\" you tell her. \"Looks like you're sloppy sixtieths.\" You manage not to burst out laughing as you say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care!\" she says. \"Kevin, could you put h . . . <b>it</b> in your pack for me? I want to keep him. Uh, <i>it</i>. Whatever. I'm bringing it out with me when we leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Becky,\" you say, grinning. Cindy's smiling as well. The Rubedo goes into your empty pack, and Cindy puts the G Girls in after it. Cindy also explains her theory about the library you're in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just going to have to go after you two, because I'm good for the rest of the day,\" she says, pleased with herself. \"Let's go further down this way, the main aisle's boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna get lost in here,\" you say, because it seems it wouldn't be very hard to do. You have the distinct feeling <i>this</i> library wouldn't mind getting you lost inside itself for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Becky says in dismissal. OK, so the girl can carry a map in her head. It's a straight shot back to the main aisle, so a little exploring can't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you notice a sweet smell in the air as you proceed down a short row, then see that the bookshelves are leaning at drunken angles, books scattered all over the floor. Peeking over the tumbled shelves, you see a huge mushroom with smaller varieties scattered around. It's a tiny mushroom forest, and the fungus seems to be growing on and into the books that have hit the floor, breaking them down and leaving behind a residue that looks like crystallized honey. That explains the smell. The lights are flickering overhead (how, when you haven't been able to spot a light source since you entered the great hall of dirty books?), but there's a steady glow from a bank of mushrooms that shed a green bioluminescence. Weirdest of all, the king mushroom seems to have the screen of a computer monitor stuck in its red cap, integrated with it somehow. You can see characters flicking by rapidly, looking suspiciously similar to some of the text on the books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think they're actually scanning the books as they eat them!\" you say, tripped out. Becky trips out right along with you, but Cindy is looking . . . not herself. Her hands are in fists and she keeps clenching her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" you ask her. She looks at you, her eyes brighter than usual, then looks away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I said about the place possibly using our fantasies against us?\" Cindy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Becky asks, wrinkling her nose. \"Ewww, Cindy, <b><i>no</i></b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it must go back to a copy of Alice in Wonderland I had as a kid,\" Cindy says, trying to turn away and walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're floored. WHAT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy, you've got a <i>mushroom</i> kink?!\" you ask. \"How? I mean, in the time we were going together, you never . . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kevin, use your brain! Would <i>you</i> admit to something like that? I knew it was too weird, so I never said anything.\" She can't help herself, stepping back to admire the mushrooms some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admitted to all sorts of stuff,\" you say, mostly to Becky. \"I never would have guessed. So . . . what, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to get in there and stomp on them!\" Cindy says, grinding her jaw. \"I just wanna . . . roll around in there for a while. What do you think, should we?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Becky can't hold out, folding up with laughter. Cindy isn't bothered. Just when you think you know all about someone . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you see what I mean?\" she asks, now shivering a little. \"We <i>can't</i> defend against this sort of thing. If something turns you on, how can you resist it when you don't <i>want</i> to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a magical equivalent of a cold shower?\" Becky whispers to you. \"I never learned that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy, I think you should have a good time,\" you tell her. This would classify as one of Cindy's more winsome eccentricities, and you're charmed by it. You can't remember when anything got her absolutely unglued like this, and you're a little worried she'll snap something critical if she doesn't give in to her desire.</span></div></div>",

They're performing useful work, scanning in books, and I'd be destroying all of that industry and information. I'm walking. Here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Cindy does manage to walk away, getting back to the main aisle, waiting for you and Becky to catch up. You're simultaneously impressed and depressed; she resisted, but seems diminished by the victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably just the beginning,\" says Cindy. \"There'll be something ahead for both of you, I'll bet. Unless your secret fantasy was getting intimate attention from a book, Becky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thinking about it <i>now</i>. . . \" Becky says, head inclined in consideration. You look at Cindy, who gives you the go-ahead with a single emphatic nod, so you dig your fingers into Becky's ribs. You drive her to her knees, but she still manages to shout out a request through her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, spirit of the kinky library in some freaky dimension that I have no idea where it is, <b>please</b> send a mushroom boyfriend, maybe a tickling one, to help out our friend Cindy who is still shuddering with shroom passion that she selflessly and heroically put aside, so give 'er a break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's an eloquent enough request that you stop tickling Becky and help her to her feet. Cindy's looking both embarrassed and hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you get jumped by a mushroom, I'm <i>staying</i> to ogle,\" you tell Cindy. \"I'm letting you know now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you blame me for keeping my mushroom fetish a dark secret?\" Cindy asks rhetorically, but she's kidding. Your junk isn't, and you have to make an adjustment as the girls walk ahead of you. Seeing Cindy so helplessly turned on has you rock hard, which she couldn't have failed to notice but had enough class not to mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" Becky says, out of the blue. You and Cindy have no idea what she's on about, but she points at the shelf to her left: there's a book with a glittering yellow mushroom on it, which stands out from all the imcomprehensible text. Becky grabs for the book, and that particular shelf swings inward, revealing a very short vestibule with a door. The walls are made of yellow brick, and the door opens with a push bar. It looks like an auditorium entrance. There's a note on the door, simply reading, \"To: <i>Cindy</i> From: <i>A Friend</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secret admirer,\" Becky mumbles while clearing her throat, nudging Cindy forward. Your face gets hot for a moment, but you smother the ridiculous sense of jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about this,\" Cindy says, pausing with her hand on the bar. \"We might be better off denying ourselves instead of indulging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan with exasperation and push the door aside for her, which opens onto mushroom paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's all colors of biolume inside, though still mostly dim; you're able to make out some details, but your eyes have to adjust to the murk. There are mushrooms the size of houses, mushrooms the size of delicate little flowers, and all sizes in between. Fat ones, thin ones, tall and short, any color you can think of in as many different patterns. There's a lingering groundfog and wisps of haze over everything, and while it has the sense of a bounded space you're unable to see the perimeter. Although the more directly appealing aspects seem synthetic, there's no denying the wildness of the place. There's a smell in the air that's both minty and peppery, combined in a way that's alien. While it doesn't seem <i>dangerous</i> in here, you have the natural feeling of disquiet that goes with trying to make sense of too many unfamiliar details at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys, I . . . \" Cindy manages, looking like she's going to faint. Instead, she shucks off her uniform robe and sprints off, vanishing into a stand of mushrooms with only a swirl in warm mist to indicate her passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I wanna watch!\" you tell Becky, ready to charge off after Cindy. She grabs your arm and digs her fingers in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin, don't be obnoxious. You'll live longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's OK if we at least look around,\" you say, straining your ears for any sound of Cindy. You hear dripping water from many directions and a sighing noise reminiscent of the wind, but the air is still. It might even be getting warmer in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step into the mushrooms proper, you find you're walking into the things, the ground a mushy, springy mass. The mushrooms underfoot yield but don't break apart, but you have to watch your step. Cindy flew over them like she was at a track meet! You turn and see Becky's got the right idea, leaving her shoes and socks next to Cindy's robe before she steps in. You do the same and dump your pack as well, following after Becky while still trying to get an idea where Cindy went off to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow up to your knees in mushrooms, Becky sees one that strikes her fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, big pink shroom!\" she calls out, mincing over to a large one, twice as tall as she is. She tries jumping up and can't catch the edge of the cap, so you give her a boost and help her scramble on top. The entire thing starts to glow once she's standing on it, sinking up to her shins in the sponginess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks very much!\" Becky shouts through her cupped hands, directing her gratitude through the fathomless fog above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there's light everywhere. Many mushrooms are pulsing out flashes of color, glowing, sparkling, and generally spitting lambency that screams \"electric mushroom utopia.\" Becky claps with delight before reaching down to help you up next to her, and you both sit to watch. It's a comfy mushroom to hang out on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The place went off when you said thanks,\" you tell Becky. Now there's a drumbeat cycling up from somewhere. Maybe a lot of drums, percussion breaking out all over, but it's still more felt than heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was just coincidentally at the same time <i>Cindy</i> went off, somewhere,\" she says, winking, and you try looking around for Cindy again now that there's more light. Still no sign of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the few minutes you're waiting, there are more gifts showered down from above.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're looking up into the wispy fog hanging over the light show and mingled rataplan when you see something move. Then there are more of them, floating down. You direct Becky's attention toward the sky (ceiling?) and become convinced it's more mushrooms drifting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firecracker, firecracker, boom-boom-boom!\" you hear, faint and getting louder. Someone's cheering? No, a lot of people. Specifically, a lot of <i>girls</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?!\" you ask, but in a very happy tone because you know exactly what. \"Becky, it's raining cheerleaders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" <b>. . .</b> \" Becky responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you can see them clearly, from the soles of their Nike Staminas to their uniform shell tops, and especially up their skirts! There must be 40 or 50 cheerleaders parachuting in right now, the mushrooms beneath them flashing out landing patterns and guiding them in. They cheer all the way down, starting in with a new one. \"R-E-B-E-C-C-A! Find out what . . . !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't find out what, because Becky squeals with embarrassment and buries her face in pink shroominess. What <i>now</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky, there's <b>nothing</b> wrong with cheerleaders dropping out of the sky, trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally looks at you, having much the same expression on her face that Cindy did earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like boys, OK?\" she blurts, looking more nervous than ever. \"But a couple of years ago . . . I was in QI.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say, dragging it out to prompt her. You're already liking the sound of this! \"QI\", or 'Quote Immersion', is an elective class where sorcerors can mingle with non-magical folks, aka 'Quotidians'. Usually, in your school, that meant a field trip to experience day-to-day life off-campus and usually get some tickle magic in on the local population. You'd skipped it, having some familiarity with the quote world, but most kids born into a purely sorcerous family took the class out of curiosity. Also, there's no denying it: sorcerors have the magic, but quotes have the culture. QI daytripping was an excellent chance to snag the newest movies, music, comic books, all that sort of stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wound up going to a prep school, Uller Academy,\" Becky continues. \"There was this q-girl there, and we sort of hit it off. All day. Yeah, go ahead and leer, it was almost entirely tickling! Anyway, I haven't forgotten her, and . . . you know, daydreaming and stuff. She shows up a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the cheerleaders are starting to touch down, and you have a closer look. There are brunettes, blondes, redheads, even some with their hair dyed stranger colors. They stop cheering and roll up their chutes, laughing to each other as they stumble around in the shroomy terrain. There's a certain sameness about them, from their height to the sound of their voices to the way they move. Many of them talk at the same time and finish each other's sentences. The nearest examples are about ten yards away from you. You're thinking it's a trick of the fog or something, but then you think again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're <i>her</i> aren't they?!\" you ask Becky, excited. \"They're <i>all</i> her, with some little cosmetic changes here and there! Clone cheerleaders in mushroom land! It's like a weird heaven I'd probably never have come up with on my own! Thank you, Becky and Cindy!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meredith Elle Pletcher,\" Becky says out loud, but dreamily and mostly to herself. She sits near the edge of the pink mushroom, legs dangling, obviously thinking much the same thing you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their parachutes (all red with white spots) folded and gathered in a tidy stack, the one Meredith who's squad leader calls out commands to get the rest aligned as neatly as possible. Ah! Meredith is stacked quite tidily herself, 32D, almost certainly, which suits you; 5'7\" and maybe a shade under a trimly muscular 130 pounds. Scandinavian features with just a hint of corn-fed provinciality - probably originally a blonde, just like the squad leader. Leader Meredith <i>is</i> probably the template, which would make sense. Becky knew what she was doing when she went after this one! Cindy's not at the top of your list right now, but hey . . . a stiff dick has no conscience. Plus, the Meredith squad arrives with no strings attached; Cindy's a former girlfriend, Becky's a friend-friend. The Merediths, you strongly suspect, are created only for pleasure, so there's no chance for complications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're making their way over to you now, probably because the rest of the shrooms have stopped flashing so urgently except for the stalk of your own, strobing an urgent pink. They're not moving in lockstep, each of them quite naturally doing their own thing. They're not robots, and there's no suggestion of a stifling uniformity to them despite their all looking almost exactly alike. The more you see of Meredith, the more you like her. You do a quick count and see your earlier estimate wasn't off by much: 42 of them, since they all have numbers on the right side of their tops (#42, a platinum blonde, closes the series). All of them are in short skirts, white with maroon stripes, matching tops (a UA logo in maroon on the left), and mostly 'rabbit ear' ponytails, though hairstyle doesn't seem to be enforced. Their bloomers are royal blue, which you noticed as they were inbound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky,\" they say as one, gathered in a semi-circle beneath you. Becky, looking deliriously happy, seems to have no qualms about her earlier claim of being 'good for the rest of the day' and wordlessly stage-dives into the arms of her secret daydream gf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a respectable time before announcing yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>I'm</i> her good friend, Ke . . . hey, wait up! Hold on a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Merediths are carrying Becky off somewhere and not paying the slightest attention to you. You have to jump off the big pink shroom and walk quickly after them, waving your arms around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Becky, how about an introduction?\" you finally have to call to her. This isn't going quite the way you'd imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry!\" Becky calls out, getting her wits about her. \"Merediths, this is Kevin. He's my friend from school, and he's a tickle sorceror, too. We're here with Cindy, but she's . . . off doing her own thing right now. We'll probably see her later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Kevin,\" the Merediths say to you. Bright tones, politely friendly, nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky, do you think maybe . . . \" you say, trailing off. You hate having to ask, but it's becoming obvious to you that the Merediths only have eyes for Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, would any of you like to hang out with Kevin?\" Becky asks, the Merediths putting her down so she can converse in more dignified fashion. \"Thanks. Any of you? He's a mostly decent guy, and there's no way I can handle <i>all</i> of you myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it sounds like 42 girls standing around talking all at once, each trying to say something and no one synching up. Mostly debates about dividing into groups and who gets access to Becky first, for how long, to what degree, on and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll hang out with Kevin for a while,\" says a black-haired Meredith. Number 21. You actually thank her, which doesn't do wonders for your ego, but what the heck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a boy,\" Becky says. \"He's a visual type!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a bit of a sigh over this, but the Merediths get it. 42 steps up to act as a bookend to 21, a carroty redhead joins (13), then a toffee blonde (17), a chestnut brunette (4), and the one with light blue hair (36). A six-pack of Merediths suits you just fine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Becky and Merediths!\" you say, genuinely grateful. Becky and the Merediths tease you, but seem to find you amusing. \"Uh . . . and thank <i>you</i>, whoever's up top!\" That was likely a wasted bid, nothing dropping down for you, but you're happy with what you already have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun, Kev!\" Becky calls out, proceeding off with her three dozen playmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, where to begin?\" you ask, grinning at your loaner harem.</span></div></div>",

I don't think you're <i>that</i> interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, more about the tickling part,\" Carrot Cake says, thinking you're about to go off on some excursus regarding magical categories. She doesn't know that it's taking a lot for you to stand here chatting instead of getting to work, but you're having fun as you see how long you can deny yourself. It's a decent way to break the ice, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Tickling</i> sorcery, right,\" you say. \"A lot of people think it's silly, but it evolved as a system of distraction cantrips useful in magical duels. That's the textbook definition, anyway. In other words, if you're squaring off against another magic user, the ability to get a simple spell off quickly that breaks their concentration before they can throw a fireball or something at you means you have the upper hand. And then someone decided to carry that logic forward and completely subdue their opponent with tickling rather than just distracting them before they threw their own fireball, and you wind up with tickling as a valid form of magical combat. We take a lot of grief for it, but we're like the quick draw artists of the duelling world. 'Thaumatomachy,' to use the technical term for a duel, which no one but professors does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure that's properly conjug . . . \" Gin Fizz begins to say before being cut off by a disbelieving Too-Blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your mission in life is to become the John Wesley Hardin of magical tickling?!\" she says, jaw dropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well . . . sort of,\" you say, in truth not totally familiar with the name. \"Duelling's just a part of it. A lot of tickle sorcerors wind up going into neuroscience, psychobiology, stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand-up comedy,\" Conker suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Child care!\" says Shockwave, and by now all six are giggling at your expense. You don't mind. They're q-girls, so they don't know who's going to have the last laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're thinking this, you hear what sounds like three dozen cheerleaders bursting into laughter somewhere not too far away. Becky must have nailed them pretty hard, and the sound of it piques you into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been working on something that proved not terribly effective against other sorcerors, but it might be OK against quotes. You start in with a magical phrase that runs to something more like a verse, too long to get off quickly. The Merediths stand and wait patiently, maybe a little eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo-Blonde tops your list, since she seems like the snarkiest of the six girls, so you target her without a second thought. She sighs and shifts from foot to foot, trying to resist giggling, and finally can't help it. Too-Blonde drops with a squeal of laughter, trying to toe off her shoes and drag her socks free as the latter fill up with tickling filaments. You'd taken pride in this one, the hardest part being the phrasing that lets you summon the tiny threads of energy <i>into</i> someone's clothing before said threads undergo magical deposition to fluffy materiality, tickling as they expand. Naturally, any of the girls you'd tried it on (first Kelly, and then Laura when your ego was already bruised) had been able to counter it without effort, and you were never able to shorten the phrase to a more serviceable terseness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo-Blonde is your first successful victim, rolling around while kicking and screeching, the rest of her group more than happy to tease her. She'd gotten the shoes off but then lost any ability to deal with her socks, which are double-rolled at mid-shin in some cheerleader method that must help to keep them up during drills. The white socks are undulating as noodles of orange fuzz squitter out of them, looking like fugitive caterpillars sick of being cocooned. The effect ends too quickly for your liking, though Too-Blonde is glad of it. If she'd been able to get her socks off, that would have ended the fun at once; the spell is only effective against skin locked in tight clothing, useless against someone who's already barefoot. Also, for stylistic reasons, it bugs you that you were never able to get any other color but orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you call <i>that</i> spell?\" Too-Blonde asks, peeling her socks off with some interest as she has a closer look at the orange stuff. Fortunately, her teammates are equally interested in the feel and texture of the fluff, not driven to immediately bare their feet to avoid Too-Blonde's experience. Although if the original Meredith spent a full day with Becky, she must like being tickled, so her clones might feel the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dreadful Orange Fuzzies,\" you tell Too-Blonde, shrugging as she laughs at you. \"Something I came up with myself, just a placeholder name. It doesn't work against other sorcerors, believe me. A failed experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Failed</b>?!\" the other girls say as one, surprised. They're under the impression it was middling cool, but then they're still quotes even if they're clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good, I thought this would be disgusting,\" Too-Blonde says to herself, eyes on her feet as she steps around on the shroomy turf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mushrooms are a fungus, so you can get athlete's foot from them,\" Shockwave says with a ring of authority in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you for real?\" Gin Fizz asks, mirroring Too-Blonde's earlier jaw drop. Yet another interesting divergence between the Merediths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider your next move.</span></div></div>",

You feel several of the monsters weaving strings around your feet and toes, tying them into total immobility, which tickles something fierce in itself, eliciting wild, muffled laughter that only seems to drive the imps into a mirthful frenzy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the monsters begin in earnest: scores of agile little fingers savagely tickling the soles of your feet! You scream with laughter, and squirm feebly (as there's literally nothing else you can do), as the imps concentrate everything they have on your feet, whooping and hollering in a chorus of tiny voices. As your eyes fill with tears, an imp near your face daubs them with a small cloth, wringing it out into a little flask with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goes on for what seems like eternity, you laugh until you are hoarse and the room spins deliriously around you. The imps give you breaks every 20 minutes or so, but other than that, they tickle your feet all night long, filling several of their flasks with your tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the first light of dawn streams in through your window, the horrid little things relent for good, slapping you on the backside and thighs one-by-one, as they retreat back under the bed, returning to their own plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the little fiends don't bother to untie you! You're totally exhausted, after an entire night of sleepless tickling, and still soundly hogtied and class is about to start! You'll catch hell for being late, or missing class altogether, but you're so tired you almost don't even care at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you manage to loosen one of the knots binding your wrists after several determined minutes; if you work at it, you could be untied in under a half hour, you think.

So, rather than concentrate on offensive spells to bother opponent spell-casters, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had to bone up on defensive spells to bend back feathers and zap magic tickling fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I study some more, eat a late dinner, and turn in for the night, filled with dread and uncertainty at my ability to master tickle-magic when I am so horribly susceptible to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When I awaken later, it <i>feels</i> like next morning, but it also has a strangely surreal, <i>dreamy</i> sense to the day, and I wonder if I am not still under a magic spell or still asleep as I lay against my pillow.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Confidently, you challenge her to a match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you step into opposite corners of the ring. Laura stares evilly at you with her dark, insidious eyes. You've been studying quite a lot since your last encounter and in your studies you've uncovered what seems to be a pretty amazing total immobilization spell! The verbal components are tricky and it takes a while to cast, but you're certain you can pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tone chimes and the match officially begins. Before Laura can act, you rattle off your amazing new spell with incredible speed and precision! Laura's eyes go wide as yards of spectral rope blink into existence and begin wrapping themselves around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the heck did you learn this?!?!\" Laura shouts, just as coils of rope slide between her teeth, effectively gagging her. This IS an awesome spell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few seconds, Laura is completely covered in shimmering rope. Only the top of her head and her feet protrude from the countless coils that bind her. She struggles and MMPHs fecklessly as you walk triumphantly toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, Laura,\" you tease, \"is a dusty old immobilization spell. I don't think they even teach it anymore, but I don't know why. It seems to be pretty effective!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shakes her head and grunts angrily as you kneel down in front of her wriggling feet. Slowly, maliciously, you pull her socks off, exposing her bare, sensitive soles and meticulously pedicured toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've waited so long for this Laura, to pay you back.\" you whisper. \"And since the match is only over once you verbally submit - and you can't exactly do that in your present situation - I think I'm going to tickle your feet until you pass out. Or until my hands cramp up or I get bored, whichever happens first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and Laura's eyes bulge as she screams and twists in the coils of rope that hold her fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to rake your nails over her vainly kicking feet when Laura begins to shimmer and sputter, slowly becoming translucent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are momentarily stunned as coils of shimmering rope appear and wrap themselves around your body, leaving you helplessly gagged and bound, just as Laura was! The image of Laura in front of you smiles and disappears completely and you hear Laura's voice from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations on immobilizing my mirror image, you dunce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall to the mat and desperately roll onto your back. You see Laura walking maliciously toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they don't teach that immobilization spell anymore because it only works when your target isn't paying any attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin pleading desperately into your gag as Laura kneels down in front of your feet and begins slowly rolling your socks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long were you going to tickle me?\" Laura asks, mockingly. \"Until I passed out, or until you got bored? Was that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and struggle uselessly while Laura holds your now naked feet in an iron grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I never get bored of torturing you. Let's see how long you can remain conscious then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith frenzied speed Laura attacks your feet with her nails, dragging them over your soles and between your desperately wriggling toes. You scream and struggle until your head swims and your vision blurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like an eternity of tickling you feel the coils of magical rope beginning to loosen on your body. In a daze, you glance up and see Laura, now standing directly over you, beginning to cast another, probably even more terrible spell! Thinking as quickly as you're capable of, you realize you can cast a Dispel, nullifying all magic within the ring and relying on your physical strength along to best Laura, or you can cast that other, incredibly cruel and amazing spell you've recently been studying. You're fairly certain you kind of remember the words ...</span></div></div>",

Becky smiles and says \"Oh, but you just told me you do have at least one, and I'm not stopping until i find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's fingers work they way around your sides and land just below your navel. You laugh a bit harder and Becky picks up on it as she speeds up her tickling pace, sending you into helpless laughter. \"Tickle tickle tickle, is this your tickle spot Kevin?\" Becky continues to tease you. \"NOHOHOHOHOHAHAHAHA!\" you laugh, not wanting to give up yet. Truthfully this is one of your most ticklish spots and Laura has used it to make you submit on several occasions, but Becky's not the expert tickle Laura is. Becky tickles all over your belly until your out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your tougher than you look Kevin, but I think I've been going at this all wrong. I noticed my ghost friends here never tickled your feet\" Becky says as she kneels down next to your feet. \"Becky don't!\" you shout,knowing the game is up. \"Submit!\" Becky shouts back. \"NHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" your reply is cut off as Becky spiders her fingers all over your helpless soles. \"Tell me Kevin, which foot's more ticklish? The right?\" she asks, using all ten fingers to tickle every part of your right foot. \"NHOHOHOHOHAHAHA!\" you laugh. She stops tickling you for a second and asks \"did you know you've got a birthmark on the bottom of your left foot?\" Your feet have always been your most ticklish spot, especially your left foot. Laura likes to call the birthmark in the middle of your left sole your \"tickle button\". \"Becky dohohohon't\" you giggle as she pokes at it. \"Looks like I finally found your tickle spot Kevin!\" Becky shouts triumphantly as she uses all ten fingers to tickle your left foot, making sure at least one finger is always tickling your birthmark. \"Tickle tickle tickle, kootchy, kootchy coo\" Becky's teasing sends you completely over the edge. \"IHAHAHASUHAHAHA!\" You want to submit, but you can't form the words! Becky stops tickling you \"Tell me I found your tickle spot, tell me you submit!\" You lay there catching your breath until you feel a single finger stroking your left sole. \"You hehehe found hehehe it hehehe I hehehe suHAHAbmit!\" Becky jumps up in the air and claps her hands, celebrating her victory. \"Don't worry Kevin, the ghost hands will dissipate soon, I think. I can wait with you till then if you want.\" Becky wasn't really a cruel tickler, she just wanted to win the match. Having someone to watch out for you until your free would be nice.

And it was all my own fault\" <br>\r\n\"This kid of things happen to everybody once in a while\"<br>\r\n\"I envy you. Kevin. Even though your magic is not that good, you challenge other opponents again and again. If only I had your confidence\"<br>\r\n\"Becky, I don't know what to say, you make me feel a little bit embarrassed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're holding your neck and having a grin in your face speaking those last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think Miss Galacia was right. I should face my consequences\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have to take my responsibility. But I think I would die if it happened in front of everybody again. This is why I want you to do it.\"<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was our right to tickle me anyways, if you hadn't surrendered to protect me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see her face blushing while speaking out those words. She can't even look into your face anymore.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this?\"<br>\r\n\"Please don't talk me out of this. It took a lot of courage to come here\", she answers<br>\r\nBecky begins to undress until she's standing in front of you in just her underwear. Then she moves into your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If my magic wasn't so bad I would do it myself, but instead I brought these\"<br>\r\nIn her right hand she is holding some shackles. Normally you would throw them at your opponent, but after breaking the seal Becky puts it on her chest.<br>\r\nAs soon as the artifact touches her skin, the magic shackles fasten her to the bed in a similar way as she had been tied during the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing, Kevin. I know that I can't take this type of punishment very well. I will be begging you to stop immediately. You have to refuse. Don't stop until I learned my lesson\"<br>\r\n\"That's a little bit vague, don't you think. What does this mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Just imagine I was a different person that had lost to you. Yes imagine I was Laura. What would you do if she had lost to you and would be completely vulnerable? You would tickle her senseless and you have to do it to me as well. I lost the match, I have to face the consequences\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky must be pretty desperate, Miss Galacia's words must have really hurt her if she is going so far<br>\r\n\"You are going to regret this, Becky. But if this is really what you want, I will do it. I will tickle you as if you were Laura\", you say as you are preparing to tickle Becky ...</span></div></div>",

Soon she almost stops squirming and simply lays on the bed as the arms tickle her crazy. For more than half an hour the spell keeps tickling Becky until it finally starts wearing off.

Slowly it floats towards Becky's body, shooting a lightning bolt at her.<br>\r\nBecky shrieks, but not in pain. The ball-lightning only shares the name with the natural equivalent. But this ball is neither hot, nor causes pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bolts travel through the body, stimulating the nerves along it's way, to cause sudden burst of tickling sensations.<br>\r\nThis magic spell works almost completely inverse to the last one. <br>\r\nIt's not some kind of heavy tickle punishment, not even constant tickle punishment as there are breaks between the bolts. <br>\r\nIt also doesn't drain the endurance as much and it's not depending on the victim's weak spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the randomness and the speed of this spell are the criteria that define it the most and make it so special. <br>\r\nThe victim never knows when he/she will be tickled, but when it starts, it happens within an instant and there is nothing you can do about it. <br>\r\nSince the bolt enters the body, there is no way to protect your weak spots by covering them, not without rubber clothes or magic that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky keeps shrieking as the bolts travel through her body. During breaks she is still trying to persuade you to release her, but no, you two are not finished yet.<br>\r\nWhat Becky doesn't realize yet is, that she is in fact slowly regaining her stamina since she isn't tickled constantly.<br>\r\nThis is a fact that will make the next view hours so much more enjoyable, at least from your point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes you decide it's actually time for phase two of the ball-lightning spell.<br>\r\nWith one move of your hand, the ball splits into countless smaller balls, which attach to all different parts of Becky's body.<br>\r\nAfterwards they start sending electric impulses between each other. These impulses are not as strong as before, but now the whole body is affected at once, almost at the same time. It's more like some kind of teasing than actual tickling, but since the pattern of the impulses changes constantly an the pattern is still completely random it's quite unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ihihihihi Kehehehevin stohohohop this. Nohohoho mohohore lightning!\", Becky pleads.<br>\r\nThe effect of the spell is almost over anyways, but there is not way to cancel the effect of the spell now.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Becky, there is nothing I can do about this\", you answer with a little bit too much joy in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that Becky has reaches her mental limit. She starts mumbling some magic spell, but since she is laughing while doing so, you know that she completely blew it.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to do this? You know, what happened the last time you tried casting a spell\"<br>\r\n\"Ignoring your warnings, Becky continues with the spell while giggling and shrieking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize the type of the spell, normally it's meant for teleportation, but Becky made so many mistakes, she completely changed the type of the spell. Also she made so many mistakes, it's going to backfire at her for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me I didn't warn you\", you say while going a few steps back (you don't want to be caught in the effect afterall.)<br>\r\nMeanwhile Becky has finished her spell and like you predicted it completely backfires, hitting her own body.<br>\r\nOnly after the effect is over you recognize what Becky has actually done and what trouble she has actually gotten herself into ...</span></div></div>",

From the outside it looks like an iron maiden (thus the name), but from the inside it's completely hollow.<br>\r\nStill the iron maiden is so tight, it completely removes all mobility from the victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you can still hear Becky's laughter from inside, it seems that the ball-lightning hasn't completely vanished yet. <br>\r\n\"This time you've really done it Becky\", you say<br>\r\n\"You've gotten yourself into trouble again. I really was feeling sorry for you, you know. I almost wanted to release you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards your desk and grab your tool box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But like you and Miss Galacia said, you have to face the consequences of your actions. I'm afraid you leave me no choice but to take advantage of the iron maiden now\"<br>\r\nBecky, who is still laughing isn't responding (you most likely couldn't clearly understand her from the inside anyway)<br>\r\nCurrently Becky is still being teased by the ball-lightning spell, but the true purpose of the Iron-Maiden spell is completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt removes the mobility of the opponent and wraps around the whole body, except for the the soles, which are without any protection. The poor victim can not even move it's toes and has to endure whatever it's tormentor is going to do with them.<br>\r\nYou take a feather from the toolbox and slowly start tickling the right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky immediately reacts to this by laughing louder than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a seat in front of Becky's feet, draw a second feather and start to use both of them at the same time.<br>\r\nBecky is laughing and pleading inside the iron maiden, but outside don't understand a single word she is yelling.<br>\r\nThe tool box actually contains lots of useful toys: brushes, feathers and gloves of all kind and you are going to use all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while the laughter stops whenever you are granting Becky a short break, which means the ball-lightning is gone by now.<br>\r\nFor minutes you keep stroking the soles, moving from arch to and inbetween the toes, using every special trick you learned over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after what must have felt like an eternity for Becky, you decide that it's time to come to an end too (since the iron maiden also won't be there forever anyways).<br>\r\nIn the final stage you start using your own hands and even your tongue, which seems to drive Becky mad. The words have long stopped and all that you can hear by now is frenzied laughter from the inside of the iron maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen more minutes pass and the effect of the Iron-Maiden spell finally wears off. <br>\r\nBecky remains tied on the bed, without any energy left. Her hair is a mess and her body is covered in sweat.<br>\r\nYou unlock all of her restraints but Becky still doesn't move right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes pass with neither of you saying a word, nor moving.<br>\r\nThen Becky breaks the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe what just happened. You can be quite cruel you know\"<br>\r\n\"Are you mad at me?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I came to you after all. But I can't believe you had this sadistic side in you\". She smiles saying those words, while covering part of her face with one of her hands.<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't have mentioned Laura\"<br>\r\n\"I guess not. Just give me a minute to regain my strength\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move to the desk to get the watch and show it to Laura<br>\r\n\"Almost 2 hours?\"<br>\r\n\"I told you, you are stronger than you think\"<br>\r\n\"Wow Unbelievable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while Becky stand up and starts getting dressed again.<br>\r\n\"I guess, I have to call in sick tomorrow, there's no way I'm going to school like this. Not in a view hours\", she says while smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she finally leaves you call her name again.<br>\r\n\"Becky, wait. Since you had the courage to come here today I just have to tell you something too.\"<br>\r\n\"What is it?\", she answers with an astonished face.<br>\r\n\"You know, I have to admit something\"<br>\r\n\"Yea?\"<br>\r\n\"I kinda wasn't THAT selfless during the tournament you know.\"<br>\r\n\"hm?\"<br>\r\n\"You know I didn't want to ask you before, because I didn't want to take advantage of the situation, but know since you are standing here in front of me now\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not exactly sure what you are talking about\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I wasn't able to punish you in front of everybody like that, because I kind of have a crush on you. So would you like to go out with me or something?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh\"<br>\r\n\"I mean you don't have to. Like I said I didn't want to take advantage of the situation.

Hesitantly, hands shaking, you grip Becky by the hips, pulling her closer. When she doesn't protest, you slip your hands the rest of the way around her, encircling her waist and hugging her tight to your body. In response, she reaches up with both hands, rubbing them over your chest and shoulders, caressing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss is as light and fleeting as it is shocking and you stand in stunned silence as she pulls away after several long, wonderful moments. You gulp, feeling flushed and a little confused. You're still holding her by the hips, her skin feeling warm and wonderfully soft under your palms. You're struck by the sudden urge to tickle her but after the night you've just put her through, you're not sure it's a good idea to push your luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky smiles wanly, her own cheeks stained with colour. She lets out a tiny giggle, covering her mouth with one hand.You grin back stupidly, caught between a storm of disbelief and abject elation. Your mind is churning and your pulse a white-water torrent pounding through your veins. Your knees feel weak and for a moment you're not sure which of you is holding the other up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, Becky jabs you in the side, fingers spidering along your ribs in a quick, darting tickle. You dance back quickly, out of her reach, letting loose a yelping string of giggles. \"H...hey! What was THAT for?\" you demand, shocked. Becky flashes you a sly, teasing grin, wagging one finger at you chidingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was for taking so long to ask me out. Honestly, Kevin, I was beginning to think you'd NEVER find the nerve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops. Staring at her silently, eyes popping half out of your skull, it's a few moments before you can manage to find your voice again. \"You...you knew that I liked you?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I knew,\" Becky replied, rolling her eyes. \"No offence Keven but you're not the most subtle guy in school. I've noticed the way you steal glances at me whenever we see each other. And the way you get kind of shy and nervous when we're studying together. I...\" her voice breaks and her face turns red again. \"I wasn't TOTALLY sure, or course. I mean, you DO kind of have a reputation as a pervert.\" Well THAT stung. \"But after what happened during the tournament and how you forfeited the match just to help me I...I kind of put it all together.\"<br>\r\n\"I...um...oh.\" You stammer weakly, unable to think of anything more intelligent.<br>\r\n\"So yes,\" she said, continuing. \"I think I would like to go out with you. Or something,\" she added with a mischievous wink.<br>\r\nTurning away, she padded back to the door. She paused on the threshold, giving you a parting glance over her shoulder. \"See you later Kevin. I'm looking forward to our next study session together. I still need a lot of practise if I'm ever going to be as good as Laura. And you're not that bad of a teacher. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shut quietly and for a long, long time you could only stand there, staring at it blankly. Then, the full weight of what had happened struck you, all at once. You'd asked Becky out. You'd asked her out and she'd said yes! She kissed you and said yes! Did that mean she wanted to be your girlfriend? It didn't matter; she'd kissed you and said yes and she liked you too and she wanted to go out and she kissed you and she wanted to study together more and she liked you and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a tiny, laughing whoop of joy, jumping up and down and pumping your hands in the air. You look like a complete idiot but you don't care. You like Becky and she likes you back! You'd taken a gamble and struck Jackpot! Becky was by far one of the sweetest and nicest girls in school (not to mention one of the cutest). Granted, she was almost as inept at tickling magic as you were but hey, that just meant plenty of opportunities to practise together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so excited about this amazingly wonderful turn of events that you're not sure what to do now. There's no way you were going to be able to sleep now and even if you could, classes were scheduled to start in only a few hours.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Brian is laughing hard into his demonic handgag and bucking wildly, causing his quickly stiffening member to bob back and forth embarrassingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura, who had been watching her summoned creature worriedly, slowly turns back to face you, smiling with that same sinister smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some banishing,\" Laura teases, \"I don't even know why I worried. I should have known you'd screw it up. Now tell me, should I tickle your feet or your armpits before I let you submit to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp hard, but notice just over Laura's shoulder that the demoness is no longer tickling Brian; she seems to be sniffing the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're watching the demoness and trying to think up a spell to save yourself from Laura when the fiend suddenly drops Brian, exhausted and gibbering, onto the mat. The creature eyes Laura, licking her lips, and moves silently toward the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice the faint circle of protection that had been ringing Laura's feet, a necessary part of a summoning spell if the summoner wishes to control whatever they have summoned, is gone! Your banishment spell worked! Kind of ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature stomps with extra-planar silence until she's just behind Laura. You raise a hand feebly and point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, Laura ... behind you.\" You stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura scoffs, but suddenly seems to notice the eerie silence that should be filled with the sounds of Brian's tickle torture. Turning, she has just enough time for a terrified squeak before the demoness lunges, pinning your rival spread-eagle to the canvas with the speed and ferocity of a giant feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo! Wahahaha! How!?!\" Laura shouts between fits of laughter, as she-demon straddles her, holding Laura's wrists and ankles in place with her own, while her second pair of hands dig and tickle over Laura's helpless armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian is still on the other side of the ring, curled into a naked ball and giggling weakly. You crawl cautiously toward your partner, giving the demoness a wide berth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Please!\" Begs Laura, as the succubus halts her tickling momentarily to slowly lift Laura's shirt. \"I'll submit! Just banish her ... carefully this time! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's shirt catches momentarily on her stiff nipples, before sliding free of her chest and armpits, and settling over her eyes like a blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, noooo!\" Pouts Laura, her lips twisted into a terrified frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you submit,\" you reply. \"But if you submit now, the win would technically go to your friend there. But she'll return to her plane when the summoning expires, just be patient! Then you can submit to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura whines and hyperventilates as the seductive creature slides her long fingernails gracefully over her body; tracing along her armpits and ribs and back to circle around her shuddering breasts and sensitive nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inch over to Brian as you hear Laura's torture begin in earnest, the demoness' fingers dancing all over her exposed body in a superhuman blur. You realize with a devilish smirk that you <i>could </i> turn on Brian and force him to submit while Laura deals with the demon, and then get back to Laura once the fiend returns to her plane, thereby scoring double points!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's enticing, but also slightly evil. You and Brian could both just watch the show and then beat Laura together.</span></div></div>",

You stop and immediately remove the spell from Brian, who at this point has to be carried out of the ring. Since Laura is still being tickled by the demoness, you just wait until she submits. When she finally does, and the demoness goes back to her plane, you cast the same spell you cast on Brian on Laura. You lift up her head, and take off her shirt-blindfold. she has a look of pure dread on her face. You then take off her shoes, and she begins pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin, please. I'm sorry!\" Laura tries, but you cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry won't cut it. You aren't getting out of here until you submit.\" You respond. You begin tickling her in-between her ribs, which doesn't get much of a reaction. You then decide to tickle her breasts, which gets the necessary response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! STOP!\" Laura yells, which you do. You then roll her over and try a tactic from an old book you found. You grab her foot, pull them back and then cast a spell that gives you a rope, which you tie around her lower shins and waist. You then begin tickling her feet, while she screams in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T TAKE IT!!!!!!!\" Laura yells, while you tickle her feet. Your hand slips, and hits her butt on accident, which causes a scream.

She lets out muffled giggles and whines as they torture her helpless feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" you say \"And by the way, that spell is only canceled when the victim passes out so have fun having your feet tickled into unconsciousness\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this she whines out a muffled \"MMMMM HM HM HMMMM HMMM HMMMMM!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou take in the beautiful sight of her helpless feet being tortured while she's almost in tears from the torture, and then turn your attention back to Brian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"now\" you say \"Where should I start on you? that is, before the spiders arrive and do all the work for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no!

What the heck?!\" You shout, craning back to see several more animated limbs slithering ominously down toward you from the thickly foliate branches of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh no,\" you groan, as the tendrils holding your wrists begin to slowly lift you off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Becky!

Unsurprisingly, the pernicious plants quickly peel away your shorts and violently tickle your thighs and bottom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"GNNNNNFHAHAHA! NNNNT RRRRRR!

She begins to gibber madly, shaking and thrashing in an almost animalistic need to escape, even as the conjured arms of her spell continue to tease and tickle her into ever-higher hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step back, you run the spell you intend to cast over in your mind, making sure you have it right. It's a relatively simple spell; one of the first you learned. But, given your well-known reputation for fumbling even easy spells, you figure its better to be safe than sorry. When you're ready, you recite the cantrip, creating a long, stiff turkey feather to materialize in front of you. It bobs and waves around in mid-air slightly, following the motion of your hand. Meant more as a practice spell than anything practical, it nevertheless serves your purpose perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing with your hand, you bring the feather down, between Becky's legs. Through her tears and howling laughter, she watches the feather draw near, a look of pure terror filling her eyes. She shakes her head in denial, forcing out frantic protests and piteous begs between gut-wracking giggles. You ignore her and wave your hand forward, drawing the tip of the feather down the crease of her inner thigh. Lost in a haze of tickling Hell, Becky can do nothing but squirm and shake and laugh. You motion the feather to slid back up, shifting it inward to brush its teasing edge against the side of her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOHOHOHOHOOO! Please NOOO!\" Becky manages to choke out, letting out a shocked gasp at the feel of the feather gliding straight up her slit. You twirl the feather back and forth, teasing her lips and making her strain against the ropes holding her. Sweat is pouring down her naked body and as the minutes slowly tick away her shrill laughter is soon interposed by grunting moans and panting gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling completely entranced by the nightmarish torment you're inflicting on poor Becky, you go for broke and summon a second feather, that you set to slowly tickle and teasing the outsides of her lips. By this point, Becky's arousal is more than obvious, her pussy glistening wetly, her lips flushed and peeled open. and you use your first feather to tickle at her inner walls, occasionally bringing it up to swirl tiny circles around the stiffened nub of her clitoris, which is peeking out from beneath its hood and is practically vibrating from the torturously teasing attention that it's receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on you feather Becky's pussy, teasing and caressing every square inch of her quivering womanhood. You glide both feathers everywhere, swirling them into every nook and cranny, sending Becky into new heights of shrieking laughter and whimpering need. The only break you give her is when you're forced to pause and wipe off the feathers as they become soaked in her continuously flowing juices. Becky is bucking and thrashing in mindless torment, her voice sounding raw from the equal amounts of gasping laughter and erotic moans she's been utterly for the past ten or fifteen minutes. Her hips shake and tremble in her efforts to hump the feathers keeping her maddeningly on edge but the bonds of her own spell, which is still going strong, keep her from moving more than a few inches in either direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plehehehehease,\" she croaks out weakly, eyes unfocussed and rolling in her head as she twitches and giggles. \"Please let mehehehehehee CUHAHAHAHAHAAM! Oh FUCK ME PLEHEHEHEHEEEAAAASSSEEE! Let me cum! Let me cum, let me cum, letmecumletmecumletmecum. LET ME CUM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo wild is her desperation to achieve orgasm that you almost feel sorry for her. Several times in the past, you've found yourself at Laura's mercy and made to beg for release. The girl was a true sadist and knew how to keep you bucking and howling, sometimes for hours on end before finally allowing you to blow your load. You knew how poor Becky was feeling right about now. Which made payback feel all the more sweet. Sure, you'd much rather it was Laura sitting there, naked and screaming at you and begging to cum but hey, at this point you'll take whatever you can get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The magical hands that had been working them over allow you to take over, and apparently you're much better at it! She is almost whimpering!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her clit and nipples being worked over she seems to forget about her pits and her feet, her laughter dying down to a cute little \"ooooooohoohoohoohooh\" until finally she groans and gasps, letting out little giggles here and there. Poor girl, you almost feel sorry for her, but not sorry enough to keep from taunting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plant a kiss on the back of her head and fondle her boobs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to cum don't you hon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shamelessly nods and groans out a desperate \"uh-huh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start gently pinching her nipples twisting them like radio dials!

Where does SHE get off scolding ANYBODY for tickle sex torture? she's done it to you SO many times!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout letting up on Becky's poor, over-stimulated nipples, you whisper in her ear:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww, you need to cum so bad! Tell you what, I'll let you cum, but only if you can convince Laura to get you off\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky GASPS at this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oooohh nohoho plehehehez... plez Kevin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pipes up \"What are you telling her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Becky just sits there and tries to take it, but the complete stimulation of her nipples and clit combined with the tickle torture on her feet and armpits gets the better of her. Gazing at Laura with her big blue doe eye she desperately stammer out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Icant takeit!.... Laura, please make me cum! It's the only way he'll let me get off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura displays a look of fury you've never seen before, it's almost enough to make you wish you hadn't tried this. She glares at you and you half expect her to start shrieking at you. Instead, her response comes in an eerily measured, calm, and deliberate manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will get you back for this you jerk! And when I do, it will be worse than anything I've done to you in the past. I - Promise!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbs into the ring and kneels in front of poor becky, her clit and nipples being worked while her feet and armpits are tickled beyond belief. Becky just stares, giggling, moaning, begging her with her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any hesitation, or inhibition, Laura strokes Becky's hair and says \"You poor girl\" She kisses her soft lips for a long moment until, absently Becky's mouth opened and their tongs explore each other's mouths. they kiss harder and faster as the seconds go on, and passionate groangs can be heard throughout. Finally Laura lays on her belly, her head in between Becky's legs which are tied wide open to either side of the ring ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and gently Laura plants soft kissed on Becky's pussy, up and down, provoking a soft \"uh! uh! uuuuunh!\" from becky. Laura stops for a second to slide her tong up and around her clit. Becky groans<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uuuuhhhnnnnnh, oh not just my clit, please! I want.... oooooh!....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiles, she knows that Becky is a little bit new at sex and kind of shy, she finds this very cute, and a perfect opportunity to break her out of her shell a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plants several little rough kisses on her clit with a *smack, smack, smack, smack* Causing a cute little \"oooh!\" for every one. Then cruelly, she stops and says \"What? you gotta tell me what you want girl\" with a smirk, she waits for her answer, she can tell that Becky has to overcome her shyness and this makes her grin even wider as she hears her response\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh I want your fingers in me please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand behind a naked and tied up Becky, your hands working her nipples, looking over her shoulder and see Laura laying on her belly about to go down on her, you start to feel much like Becky her self! You are so hard and you want to jack off so bad! this only gets worse when Laura giggles and bends her kneed so that her feet are behind her back and facing you. She absently kicks them like she's having fun (and she is). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Becky, what was that? I couldn't quite hear you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan! Laura is mean to everyone! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky replies as loud as she has ever dared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please finger me and lick my clit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura giggles and slowly inserts two fingers into Becky's warm, wet pussy, the slowly glides them in and out as she leans in and starts aggressively working her tong over her clit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's shyness evaporates and she shamelessly coaches her and leads her on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Oh Laura! Oh yeah lick my pussy! oh it feels so good! Oh I'm gonna cum so bad!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiles and giggles even as she licks the poor girl's clit and fingers her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so distracted by this beautiful site that your hands stop what they were doing and you are frozen in awe. Becky notices almost instantly and what you hear as a result is music to your ears!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Kevin! Play with my nipples please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and giggle and oblige her, gently pinching and rubbing her nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man\" you say, \"Are your feet or your armpits even ticklish anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky giggle/moans at the reminder that two of her worst spots are being tickled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe replies \"ohohoho - oh Idno't care! tickle my feet, tickle my armpits, do whatever you want just don't stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's your next move?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your rubbed your ankles together and whimpered at the pink ribbon she'd used to bind your big toes together. The silly bow she'd tied left two strands of the velvet material hanging down across your taut soles and the movement of your feet let the soft fabric faintly tickle you causing you to squirm more and make it worse. Becky took you by the shoulder and smiled to the crowd at how you were essentially tickling yourself for her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I picked a color that really brings out your eyes at least.\" she said trying to hide how amazed she was at the fact that this had honestly worked.

This ribbon in particular was something she was proud of. The more you struggled the softer it would become and the worse the sooooft strands it dragged along your soles would feel to a ticklish screw up. Deep you down you believed you deserved this almost as much as Laura who licked her lips at the thought of ambushing Becky herself later and taking that particular little trick for herself later.<br>\r\nBecky planted a kiss on your cheek as your squirming brought a third and and then a fourth tendril from the ribbon. One joined it's fellows in tormenting your soles while the other wormed itself between your other toes. Becky's index fingers drilled into your sides and stepped slowly up to your defenseless pitties while you wondered where this Becky had been until you'd had the worst day of your sorcery career. Finally your poor, poor pits were tickled again and your squirming got so bad that Becky was having a hard time keeping you still enough to tickle. The ribbon was throwing out three, four and now five more tendrils wiggled down with one teasing your heels another dragging back over the tops while that third one started squirming up your knee. You tried to buck free in sheer desperation but it made it worse as now five, six, SEVEN extra tendrils wormed out of the glowing ribbon. They slithered all over not only your knees and ankles tickling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's fingers started tip-tip toeing towards your nipples but your eyes were more focused on the ribbon which now glowed sinisterly. </span></div></div>",

And she's produced a second set of arms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" she says \"We can start our wrestling match now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" you exclaim. \"No fair! you have an unfair advantage and you're not effected by the anti magic field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where you're wrong, my shapeshifting is a natural ability, not magic\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do is pout, everything she's done is perfectly legal. In situations where an anti magic field is in place, matches can be decided by  tickle wrestling match. In fact, this is encouraged to teach students what to do if their magic fails. there's just one problem, you're terrible at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you think, there's nothing you can do, and what's the worst that could happen? If she get's you in a hold you can't get out of you can always submit before she starts tickle torturing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume a stance your self, but you're pretty sure you're not doing it right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour match begins. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A leather gag tightly covers the whole bottom of your face and the desert sun beats down mercilessly. Sweat beads and runs down your nearly-naked body. A sign nearby reads \"Please see this sorry excuse for a wizard home safely. Or ...\" Near the sign is a barrel filled with feathers of every shape and variety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle against your bonds as you hear voices in the distance, and see figures emerge over the ridge!

Immediately you feel every breath of wind on your body! You begin bucking and screaming before either girl even touches you with a feather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing maliciously, both of them lay into you; one twirls feathers over your nipples and darts into your arm pits while the other saws between your wriggling toes. Every nerve of your body reacts one-hundred fold; you scream into your gag, writhing and struggling, but the girls only laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment of sheer cruelty, the woman in white yanks your sweat-soaked briefs down to your knees. She drops her feathers and attacks you with both hands; one hand sliding between your legs, toying with your ass, while the other runs its thumb up and down the underside of your shaft. You groan and shout into the gag, your voice growing hoarse. The blonde tortures your nipples and armpits with the flicking feathers as you thrust desperately against your bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan and pant, near-climax from the over-stimulation wracking your body when the girl in white quickly pulls her hands away, laughing. Taking the queue, the girl in red drops her feathers, while you shake and quiver, pleading desperately under the blinding desert sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was fun.\" Says the blonde in red, looking over the desert horizon, completely ignoring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun enough,\" says the dark-haired girl, as you mmmmmpppph and beg \"On to our test then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On to our test.\" Agrees the blonde. You writhe and squeal desperately as both girls continue into the desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou buck and groan under the desert sun, covered in sweat, about to burst.

Feeling leaves your feet, but you trudge on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore nightfall drowns the barren landscape in inky darkness, you see what appears to be a massive, iron-bound door set into a jagged outcropping of rock and ice on the horizon. Desperate for any kind of shelter you break into a clumsy, denumbed sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock at the towering double doors (no sense being rude), but there is no answer. With the rest of your waning strength you push mightily against the frigid oak and slowly it groans open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning before you is a tremendous hall! Massive bronze braziers line the ice-carved walls, filling the hall with a dim, but warm, light. You step trepidatiously forward, until the howling of the wind through the crack of the door is a distant whine. But another strange and rumbling sound grows louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end of the hall you see an incredible sight! Slumped in a cyclopean wooden throne, thunderingly snoring, is a huge man, well over 20 feet tall! A frost giant! His chain shirt jingles and his bone-white, braided mustache flutters with each exhalation. To his right is a lovely, but equally giant, woman; divested of every shred of clothing she is folded into large wooden floor stocks. Her head pokes through the center with her hands at either side, and her enormous bare feet just below them. Despite her contorted arrangement, she seems to be sleeping just as soundly as the other giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to consider the wisdom of coming any closer when the eyes of the woman open suddenly, focusing directly on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, brave magician! You come for the feather,\" she whispers loudly, with a thick Scandinavian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motions with her eyes toward the throne and you notice a scintillating golden feather resting on the lap of the sleeping giant. This must be the item you need to escape this pocket dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe she-giant groans and fidgets uncomfortably in the stocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free Helga from this contraption and I will give you the cursed feather!\" She pleads, smiling hopefully.<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm,\" you think, \"cursed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You draw back a thick-leaved branch and discover a campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep voices belong to several hulking, barbaric-looking men wearing breechcloths, ruddy body paint, and little else! One or two sit lazily around the crackling fire, sharpening strangely exotic weapons, but three of the stooped beasts are gathered around a pair of sturdy poles, hung horizontally between the crotches of trees. Dangling from the poles are a man and woman, bound at their wrists and ankles, bowed uncomfortably toward the forest floor, wearing only tight green shorts and a slight, green tanktop for the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relentless laughter is coming from the woman, a dark-skinned beauty, with short black hair and strong Mesoamerican features.

Well at least satisfied for now. One of the barbarians starts to untie the completely exhausted woman, while the others are talking. You can't quite understand what they are saying, but you can see that the biggest barbarian is giving something to the second biggest one. As you look closer you suddenly realize what it its. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a shard of the legendary shadow crystal and quite a big one. The shadow crystal nullifies all magic within a certain radius and this one seems big enough to prevent any magic spell within 50 feet.

What seems to be even worse is that they most likely have more than one shard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime both captives have been removed from the poles and their arms and legs have been tied with ropes. It seems that escaping is still no option for those two. The biggest barbarian of the group takes the male captive, the second biggest one takes the female captive and the group leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for one minute and then start to follow them.

Nonetheless you never lose track of the barbarians and after about half an hour they finally arrive at their destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's some sort of village, primitive, but still impressive. The buildings are made of stone and there are quite a few of them. You can see a big statue in the middle of the village and on top of it, there is a big, dark colored sphere. It must be another dark crystal and this one is big enough to protect the whole village from any magic spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of barbarians enter the village, but you have to stop here for now, if you want to remain unseen. The men and their captive enter one of the buildings at the border of the village. A moment later the barbarians leave, but it seems they left the dark skinned beauty inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you consider your options. As long as the dark crystal is protecting the village from casting spells, you won't be able to defend yourself properly. But then you realize that there is a loophole. It's impossible to affect anything with magic, that is placed inside the anti-magic-barrier. But you can affect things that are outside, and the effect won't be canceled once it enters the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately cast an invisibility spell on yourself. It's the only one you know, but it is quite powerful. You will stay invisible until a certain purpose has been fulfilled and right now your purpose is to save the poor captured woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you're invisible you move closer to the village and by doing so you start to hear laughter. At first it's silent, but with every step you take towards the stone building with the captured woman, the laughter gets louder and louder. You take a deep breath and enter the building. It seems to be some kind of prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see about 10 individual cells, with massive stone walls in between. Each cell contains a female prisoner. Some are chained to the wall and some of them have been fastened to the floor, but and all of them share the same fate. They are tickled without mercy by by a big brute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move forward, looking into each cell. None of them contain the woman you are looking for, until you finally reach the last cell. So this is where the poor woman has been taken to. There is another person inside the cell, the first female barbarian you have seen so far. Like her male counterparts, she is clad sparingly and parts of her skin have been covered with paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black woman has been placed in a pair of stocks and even her toes have been tied, so her feet have been completely immobilized. Additionally her hands have been tied behind her back. The poor captive is pleading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please not again, I can't take it any more. Please, I'm begging you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

She starts to tickle the soles of her feet with her long fingernails. The poor victim immediately explodes with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnoooooo waaaahahaha. Staahahahap. No mohohore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she had some time to recover, you can see that she is still pretty exhausted. No wonder, hardly one hour has passed since you have left the campfire and who knows how long she had been tickled there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Gorf told me your feet were especially ticklish and would require special treatment. You and I are going to have a lot of fun\", the barbarian says, without stopping the torture for even one minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer poor captive keeps screaming for mercy for a while, but soon just her laughter remains. It seems that she doesn't have enough strength left for yelling. Meanwhile you are still invisible and sitting in the corner. You are covering your ears and telling yourself that you are sorry and promising that you will save this poor woman from the tortures soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quite some time the barbarian woman stops the tickling for a moment. The captive seems to be relieved at first, until she realizes that her tormentor is just going to change her strategy. The barbarian woman takes two feathers and starts using them simultaneously on her victim's feet. The poor woman is sent into hysterical laughter once again. Channeling all her remaining power she starts to yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leeeeaaave my feeeet aaaloooone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian woman simply smiles and continues stroking those big soles, moving between the toes once in a while. The dark skinned beauty keeps laughing and pleading but none of it reaches the deaf ears of her tormentor. She keeps tickling the poor woman for hours without stopping for more than mere seconds. Only when the sun has almost vanished and the night is about to begin she finally stops the torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's stop here for a little while\", she says. \"I will give you some time to recover your strength, this isn't fun if the laughter becomes too silent after all\". She laughs for a moment and then continues. \"I will return soon and then we will carry on where we left\". She starts to leave the cell and before vanishing around the corner she says her final words. \"You are going to laugh the whole night\" And then she is gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark skinned beauty on the other hand is still breathing heavily. You can't even imagine how bad this must have been for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do now?</span></div></div>",

You may be invisible but the black woman is not. You are afraid that someone from the other cells might see her, but soon you realize that all of them are too occupied with either tickling or laughing. \"Come on, let's move\", you say while taking her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk towards the door and before leaving the building you take a look outside. \"We are lucky, nobody is watching. Also it's getting pretty dark. If we are careful, we should be able to escape. Let's move out quickly before someone catches us\", you say while trying to sound as brave as you can.<br>\r\nBoth of you take a deep breath and then you start running as fast as you can. For ten minutes straight you run full speed until your body suddenly becomes visible again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purpose of the magic spell has been fulfilled and the effect has worn off. The dark skinned woman stops running and starts talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I can see you, I can finally thank you properly. Let me first introduce myself, my name is Aya. And you have my eternal gratitude for rescuing me.

She seems to have gone hunting, because she is carrying a rabbit and a deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you managed to escape, but you are going to regret this, and your little boyfriend here will be my personal trophy\", the barbarian woman says while dropping the hunted animals and preparing for combat.

She has stopped her assault and is looking at her body as if she can't believe her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you have underestimated the reach of the anti magic barrier\" Aya says and starts to prepare another spell. You actually recognize this one, it's a powerful sleeping spell. The magic immediately affects the barbarian woman and she falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell just happened? It seems Aya realizes your astonishment and starts to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I am a Shaman, actually a descendant of a special bloodline.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay\", you answer, still amazed by the recent events<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya continues with her explanation. \"This is why I have been captured. I have something they want. This is also why they will realize my escape soon and they will start hunting me again. But I have a plan. Can you cast your invisibility spell once more? This time on the three of us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but why on her as well? Shouldn't it be enough to make us invisible\", you respond.<br>\r\n\"There is a reason I transformed her into a copy of me\", Aya says and you finally start to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cast the invisibility spell on you, Aya and the barbarian woman. Then you and Aya start walking back to the village again. It takes a while, because you have to carry the sleeping woman. Even though she now has the shape of Aya, she is still as heavy as she had always been.<br>\r\nThe three of you enter the stone building with the cells and move to the last cell, where Aya had furiously been tickled before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou help Aya tying the barbarian woman up in the exact same way Aya had been fastened. Immediately after you are finished, the invisibility spell of the barbarian woman fades away while you and Aya stay invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't finished yet\", Aya says and puts a gag into the captive's mouth. \"Now she won't be able to tell anybody the truth\" <br>\r\n\"Any if somebody removes it?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think they will believe her anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian woman starts to wake up and realizes that she can't move her body. She starts to scream for help, but only muffled sounds are coming from her mouth. Aya starts tickling the barbarian's feet, which immediately produces wild laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How I would love to give you the payback you deserve, but I guess I will just have to imagine your suffering at the hands of your friends\", Aya says. <br>\r\nThe captured woman screams as loud as she can, but you can't understand what she wants to say.<br>\r\nThe noise seems to have alerted one of the barbarians in one of the neighbor cells though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on. So eager to laugh again?\", he says and even though you can't see him yet, you can hear that he has started to move.<br>\r\nAya bends down to the captured female and whispers \"Now it seems that you are going to laugh the whole night instead of me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big brute enters the cell, moves towards the captive and immediately starts feathering her soles, which results in hysterical laughter right away. For a little while you and Aya keep watching the torture of the barbarian woman. But soon you finally leave the stone building and the village. The two of you run through the woods until the invisibility spell wears off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe we just did that\", you say to Aya.<br>\r\n\"You know what, me neither\", she answers. \"I hate that we have to leave all those women, but there is nothing we can do about them for now.\"<br>\r\n\"How long until they will realize that we placed a decoy?\"<br>\r\n\"The duration of the spell differs, but it will take at least several days\", Aya answers with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just realized that I never asked for your name\".<br>\r\n\"I'm Kevin\"<br>\r\n\"Okay Kevin, what are we going to do now?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to think about the available options and then you start to answer her question.</span></div></div>",

After what you just witnessed, you don't dare to move even an inch. If you get captured now, you would suffer the same fate or even worse. No, you can't risk it, at least not for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passes and the barbarian woman returns, this time with a man accompanying her. Without saying a word she starts to continue tickling the victims feet again.The poor woman doesn't take it very well this time. Almost immediately she starts begging and pleading. The short break simply wasn't enough to recover her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she completely snaps, yelling that she will tell them everything, if they just stop the treatment. This must have been what the barbarian woman had been looking for. The torture somewhat lessens, even though it doesn't completely stop. For the next 20 minutes, the captive woman tries her best to correctly spell a list of ingredients, while her soles are still being teased with a feather. Meanwhile the male is writing down every word on a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally has finished talking, the barbarian woman tells him to leave. Completely exhausted the captured woman summons her last strength to speak.<br>\r\n\"You have what you wanted. Now let me go, leave me alone finally\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer captor grins with an evil smile as she starts to target her feet with the feather again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's true that we got what we wanted, but I never said anything about letting you go. I didn't even say anything about stopping the torture or any breaks. I said that you would be going to laugh the whole night though and I'm afraid that I have to keep my promise, otherwise my words wouldn't be worth much anymore, would they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely shocked by this statement, the dark skinned beauty keeps pleading and begging, but it's useless. The evil woman keeps feathering her soles till the sun rises. But the poor woman's ordeal doesn't stop at this point. Every single night, she has to suffer the worst imaginable forms of tickle torture one can imagine. It takes weeks, listening to all the barbarian's in the village, until you realize what the woman gave to the barbarians during that fateful night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ingredients are needed for a magic potion, which cancels all magic spells for about 3 hours on each person, who drinks it. Without the need of shadow crystals, the barbarians used this potion to conquer others. At first rivaling tribes, then other cultures and races. You heard that the magic school was able to defend themselves pretty long, but in the end even they had no chance without the use of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Each day new female prisoners are brought to the village, which grows at an unbelievable speed, while the male prisoners are brought to a village that is located nearby. The captives are used as tickle slaves to satisfy the barbarians desires. Among the ones you recognize are Laura, Becky and Kelly as well as other colleagues and even teachers from the magic school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all of that happened, because you were too scared to act at the most important time. Since you didn't rescue the black woman, you never became visible again. Hiding yourself with the magic spell, you manage to survive by stealing from the barbarians. Guilt and fear prevent you from leaving this place. Thus you are doomed to listen to the hysterical laughter of the innocent victims for the rest of your sorry life</span></div></div>",

You happened to be wearing a T shirt and jeans when you were transported, but you regret being barefoot, however you're grateful for the extra upper body armor considering the tickle traps that might be in a forest setting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get as close to the voices as you dare, and you see the source of them. There appears to be, what looks like some kind of training center in the middle of this forest. Monkey bars, and obstacle course, and the like. You see trainees all over the place and doing all kinds of exercises, and they all appear (of course) to be related to tickling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the trainees are barefoot, the guys are shirtless and the girls are in only a bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see a kind of wooden plank suspended high in the air, below there appears to be a pit of some kind, and two contestants, both guys, one blond the other with black hair, walk toward each other on the plank. you feel nervous for them, the plank is only about three feet wide. the contestants carefully approach each other, your heart skips a beat as one of them loses his balance and nearly falls, but he recovers and continue toward his opponent, who seems to have better balance, he seems to have a little more experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two meet in the center and begin grappling trying to knock the other into the pit below. You can't see what's in the pit form your vantage point but both of them seem terrified of being thrown in. They lock up, almost like they're doing a test of strength, the black haired guy almost immediately overpowers the blond and he groans at the prospect of falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move to try and see what on earth is in the pit below, but unfortunately this draws the attention of one of the instructors. He sounds some kind of alarm and a crowd of students and instructors rush toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and run, you manage to keep  good distance between you and the mob, you're tarting to feel confident about an escape when all of a sudden: WOOSH! A tree vine 'snaps' around your ankle and hoists you up, holding you upside down. You groan, knowing what kind of trap this is and what it does to keep the victim pacified. You have less than a second to regret being barefoot before another bransh comes over and starts tickling your helpless foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOOOOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!!!! you cry<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle against the vine and try desperately to reach your ankle, it looks like you're trying to touch your toes upside down and it must look hilarious because as soon as the mob catches up with you they stop and watch you as your poor foot is tortured and you flail around trying to protect yourself from the torture. Eventually you become exhausted and give up. You let your arms go slack over your head and just take it as the branch scribbled up and down your defenseless bare foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay he's had enough\" One of the instructors say, and the vine, mercifully lets you go. Humiliatingly, you let out some aftershock giggles even after your tormentor lets you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take him to the training grounds, if he's a hostile maybe we can tickle torture some information out of him, if he's friendly, well, we can always use another recruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey take you to an office at barracks at the training grounds. A guy and a girl are present they're both wearing the same outfit, you assume it's the standard uniform that these people wear. A white tank top and black shorts.

Peeking nervously into the chasm you see a roiling mass of spectral, humanoid figures, they stare at both of you hungrily, reaching toward you with sinister, tendril-like fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel notices your worried expression and teases: \"Not familiar with Lust Spirits, eh? Don't worry, I'll give you a formal introduction in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretches athletically before diving gracefully out over the pit and effortlessly catching hold of a metal crossbar. She smiles and now you can see her remarkably well-toned arms and lats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard, gather your courage, and inch cautiously toward your opponent, hand over hand, acutely aware of the sea of menacing creatures flailing rapaciously several feet below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel comes at you like a flash! In an instant she's hanging inches away from your face as you awkwardly maneuver. Deftly she brings her knees up to her chest and drives her glossy, wiggling toes into your helpless armpits. You turn and buck wildly, as you explode in a torrent of screaming laughter. You never even had a chance. The laugh and beg between fitful gulps of air, but it only seems to encourage Rachel to tickle you harder, her slender toes dance under your chin and up and down your ticklish sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to end the torture you let go of the bar and lunge toward your tormentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cry of astonishment erupts from the crowd when your wild flailing arms lock around Rachel's hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh! What the heck are you doing?!\" The surprised girl squeals! \"Let go, you idiot! You lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel begins undulating and squirming, hopelessly trying to shake herself free but your terror-induced grip is like iron. You stare despairingly down at the sea of lust-maddened phantasms clawing and flicking just inches below your dangling feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMocking giggling grows among the crowd of onlookers as both you <i>and </i>Rachel's shorts begin sliding slowly down her sun-darkened thighs, revealing a blindingly untanned groin and butt, and a well-manicured chevron of dark pubic hair. Rachel gasps and her face flushes cherry red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour opponent really starts struggling now while a stream of high-pitched, unmentionably foul curses and threats pour out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and her pants slide reluctantly over her knees and you suddenly feel the first ghostly fingers poking coldly at your wriggling soles and clenching feet. It's the most insanely ticklish thing you've ever felt and right now it's only a few of them attacking your feet; the pit seems boiling over with hundreds more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip on the monkey bars slipping with the added weight of your body and very public humiliation, Rachel gathers her strength for one last shuddering attempt to buck you off ...</span></div></div>",

As both of you howl in horror, you fall into the midst of the Lust-Spirits as the crowd watches on, giving a cheer at seeing you both make the plunge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fall slows the instant you fall among the Lust-Spirits, preventing you from crashing to the bottom. This proves to be a small comfort though as the tickling starts the instant you stop in the middle of the spirits, their ghostly fingers probing your body as they start their torment. You instantly burst into laughter, the spirits themselves not preventing you from breathing or making a sound as you feel the fingers skitter up and down your sides and legs as the torture begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before they start to slide your clothing off, your shirt and trousers being pulled off as more fingers tease and tickle your exposed flesh. Your screams get even louder as fingers stroke around your nipples, the soft nubs of skin proving to be highly sensitive as they're flicked and teased. Even more tickling goes over your skin, your feet tormented by rapid wriggling of the fingers of the the Lust-Spirits, the ghostly faces looking gleeful as they make you writhe in torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst is yet to come however when you feel your boxers yanked off your body, leaving you utterly vulnerable and exposed as they descend onto your penis.  Already full erect, your cock twitches as it feels the soft teases coming from the Lust-Spirits. Their fingers stroke your erection from the base of your cock to the very tip, just enough to tickle the highly sensitive organ but never enough to push you into an orgasm. One finger in particular wiggles right below the helmet of your cock, your high pitched screaming and laughing aided greatly by its work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang in this state of torment for some time before you manage to open your eyes, blinking back tears as you see an extra torture added onto what you're already going through. Rachel has also lost her clothing and is currently being held just above you, her gorgeous naked body jiggling about with each tickle she gets to her sensitive spots. Both of her nipples are being services, her breasts bouncing around as she babbles and pleads for mercy through her laughter, loud moans coming from her showing that she was being sexually teased just as much as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose track of time as the tickling goes on, your arousal overwhelming as your cock is teased and you're forced to watch Rachel's naked body writhe just out of your reach. You honestly feel as if you're going to lose your mind when...</span></div></div>",

You suppose you could have asked, but Rachael has been pissing you off and, whatever is in there, you really want to knock her into it! Plus you can't take much punishment on your armpits so that kind of ruled out the monkey bars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you remove your shirts until you're shirtless and she's in only a bra and you climb the ladder until you reach the top. A whistle blows and you both start carefuly walking toward each other on the narrow plank. Keeping your balance is even harder than you would have imagined and you're even more worried about falling. \"Wait a minute\" you think \"Falling into what? what the hell is down there\" You carefully decide to look down and then you see what looks like a sea of ghosts below you in the pit! It startles you so much that you lose your balance! you wave your arms around trying to regain but it's no use; fortunately you're able to guide your self forward and you fall onto your belly on the plank. you wrap your arms around it desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael laughs, carefully continuing to approach you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly get your self to your feet, she says...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're called lust spirits; whoever falls in will be in for a long night of having every bad tickle spot on your body getting tortured at once while every hot spot is teased, and I mean \"teased\"! they're pretty mean and I think they like adding orgasm denial to the torture, it kind of simulates the stasis field that the alphas use, we designed it to instill a strong dislike of losing to one\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan! What have you gotten your self into!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The person who falls in usually tried to claw, swim, or find some way to get out, but it's like being the ball pit at Chuckey Cheese's, you can't get any traction. you just have to wait until they get bored with you\" She smirks s she put an emphasis on the word \"YOU\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now you're back on your feet but absolutely terrified of falling in the pit! But you have no choice, you're gonna have to fight your way out of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael finally reaches you and grins condescendingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should just jump in and get it over with honey, no need for you to get any more embarrassed by losing to a girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a flash of rage, more than anything in the world you want to push her in! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can't loose to a rookie recruit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds her arms out to either side as her balance gets even worse and her little hops become more erratic.

She wobbles and holds her arms out for extra balance. You get an evil idea and tickle her armpits one at a time while she has them out. she closes her eyes and giggles, leaving them up , apparently she'll take the torture in exchange for balance. you tickle her foot which you so expertly caught. she looks like she's going to cry as she whines out in tortured laughter, but she holds her arms up as if to say \"I'm not resisting just don't push me over!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou tickle her bare foot for a while longer and then stop. she seems to know what you intend to do as you start moving her leg up and down, she really looses her balance, looks at you and lets out a soft \"no\" . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou nod your head and grin. \"Have fun being tickle tortured and teased\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnononono pleeez!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and by the way, whose the cute one now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push her lug upward and she goes tumbling into the pit! \"NOOOOOO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb down the ladder as fast as you can to get down there. When you finally arrive at the pit you see that the spirits have removed her shorts and bra. Her arms are being held at her sides and her legs spread egale.

The tickle torture combined with the sexual stimulation is too much and she starts giggle groaning and begging for release! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry hon\" you say \"looks like you're gonna be tortured for a while, maybe next time you'l try harder to win\" You wave sarcastically at her and start to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou hear her groaning and giggling and begging incoherently. suddenly you have a second thought and walk back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOOOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO PLEEEEEEZGETMEOHOHOHOHOHOHUT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou look at her, completely helpless, this really is the worst torture you can imagine. considering her predicament a bit longer, you reach in. she groans in relief as if her rescuer has arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her wrists and lift her arms up. they're held in place and you start to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here\" you say \"Get her armpits too\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs all you hear as you walk away and leave her to suffer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've teamed up with another recruit named David and the two of you have reeked havoc in the training core. In every event requiring teams you dominate and teas have started to fear you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's an \"anything goes\" training ground, the motto being \"do everything that the Alpha's would do  and you two have spent the last 7 days making the most of it. Almost every victory ends in forcing a blowjob from your opponents in order to stop the ruthless tickle torture you inflict on them. Once in a while you'l even have an opponent on her knees sucking you off and you'l make her reach up and play with your nipples while you tickle her armpits, ''while she's blowing you!' you've been doing this as more and more you enjoy the humming sensation from the relentless giggles, and plus the girl usually goes harder and faster in order to get the ruthless assault on her pits over with more quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese kinds of tactics and terms of submission have earned you and David the reputation of being \"mean\", and so you've happily adopted the nickname \"the mean boys\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour days ago the lust spirits finally got bored with Rachael, that means that they worked her nipples and played with her clit white tickling her armpits, sides, ribs, belly, knees and feet for three whole days! from what you've been able to gather she would usually pass out every hour or so, wake up giggling and moaning and beg to get off. You actually felt sorry for her and were a little glad to hear that the spirits let her get off every once in a while. Of course she'd pass out immediately after climax, but apparently, while she giggled and moaned even harder from being made more sensitive after cuming, but even more interesting, she apparently would call out \"Oh Kevin, oh fuck kevin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou smiled at this when you heard it, and you loved knowing that she had to take all that torture while you were racking up wins and getting blowjobs from your opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's spent the last four days recovering, and apparently she's back to normal. You heard that she even wants to set up a revenge match with you! upon hearing this you sent word to her that you primarily fight tag team matches now, and that you don't feel you have anything to prove since you beat her, an elite, as a rookie, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou were about to go about the tasks of your day when you got word back that she will fight BOTH you and David and she'll allow magic to be used!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe it! she's so desperate for revenge that she'll stack the odds against her like that? Two opponants haven't been able to beat you two let alone one! and that was with no magic! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou send word back that if she feels like enduring more torture so soon after recovering who are you to stop her, and the match takes place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe three of you end up in a ring together, you and David wearing only black boxer shorts with \"The mean boys\" stenciled on them, and Rachael wearing a white tank top and black shorts uniform of the elite Beta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well\" you say \"How are your nipples and clit feeling after being rubbed raw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe glares at you but says nothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And oh\" you continue \"Sorry I lifted your arms up and left you there to take it, I figured you were getting it everywhere else your pits must be jealous\" you smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe looks PISSED! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if you're talking so much shit when the match is over!\" she growls <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou laugh \"Bring it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that Brian doesn't really have any magic skill, but that doesn't really matter, you doubt that Rachael does, so you prepare a simple spell to bring her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna love tickling your armpits while you suck me off like a 2 dollar whore, then you can do David here\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Please No!\" you beg, but your arms are frozen over your head leaving your sensitive nipples wide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe starts rubbing your nipples, making you moan and giggle but every now and again she pinches and tweeks them making you yelp and grunt pathetically.

Of course you'l have to live with the shame of being so desperate to get off that you got a blowjob from a guy\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe she's doing this to you. The hands have been tickling your pits, feet, stomach and sides for over an hour and they've worked your nipples until you'd do practically anything to get off! Making Dave do it would be too humiliating, for both of you, but you don't think you can take anymore! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you work this around in your head and your nipples and tickle spots are being worked into a frenzy, rachael stretches her legs out so you're forced to stare at her sexy feet, just to add insult to injury. she knows exactly what she's doing and she loves it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAARH!\" you growl and then, \"oooooh aaah, ohpleez!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe rolls her eyes (and wiggles her toes for more torture) \"The only relief you're going to get is from your partner, although he might not appreciate it when he snaps out of it\" she smiles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to giggle moan while the ghost hands start to focus on your nipples and pits, one sensation playing off of the other, you're forced to stare at Rachael's feet which turns you on even more, your erection is throbbing and you can't take anymore.

You're so horney that you'd fuck anything, even though you're not gay, his olive skin and flat stomach seem strangely attracted to you, your neurons are all over the place and misfiring everywhere, you look back at Rachael's feet and you can't take anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls you tortured and humileated have been looking on and rooting sarcastically for you to get one from your partner, you don't want to give them the satisfaction but you're done, you're so desperate for release you'l do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours of the ghost hands working over your feet, pits and nipples, you close your eyes and blurt out \"Daveplezsuckmydick!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe reaction is instantaneous, the girls giggle and laugh at you and Dave walks over, stands you up on your feet, gets down on his knees and starts sucking you off. You stare at Rachael's feet while your cock is worked hard by your partner, you know you won't last long as she starts wiggling her toes, almost tauntingly. Suddenly she orders David to reach up and play with your nipples and before you know it they're getting double stimulation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're ready to blow! You groan and moan as Rachael orders you to tickle Davids armpits just like you guys would do to the girls! You know this is one order you could easily refuse, she could never order dave to stop before you cum, you're so close; but you're head is in a suggestable fog and you immediately obay, you reach down and gently claw your partner's pits and you feel the hum as he giggles while he continues to blow you. One last look at Rachael's feet you you explode in his mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOOOOOH FUUUUCK AAAAAAAAAAAH!!!! OOOH FUCK YEAH!!!!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou groan out, you shamelessly fuck your partners mouth as you cum your brains out! Forgetting whose it is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe girls all laugh, cheer and high five eachother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you collapse in a heap on the mat and so does David when Rachael snaps her finger. You shutter to think how he'l react when he wakes up but right now you hardly care, you moan through a wave of aftershocks, both from the tickle torture and from the blowjob you just got. you lay on your back and jerk your self off a little as your chest heaves up and down and you groan with every breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and see Rachael standing over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"kiss my feet\" she orders<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou obey without hesitation and then pass out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wraps around you like a cocoon and you feel the same fibers that have been tormenting your feet now get your stomach, ribs, armpits, as well as your thighs, behind your knees, and your neck.

Your back begins to ache, swinging back and forth by your wrists and ankles, but you get a pretty good look at the forest floor which is, unsurprisingly, an unbroken sea of tangled vines and foliage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long while you emerge into a large clearing, lit by hundreds of low, flickering torches. The unmistakable sound of reluctant, breathless laughter catches your attention and you see the source is a well-muscled, barbarian, one of two, bound tightly with yards of vine to two mighty boughs flanking the entrance to a village of huts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked barbarians are bound to the trees a couple of meters from the forest floor, and a small crowd of tittering, mail-bikini-clad women have surrounded one of the them and are taking turns gleefully tickling his helpless feet!  The other brutish captive looks on with helpless embarrassment and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman carrying you approaches, she admonishes and shoos the frolicsome torturers away, much to the relief of the tortured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are carried through a wide outer ring of huts and dwellings, drawing a crowd of the strangely appareled jungle women, until you come to the center of the village, where a breathtakingly beautiful blonde woman, with strange runic tattoos on her body, reclines in a massive throne of horn and wood before a great bonfire. She is flanked on either side by several scantily clad spearwomen who aren't too hard on the eyes either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the bonfire from the jungle queen a pair of spearwomen hold one of their kind by the shoulders: a slim woman with short, auburn hair, and long, sinuous legs. Statuesque amazons of every variety ring the fire, watching the proceeding intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fiery amazon that captured you, queues up behind the three women opposite the throne and drops you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where are these transgressors now?\" asks the commanding blonde on the throne of horn and wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They escaped, my Empress,\" replied the amazon between the two spearwomen, hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp went up from the assembled crowd, and a savage looking, ebony-skinned woman to the right of the throne hissed through her teeth. The \"Empress\" merely sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The outlanders violated our Mother Forest, looked upon our Sacred Grove, and returned to their blasphemous outpost?!\" Asked the Empress, increasingly agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have powerful magic, Empress!\" said the auburn-haired woman, straining in the grip of the spearwomen on either side. \"I was preparing to interrogate their leader when a great sleep fell upon me! When I came to, our captives were gone. It won't happen again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No it won't,\" replied the Empress, looking suddenly dour. \"This trespass and humiliation has wounded our Jungle and She must be healed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empress, no, I ...\" Began the auburn-haired woman, but the Empress cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyel'ah, <i>you</i> must heal this wound. Take her to the Briar!\" Shouted the Empress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of amazons cheered and hooted at this while the auburn-haired woman was forcefully dragged out of view, begging and pleading not to be taken to the Briar. As the crowd slowly quiets, your crimson-maned captor carries you toward the bonfire, where the three women stood previously, dropping you again to the ground, amid the rekindled whooping and noise of the assembly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Kass'alt, what have you brought for us?\" Asked the Empress, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the transgressors, Your Greatness. I found him in the forest, someone bound his feet in prodvine.\" Explained your captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a transgressor!\" You shout, \"I'm a student of magic, I was j ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the nod of the ebony enchantress flanking the Empress, your captor stuffs her foot into your mouth, interrupting your explanation and effectively gagging you. You consider biting down, but quickly think better of it. You just sit there, with half an amazon foot in your mouth, humiliated and a little grossed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm,\" said the Empress, pressing her finger to her chin. \"A transgressor, but an enemy of our enemies. You have seen their camp, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head with some difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you know their ways as well,\" said the Empress. \"That could be valuable to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Your Highness,\" shouted the dark woman on her right, \"he is a transgressor! He must heal the forest. To the Briar with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, many among the barbarian women cheer and holler. Many, but not all. The Empress sits contemplatively a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing hogtied on the ground with an amazon's foot for a gag is undesirable, but you feel like the Briar, whatever that is, is infinitely less desirable. For an achingly long time you lie there, looking pleadingly to the Empress to have mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Empress rises and extends her arm toward you and declares ...</span></div></div>",

The crowd of assembled warrior women cheer and hoot bestially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan and roll your eyes. <i>Of course it'd be the Briar! If it weren't for bad luck after all ...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to your fate you can only hope maybe they'll get you out of this hogtie before the whole Briar thing, your back's starting to ache and you've long ago lost feeling in your fingers and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly your captor withdraws her foot from your mouth. You work your jaw a bit and try to dislodge the motes of dirt and debris from your tongue with a frenzy of spitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are once again hoisted up by the ropes on your wrists and ankles and carried away from the glow of the fire and the clamor of amazons. Carried and deposited into a small earthen hut, one of several lined up in a dark corner of the village. Though it's more of a tiny shed than a hut really. And although the ceiling is rather high you probably couldn't fit more than two people in here at a time without it getting extremely awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat assumption is soon validated when your captor undoes the rope between your wrists and ankles (finally!) and two more strangely arrayed women push into the shelter. Somehow the three of them manage to maneuver you so that you are hanging by your wrists from the ceiling, the tips of your toes just brushing the dirt floor, if you really stretch. Forced into a tiny space with three beautiful women constantly bumping into you and brushing against you with their bodies, you almost forget the incredible amount of danger you're probably in. But the glint of something in one of the woman's hands quickly brings you back to reality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing the worst, you're almost relieved when she takes the shard of obsidian and cuts only your clothing. Soon you are naked and, much to your embarrassment, very aroused, but none of the women seem to care one way or the other as they go about their machinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick, syrupy salve is scooped from stone pestles and smeared onto your body in esoteric designs and runes, paying special attention to all of your most ticklish spots. You flinch and giggle and moan, but the women ignore you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished, they leave the hut and you dangle there confused and humiliated. If this is the Briar, it doesn't seem all that bad. You're dreamily reminiscing about the strange massage you'd just been treated to when a small breeze wafts into the hut and sends you into a ticklish spasm! The light brushing of your toes against the floor causes you to scream with laughter! Awash with terror you realize the mystery salve has somehow made you even more ticklish, absurdly ticklish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything that follows is a delirium of breathless squealing laughter and ticklish agony. The three women return after some time and carry you off into the woods, along a tangled path illuminated by low, dimly burning torches. You arrive at a clearing on the edge of sheer cliff, all around cluttered up with double sets of crudely hewn stone pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging between one of these sets you see through thick tears of laughter, the leggy amazon Kyel'ah, from the Empress' audience, stretched in a taut X, naked and covered in the strange tickle goop, laughing and shuddering in the breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women tie you to a pair of columns a few feet from Kyel'ah, who is all the while struggling and laughing and begging to be released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce restrained the amazons, who previously had been very stoic and mechanical, begin tickling you with animal ferocity. You scream and plead while the women mercilessly tickle your sensitive and exposed armpits, and flick at your tender nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour red-headed captor drops to her knees and begins raking her nails of your desperately scrunching feet, and poking between your helpless toes. One of the other women starts at your stomach and works slowly down between your legs, variously brushing gently and wiggling with her long, sinister fingers.
