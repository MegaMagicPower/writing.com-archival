He was waiting for his dad to return from a new buisness deal for some other hair brained scheme for the square. Peter knew it would probably fail. It usually did with his dad. Ian wasn't the worlds greatest buisnessman, although he often thought he was. As for Peter, he had more sense than his dad. However, life hadn't been so good for the young Beale. He recently had to dump his girlfriend Lauren (with a little persuation from her dad) and he had been on a slight downer ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored as he was, he began looking around the pub. There were the usual mix of regulars and faces he's never seen before. Peter was so bored however, his eyes diverted his attention to some of the girls in the pub. He coulden't help but look, he was at the age when he began getting more curious about girls. Across the bar, he saw Stacey Slater. He had always thought she was pretty hot. He admired her fine legs as she wore a short skirt as usual. Her large bulging breasts clung to a tight top. She was drinking with her friend Danniele Jones, who was also pretty sexy but hadn't quite developed the features of her friend yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes scanned across the bar to the pub owners niece, Ronnie Mitchell. She was still in good looks for her age and looked like she had just came back from a jog, her beautiful figure clasped against her tight tracksuit. Her well crafted ass stuck out like a light from the bottoms. His eyes then skimed across to Chelsea Fox. She was a young and beautiful black woman who was drinking with her farther on the far end of the pub. She was wearing another low cut top, which showed off her beautiful clevage. Her breats bulged through a tight top, which Peter admire with glee. He closed his eyes and began to think of other girls; his ex-girlfriend Lauren Branning, her hot mother Tanya Branning, the neighbourhood girl Whitney Dean, the mid 20's mother Dawn Swann and even his own sister Lucy Beale, all pulling off sexy poses Peter created in his imagination. Peter smiled as his bulge grew in size just on these thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter opened his eyes and his mouth felt a little dry. He got up to go and get a drink from the bar paying the bartender with his pocket money. However, earlier in the day, an old Mitchell family drink had got mixed in with some of the orange juice suplies. It was no drink however; it was a magical potion. Peter began to feel dizzy and lightheaded after he drunk the orange juice. He almost thought he was drunk untill he began to get a pain in his stomach. Still dizzy, he stumbled too...</span></div></div>",

His sight had blurred and he felt himself bump into several people on the way. Voices were sounding out from every corner of his mind. He's head was spinning but hsi mind tried to focus on the pain in his stomach. It was not like any other pain he had experienced. It was grinding him apart inside. Peter reached the toilets and fell onto the sink. He barely managed to hold himself up against the the sink. He was going to be sick. He could feel the vomit racing up his throat. It was tingling through his body, the feeling reaching every part of his body. He then threw up and blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Peter woke up, he coulden't feel a thing. He felt numb, his eyes still hazy from the drink. He looked around and didn't know whether he was dreaming or not. He could not make out what was going on. He was thinking he was seeing the toilets but from the ceiling instead. Peter began to panic, he tried moving around. He rushed around in circles, eventually finding a way out of the grey and white room through an open window. He flies at great speed through the air into the centre of the square. As he flies, he's see the outline of a girl walking across the square. Peter tries to steer away but he can't control himself. Whatever sort of strange spirit he had become, he was being drawn to the girl. He hit her in the mouth and began to decend into darkness. After a few minutes Peter awoke yet again. He was lying on the grass of the square. He's head was still spinning after what just happend. He began to look at his hands. However, they were not his as they were more smooth and feminine. He brung a hand to his chest and felt something soft and round. These features were those of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya Branning: 32, white, female, large breasts, nice natural curves, hot ass, beautiful face, smooth long legs, mother of his ex girlfriend, salon owner, in a relationship with her former husbands brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey Slater: 20, white, female, beautiful long legs, nice sized breasts, nice ass, beautiful face, worked on the market with her Mo and Dannielle, in a relationship with her new boyfriend Callum after divorcing her ex husband Bradley Branning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore charecters and descriptions in other choices option.</span></div></div>",

They were now slim and femeinine with nail extensions on the fingers. He looked down and saw he was wearing a white buisness top with a tight black skirt. He also wore 4 inch pump high heels on his feet. Beneath his top, there were two large lumps. Peter poked a hand through the button holes in his shirt an felt they were being in by something. It was a silky white bra which held what Peter had strangly been suspecting; beautiful C cup breasts. \"How the heck did I get these!\" Peter said in confusment. However, Peter did not hear his own 14 year old voice but that of an older woman's, and he had a sneaky suspiction who is was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter needed to confirm his thoughts and got up quickly to investigate. He nearly fell over again though after stumbling in his new high heels. He eventually began to waddle his way over to a nearby car to check the reflection in the window. Peter had many emotions running through his head; excitment, panic, amazment, fear, confusion. Peter noticed his ass and hips strangley moving fluently from side to side as he walked. When he reached the car, the reflection confirmed what many of the voices in his head had been hoping for. What Peter saw was no longer the reflection of a 14 years old boy. Instead, he saw the relection of Tanya Branning, a 32 year sexy salon owner who Peter had the hots for ever since she arrived in the square. \"Oh my gosh...this is...unbelivable. I'm..I'm misses...Lauren's mum...hot Tanya Branning!\" Peter said in utter amazment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to stare down at his new body. All Tanya's features were there. He felt the curves of her body with his hands, which then moved up and groped her breasts tightly. Peters new female nipples hardened from the sensitivity. His hands then moved around to the back and graped two handfulls of her hot curved ass. Peter jumped forward slightly after squeezing his buttcheeks. \"This is amazing, how do girls live without touching themselves constantly!\" Peter said to himself. He admired his beautful face in the reflection, his hands stroking his new blonde locks of hair. He began to pull off sexual poses, blew himself a kiss and even darted his tongue between his two fingers. 'This may be weird but I think I'm liking it.' Peter thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what to do next???</span></div></div>",

Not only was he now an adult and a woman, but an incredibly sexy one who he had always wanted to see 'a bit more of'. \"Damm, I can do so much with Tanya now.\" Peter said to himself. Some very appealing images began flashing in Peters mind. He was an adult now so he could go down to the strip club just a few roads from the square. Him and his friends often pased by it on the way home from school and joked about it every time. Today, however was your lucky day. You could go there 4 years early!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther thoughts began to circulate in your head. You could go back to Tanya's place and give yourself some quality time with your new found assets. Peter began to think hard, scanning Tanya's thoughts. He discovered that he had at least an hour and a half of playtime with the body. Jack was working at the club, Lauren was at her friends house and Abbie and Oscar were over at there grandma Dot's house. This was plenty of time for a fondle fest. 'Damm, so many choices...'

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter eventually decided he wanted to go to the strip club. This was going to be fun for him now. Not only was he going to a strip club, but he was going a sexy adult woman and he could even drive there! Peter retrieved his new handbag from the floor and scanned Tanya's memories to find out which car was his. He found it in the shape of a people carrier, most likely bought for the family. Peter unlocked the car and sat down in drivers seat. Just comforting Tanya's body against the turned Peter on. He moved his hand down for a wank. However, Peter remembered he no longer had his male penis. He hadn't quite checked Tanya's pussy yet anyway. He sliped a searching hand beneath his skirt and found a pair of silky panties. He began stroke on them in an attempt to errect Tanya's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel himself getting wet between the legs. He covertly sliped his fingers underneath the panties and began to stroke at Tanya's clit. He felt a warm, tingling feeling as he masturbated in a womans body. \"Oh wow...the is beautiful\". Peter moaned as he continued his work. He slowly sliped a finger in to Tanya's vagina and started fingering. The sensation was overwhelming and knocked Peter back. He sliped another finger in to increase the feeling. \"Oh wow yes, don't stop, this feels so good, harder, faster, please Peter, I'm your horny little slut\". Peter moaned, using his new voice to turn himself on even more. Eventually, the preasure built high enough for Peter to cum for the first time as a woman. His femanine fingers were covered in Tanya's hot, clear and sticky juices. He licked every little drop off. \"Mmm, tasty Tanya\". Peter said to himself, a large grin spreading across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter then decided to make a move for the strip club. He scanned Tanya's memories again and the knowledge rushed through him. 'I know how to drive'. He thought in excitment. He started up the car and began to drive a few roads to the strip club. It felt fun to be driving, not the first new experience Peter had today though. After around 10 minutes driving, he reached the strip club. Peter unbutoned a few butons on his top and let his hair down. He steped out of the car and walked into the strip club, easily moving past the security guard who kept anyone underage out. He could not stop Peter and his sexy new hoast however. Peter began to look around the room. The room was slighly dark, lit by neon lighting. There were many gorguess women all dancing around on poles and wearing next to nothing. Peter began to feel wet again, he was drooling slightly too. He took a walk over to the far side of the club. Many men began to admire his new body as he walked pass. Some wold whistleed, another shouted \"oi oi love, hope your part of the show too\". Peter giggled at the fact his new body was drawing so much attention. He always knew Tanya was incredibly sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter then notcied a particular stripper amongst the others. She was in her mid 20's and had a smooth sexy body. She had more curves than a mountain road and gorguess D cup breasts. She was brunette and waering nothing but a skimpy bikini and leather boots. Peter saw down on the chair and watched her dance. The stripers moves up and down the pole turned Peter on even more. He began to stroke at his skirt, where Tanya's pussy was. Peter had so many naughty ideas in his head and wanted to try one out. Eventually, he decided too...</span></div></div>",

He's vision was still a little blured and he felt stiff, so he raised he's hands into the air. However, the hands looked very different. They were all manicured. Peter gasped at this, why the heck were his nails manicured with all this girly stuff. With a slight gasp, he sat up. However upon doing so, brown locks of hair fell upon his face. Fussily pushing them away, Peter also noticed strange feelings down below. He looked down and the sight that greeted him was very out of the ordinary. He was wearing a black cocktail dress, with black leggings and high heels to match. Peter could feel the cold of the floor. 'Why on earth am I wearing all this'! Peter thought. Upon looking at his chest, Peter saw the weirdest sight yet. It looked like his chest had swollen. Bringing his hands to examine, they felt very much like...breasts. They were breasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter tried crawling backwards to avoid this but the body moved with him, it was his. \"What the fuck is going on here!?!\" Peter said aloud. He instantly brought his hands to cover his mouth at this, as it was not his voice. It was alien to him, yet sounded somewhat familiar. Peter had to find out what was going on. He looked around briefly and saw a handbag on the floor. Perhaps it's contents could tell Peter who he was. He got up swiftly but nearly fell back down again due to the damn heels. Examing the bags contents, he come across a drivers licence saying 'Janine Butcher'. 'No it can't be...'. Peter found a small make up mirror and the reflection of his face made his drop it instantly. After a momment of hestitation, he picked it up again and could see his face, clear as day. However, his face now looked like Janine's! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..what's going on??\" Said a confused Peter. \"This can't be happening....it's...it's just...unreal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was Peter feeling?</span></div></div>",

The reflection of Janine's face did the same. He put the mirror in the bag and the bag on his shoulder. Peter took a quick glance around to check he was on his own. He was. \"Cooool\". Peter said in a very adolecent mannor, hugging his new body. There was nothing childish about his new body however. He was an adult now, and not just any adult. He was the scheming, moneygrabbing yet incredibaly sexy Janine Butcher. Peter's new manicured hands began hugging this new body over. Peter felt the incredibaly sexy curves of his new body, exploring every region. His hands brushed against his breasts and he cupped them tightly. The feeling tingled through Peter's new body. He giggled with his new voice, a checky grin emerging across his face. Although this wouldn't be out of place on Janine's face regularly, the grin was being made by horny young teenage boy this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...this is such a sexy body\". Peter moaned with his new voice, continuing the touching. \"I could do so much with this fine piece of ass\". Peter grabbed his buttchecks at saying this. He raised a good point however. There was a lot he could do now as a sexy woman and not as a teenage boy. What should he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Peter regained his vision, he notcied something very strange. He looked up towards his now raised hands and notcied his skin had almost changed colour. As he's sight cleared, they were indeed no longer the pale, caucasian hands he once possessed but a light shade of brown. There was something else too. The fingers were more sleak and femenine, with purple nails, a bracelet on one arm and a ring on the other hand. Peter sparked into life at this discovery. He sats straight up but before he could look around the mid-summer square center he now sat in, long brown hair came down to cover his face. 'Huh, what is all this'? Peter thought, spitting some out of his mouth. He's hands grabbed the hair and followed it down it's full lengh. Along looking and feeling down, Peter discovered that he was now wearing a purple jumper, which seemed to be all funny on the chest. Upon trying to adjust it, he was startled to feel something underneath it, almost like it was attached to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!?\" Peter proclaimed loudley. However, his hands were now in the way of his mouth, for the voice he had just heard was certainly not his, or even one of the male gender. \"Wha...whats going on?\". He whimpered nervously. Bringing his hands down to examine his chest again, whatever was underneath felt very full and round, almost like...breasts! This was all getting very strange for Peter. As he looked down further, he notcied he was now wearing a black skirt of about calf lengh, with grey stockings covering a pair of sleek and sexy legs, dorned with long, black boots on the bottom. Certainly very out of place for a 15 year old boy. Peter slowly moved his hand down the skirt and could not feel a throbing penis or balls. Instead, the space seemed almost empty but then suddenly tingled with imense feeling, forcing Peter to withdraw his hand immeadiatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter got to his feet quickly, trying to find some form of identity. 'Whats happened to me'? He kept thinking in his head. He found a womans handbag on the floor and made a frantic dash for it, skimming through his contents untill he at last found a mirror. Upon pulling it out however, he soon dropped it in amazment. After a brief lapse of shock, he picked it up again and once again saw his face. However, this face was most certainly not his. It looked like the face of the young asian wife and friend of the family Amira. Peter brung his hand up to his cheek and felt it's soft touch. The reflection did the same. This face was now Peters, along with the whole of Amiras body. Peter was now in control of Amiras body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is going on here?\" Peter said to himself with his new femenine voice. \"All I remember is blacking out...if that makes sense...and now I'm a girl...What!?!\". He's confusion echoed through his mind as he placed the mirror and bag to the floor. He looked down at this new body. However, other emotions were arising amongst the confusion and fear. Intrigue and indeed lust were building withing Peter. He was already in this mood back at the Vic and this experience could be just the kind of adventure and ineed, sexual relief, Peter was craving. He's shocked expression turned into a cheeky grin as he's hands began to observe the body in a more probeing manor. \"Hmm, maybe this isn't as bad as I first thought\". Peter told himself in a cocky tone. \"Besides, I could imagine their being many advantages to being a sexy asian woman, as long as I can get out again of course\". Peter cupped his breasts at this, briefly making sure no one could see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new lust and desire for using the attractive Amiras body was growing as excitment in Peters body, sparking off many ideas. What should he do now?</span></div></div>",

He said to himself, slapping his own hand slightly to remove it from Amira's breast. 'I need to figure out how to get out of here first, in case I'm stuck forever'. He thought, condisering the bad side this situation could still represent. He certaintly didn't want to be stuck as a woman all his life. And he also wanted to find out if this was the only abbility he now controled. Looking around, he checked to see if nobody was watching him. Indeed they wern't. Nobody seemed to have cared that a young woman had passed out in the square and got up to start fondling herself. 'Typical...but good'. Peter thought to himself. He still decided on not trying anything in the square, so looked for an alleyway or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in Amira's body was a strange expereince for Peter. He had to slow down slightly to control the constant giggling of his breasts and the sutle sway of his female hips. Eventually, he found an alleyway in the corner of the square, not far from where the Masood family lived oddly enough. He looked around once again, checking the coast was clear. It was. He dropped Amira's bag and began pondering his situation. \"Hmm ok, I got into this body...now I need to out.\" He said to himself. Closing his eyes, he concertrated hard on his situation. All of a sudden, he felt another strange rushing sensation numbing his body. Regaining his sight again, he was now looking down on Amira's body, passed out, sliding down the wall in it's unconcious state. 'Yes, it worked'. Peter heard himself say. Although he couldn't talk, he could still hear loud enough in his ghost like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alright then, well thats that sorted at least. I won't have to worry anymore hopefully. So I'm like a ghost now. Too cool'. His voice echoed, spinning in mid-air. He touched back down to ground and could slowly feel feeling regaining as he re-materialised into his regular form. \"Good to see my old body too, at least I know thats not gone\". He said in relief, looking over himself again. With his powers now understood slightly better, what would Peter do next?</span></div></div>",

Besides, he still wanted to see what effects his powers had. \"Sorry Amira hunny, your sexy and everything but I'm looking for someone else to play with at the minute\". Peter giggled to himself, a new found sense of confidence rising in him from his achievments. However, Amira's body began to stir at his voice. 'Uh Oh'. Peter thought, ducking out of sight quickly. He quickly returned to his ghost like state, to make himself invisible to the human eye once more. As he looked round again, he saw Amira getting up, rubbing her head in disbelief. \"Urgh...what happened?\". She stuttered in confusement. Eventually, she regained her composure and carried on to where she was going before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, they can't remember anything. This just keeps getting better'. Peter thought.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chelsea Fox was the woman that Peter next desired. He had seen her in the Vic earlier and could barely keep his eyeballs in his sockets. She had been out of uniform and looking extra sexy as she exposed her flawless figure in a tight low cut shirt and jeans. It was enough to drive Peter crazy. He knew this was one person he simply had to try his new power on. Zipping along at high speed, Peter got cocky and now decided that being a ghost could let him float through walls. Peter hit the wall of the pub full on but was stopped in his tracks. Obviously, he wasn't like a regular movie ghost. The front door would have to surfice for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing his form through the tight space in the door, Peter was once again inside the Vic. However, no one could see him this time as he was a ghost floating just above their heads. He also wondered whether or not his dad Ian was out looking for him. It had been a little while since he first disapeared. Well maybe he was, although if he wasn't, it didn't suprise or bother Peter. He was just looking for Chelsea at this momment. Peter hovered over too where Chelsea had been sitting before. However, she wasn't there anymore, the seats since taken up by other punters. Peter went to check the girls toilets in order to see if she was there. Squeezing through the keyhole and simply being in there was entertaining to Peter, yet there was still no sign of his target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She must be at work or back at her place'. Peter thought to himself. Venturing outside the pub, he decided to try the salon first. It was getting late and towards closing time for most things on the high street so Peter travelled a little more hasitly to get there. Ariving outside the salon, Peter notcied someone leaving. It was Amira, the young woman he had been in control of earlier. Beside her was Roxy Mitchell, the sophisticated 30-something owner of here and the Vic and also a mother. Last but not least was the woman Peter had been looking for. Chelsea Fox. Looking beautiful as ever, she was wearing her salon uniform, a pink buttoned top with some skin tight white trousers, from which her beautiful figure was clear, especially that nice ass of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter moved in closer to hear their conversation. \"Now your sure you don't mind finishing up in here Chelsea? I mean I would help you out here but the Vic needs me tonig...\". Roxy began. \"Don't worry, I'll be fine here\". Chelsea replied, obviously in a good enough mood. \"Thanks hunny, I would stay too but I had an evening planned with Syed tonight\". Amira added, hugging Chelsea. \"Well look, when your done, lock up the place. Here's the keys, just drop them off to me later or be here tommorow morning bright and early\". Stated Roxy, handing Chelsea the keys. Looking over this situation was giving Peter idea's. If Chelsea was staying at the Salon, on her own for overtime and she had the keys too...Peter had somewhere nice and cosy to explore his new body in peace and without interference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy and Amira both took their seperate ways, leaving Chelsea to head back inside. Peter took a quick glance at the woman he had been inside earlier walking off before following Chelsea into the salon. He fitted in right on time, passing through the door and into the building. Now he was inside, it was just him and Chelsea. Peter would have licked his lips...if he currently had any. Chelsea was oblivious to his presence, obviously packing things away. Peter took a momment to admire her beauty, notcing her nice ass as she bent over to pick something up. Eventually, he had been taunted long enough. Waiting till she was out of sight from the main window, he swooped in at high speed and crashed striaght into Chelsea. Blacking out again, he got the same feeling of dizzyness in controlling her concious. Chelsea on the outside meanwhile fainted to the floor and began squirming as Peters hostile presence overwhelmed her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Peter regained vision again, he felt the similar feeling of being on the floor. Not the first time he had been today. The setting sun shone in brightly through the window, causing Peter to cover his face with his hands. However, these were no longer his hands. The same process of self discovery commenced with Peter, finding his new, slender feminine fingers, he's new curvy figure, large breasts, curvy ass. He was in heaven. A huge, slightly mad smile came across Chelsea's face, which now belonged to Peter. \"Oh wow...this is amazing\". Peter moaned as he squeezed his new breasts. Getting up proved to be a problem due to Chelseas heels. Peter kicked them off in annoyment thinking 'I don't know whow women wear those'. As he looked in the mirror, Peter saw the reflection of a beautiful young woman possessing an almost child like smile of amazment. This was Peter possessing Chelsea's beautiful body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool\". Peter said in excitment, still fondling himself. \"I've got to be white, asian and black all in one day...hehe\". Peter began unbuttoning the top he now wore, revealing his new slim figure and a white silk bra which concealed two large and amazing breasts. \"Mmm, your a naughty little slut aren't you Chelsea\". Said Peter, using a seductive tone to his new voice. He sucked on his finger and bent over to swing his clevage. \"Well I'm gonna use this body like a toy, to do my bidding\". Peter wondered if he had gone a little crazy with power. It was probably the horniness he now had making him say this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what did Peter do next?</span></div></div>",

On top of that, his job was finally running smoothly. His boss Phil seemed to be too drunk lately to care whether or not he did the job properly anyway!

Gary walked over to the bar and asked for his regular pint. However, both Gary and the barmaid were unaware that a strange liquid had leaked into the Mitchell's beer supplies. Gary took a big sip and swallowed it down. After a few seconds, he began to feel a bit drowzy. \"Well...thats strange...ow much alcohol is...in the this again?\". Gary said clumbsily Roxy the barmaid. \"Only the same as you usually drink Gary. Why, what's the problem?\" \"Oh nothing, I must be tired or something\". Gary said, thinking of a plausable excuse.

She had a free half day there after winning one of the pub quiz competitions. It managed to pay off at least and Bianca was always bound to jump at the chance. So Tony was left to spend his money on what half of the square probably did too: a pint. It had been a topsy turvey few weeks for Tony. He's secret relationship with Bianca's adoptive daughter Whitney Dean had broken off and she nearly blabed too Bianca about it. This ended up sparking big arguments within the family. He had thought a family holiday would have cured the family ills but instead, Whitney and Bianca had come back and began to fighting again. Tony still had feelings for Whitney but needed to keep them a secret from Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony began to think about his his 15 year old love interest. She was well develpoed for her age, with a large set of breasts and a cute ass. She often hid herself beneath too much makeup and baggy clothes. Tony wished she'd be a little less constrictive of her beautiful body. He knew just how beautiful it was. He was only getting limited acess at the moment and this did not please him. Tony put down his drink and looked across the pub. He saw Whitney's two friends Lauren Branning and Lucy Beale. Tony admired them both as he often got good views of them when they hung around with Whitney. He gazed at Laurens body, noticing her developing features, such as her B cup breasts and well crafted ass (which stuck out well in her tight clothes) and gorguess doll face. Lucy was developing quicker however, her breasts already at a C cup and her curves were curvier. She was also wearing tight clothes that made these features all the more noticable. Tony often daydreamed about the 3 friends together and how they would do whatever he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony's mind also began to think of other young girls; Libby and Chelsea Fox, Dannielle Jones and her friend Stacey Slater, Lauren's little sister Abbie and Ronnie Mitchell all flashed across he's bored mind, pulling off there own sexual poses for him. Tony eventually came out of his daydream and decided he needed a drink. He called Phil Mitchell for another pint. As Phil poured however, he didn't know that an old Mitchell family mixture had poured into the beer suply. This was no ordinary mixture however, it was an old potion from the middle ages! Tony drank the pint without thinking but began to get sharp pains in his stomach. He's eyesight blurred and his head felt like it was spinning. He was going to be sick. Tony shifted his way out of the front of the pub. He could hear people muttering 'look at that drunk'. Tony got outside and wandered into a dark corner. Thankfully there wern't many people around on the streets when it got dark. Tony could feel the vomit moving inside him. It was almost like he was being torn apart inside. He eventually gave in, was sick and blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, he felt very strange. He's eyesight was still blurred and everything seemed brighter. He also felt numb all over. He looked down and saw something even stranger, he had no body! All he could see was a white cloud and several tentacles like things coming out of it. Tony began to panic. He started drifting around nervously and picking up speed. He coulden't control where he was going. He sped over to the square center and saw the figure of a girl in his way. Tony tried to steer away but he was going to fast. He eventually hit the girl in the mouth and blacked out again. When he woke up yet again, his head hurt from the past few minutes. At least his eyesight had returned to normal again. He raised his hand up to his head but felt something strange; long hair. He brung his hands back down to face leval. There was something wrong with them too. They were smaller and more feminine than his own hands. Tony had landed straight into the body of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney: 15, white, female, round C cup breasts, nice figure and legs but often hid it beneath baggy clothes, cute face but often wore lots of make up (to Tony's dislike), had a relationship with Tony but nearly caught out after Tony assualted Peter Beale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren: 14, white, female, B cup breasts which were growing bigger, nice curves, cute ass and face, caught in the middle of a family bust up with her dad and her mother with her new boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: 15, white, female, C cup breasts and growing, nice curvy body, smooth legs, nice ass, pretty face, often a bitch too many people and needed an attitude adjustment, disrepectful to her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDannielle: 20, white, female, nice slim figure, smooth long legs, cute ass, C cup breasts, beautiful face, still quite nervous as she hadn't been in the square long, best friends with Stacey Slater and stayed with her and her family, trying to establish a good relationship with her estranged mother Ronnie Mitchell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He was lost in deep thought, his mind pondering over a great many things. The sound of the bustling urban enviroment seemed incredibley faded in comparison to the voices in his head. Jay had lived a very eventful life for a simple sixteen year old boy. Seeing his dad die at a young age, he had turned to a life of criminality, which had almost cost him his life. After being adopted by one Mitchell, then another, he had witnessed his 'brother' Ben brutally murder an inocent woman. It was something he was lucky to find himself out of prison for being a part of. It hadn't left him without deep emotional and psychological scars however, he's lads exterior harbouring a much darker interior. He thanked the heavens that he had Abi and Lola to fall back upon at the very least. Sometimes however, he wished he had more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, something caught his attention enough to break his trance. It was a shining object of some kind, nestled away in the nearby bushes. Jay got up from his swing set seat and walked over to investigate. Who knew, it could be something valuable to pawn. Upon inspection though, it was something far different. Jay picked up the object to find it was a small crystal of some kind, perfectly formed and glowing with a faint blue aura in the afternoon sun. Inside the crystal was a swirving white mist. It entranced Jay as he looked over the crystal, stroking it's exterior with his thumb. As he gazed into it's depths, he began to feel all the tension and preasure he was feeling prior lifting off his shoulders. It cleared his mind of any doubts and left him feeling clear. Closing his eyes momentarily, Jay reveled in the feeling until he looked about once more. The crystal was no longer in front of him. Then again, neither were his hands. Now he seemed to be surrounded in the white mist. Looking down to his own body, he noticed it was no longer there. He was now literally floating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay felt panicked by this new turn of events. What on earth had happened to him? He tried moving and found himself flying about at great speeds. It was something he was unable to control properly. All he could think clearly at this point was that he needed to find help. Bounding about however, he couldn't make sense of anything. Or anyone. Which was exactly what happened when he hit someone and blacked out. But who did he hit?</span></div></div>",

The bright, sunny day it had been was just about visable. However, his strained vision kept those leaning over him blurred from sight. Bringing his hand to his head, he needed to find a way to soothe the aching. Slowly but surely, his vision came start to become clearer. He could just about make out the faces of Fatboy and Poppy, who were knealt down to examine him. Sound began to flow through his ears again as he made out what they were saying. \"Abi! Abi, are you ok babe?\" Poppy asked with concern. \"You want me to run to the salon and get your mum?\" Fatboy asked, ready to shoot off at the word go. \"Wh...wha?\" Jay tried to get out, still feeling weak from the blackout. \"You had a nasty fall Abi, just try to sit down for a minute\" Poppy continued, still voicing her concern for his well being. Something was definatley wrong however. \"Why do you keep calling me Abi?\" Jay asked timidly. However, as the words exited his mouth, his brain come to the realisation that is was not his voice speaking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, you don't have amnesia do you?\" Poppy gasped, now rather worried about what the consequences of the blackout were. \"Don't be stupid, she couldn't have gotten that from falling over!\" Fatboy told her, seeing sense. Jay however, wasn't really concerned with their bickering however. He was now concerned over what had happened. Bringing his hands up to his face, he noticed they were very different indeed. Instead of the strong, dirty hands that had been fixing up cars, these hands were clean and slender, very feminine in appearence. Jay began to sit up as the entourage backed off. However, he noticed blonde locks now falling across his face. \"What the hell?\" he cursed. No sooner had the words left his mouth however than his hands were clamped over it. The voice speaking sounded like Abi's. Looking down, his fears were all the more confirmed by the sight of a body very alien to his own. He was wearing a sleevless, colourful top as well as a pair of figure hugging jeans. The figure was most definatley not his own. Neither were the two mounds now sticking out his chest. Jay could of almost blushed if he wasn't so hard up on things. However, his hosts body could most certainly do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abi, you ok?\" Poppy asked once more as she noted Jay's confusion. Jay stumbled for words before he finally said something sensible. \"Do you have a mirror?\" He asked nervously in his timid little voice. \"Sure\" Poppy replied momentarily, searching through her handbag to retrieve a little makeup mirror. Jay flipped open the case and saw what he feared. Looking back at him was not his own reflection but that of his on and off girlfriend Abi Branning. 'I don't understand' Jay though to himself, creeped out by the whole situation. Handing the mirror back, he got up quickly, stumbling somewhat after the effects of the blackout, though keeping as much composure as possible. \"You sure your ok Abs?\" Fatboy asked, beggining one of his ramblings. \"I'm fine. Excuse me\" Jay replied with his new voice as he walked swiftly away from the scenario. That walk soon became a run, which took him to a secluded alleyway in the corner of the square. He was breathing heavily after the run, something that made his chest heave, the breasts he now sported rising and falling. \"What the heck happened to me?!\" he cried, no knowledge of a way out of his situation in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment however, he calmed himself. There must be a way out of this. Concerntrating, Jay though of the crystal and the power he'd recieved. In an instant, the information is diposited ran through his mind, every little detail clearly inputted like he'd knew it a lifetime. He saw of how he could turn aparal and possess bodies, control others with other versions of himself and morph his form and the forms others as he chose. \"Oh wow, I have power\" he gasped in delight with Abi's vocals. Looking down at himself once more, he thought of just how  fun having Abi's body could be for a while. \"I think I can have some fun with this. I've always wanted to know what lies beneath\" Jay smirked, cupping his new breasts with his hands. They felt exceptional to touch. He began to form devious ideas in his mind as he plotted where to go...</span></div></div>",

Dexter was currentley out getting lunch and Phil was most likely checking up on Lexi at home. It left AJ with the time to kick back for a little whilee and goof around as he pleased. Of course, he'd have to be on the lookout for his bosses return, certainley not wanting an angered Phil finding him messing around. For the time being however, it gave him a chance to put down his wrentch and take a breather. AJ admired the car he had been working on as he took a proper glance at it. It was well kept, classic Jaguar. It was much like the one that Derek Branning used to own, before his death of course. AJ began to inspect the interior, imagining what kind of life he would be living if he could afford a car of this stature. It was certainley a good vision, one that made him smile with glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs inspected the interior of the front, he noticed something very unusual in the glove compartment. Curiosity getting the best of him, he checked it out. What he found was a small glowing crystal, perfectley formed and shining a bright blue. It entranced AJ, the shiny object proving very aluring even if so simple. He picked it up and looked over it closely. There seemed to be some kind of a faint mist buried within it's core. The closer AJ got to it, the brighter it seemed to glow. Staring into it for longer enough, AJ seemed to feel himself becoming weightless, as if every bit of stress and tension lifted off his shoulders. He was, in a sense, comfortably numb. That was when he noticed that the crystal had dropped to the floor. It was no longer glowing in any sense. AJ tried to reach a hand down to get it. Yet try as he might, he could not reach down a hand. There was no feeling in his body. As he looked about for such a cause, he discovered he had no body. The feeling of weightlessness he got was his body disolving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaniced and weired out, AJ desperatley began to seek help. He moved out of the car door yet could still not feel his legs. Remembering his employer and colleague were out at the moment, he needed to head outside in order to find help. As he rushed out of the Arches, he began to lose all sense of direction in blind panic as he practically floated around for aid. Coming around into the main section of the square, he felt himself crash into something and black out. Or someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was that someone?</span></div></div>",

He was begininng to panic now, with no hope in sight for his unusual prediciment. All of a sudden however, as he shot down a narrow path, he noticed a girl standing with her back to him. \"Hey!\" he tried calling out. It was no use and the girl did not hear his calls. Trying another form of contact, he tried reaching out to touch her on the shoulder. As he came in contact with her however, everything went black. The world around him disapeared from sight, though he could still feel something. It were as though he were being pulled in to a tight space of some sort. The numbness that resided over his form began to disapear as he felt human in shape and form again. Opening his eyes, he took a deep gasp for breath, as if he had been holding it in underwater before release. 'Ouch, that was rough' he thought as he held on to his head. Looking about through hazy eyes however, he saw the girl had vanished from view. Instead, a concerned man from one of the market stalls came over to check on him for some reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright there darling?\" he asked, voicing concern for AJ's current state. He asked it in a strange way though. \"Darling?\" AJ muttered, groggy from the experience. Something seemed off about his voice however. The hair on his head seemed different too. He began to follow it downwards as the owner continued. \"Did you bump your head on something little lady?\" he asked again. \"Lady? Mate...\". AJ stopped right there as he covered his mouth. His voice definatly sounded ladylike. Very unlike his own. It was the voice of someone else on the square. Looking down nervously, AJ saw a sight a million miles different to the usual view of his own body. For a starter, his hands were white instead of there usual brown. They were also slender and feminine. He also noticed the long hair that he had been following down. It had gone far beyond his normal lenghs, stretching down to mid chest at the least. And there he saw the strangest sight of all. Two mounds sticking out from underneath a girly red sweater. He could feel them attached to him. A perfect paid of breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thats what you are me thinks\" the man interupted as AJ began to look at himself in shock. \"Maybe you should go get some rest love\". AJ was too shocked to even answer. He just began to run off, away from the crowded scene around him. He felt a bag hanging over his shoulder, which he held on to as he ran for cover. His long hair whipped about his face as he ran. His breasts also bounced underneath the jumper. This was all very sureal. He could only think of one place to run at this point and that was back to the garage. Racing through the ajar door he had left, he shut it swiftly behind him as to avoid the outside world. To his delight, Phil and Dexter were not back yet. Needing to find a mirror of some sort, AJ eventually settled on glass window of the car he had been working on. There, it it's relfection, he saw the weirdest sight of his life. Looking back to him was Lauren Branning. She was wearing the same look of shock and panic that he could definatly sense he was wearing at this point. She looked right back at him. Thats when he realised it. He was now Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself once more. He could see her slim, lovely body now attached to him from the neck down. Looking back at the window, so did she. \"This is...so freaky\" he exclaimed, eyeing himself as to understand what was happening. His voice sounded exactly like hers too. AJ however, in his imature sense of mind, could not stay in panic mode forever. In fact, looking back at what was now his relfection, he made a cheeky little grin appear on her face. \"Well this is certainly new\" he noted, looking down at his body. He moved his hands up to Laurens chest and gave a tight squeeze on her breasts. \"Oh wow, thats good!\" he exclaimed, the alien feeling exciting him. He continued onwards as he looked back at himself, a hint of lust in her eyes, now his. \"Well I'd give her a go admitedly\" he giggled. \"I guess I technically can now\"! He moved a hand south to the tight fabric of his jeans around his crotch.
