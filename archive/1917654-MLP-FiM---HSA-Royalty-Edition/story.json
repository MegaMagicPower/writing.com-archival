            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a bright summer day in Ponyville. It's been two weeks since the end of your junior year in high school, and up till now, you haven't done jack. The last eventful thing that happened was when Twilight was coronated as a princess, but that was a week and a half ago. Earlier this morning, you, Spike and Twilight had received a letter from Princess Celestia to catch the 11:00 AM train to Canterlot. It was now 10:55, and you and Twilight are waiting in the cabin for the train to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think Aun- I mean Celestia wants us to come to Canterlot so early in the morning?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must have an important thing for us to do,\" Twilight presumes. \"She did invite the others, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, why would she need me and Spike?\" you ask. \"We don't have Elements of Harmony like you and the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but that doesn't make you two useless,\" says the alicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it does!\" says a pony coming towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too, Rainbow Dash,\" you say with an irritated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now is that any way t' talk to somebody?\" says another pony wearing a brown cowgirl hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack is right, Rainbow Dash,\" says a unicorn with an indigo colored mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure Dashie was just joking!\" says a bubbly, pink coated earth pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, Pinkie Pie,\" says the pegasus. \"I was only joking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... everybody...\" says a shy pegasus that was just walking in. \"I think the train is about to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your watch. \"Thanks for the heads up Fluttershy,\" you say. \"We should all sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for the next forty five minutes, you and your friends ride the train all the way to Canterlot, with you drawing in your sketchbook the whole way there. When you all get to Canterlot Castle, you're greeted by the three princesses, Celestia, Luna and Cadance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you all had a pleasant trip,\" says Celestia. \"You must be wondering why I invited you here.\" You all nod your heads in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are two reasons,\" she explains. \"After months of negotiation, the Canterlot empire has finally settled a treaty with the Changelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the other ponies drop your jaws in shock. If that wasn't shocking enough, out of nowhere, Chrysalis, the queen of the Changelings, shows up. Fluttershy nearly faints from the stress of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia speaks the truth,\" she says. \"It was a long debate, but we've decided to let go of our differences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know this is a shock to all of you,\" says Luna, \"but we can assure you that Chrysalis means no harm.\" Cadance nods her head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secondly, I heard you all have been having a rather dull summer, so far, so I've invited all of you to stay here at the castle for three weeks!\" say Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your friends immediately cheer up, happy to know that you'll be staying at the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one issue though,\" says Luna. \"There are only three available guest bedrooms with two beds each, so someone will be the 'odd one out,' as they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT IT!\" says the other ponies. You were always so slow when it came to that. Even Fluttershy was quicker than you. So now you have nowhere to sleep. Sometimes you wish you were Spike's size so that a small cushion would suffice for a suitable bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm sure you don't want to share a bed with one of the girls...\" says Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. There were several reasons why that would be a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Twilight hogs the sheets.<br>\r\n2. Rainbow Dash snores.<br>\r\n3. Pinkie Pie would most likely prank you in your sleep.<br>\r\n4. Rarity would want her privacy.<br>\r\n5. Applejack kicks in her sleep.<br>\r\n6. Fluttershy is too timid to have a boy sleep in the same bed as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia continues. \"...so you'll just have to sleep with one of us,\" she says, referring to her, the other princesses, and Chrysalis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me,\" says the queen. \"I prefer to sleep alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no problem with it,\" says Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Shining Armor won't mind you sharing a room with me since he trusts you,\" says Cadance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can always share a bed with your dear old aunt,\" says Celestia. The very second she says that, you knew what was going to follow. As you predicted everyone laughed at you, Rainbow Dash being the loudest. Even Fluttershy was laughing at your expense. Luna and Cadance look at each other, embarrassed for you, while Chrysalis chuckles in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say something funny?\" asks Celestia, totally oblivious to how embarrassed you are. She may be the royal princess and all, but she can be really dense when it comes to things like this. \"Anyway, it's your call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you choose to bunk with?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two other princesses lead your friends into the castle, and Celestia does the same with you, but the two of you end up splitting up from the rest of the group. As you both walk to Celestia's room, you take a look at your dear aunt and blush. You've been somewhat infatuated with her for a while. The earliest you remember feeling like this was about six months ago. You don't know what, but there was something about Celestia that caused you to develop a crush on her. Was it the way she carried herself? Was it the way she always had your back? Was it because she was just so damn hot (did  you really just think that)? You can't put your finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are!\" says Celestia, opening the door to your room. You know you've been in your aunt's room before, it's just been so long that you forgot what it looked like. The bed was massive compared to a normal sized one, but you expected that much. There was a door to the right, you assumed that was the door to Celestia's private bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, make yourself comfortable,\" she says, \"and don't worry about clothes and stuff. I have wardrobes specially picked out for you and your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always think of everything,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your happiness is my top priority,\" she says, giving you a hug. You really enjoyed Celestia's hugs. It gave you a chance to get a whiff of the sweet scent that permeated from her mane. \"One more thing,\" she says when she releases you. \"Since we'll be sharing a bed, you should know that I like to cuddle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Celestia says this, you immediately take notice of the throw pillow on her bed. You could see that the middle of it was significantly thinner than the rest of it. You don't know whether to be happy or worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" says Celestia, \"do you still want to know how I met your parents?\"</span></div></div>",

Your aunt succumbed to her sweet tooth much too often. \"Apparently, I wasn't the only one worried, because as I got to the auditorium, where the ceremony was being held, I saw your parents rushing to get inside. Unfortunately, I saw them a little too late, and I ran right into them. After apologizing to me repeatedly, I asked them if they wanted to make their entrance with me. Since they had the highest GPAs out of their graduating class, they were going to be sitting next to me anyway, so I thought that it would be a great idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to get to know them better during the party after the graduation ceremony,\" she continues. \"We all had a lot in common, especially me and your mother. When I asked them if they were dating, they got all embarrassed and said no.\" You sigh. Another bad habit of Celestia was that she was too forward. \"Whenever you get all flustered it reminds my of how your father acted back then. Our friendship grew over the years, and I eventually served as the maid of honor at your mother's wedding.\" You then remember seeing Celestia in your parents' wedding photos. As expected, she hasn't aged a day since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before your parents passed, they told me that should anything happen to them, they wanted me to look after you, and I kept my word,\" she said. \"So, that's pretty much everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at the story Celestia just told you. The fact that she was so devoted and always kept her word was one of the many reasons why you became attracted to her. Without thinking, you wrap her in a tight hug, and she hugs you back, wrapping her wings around you. \"Thanks for telling me that story, Auntie,\" you say. \"I can see why my parent wanted you to take care of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, sweetheart,\" she says. \"And I want you to know one thing...\"</span></div></div>",

You begin to hope that this is a sign that she\u2019d be open to a relationship with you, but you don\u2019t try to ask her yet. You just enjoy the moment. Maybe someday you\u2019ll gain the courage to admit your feelings. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anypony that likes her, too. You have all the time in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you leave the bedroom, you hear Twilight and your other friends chatting in the distance. You follow the sounds of their voices and end up finding them at the castle\u2019s main balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, [your name],\u201d says Rainbow Dash. \u201cDid you get all settled in with your auntie?\u201d The pegasus starts to chuckle, and you roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, Rainbow,\u201d you say. \u201cAnyway, did you guys get settled into your rooms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d says Twilight. \u201cApplejack\u2019s rooming with Pinkie Pie, Rarity\u2019s rooming with Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy\u2019s rooming with me. Thankfully, she doesn\u2019t keep her side of the room cluttered like your room back home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is not that messy,\u201d you say defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is for my tastes,\u201d she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re so OCD,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has a point, darling,\u201d says Rarity. \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand artists. I can totally relate to you, [your name]. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a little organized chaos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid somepony say \u2018chaos\u2019?\u201d asked a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA puff of smoke suddenly appears out of nowhere, and when it dissipates, you see a draconequus before you. The only draconequus you know goes by the name of-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiscord!?\u201d everypony says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, everypony!\u201d he says. \u201cPrincess Celestia invited me over to the castle to stay for three weeks. I assume you all got that same invitation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d says Fluttershy, happy to see her friend. \u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here, Discord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself, Fluttershy,\u201d you think. You really didn\u2019t like Discord. Between you and your friends, that guy always messed with you the most (Twilight was a close second). You never thought he was evil, per se, you just thought that he was a major troll (which, in your opinion, was worse). Hopefully, he won\u2019t fuck up your vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you could make it Discord,\u201d says Celestia, who had just arrived at the balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the only reason why I came is because you invited me personally, Tia, darling,\u201d says Discord, walking up to the princess and kissing her hand. When he does that, part of you gets a little riled up. Hopefully, he wasn\u2019t seriously flirting with your aunt, because the last thing you need is someone getting in between you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Princess Celestia taught it to me after she learned it from Chrysalis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow ironic,\u201d you say. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna use a spell that Celestia taught you to spy on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019d better get to the dining hall for breakfast. We don\u2019t everypony else to get the good pickings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the dining hall and get your plate ready, you find that the only vacant seat is next to Discord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cFuck my life,\u201d</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly sit next to the draconequus, who turns to you and smiles. \u201cGood morning, [your name],\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning,\u201d you say in a somewhat cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Celestia and Discord finally leave to go on their\u2026 date\u2026 You and Twilight silently follow them while the young princess casts the disguise spell. Twilight transformed into a normal unicorn with a light blue coat and a short, choppy mane of a darker blue. For some reason, you were transformed into a pony as well, a unicorn, to be exact. You had a coat and mane that matched your skin tone and hair color, respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you ask, I haven\u2019t figured out how to cast a human disguise yet,\u201d she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeh, it\u2019s better anyway,\u201d you whisper. \u201cCanterlot has the least amount of human residents, next to Ponyville. The less suspicion we arouse, the better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou end up following Celestia and Discord to a small restaurant, and as usual, everypony bows to her. They end up getting a nice table on the outside patio. Luckily, you and <br>\r\nTwilight get a table that\u2019s rather close to them. Twilight then casts a spell that enhances your hearing so that you can both hear whatever Celestia and Discord are saying. You take a good look at the princess and notice the necklace she\u2019s wearing. It was a custom made one encrusted in diamonds, and you were the one that gave it to her. You smile and remember the day you gave it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It was a month ago, Mother\u2019s Day, to be exact, and Celestia decided to pay you a visit while Twilight was out with her mom. This was the third Mother\u2019s Day that\u2019s come by since your parents passed, but you still hadn\u2019t gotten used to not being with your mom on this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis year was going to be different, though. You\u2019ve known for a few months that Celestia was coming over, so you decided to get her a very special present as a way of thanking her for being like a second mother to you. You ended up getting a job and working your ass off to get that necklace for her, but it was all worth it in the end. You remember the look of joy that was on Celestia\u2019s face when she saw her gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness, [your name],\u201d she said. \u201cThis necklace is beautiful! I promise I\u2019ll wear it whenever I go out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as you knew she held to that promise. You remember seeing her wearing it at Twilight\u2019s coronation, and that alone was enough to make you smile like an idiot.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the necklace you gave Princess Celestia for Mother\u2019s Day?\u201d Twilight asks, snapping you out of your flashback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah\u2026\u201d you answer. You then see Discord take something out and put it on the table. It  was a small rectangular box. \u201cWhat do you think is in there?\u201d you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Twilight whispers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both find out what is in the box when Discord takes it out. It was another necklace. One that was much more expensive. It was gold with several different kinds of gems <br>\r\nencrusted into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor you, my dear,\u201d he says to Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood starts to boil. He may not know that the necklace Celestia is wearing is the one that you gave her, but you were still mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis necklace looks much better on you,\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Celestia\u2019s response?</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s always nagged you to tell her about your history with the princess, but you never told her. Now she has the perfect opportunity to know your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was close friends with [your name\u2019s] parents,\u201d Celestia explains. \u201cActually, I was the one that got them together. I was his mom\u2019s maid of honor at their wedding, and I was there when [your name] was born. After his birth, I vowed to his parents that I would take care of him should anything happen to them.\u201d The princess giggles to herself. \u201cThere were even times where I took time off from my royal duties to pay a visit and spend some time with [your name].

She remembered her mother answering the phone, the shocked look on her face, and the expression of horror on yours when she told you the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try not to cry when you hear Celestia tell the story, and you continue to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[Your name] had nowhere to go, so I had him stay in the castle for the rest of the summer,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt really depressed me, watching him sulk around, so I did whatever I could to make him happy and keep the promise I made. After some serious thought, I decided to send him to live in Ponyville to spend his high school years with Twilight. I figured that if he made friends with her friends, it would cure his loneliness and make him feel a lot happier. I called him every day to make sure that he was doing alright. Even though I knew he\u2019d be fine, I couldn\u2019t help but worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d asks Discord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d she answers, \u201che\u2019s like the son I never had. I love him dearly, and I\u2019d never forgive myself if anything bad happened to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t help but smile when you hear Celestia say that.

I just wanted you to know that I was sorry.\"</span>, he said, lowering his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked by this. Discord apologizing for what he did to you and being understanding. This side of him was new to you. Maybe, just maybe, he wasn't as bad as you thought, Just mischievous. You thought about what he said. Sure, he was your rival in winning Celestia's heart, but did you need to be enemies? Also, even tough you didn't liked it, you had to consider that Celestia may choose him instead of you. And, whatever her choice would be, nothing would make her happier then the two of you getting along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Discord.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Y-yes?\"</span>, he said, lifting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, your not the only one that loves Celestia.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"*chuckle* I know. I know she's your aunt and that you-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"NO!!! That's not it! I love her more than just as an aunt or a mother!

I- I had no idea!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Of course you didn't. I made sure that no one knew. Before my parents died, I looked at her and saw her as an aunt. After the accident, I saw her as a second mother. A year after that, I began seeing her as a mare. From the moment that happenned, I was sure that I loved her.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"(Name)...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I know you l- love her. I saw how you talked to her yesterday. And the way you looked like when you gave her that necklace.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Yeah. She prefered you-. Wait! How do you know that I gave her a necklace?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Twilight and I used the transformation spell to follow the two of you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"!!! Where did she...?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Chrysalis taught Celestia and Celestia taught Twilight.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Hmm. I see.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Back to the matter at hand. Tonight, I plan on confessing to her. I hope that she chooses me. But I know that she might choose you. Still,  whatever her choice is, I will respect  it. Becauso I want her to be happy. Should she coose me, I hope you do the same. But, I want you to know that, whether she cooses me or you, I would like to get along with you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Really?! You would?! Why?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"For two reasons. One, whether it's in a romantic way or not, Celestia loves us both. And I know that nothing would make her happier that seeing the two of us being friends. And two, because I was I'm impressed by your actions today. So, I thought that you might not be bad like I thought. Besides, Fluttershy is right. Everyone deserves a second chance.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finished saying that, you looked at Discord and you were surprised to see him, of all people, crying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Thank you, (name). Thank you! You have no idea how those words made me happy. And don't worry. I too want Celestia to be happy. So, even if she chooses you over me, I'll still will want to be your friend and I will still love Celestia.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Discord finished talking you walked up to him and extended your arm, he did the same and you shaked hands. You then unlocked the door and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"(name)?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes, Discord?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Good luck with \"Auntie Celeste* *wink*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"He, he. That's more like the Discord I know. Thank you. Also, good luck to you as well.\"</span></span></div></div>",

You could never tell your aunt that you liked her sister. Even if she wasn't really your aunt, you're sure that Celestia wouldn't be okay with you liking her sister. You're not even sure if she's okay with you liking other mares n general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, [your name],\" she asks. \"You seem a little spaced out.\" You then see a glint in her eye. \"Lemme guess, you're thinking about a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you lie. \"I'm just thinking about how I'm gonna spend the next three weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she says, sounding somewhat relieved. \"Well, you just let me worry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you say, relieved that she didn't see through your lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Celestia calls everyone to dinner. As you get there, you see a vacant seat next to Luna. You take a chance to walk up to her. \"Excuse me, Luna,\" you say. \"Is this seat taken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess of the Night smiles warmly at you. \"Not at all, [your name],\" she says. \"Please sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner gets started, Luna strikes up a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, [your name],\" she says. \"My sister tells me that you are an artist, and that you're really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well...

The next morning, at breakfast, Celestia tells everypony about her plans to go to the beach, and they all cheer in excitement. Everypony rushes to get ready to go, and by eleven AM, you were all on the train. You wanted to sit in a booth with Luna, but then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, [your name]!\" calls Rainbow Dash. \"Where're you goin'? Come sit with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't just blow off your friends just to sit with Luna. You liked her, but you weren't obsessed with her. After almost an hour of idle chatter with your friends, you all finally make it to the beach. As you all get off the train, you see two changing rooms, one for males, one for females. Spike didn't need to change, so you were in the changing room by yourself, which felt rather weird. You look up and see a grate in the wall separating the two changing room. All you needed to do is step up on the nearby stool and you had a clear view of the girls. While you did have a crush on Luna, you did consider all your other pony friends to be a little attractive in their own way. Plus, you thought Chrysalis and Cadance to be pretty attractive, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, an angel and a devil appear on your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it, bro,\" the devil says. \"This opportunity will never pass you by again! You get to see Luna change AND a bunch of other cute mares!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that!\" says the angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's not the right thing to do?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, because it's too risky!\" the angel says. \"There are ten mares in there. Odds are, one of them is bound to notice you. Not to mention that one of those mares is Auntie Celeste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, he's got a point,\" says the devil. \"Seeing <b>her</b> changing will fuck up the entire experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your mind made up, the angel and devil disappear from your shoulders, and you go outside to wait for the girls. You hear them coming out of the changing room, and your face turns red when you see them all in their bathing suits. Even Fluttershy, Twilight, and Rainbow Dash with their one piece suits looked pretty hot. Celestia comes out behind everypony else, and she was wearing a pink bikini that was rather revealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dammit, Auntie,\"</i> you think. <i>\"Why? Just... why?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait up everypony!\" you hear from inside the changing room. Out comes Luna, who was still adjusting her bathing suit, a two piece that was just as attractive as Celestia's (did you just admit that?), but left more to the imagination. All the other ponies went off on their own, some basking in the sun, other going in the water. Luna, on the other hand, walks towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, [your name],\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Luna,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" she says. \"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess giggles. \"Thank you,\" she says. \"So, how about we...\"</span></div></div>",

You realize what Luna's about to do, and you repeatedly beg her to stop, but your cries fall on deaf ears. Luna lifts you higher and higher, then moves you over an open area of water. With a snap of her fingers, the spell releases, and you fall straight into the cold water. Even under the water, you can hear everypony laugh at you. You resurface seconds later, gasping for air and shivering. You turn around to see Luna was right behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... n-n-not cool...

A tent quickly forms in your shorts again by the time she pulls you into her room and shuts the door. \"I've found you rather attractive for some time now, [your name],\" Luna says, locking the door. \"I'm not being too forward, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no, of course not,\" you say, trying not to be distracted as Luna starts undoing the string keeping her top on. \"I've liked you for a while, too, Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiled and blushed slightly before removing her top. Seeing her firm breasts bared within arms reach almost made you cum in your shorts. Her breasts were round and firm, barely loosing shape when she removed the garment and tossed it aside. With a sultry look, Luna hooks a finger into the waistband of your shorts and pulls. The shorts fall and expose your hard shaft to the princess. Pre-cum already dripped from the tip and it pulsed slightly. \"I like what I see,\" Luna says, looking at your through her eyelashes. She turned her back to you and pushed down her bottoms, giving you a slow reveal of her round, firm butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you wake up back at the beach to the sound of Luna's soft giggling.

You push open the door and see that the gym is nicely decorated for some reason, which you can't wrap your head around. Why in the world would they decorate the gym like this when school's been out for weeks? You look to the gym's stage, and see a DJ stand with speakers on either side of it. Just then, it hits you. This was exactly how the gym was decorated for junior prom! You look at yourself and see that you're dressed in the same tuxedo you wore at the dance as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind quickly goes back to that night. You didn't have a date, and neither did Twilight, so you just went with each other as friends, something that Rainbow Dash teased you about for a week. You look around and see that nopony is here. \"Am I the only one here?\" you ask yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're not,\" a voice says, and you jump in surprise. You turn around to see Luna walking towards you, dressed in a midnight blue dress that went down to her hooves. There was a tear in the side that went up to her hip, which allowed her long dress to be less restrictive on her legs. Her mane was done in a ponytail (oh, the irony) and she had a necklace with a charm in the shape of a moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna?\" you ask. \"What are you-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dreaming,\" she says. \"I wanted to come visit you, and I was lucky you were dreaming about your prom night. It gave me an opportunity to dress nicely for you. I could make this place look much nicer for both of us, but I'd be using a lot of magic, and Celestia might sense it despite the fact that she's sleeping. I think it's best for both of us that she doesn't interrupt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interrupt what?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our dance,\" she says with an alluring smile. Her horn emits a glow, and it makes a slow song start to play out of the speakers. She wraps her arms around your waist, and you drape yours over her shoulders. You both start to move with the music, the both of you enjoying each other's embrace. You never thought that Luna would want to be this close to you, and now it's happening! The princess looked into your eyes, and you look into hers, mesmerized by their soft shade of blue.

You start thrusting at Luna's urging and feel that you won't be able to last long inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screw your eyes shut and bury your face in Luna's full breasts as your orgasm crests. You let out a loud, yet muffled, grunt as you explode inside Luna and proceed to fill her with an immense load. You grunt into her breasts as she screams in pleasure, firing more cum into her than her pussy can hold. An immense amount of your spunk bursts out of her around your cock and splatters onto her inner thighs, coating some of her blue white. Luna traps you in a passionate kiss in the wake of your explosive orgasm and the dream fades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to find...</span></div></div>",

You all get your room keys, and make your way to the top floor, where all your rooms were. Finding your room was a cinch, despite the massive number of hallways and doors, and you and Luna find out that Celestia's room is right next to yours. Unbeknownst to the either of you, the princess planned it that way. You and Luna get settled in your room, and you notice that there are two beds. If you're lucky, you'll get Luna to share one of them with you by the time you leave Las Pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you all go to dinner at the hotel's restaurant, but all that was on Celestia's mind was her plans for later that night. After dinner, you go back up to your room with Luna and prepare for bed, but then you get a call from Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sweetheart,\" she says. \"Can you meet me in my room for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, okay...\" you say, then you turn to Luna. \"I have to go, Luna.

You roll your eyes and make your way to the bed, lying down next to your aunt. \"Now look at me,\" she says, and you turn your head towards her. \"Do you love me?\" she asks with a baby voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you ask. \"Are we really doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I love you, right?\" she asks, ignoring your last remark. \"I love you very much, [your name].\" You fail to notice her inching closer to you. \"You've grown into such a handsome young man. It's a wonder why you don't have mares falling for you left and right.\" She then chuckles to herself and puts a hand on your cheek. \"They must not see what I see.

Needless to say that your strength shocked everypony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"What are you doing you idiots?! Get him!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four enemies left charged at you at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Look out!\"</span>, Nightmare Moon shouted, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Don't worry. I can easily take care of four foalish idiots.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Then take this!\", yelled brute number one. Trying to punch your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punch did connected. But you didn't felt a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Was that your best punch?

Now, it's my turn.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then grabbed one of the brutes arm, spined him around and threw him against two of the other three brutes. Launching them them all against the wall, like their leader, who had gotten up and was charging at you along with the remaining brute. The leader tried to kick you from your left side and the other brute tried to hook punch you in the face. You merely jumped in the sky and dodged. Predictably, the leader's kick hitted the brute's stomach and the brute's punch hitted the leader's face, knocking him on the floor. The brute fell as well, knocked out. And the leader was to tired and harmed to do anything else than sitting straight and looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"W-why?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Hmm?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Why do you defend this monster?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Um...

I do. I know exactly what she tried to do.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Then why do you protected her?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Because everypony deserves a second chance. And because it was the right thing to do. Now, let me ask you a question. Who is the monster? The one trying to defend herself and who's not harming anyone? or The one, or ones in this case, that take advantage of one's moment of weakness and try to take revenge in such a cowardly way?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth, the brute and Nightmare looked at you with wide eyes. The brute then lowered his head, ashamed and realizing what him and his fellas had done and had tried to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"clblue\">*He's wise, caring and protective. It's almost like...*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Um... Missy?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare looked at the brute. Her face showing no emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Look, I'm... I'm sorry about what me and my companions did to you. We let our anger control us. And we promise, by the princesses, that were not going to do anything like this again, to anypony.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat surprised Nightmare. The man who harmed her was humbly asking for her forgiveness. You, on the other hoof, were smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Don't worry. I understand why you did it. And I forgive you. I won't hold any ill feelings against you and your friends.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Thank you, missy.\"</span>, he then looked at you. <span class=\"cred\">\"Um... If I may ask, who are you? To have such strength and speed... I'ts not something anypony can achieve.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"My name is (your name).\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"*GASP!!!* You meat THAT (name)?!

That's me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Nightmare was surprised before, she was even more so now! Not only her savior was a human, but her also was related to her former host and said host sister! Now she knew why his attitude seemed so familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Oh, my humble apologies, your highness!!!\"</span>, said the brute, suddenly bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"P-please don't do that. It's kind of embarrassing.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"B-but your royalty!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Maybe so but, I don't think I'm better that anypony or anyone. Look, how about you and your friends just go home and we'll forget this ever happened, okay?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Yes, sir. Thank you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then woke his friends and they all went their ways.

Some looked at you with admiration, some looked at you like you were crazy for helping someone as dangerous as Nightmare Moon and some looked at Nightmare Moon in fear. You simply ignored them. Nightmare Moon, on the other hand, was having trouble was feeling uncomfortable with so many stares. Noticing her worry, you leaned her head against your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Hey. Don't worry. Their just a bit uneasy.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"They are right to be so. I did caused a lot of problems for Equestria.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Maybe, but I believe that everyone/pony can change.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Why do you say that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Because I have faith. And if you want examples, Discord turned a new page and, while he still is mischievous and gets on everyone's/ponies's nerves at times, he's not evil anymore.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"What?! Discord became good?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes. Hard to believe, isn't it? But the element of kindness, Fluttershy, managed to befriend Discord and, with help from the other elements and myself, we managed to reform him. There's another ex-villain that you'll eventually meet after we arrive at the castle.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Hmm, I see. Still dosen't explain how you think <i>I</i> could change, tough. I mean, I was born out of negative feelings.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"So? I still have faith that anyone/pony can change. No matter who they are or what are their origins. Also, if you ask me, I don't see an enraged, maniacal, selfish and insane mare. Rather, I see a scared, beautiful mare that just needs to let a bit of friendship into her heart.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Thank you-! Did you just called me <i>beautiful</i>?\"</span>, she asked, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Ah! W-well... I guess I did.\"</span>, now you were blushing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Do you really think I'm beautiful? You're not just saying it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Can I call you Moon?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Moon, look into my eyes and tell me if I'm lying.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked and could see nothing but sincerity in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"T-thank you, (name).\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Don't mention it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 or 15 minutes of walking, arrived at the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Ah. (name), sir. Its good to see your in one piece?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"What do you mean? Why wouldn't I be in one piece?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"We heard of what happened at the city.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Uh oh...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Why \"uh oh\"?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"If the guards heard it, then auntie Celeste and auntie Luna must already know.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Yes, they do sir.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Um, sir? Pardon me but, is that who we think it is?\"</span>, asked the second guard with a bit of fear on his voice. Finally noticing the injured mare in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes and no.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Uh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes, she is Nightmare Moon. No, she's not evil.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Oh. Well, if you say so... Anyway, the princesses are very concerned for you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I see. I'll take Nightmare Moon to the infirmary and then I'll go talk to them. Thanks for your hard work.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir.\", both guards saluted at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then entered the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"*sigh* I don't really like when ponies salute or bow to me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Why? Your royalty, even if your adopted.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I know. It's just that, it feel embarrassing and uncomfortable. I don't want anyone/pony treating me like I'm some kind of deity. I prefer to think that I''m just like anyone/pony else. Just because one lives in a palace, dosen't mean he/she is a better person or pony. After all, it's one's actions that define who they are.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Then, if one is defined by his/her actions, aren't I a monster for what I did?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Some may think like that but, while there's always time for god things to become bad, the opposite is also true. Meaning that bad things, or, in this case, pony, can become good.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Celestia taught you very well, you know?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Thank you, Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"You're welcome.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you finished chatting, you were on the infirmary. You then, gently, placed Nightmare Moon on an empty bed and called for the nurse. After a couple minutes, a cheerful nurse appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Hello, I'm nurse, Redheart. And I'll be taking care of you today!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Um... Thank you. But...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"But what, dear?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"A-aren't you scared of me?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Well, normally I would be but, if Mr. (name) brought you here and if he's comfortable around you, then I don't think your a bad pony. Besides, here, in the hospital wing, our job is to heal, not to judge.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Thank you, miss Redheart. I't nice hearing it from another pony.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"You're welcome. Now, let's get you checked up, shall we? Mr. (name), I'll have to ask that you wait outside.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"What? But, but...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then gently placed a hand of Moon's chin and stroked her pretty face with your thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Shhh. Don't worry.\"</span> you said in a kind and caring tone. <span class=\"cblue\">\"I'll be right outside the infirmary. And if you need anything, just call. Also, I'm sure miss Redheart will get me once she's done.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"You have my word.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"A-alright.\"</span>, she said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then exited the infirmary and sat on a bench at the waiting room. Things were quiet for a moment but, as usual, things didn't stay that way for long. Because suddenly, the door opened and in came Twilight and co., the Princesses, including Cadence, and Chrysalis. All of them sported worried faces, except for Chrysalis, who wasn't paying much attention.</span></div></div>",

You feel yourself getting more and more frustrated with Celestia for humiliating you like that. For a moment, you wonder if you're just being petty, but then you remember all the <b>other</b> times Celestia's treated you like a child over the years. If this shit keeps up, you're gonna explode! When you finally get into the bedroom, Celestia tells you where the bathroom is, and where your clothes are, and you pay half-attention to her, which she quickly notices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, sweetie?\" she asks as you wince at that last word. \"You seem a little quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay. This is my chance to tell her how you feel about her babying me all the time. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">All I have to do is calmly explain how uncomfortable it makes me.</span> Screw that! I'n giving her a piece of my mind!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Celestia,\" you say. \"I'm not okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess is taken aback by the fact that you addressed her by her name. \"Okay, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong is that you embarrassed me in front of everyone less than five minutes ago!\" you say, the sudden rise in your volume making Celestia flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realizes what she did wrong, but she tries to make it seem like it's not that big of a deal. \"Well, maybe they're just jealous,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. My friends would kill to have a princess doting on them 24/7.\" The sarcasm in that sentence is as clear as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you acting like this?\" Celestia asks, flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm tired of you babying me all the time!\" you say. \"I'm seventeen years old! I'm going to college next year, and I still have you treating me like a toddler! Why do you always do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that getting mad wouldn't solve anything, Celestia walk closer to you and puts a hand on your shoulder. \"Because I'm your aunt, [your name], and I promised your parents that I'd look out for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a difference between looking out for me and babying me,\" you say, pushing her hand away. \"And this may be news to you, but you're not my real aunt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose last few words strike Celestia like a freight train. Without taking another look at her, you walk towards the bedroom door. \"I need some air,\" you say without looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go out to the castle's balcony, and look out into the distance, taking a long sigh. You finally let out all the anger and frustration that was building up inside you, so why to you still feel bad. All of a sudden, you hear somepony talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing out here?\" you hear. You turn around and see Queen Chrysalis walking towards you. She looked rather alluring at this time of night, but you push the thought out of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" you say. \"Just thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't have anything to do with Celestia, would it?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just passed by her bedroom and heard sobbing coming from inside,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great. You made Celestia cry. Sure, you were mad with her, but you didn't mean to make her cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Celestia,\" says Chrysalis, taking your silence as a confirmation. \"She's a strong mare, so whatever you did to make her that upset must've been pretty harsh. She and I may have only just started to get along, but I actually feel sorry for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprises you. Could Chrysalis really have turned over a new leaf? Maybe she's just playing you. You could just ignore her, but maybe talking to her will make you feel better.</span></div></div>",

I just wanted to finally let that be heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you took it too far,\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were on the verge of breaking down.

I understand what you mean, but at least consider yourself lucky you have someone to care for you, even if she isn't your real aunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized she was right.

Coming from her, maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach Celestia's closed room. You hesitate of opening the door, since you still hear sobbing coming out from the other side. You sucked it up and prepared for what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, you realize it's darker than usual and that Celestia is sobbing from the bed. Now you really feel bad. Not only saying that to her, but making her cry as well? You never saw her do so; and now you see it's sadder than what you thought would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie..?\" you weakly say.

You don't like where this is going, so you slowly walk towards her, ready to take any yelling or scolding she was prepared to dish out. To your surprise, though, she doesn't say a word. Instead, she slowly raises her arm, as if she were reaching out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia, I just wanted to say-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you get another word in, Celestia fires a magical blast that pushes you back like a powerful telekinetic force, slamming you into the door. You grunt in pain as you slide to the floor, but you're glad you had closed the door behind you. If it was open, you would've been knocked right out into the hallway, and Celestia would have the chance to lock you out of the room. You slowly get back on your feet and continue to walk towards Celestia. The princess fires another blast, knocking you off your feet again. You get back up and keep walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia please, just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're interrupted again by yet another blast. Fortunately, you had anticipated this and braced for the impact, so you were able to stay on your feet. You keep walking, and you are able to dodge the next blast Celestia fires. Luckily, she had exhausted all the power she had into that last blast, and she needed to recharge. By the time she raises her arm to fire another round, you were right in front of her, at point blank range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of anger in Celestia's eyes scares you, and the tears streaming down from them sadden you. The mixture of fear, sorrow, and remorse brings a tear to your eye as you wait for her to fire. Your aunt looks at you, her magically charged hand inches away from your chest. She can knock you out right now, but then she realizes something. She'd be bringing harm to her dearest nephew. She swore to your parents that she'd protect you, and here she is threatening to knock you unconscious. She can't bring herself to do it, not only because she's be going against her promise, but because she'd be hurting the boy that was like the son she never had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia slowly lowers her arm, the angry look on her face disappearing. You take this opportunity you hug your dear aunt tightly, as if you couldn't let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celeste, I'm really sorry for what I said earlier,\" you say. \"I was stupid to let my anger get the better of me. I'm glad that you look out for me and do everything you can to make me happy. I don't care if I'm really related to you or not. To me, you <b>are</b> my real aunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel tears drip onto your shoulders. \"Do you really mean that?\" you hear Celestia ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every word,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess sniffles \"I'm sorry too, [your name]. I should've been aware of your feelings,\" she says. \"I didn't mean to be so overprotective all these years. I'll try to give you your space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Thanks, <b>Auntie</b>,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the two of you, Chrysalis was watching everything, a small smile forming on her face. That strange feeling suddenly returned. There was a warmth in her chest that she couldn't explain, and it made her feel good. The Queen of the Changelings walks back to her room, embracing this new feeling she was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up and see that Celestia was gone.

I guess I'm finally turning over a new leaf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis smiles at Celestia, and the latter seems to buy the former's story. \"Alright then,\" she says. \"Anyway, breakfast is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right down, then,\" says the queen of the changelings.

After the argument, I came out here to collect myself, and then Chrysalis came along. After telling her what had happened, she suggested that I apologize to Celestia, and I... got a little caught up in the moment and hugged her. I made up with Celestia afterward. Then this morning, I ran into Chrysalis again, and we were talking about last night. She told me that when I hugged her, a strange feeling welled up inside her, and that she felt it again when she saw me and Celestia patching things up. She then wanted to tell me something, and she was a little hesitant to say it, but then Celestia interrupted us and she didn't get a chance to say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna finally begins to understand Chrysalis's role in this. She then ponders for a second. \"If you ask me, I think that Chrysalis wanted to tell you that she likes you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen, and you look at the princess. \"You think so?\" you ask, and she nods her head. \"You don't seem bothered by it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe everypony deserves a second chance, [your name],\" she explains. \"I was given one, Discord was given one, and both situations proved to work out for the better. The same can happen with Chrysalis, if she's given the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. \"I wish your sister felt the same way,\" you say. \"After she saw me with Chrysalis, she told me that I couldn't be around her anymore. That led to me being so preoccupied during breakfast. I was wondering why she had to be so harsh, especially when she promised not to be like that. Why does she have to be so protective of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't alone,\" says Luna. \"Imagine what it's like being her younger sister. To this day, she treats me like a foal despite the fact that I'm a grown mare. I can definitely sympathize with you, [your name]. If there's one reprehensible quality about Celestia, it's that she can't admit when she's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both laugh at the truth in that fact.

So here's my plan: I've been practicing telepathy spells for awhile, so I can distract Celestia while you go and talk to Chrysalis. If anything goes wrong, I'll let you know immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really nice of you, Luna,\" you say. \"When should we try this out?\"</span></div></div>",

She decides to stay there a little longer so she can hear Celestia's explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been there for you since the day you were born, [your name],\" she says. \"I've been watching you grow and mature, and I promised your parents that I would look after you while you went to high school in Ponyville. A while after you started living there, I started to... notice things about you. You had grown into a great young man, and a handsome one, too. Soon I began to have romantic feelings for you, and I tried to push those thoughts out of my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Luna, and Twilight look at each other, shocked to hear what you're hearing. Twilight, in particular, was surprised to find out that her mentor was harboring affection for the boy she thought of as kind of a second brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was wrong, because even though we weren't related by blood, I was still family to you, and it'd almost be like an incestuous relationship,\" Celestia continues, \"but I eventually got over that insecurity. Part of the reason why invited you and your friends here was so that I could get closer to you and... and maybe you'd develop the same feelings I had for you, but then Chrysalis... you feel in love with <b>her</b> instead. I was prepared to deal with you falling in love with another mare, since there was a chance of that happening, but I never imagined that it would be her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you've been acting like this, sister,\" says Luna. \"You were in denial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder princess nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie Celeste, I...\" you say. \"I had no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry for putting you through all this, [your name],\" Celestia says as she wraps you in a hug. \"I just couldn't bear the thought of you not being with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Auntie,\" you say. \"I finally understand how you fell now.\" You were being sincere when you said that.

I love Chrysalis, though, and while I am flattered, I just can't be with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight is left speechless, Luna sheds a tear, and Chrysalis, who was still right outside, was crying tears of joy after hearing you say that you loved her, even though she's heard you say it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Celestia's response, though.</span></div></div>",

It was particularly lethal to males, so when it cleared up, the population was disproportionately female. A law was put into place requiring males to take on more than one partner in an attempt to repopulate the land.\" Celestia looked around. \"What? It was a desperate move, yes, but it worked! After about four or five generations, the population had stabilized to the point where the law was no longer required. It was altered so that a male could take on more than one partner so longer as all parties involved agree to the arrangement and sign a marriage contract that they write together. Almost no one knows about this law, but it is still valid. I understand if you're not interested but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept!\" All eyes were now on Chrysalis, who was grinning. \"A political marriage will help strengthen the bonds between our countries. That's the political reason. The more personal reason is that these emotions are new and strange to me, and I think it would be advisable to have someone with more experience help guide me. Or two someones.\" She walked over and hugged you lightly from behind, then whispered in your ear, \"Besides, think of all the things we could do in the bedroom with another girl, (your name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it briefly, and your face reddened visibly. You hoped the others didn't hear what Chrysalis just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled softly, and said, \"I am pleased you accepted this so easily. I accept it as well. After all it would make me look silly if I didn't.\" Celestia began walking towards you and <br>\r\nChrysalis, who was still hugging you, a little tighter now. \"What do you say (your name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed and took a deep breathe, before saying, \"I accept-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have said more, except that several things happened very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Chrysalis and Celestia began shouting \"YAY!\" and hugging each other tightly, with you sandwiched in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) As a result of 1), your head was now trapped between two ample sets of breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) As a result of 2), your heart rate skyrocketed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) As a combined result of 2) and 3), your internal oxygen supply was rapidly disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) As a combined result of 4) and flat-out embarrassment at your current situation, you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour last thought before you lost consciousness was, 'If I die here and now, it will be without regret.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia and Chrysalis stopped hugging when they felt your body slump downward. They broke apart, Chrysalis catching you before you could actually fall.

They had no problem with making sure you weren't harassed by anypony, and the wedding didn't have to be as extravagant as Shining Armor and Cadance's but for the alliance between Canterlot and the Changeling Empire to work, there had to be at least some public knowledge about the wedding.

Finally, she speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can't have you, [your name],\" she says, \"then nopony can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's eyes widen when she hears this, and she immediately knows what Celestia is about to do. Unfortunately, her reaction wasn't fast enough. Celestia quickly wraps her arms around you in a crushing hug, then her wings open and wraps them around you. Her horn then glows and a blinding white light, that stuns Luna and Twilight just as Luna was about to cast a counterspell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast!\" says Luna. \"She was to quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did they go?\" says Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea,\" the taller princess replies. \"We have to find them before Celestia does something she'll regret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I tell the others?\" asks Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Cadance and Chrysalis,\" says Luna. \"We don't want your friends to get too involved in this. I know you think they may be able to help, but the only thing that can stop a princess as powerful as Celestia is another princess that is just as powerful. Hopefully, with my strength combined with that of you, Cadance, and Chrysalis, we can save [your name] and calm my sister down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two princesses leave the room to find Chrysalis (who quickly fled the hallway) and Cadance, and begin their mission to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you're still in Celestia's embrace, and you were in total darkness. That darkness, however, was only caused by Celestia hugging you so tightly that your face was buried into her shoulder. She loosens her grip a little, not by much, but just enough to give you a good view of where you are. You're in some kind of cave, with crystals in the walls. Cadance has told you about this place before. She was held captive here herself once. These... these are the Canterlot Caves! Now that you know where you are, you try to communicate with Luna through your mind again, but she doesn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not going to work, [your name],\" says Celestia. \"I severed your telepathic connection with my sister last night when I pulled you out of the Dream Dimension.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia, please-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that!\" she says, raising her voice and tightening her grip on you. \"You're supposed to call me 'Auntie Celeste'. It's all I have now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie, you have to stop this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't... I can't let anypony else have you. You're to important to me to just let go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Literally <b>and</b> figuratively,\"</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other option, you muster up all the strength to try and escape. You squat down, causing your body to slide out of the princess's grip, and you immediately turn tail and make a break for it. You run as fast as you possibly can, but as you turn the corner, you see Celestia in front of you. How could you have overlooked the fact that she could use teleportation spells. Before you can stop and turn the other way, the princess raises a hand towards you, firing a magical blast that sends you flying. You land on your back and the impact makes you shut your eyes. When you open them again, you see Celestia straddling you, a look of sadness still on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Celeste,\" you say, \"Get off of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, so you can run away from me again?\" she says. \"Why do you hate me, [your name]?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says that I hate you?\" you ask back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell by the way you've been looking at me lately, like you don't even want me around, like I'm an annoyance to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how I think of you at all. It's just that I have feelings for Chrys-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Don't</b>... say... her name.\" she says, the tears beginning to flow again. \"I won't let her take you away from me.\" She then lowers herself onto you, and caresses you cheek with her hand. \"I want to show you how much I love you. Maybe then you'll see that I'm the one you should be with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panic and start to struggle as Celestia lowers her face closer and closer to yours.</span></div></div>",

He hasn\u2019t called you that in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s Chrysalis?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s suffered a few injuries, but the healing spells that I\u2019ve been studying will be enough to heal her,\" says Twilight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a sigh of relief. \"Do the others know what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as they're concerned, Chrysalis has a stomachache, Celestia's having migraines, and you're just feeling dizzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we all know that's not the case. Matter of fact, you're perfectly fine, so if you need some fresh air, you can go on ahead,\u201d says Shining Armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome fresh air would be nice,\u201d you say. You get off the bed and walk outside. On your way to the balcony, you feel a strong presence of magic coming from somewhere. You end up following the trail to a room of the castle that you've never seen. There is a blue aura surrounding the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Luna must be in there,\"</i> you think. You turn out to be correct when you hear Luna's voice from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to keep you here until you get your emotions under control, big sister,\" she says. \"I'm not doing this because I want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" says Celestia, \"but... I want to see [your name].\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know full well that I can't allow that,\" the younger sister replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just two minutes. That's all I ask. I just want to apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer is no, Celestia. Even though I have restricted the use of your magic for the time being, I can't risk having [your name] around you. Perhaps later, when you're more stable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna, I'm begging you, let me see him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I'll tell him that you want to see him, but if he says no, that's it. Understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly bolt from the door and make your way to the balcony.

Not to mention the fact that she took your actual first kiss. Even if it was with Chrysalis, it was only a dream. Either way, it felt real. So, you're not exactly sure about that anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out to the skies, past the mountains and aimlessly looking at the outer voids that you question every now and then.

It looks like an average room, but the somewhat shadow of it makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable. You realize that your aunt is still paralyzed but can move enough to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you in slight fear, somewhat execting for a harsh scolding for doing that to you. But all you wanted was to forgive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm sorry, dear nephew... You must really hate me now, (your name), for putting you through all that trouble...\" Celestia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you reply, in a surprised, calm tone. \"No! I never hated you to begin with, Auntie Celeste.\" Her somewhat shocked expression startled you for a second. \"I mean, yes, you did all that against my will, but I know you only did that because of your jealousy and denial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia cries tears of happiness. \"So... you're not mad..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle for a bit. \"I wasn't mad, Auntie. Matter of fact, I will admit, I did sorta like your attention for a bit there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and rolls her eyes. \"Maybe you did like me, well, just a little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I really want to say here, Auntie Celeste, is that all is forgiven.\" You knew she couldn't, so you hug her instead.

She stares at your still form in disbelief. \"[Your name]?\" she said, unsure of whether or not she actually heard your heart beat. While it was entirely possible that her mind was playing tricks on her, she wanted to hang onto whatever shred of hope that she had, even if it was a small one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrysalis! Your horn!\" Twilight says, pointing at the horn in question. The queen looks up to see that her horn is glowing a bright white color, a total surprise to her and everypony else, because her magical aura is usually green. Chrysalis then looks down and sees the same white glow coming from your chest. That glow started to brighten and dim in a steady rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis then felt a familiar feeling within herself. The same one she's been experiencing since you first hugged her. While this feeling overcame her for fleeting moments before, now it enveloped her entire being. She then feels another unfamiliar sensation; her heart is beating hard enough for her to feel it in her chest, and she feels as though another heart is beating alongside hers. Shifting her eyes to the glow on your chest, she notices that the rhythm it was flickering to was the same rhythm of her heart, and a sudden realization came over her. Somehow the love she felt for you caused your heart to sync with hers, thus restoring it to full health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I doing this...?\" she asks herself out loud. All of a sudden, your eyes shoot open, and you gasp in a large huff of air, catching everypony in the room off guard. You sit up, still huffing and puffing, placing your hand on your chest in disbelief. You could have sworn you were dead. The next thing you feel is a pair of arms wrapping around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name]!\" Chrysalis rejoiced as the light on her horn disappears. \"You're alive! It's a miracle- wait a minute...\" The changeling inspects your back, where Celestia's magical blast hit you. While your shirt is damaged, your skin beneath looked completely unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So not only did your love for [your name] revive him,\" said Cadance, \"but it also healed his injury. Amazing.\" Coming from the embodiment of love herself, your revivification must have been quite the feat. Or was it because it was Chrysalis that revived you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to the queen's knees and see the necklace you had gotten for her resting on the cave floor. \"Well, so much for the surprise,\" you say, getting a giggle form Chrysalis and everypony else in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just came back from the dead and you still have time for jokes,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me,\" you say with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get you beck to the castle, little bro,\" says Shining Armor. \"I'm sure you'd want some breakfast after all you've been through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we could all use a meal,\" Luna agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, Celestia was standing there, wasn't sure if she should be relieved or afraid. She decided not to say anything, and just stood in the corner while everypony rejoiced your coming back to life. She wanted nothing more than to say that she was sorry for all the trouble she caused, but the fear in her heart prevented her from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the caves and returning to your room, you change your shirt and head out to the dining hall. You round a corner and bump into Celestia, who you realize you haven't said a word to. While you feel a little upset with her, you still forgive her in your heart. She just needs to hear it in words. \"Hi, Auntie Celeste,\" you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looks at you and she...</span></div></div>",

You couldn't really tell since you weren't paying much attention to that, but you were looking at the roster list for the fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in the first bracket, so you would be fighting first against a unicorn named Rose Petal... Twilight appears to be in the last bracket, so you won't be fighting until the final match. That's if you both make it there of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cast an invisibilty spell on your wings to keep them hidden like you did in the qualifying match.

Hmm... here, there, counteracting... got it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as Celestia started the battle, Rose Petal brought up an aura sphere and started running towards you, with more speed than you thought she had. Please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Running towards her, you start off normally. Until you got close enough, your speed increased tenfold and pierced through her field, sending her concentration into flux.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rose tried to cast it again but was foiled by a charged up beam from you, sending her straight to a stone wall. Getting up, the field was back on and she was sending a valley of magic bolts in which you deflect back. They missed, but a lucky one got to her and cracked her field. Charging up power, you turn it into a ball and throw it, thus demolishing her field and attacking her directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Struggling to get up, you walk towards her and charge up some more power, but she backs down and forfeits. Celestia sees this and says, \"Rose Petal forfeits the battle, which means [your name] wins the battle!\" Cheering was everywhere as you help your former opponent up. You smile and heal her, saying, \"Good game,\" after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, looks like I'll have to get better. I hope I see you again next year,\" Rose Petal says. She then walks away, but not before saying, \"What an interesting human...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You took it as a compliment since you're the only human who has magic like this at all. Walking back to your station, you were greeted by the next round, Star Shine and Platinum Flare. \"Nice game out there; hope you're ready to take on one of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We'll see what happens guys.\"</span></div></div>",

So... with the right environmental changes, you should be good to go. And to save time, and names, we'll skip over to Twilight's battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ironic enough, she got paired up with Trixie in a beach-like terrain. Speaking of which, if there was anypony you should be studying, it was her. You don't know each other's fighting style, as far as you know, but you shouldn't worry much. After all, yours is random and can't exactly be deciphered completely; you were learning from the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But now that you see her in action, she's quick, changes her range every now and then, and her damage varies from small to large. You'll need to stay on guard. She wins eventually and inevitably. You guess that she really wants to see how your ability can be pushed to it's limit. It's gonna be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There's something about a certain fighter though, that you just noticed the 2 rounds ago.

Challengers, take your positions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The environment now is a mountainous arena that has many hills, cliffs, and peaks. How long was this stadium again, half a mile? Or one in total? Rocks here and there... what's that up there? He's not exactly field checking nor does he do much looking around. Probably a stationary fighter. Should be easy. Wait, is he trappy? That even a word?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, if won't move, I'll wait as well,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Begin!\" As the word was shouted, Flare kicks down and causes an earthquake big enough to lose your balance, you almost needed to use your wings. Looks like you'll have to take a different approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since they are well hidden, you don't think anypony will think anything weird that you are starting to run twice as fast as usual to a nearby cliff. Bringing up some magic power, you start to launch bolts of it down to Flare and probably due to his name, he brings up fireworks of magic to counterattack. And again, name wise, it's platinum colored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He charges up more power and waits. You take the time and distract him by jumping off, which everypony got shocked from. Of course, you landed without a scratch. Using the same idea again, you take even more bolts and launch them not directly at him, but to  random area and leave them there. As another distraction, you throw one last one to him and he blocks it with a hidden shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taking the other ones you left around him, you bring it down and break that, somewhat fluxing his concentration, but ultimately, it released the blast of power. You tried to dodge it, but you got caught in its radius and was impaled into the cliff. Falling down, you try to get up, only to get slammed down by Flare, somewhat hurting your wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As a last ditch attempt to get him off your back, literally, you make a bomb of power and discharge it right there. Not even caring that your wings were damaged, you went up, going past Flare, kick him down to Equestria, and make one last line of magic, which basically destroyed the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Going down, and healing yourself, you make one last ball of magic and face him, who is now severely injured, can barely move and only has one eye open. He laughs and says, \"You were a good contestant, [your name]. I hope you make it through the semifinals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Because of your nature, you heal him as well. Not completely but enough to get him off the arena with as much as a few bruises..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The winner of this round proceeding to the semi finals is [Your name]!\" Wild cheering erupted as they all celebrated your winning. You even saw Celestia and Chrysalis, seeing how proud they were. You give a nod, signalling that you're thanking them for your prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as you get back to your station, you are congratulated by the other contestants, even those who lost. \"Nice going, [your name]!; Way to go, brother! Hope you win the next round!\" You shook their hoofs and proceeded to your room, eager to see what your next challenge was, the possible chances of Meteor Strike or Diamond Heart. Once looks very fast and agile, more than Rose Petal, the other more powerful than Platinum Flare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, something kept bugging you. That one mysterious unicorn that you passed by. He kept his hood up the entire time. Or is it she? All you saw was eyes in a dark silhouette. Something felt weird...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You weren't paying attention to the other battles, that's Twilight's concern. Her battle was a breeze though.

To consider a bunch of magic still lingers inside of you, no not that type of magic that you see that street performers do,but MAGIC. As in really powerful magic that you unintentionally received due to your... act of love(and some would say stupidity) to save Chrysalis from that blast. You have no idea what affects that will happen to the human body rather then of a recorded magical being  then it being stuck inside of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay considering magical has many properties (or could be used) for you imagine yourself as a water bottle,or a flashlight with the magic being the water,or battery in the other case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA) 1. The magic inside of you will either stay as it (or at least you think so) and you just now have magic in you,but nothing else.Basically water inside a bottle not being put to use. = No harm.No foul<br>\r\n     2. The magic inside is growing at a rate of some sort,now due to the fact that you have a human body(bottle) you expect there to be a limit of how much a body can have(water can be held inside). So in this context if you were to accumulate to much magic inside of you a being that certainly wasn't meant to hold have or use magic. = Unknown Result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB) 1. The magic inside of is acting as a battery does and is always on whether on purpose, or not.This means that you body will find some way to use the magic inside of for a purpose unknown to yourself. = Unknown Result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     2.The magic is possible to use, but for a limited time just like a battery.And if so are there any consequences? = Unknown Result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this is where magic from a blast from Your Auntie Celestia is without a doubt one of the most powerful things you have seen.Would you be able to create blast from your hands, or some other way around since you have no horn exactly?Also would you really picture yourself doing Your Aunt Celestia's job of RAISING THE SUN?How would that even work? How would everyone react?Is it possible that the magic inside of you had done something else has been done inside of you, or will do something change outside about you to suit hosting it? = All Unknown Results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo many questions no answers in sight...

She took me in and coronated me as an alicorn princess. Sure she may have doted on me, but it was because she loved me. Celestia cared for the both of us, and to just yell that she wasn't your real aunt... you might as well have spit in her face!\" Feeling that she's said enough, Cadance turns around and walks away, but then she stops and starts talking again, without even bothering to look at you. \"I thought you really had matured since you were little, [your name], but it's obvious you still have a lot of growing up to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the angered princess walks out of your sight, leaving you to reflect on what she said to you. Maybe you should just swallow your pride and apologize to Celestia. Then again, she still totally humiliated you, and part of you still thinks that your anger was justified. What do you do.</span></div></div>",

Maybe'?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'I don't know', as in I am not certain as to whether or not she likes you, and 'maybe' as in there is a possibility that she may return your feelings,\" Celestia says with a smart-ass tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. I get it,\" you grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should spend some quality time with Twilight while you're here, and then you'll probably find out if she likes you back,\" she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually not a bad idea,\" you say, and you bolt out of the bedroom to go find your lavender coated friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have said goodbye,\" Celestia says with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk down the halls of the castle, you begin to reminisce about your history with Twilight. You remember when you first met her in kindergarten in Canterlot. Your parents were already well acquainted with hers, so you visited each other often. When you had to move to Baltimare for middle school, you two kept in constant contact, and by the time you moved in with Twilight when you started high school, you noticed how much she grew since elementary. Even in the (almost) three years you've lived with her, she's... developed quite nicely. When you first moved in, you were both fourteen going on fifteen, and Twilight's body was rather underdeveloped, but now you're both seventeen going on eighteen, and her body finally realized that it was becoming that of a mare. Her breasts had grown a little, but the area that had the most growth was her hips. By the time Twilight became a princess, her hips became the kind you'd want to die for... twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could never figure out why the other guys at school weren't attracted to Twilight's looks. She had that whole \"sexy librarian\" vibe about her. They were probably turned off by her smarts, or maybe they were busy lusting after mares with more conventional beauty like Rarity. Oh well, it's not like you should complain. The less competition, the better, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally run into Twilight after a long period of reminiscing. \"Oh, hi, [your name],\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Twilight,\" you say. \"Where are the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they went out into the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you go with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going with the other princesses and Chrysalis to the city as well to go clothes shopping,\" Twilight explains. \"I know it's not you thing, but would you like to come with us? We could use a male opinion on the clothes we try on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can go...\" you say, wanting to go with Twilight despite the fact that you despise clothes shopping. Soon, you find yourself with Twilight, the other princesses, and Chrysalis on the way to one of Canterlot's finest clothing shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where should we start?\" Celestia asks the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry about it,\" says Chrysalis. We have all afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words \"all afternoon\" hit you hard as you realize exactly what you signed up for. \"It's gonna be a long day,\" you mutter to yourself. You pretty much tune out the mares as they decide which part of the store to start with, so when Twilight grabs you by the arm and drags you along to the decided location, you have no idea of where you're headed. You get your answer when you see that the section you arrived in is...</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, you hear Chrysalis dying of laughter, failing to keep herself together. \"This is priceless!\" she struggles to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bra is fine, Auntie,\" you say, turning your face from her and blushing. Celestia chuckles and stands up. \"Thanks for the opinion,\" she says as she turns around and brushes your face with her tail before walking back into her changing room. Once the door closes, you get up and make it a break for it, but when you reach the doorway that led out of the changing area, you feel a tingle in your neck that makes you fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh! What the hell!\" you say. The five mares burst out in laughter, and you lie there like an idiot. \"Good one, Cadance!\" says Celestia. \"Casting a shock collar spell was a nice call!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Celestia,\" the pink princess says. \"Shining Armor taught it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll teach you to try and run,\" your aunt says in a mock scolding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitches,\" you say under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Itches</u>,\" you say. \"My neck itches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it does,\" Luna giggles. \"So who's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go,\" Chrysalis says as you take a seat on the bench again.

Just tell me how I look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-beautiful...\" you say. \"You look absolutely beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis compliment make Twilight visibly blush, and it stuns her for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't as funny as I thought it'd be,\" says Chrysalis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this isn't fun anymore,\" Celestia whines. Twilight pouts at this and decides to spice things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how does this lingerie make my hips look?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fuck! Not the hips!\"</i> you think. <i>\"She had to ask me about her hips.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting...\" she says, turning around and subtly shaking her flank back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look stunning,\" you say against your will. \"Your hips are definitely your sexiest feature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the other mares erupt with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now it's funny again!\" Cadance says in between fits of giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concur!\" says Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight turns to face you again and leans into your face, staring right at you with those big purple eyes of hers, and you can smell her minty fresh breath. \"So, you've said twice already that you're attracted to a certain mare,\" she says. \"Would you mind telling me who she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I would mind,\" you say. Technically, you did answer her question and you were telling the truth. You did mind Twilight that you liked her. You didn't want to tell her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should rephrase that,\" she says as she sits on your lap. \"Tell me who this mare is,\" she almost demands.

No!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it were anyone else, I'd be concerned, but since I know and trust Twilight, I have no problem with you two experimenting sexually with each other,\" Celestia says. \"I've always wondered what a romantic relationship between you and Twilight would be like, and now that she's an alicorn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia begins to chuckle somewhat suspiciously. \"What are you thinking, Celeste?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, sweetheart,\" she says. \"You should go and see your... roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiiiight...\" you say, unconvinced as you leave Celestia's booth to go see Twilight. <i>\"What did she mean by 'now that she's an alicorn'?\"</i> you think. <i>\"I'll have to remind myself to ask Luna about it since Celestia's obviously not gonna tell me anything.\"</i> You make your way to Twilight, who was sitting in a booth by herself. She must have been waiting for you. \"Hey, Twi,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somepony's excited,\" you chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't I be? I get to share a beach house with you at a seaside resort, and I'll get to wear my special lingerie for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were worried about not being able to be sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I took your advice and found a book on how to be sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was just being... never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later, you all reach the resort and settle into your respective houses.

Then again, \"force\" may not be the right word to use, since you welcomed the kiss with open arms; you're just surprised that Twilight made the first move so suddenly. She's being pretty bold for her first kiss, too. Must be those alicorn instincts kicking in. You feel her tongue poke at your lips ash though they were asking to come in, a request that you were more than happy to grant.

You didn't need to open your eyes to know that they were there.  You try to pull away, but Twilight holds you in place, anticipating you wanting to back out. She then breaks the kiss and whispers huskily into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't. If they want a show, we'll give them a show.\" The manner in which she said those words surprised you, scared you, and admittedly, they turned you on. Twilight seductively grins at you and practically smashes her lips against yours, holding you tightly and wrapping her wings around you. Everypony's jaws drop, and Celestia picks Spike up, covering his eyes. Once the vicious make-out session ends, Twilight removes her lips from yours, an action followed by a smacking sound, leaving a trail of saliva. The alicorn then take her arm and pulls you towards her, turning to the spectating ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, ladies!\" she yells. \"This boy's mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance leans towards Chrysalis and whispers in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't have any of your alcohol did she?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not as far as I know,\" the queen answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Twilight walk over to the tent, Twilight with a smug grin on her face, and you a little dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony couldn't believe what they just saw, but they decided to keep quiet about it for the sake of the event.

Easy!\" says Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Luna says, fully understanding the game now. \"I think I get the gist of this game.

Plus, it was much more popular back then.\" Chrysalis chuckles in both agreement and reminiscence of all the ponies she's been with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026 can I go next?\" asks Fluttershy, which surprised everypony.

Luna stays behind, along with you and Twilight, lifts her sister up with the help of her magic, and sighs in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tia,\" she says to herself. \"You never know when to quit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she gonna be okay, Lulu?\" you ask. \"I mean, she has to raise the sun in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she'll be fine by then, [your name],\" she says \"This isn't the first time this has happened. Besides, even if she isn't well by sunrise time, I can take care of it for her. Like I said, this has happened before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really should be more careful,\" Twilight says. \"What if we were at an important social gathering like the Grand Galloping Gala? She could've made a laughingstock of herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry about it,\" Luna assures. \"Tia may go overboard sometimes, but she always knows time and place. See you two in the morning.\" The younger royal sibling then carries her elder sister on the way to their beach house, and you and Twilight make your way to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we learned a lot about Princess Celestia tonight, didn't we?\" says Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you agree. \"It makes me wonder if she was fit to raise me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like Luna said, she knows time and place. Besides, she must be somewhat fit to raise you. I mean, she managed to bring you out of your depression when your parents passed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right... Man, I hate it when you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm rarely ever wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's those rare moments that I live for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young alicorn giggles. \"I would too, if I were you,\" she says, then you both notice that you've reached your beach house already. \"Well, we're home,\" she says. \"Which means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know...\" you say absentmindedly. You open the door and the two of you walk in, shutting the door behind you. You make your way towards the bed, then you turn around, look Twilight in the eye and say \"Are you sure you want to go through with this tonight? I can wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't,\" she asserts. \"I've been waiting for this moment for years. It's the perfect time: we have our own room, I have the perfect ensemble for you, and I'm not in the middle of my breeding cycle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How often are those cycles now that you're an alicorn?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once every three months instead of once a mon- Wait, don't change the subject!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry...\" you say waving your hands defensively. \"I'm just worried, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my job,\" Twilight says with a huff. \"I'm just fine, [your name], trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. \"I guess we can't have a relationship without trust,\" you say. \"Go ahead and change. I'll be right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, sweetheart,\" she says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that in front of Celestia,\" you playfully warn her. \"She won't appreciate you using her pat name for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop. It was all I could think of at the time,\" Twilight says before turning on her hooves and walking towards her closet and taking out her \"outfit,\" if you could call it that. She then makes her way to the bathroom, playfully swishing her hips at you, making you smile like an idiot. You then lay on the bed, looking up at the ceiling and reminiscing about your relationship with Twilight for the umpteenth time in the last couple of days. You've known her for as long as you can remember, and over the years, you've both grown from friends, to best friends, to pseudo-siblings, and if all goes well tonight, to lovers. Seventeen years seems like such a short time when you look back on it. You're train of thought is interrupted by the sound of a door creaking open and a beautiful, almost angelic voice reaching your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting,\" says Twilight as she stands in the doorway, seductively leaning on the door frame and lazily swishing her tail back and forth. You see that she's dressed in the lingerie outfit that she bought from the store the other day, but you feel like you're seeing it for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't waiting for that long,\" you say. \"Besides, you're worth waiting for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight giggles at your comment, but it wasn't her usual giggle. This one was much more alluring. It amazes you how Twilight can go from an awkward bookworm to an irresistible seductress. That book on how to be sexy must be working wonders for her. The alicorn continues to saunter over to you until she finally meets you, then she uses a finger to gently push you on your back.With another sultry giggle, she straddles you and looks down at your face, savoring the look of surprise on your face. Who could blame you? You never expected that Twilight had this side to her. Looking up at her as she straddles you makes you shiver a little, but it's a good kind of shiver. Twilight smirks at you, and leans down on you so that her lips can meet yours in a passionate kiss. While you'd like to see what this new Twilight can do, you don't want to be completely submissive. Maybe her full potential will come out if you make her work for control?</span></div></div>",

Now that she didn't have to worry about anypony hearing her, she no longer had to hold back; she was free to moan as loud as she damn well pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, [your name]!\" she moaned as you gently bit her neck. You can't help but smile at how easy this is turning out to be. You raise your head and your upper body so that you can get a good look at the mare beneath you. Her eyes are half lidded, her mouth is hanging open, and her breaths are erratic. You then look lower on the alicorn's body towards her lower half, and see that there's a wet spot on her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's excited now, huh?\" you taunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up and take them off,\" she says with a hint of aggression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, milady,\" you say with mock reverence. You hook your thumbs on either side of the undergarment and pull it down, being careful not to mess up Twilight's stockings along the way. After getting a good look at her nether regions, you realize how much she wants this. Best not to keep her waiting, right? Twilight uses her magic to remove your trunks, while you unhook her bra and toss it aside. You pause again to take in the princess's beauty, and to ask her a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to keep going from here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely,\" she says. \"And don't worry about the pain. I can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head as you position yourself outside Twilight's entrance, then slowly penetrate it, chasing moans from her. Said moans turned into yelps of pain once you reached her barrier, but she looks up at you with a look of reassurance on her face, which is enough to convince you to keep going. Once the wall is completely torn off, she yells in pain and wraps her arms around you, pulling you close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Twi,\" you say soothingly, caressing her face. \"I'm right here.\" The alicorn takes comfort in your words and smiles warmly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she says. \"Keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obey the princess's request and continue thrusting into her, her pain quickly being replaced by sheer amounts of pleasure. \"Oh, goodness!\" she groans. \"Don't stop, whatever you do, don't stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a small grin.Like you had any intention of stopping. Unfortunately, Twilight catches this grin and cracks one herself, grabbing you and flipping you on your back, putting her on top. \"I'm not letting you win this little game, honey!\" she says in a challenging manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a game now?\" you ask as the mare continues to ride you. \"Well, I'm fine with this position, anyway, 'cause it lets me do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab Twilight's torso, and pull yourself up to her chest, latching your mouth onto one of her breasts, taking her completely by surprise and pushing her closer to the edge of the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, [your name]!\" she moans. \"I'm close! I'm so close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come up with the perfect idea to give Twilight the nudge she needs. You move your hands down to either side of her flank, grasping each of her cutie marks roughly and increasing your speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sweet Celestia, yes!\" she yells \"I'm gonna... I'm gonna... AAGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's walls begin to clench in response to the intense orgasm she's experiencing, causing you to release as well. As you both bask in the afterglow of your passionate act, Twilight slips off of you and rests beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel the same way,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you two do now?</span></div></div>",

You get up and look around to see that you weren't in your beach house anymore, but rather the library back in Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" you say to yourself. \"Why am I back home?\" After taking a good look around, you see that you're in Twilight's room, only it's decorated differently. There's some of your stuff in here, too, as if you and Twilight are sharing this room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch at the sound of a tired groan coming from right next to you, and you turn to see that Twilight was still asleep next to you. Wherever you are, she somehow came here with you. Maybe she'll know what to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight? Twi, wake up,\" you say, nudging her gently. She gives an annoyed groan before turning to face you, but when she opens your eyes, she screams in shock, and so do you. This wasn't the Twilight you knew. She was much older, not that the years have been treating her badly. In fact, she's aged like fine wine, but seeing her as an older mare still shocked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you screaming?\" she asks loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you look so much older!\" you answer at the same volume. \"Why are you screaming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because YOU look so much older!\" she answers back. \"You have a beard and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" you say as you feel your face. Sure enough, you had a beard, just like Twilight said. \"Well, if we're so much older, why do our voices sound like they normally do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Twilight said. \"I'm just as confused as you right now... Wait a second, when did I put on clothes? And when did you put on clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is totally confusing,\" you say as you get out of the bed. You look around the room for a while, until a framed picture on Twilight's dresser catches your attention. You look closer at it, and your eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight! Get over here!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, [your name]?\" she asks as she walks over to you, but then she gasps in surprise. The photo in question was of you and Twilight at a wedding, <b>your</b> wedding. You were wearing a stylish white tux, while Twilight was in the most beautiful wedding gown. \"We're married!?\" she says in surprise. Judging from how you both look in the photo, you both assume that you must have gotten married right after high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must be dreaming,\" you say, more to yourself than to Twilight. \"Our dreams must be linked somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. It's a dream, so we're bound to wake up eventually, so we'll just have to ride it out. Besides, I always wondered what it would be like to be married to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn blushes a deep crimson, but the tender moment is interrupted by a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

The light is so intensely bright that it knocks the both of you out for a moment, only for you to wake up in the same bed you fell asleep in, with the same clothes you had on. Scratch that, you both weren't even wearing clothes when you fell asleep, aside from the stockings on Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was bizarre...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding,\" she says. \"Just a curious question, though, did my hips look as good in our as they do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was way out of left field,\" you say, \"but for the sake of honesty, I wasn't really paying attention, so I wouldn't know. I wouldn't worry about it, though. I'm sure you'll look just as attractive in twenty years as you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww! You're so sweet,\" Twilight says. \"Well, we should get cleaned up. Princess Celestia is taking us to the boardwalk amusement park today, and going there smelling like sex and natural body odor wouldn't be a good idea. However...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind, can we shower together? I mean, to save time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, you just want to be naked with me in a shower. While I would like that, knowing how your hormones have been lately, we might end up wasting time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Twilight says dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what,\" you say. \"The first shower we take when we get back to Ponyville will be with each other, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna hold you to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, after everypony has breakfast, you all walk to the boardwalk, where there were tons of rides and other attractions to keep you occupied. Before you and Twilight can walk off, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, everypony!\" Celestia says. \"Before we go our separate ways, I think it'd be best to go in groups of three, since there are twelve of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Three?\"</i> Twilight thinks. <i>\"Ugh! I was hoping for it to be just [your name] and me. I was going to go on the ferris wheel with him and get stuck on the top, or some other romantic thing that happens at an amusement park.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were thinking similar thoughts as your marefriend, everypony already broke off into their groups, and you didn't notice after the fact. After realizing that you missed the opportunity to pick your partner, you both look at the groups that have been established. The first group was Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie, the second group was Celestia, Luna, and Cadance, the third group was Rarity, Fluttershy, and Spike, which left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrysalis, I guess you'll be with [your name] and Twilight,\" Celestia says. \"Make sure they don't run off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, Tia,\" she says with a grin. \"I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect. Not only were you and Twilight forced to have a third wheel, that third wheel just had to be Chrysalis of all ponies. Even so, you'll just have to make the best of it. As the three of you break off on your own, as do the other groups, Chrysalis says something that shocks both you and Twilight.</span></div></div>",

She obviously knows what you two did last night, and now she's holding it over your heads. You're pretty much putty in her hands at this point. If either of you step out of line, she'll rat you out to Princess Celestia, and who knows how she'll react to that? She might give you an hour long lecture about how you're both underage and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you two like to accompany me on a ride?\" the queen asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure,\" you and Twilight say instantly in almost monotone voices. Neither of you want to give the changeling any reason to snitch to Celestia, but there's one problem: Twilight is deathly afraid of roller coasters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I want to go on\u2026 that one,\" Chrysalis says, pointing out the biggest, fastest roller coaster in the entire park. Twilight seemed to shrink in fear a little bit, and the name of the ride didn't do much to ease her apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Bowel Buster?\" She says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not scared, are you?\" Chrysalis asks her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little\u2026\" the young princess admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on,\" she says. \"I'm sure [your name] will let you hold his hand. Keep in mind, if you two don't do this, I might tell Celestia about last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no problem with going on the ride, but Twilight obviously does. You decide to try and make her feel a little more at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem, Chrysalis,\" you say. \"It's just a ride. You'll have to do better than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight feels as though she can sense your confidence, and having that feeling makes her confident, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we'll go on the ride with you,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, good,\" the queen smirks. \"This little game wouldn't be any fun if you two caved in so early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both give her death glares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks. \"I may not be pure evil anymore, but that doesn't make me a goody two-horseshoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't mind games like this part of Discord's schtick?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everypony has a mischievous side to them, [your name]?\" the changeling replies. \"I figured you'd know that, what with Celestia being your guardian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. She has a point. \"Let's just get on the ride,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was hoping that the line would be long so that there would be a long wait, which there was, but she momentarily forgot about her status as a princess and everypony moved out of the way for her. You can hear her curse under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, Twilight, there are perks to being royalty,\" Chrysalis says as the three of you walk to the front of the line, where the roller coaster was waiting for you. The queen opts to sit in the front car. At first, Twilight objects, but you tell her that riding in the front car actually is a smoother ride that riding in the back car. Whether or not that's true, you don't know, but it calmed the princess down, which is all that matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Chrysalis was joking, but if it makes you feel any better,\" you say to her as you all get strapped in, \"you can hold my hand.\" The response you get is the princess's hand delicately gripping yours. The ride operator pulls the lever and lets the coaster go. Unlike most roller coasters, which go up a large hill, then make a steep fall, this one made a steep fall right off the bat, sending the three of you rushing down at an incredibly high speed. It's at this point where Twilight's grip on your hand increases one hundredfold. Thankfully the rush of the ride was enough to distract you from the pain in your hand. To you, the downwards dip wasn't even the worst part. The track swerved left and right often, which led to sharp turns that pushed the three of you back and forth. Since you were sitting in the middle, whenever you made a turn, you'd always have either Twilight or Chrysalis leaning on you. You couldn't help but notice the queen smirking at you whenever you were on each other's sides. Finally, the ride comes to a stop, and Twilight finally let's go of your hand. It's only then when you feel the pain in that hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool,\" you say, trying not to make a big deal out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to the photo booth to see our picture,\" Chrysalis says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you do that,\" you say. \"I'll tend to Twilight.\" With your attention shifted to the princess, and with the queen out of earshot, you take the chance to tell Twilight something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twi, I think we should just tell Celestia about what we did,\" you say. \"We shouldn't give Chrysalis the satisfaction of holding this over our heads, and I don't want to see you suffer anymore. I could tell how scared you were on that ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Twilight say?</span></div></div>",

Celestia doesn't speak a word as she leads the way to one of the park office buildings. She asks politely to borrow a private room and they almost throw the key at her. Once inside, the princess directs you two to sit on a couch across from her. Still showing no emotion, she commands you to tell her everything. After about an hour, you do.

Aunt Celeste normally gushed over your like a school filly, but now that you thought of it, she was just a really affectionate relative.

There was really no reason for you two to be worried at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless of course you thought our relationship was something more than that,\u201d Celestia continued. \u201cIn which case I may have to forbid you from ever again reading any of Fluttershy\u2019s erotica.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!

Fluttershy was into some pretty saucy stuff, despite her shy demeanor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Celestia continued. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of getting in the way of destiny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou see, [your name],\u201d Celestia continued. \u201cI was bereaved when I had to banish my sister a thousand years ago. It devastated me to do such a thing, and the hurt only grew worse as time went on. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. So, I left my royal duties in the hands of my most loyal advisors and set off on a spiritual quest. I won\u2019t bore you with the details of the cliffs I had to climb, the riddles I had to solve, or the dragons I had to fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound boring at all,\u201d you offer, only for Twilight to give you a shove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I eventually came upon an isolated temple in the mountains to the east. The monks listened to my burden and offered their wisdom.\u201d Celestia paused a moment to take a sip of tea, from a glass you were certain wasn\u2019t there a second ago. \u201cThey told me that everything has a destiny. They called it the Will of the Universe,\u201d she said reverently. \u201cBut whatever name you call it, we are all bound by it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelestia,\u201d Twilight interrupted hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019ve read every book there is on ancient pony theology, and I\u2019ve never seen anything on this \u2018Will of the Universe\u2019 thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled gently. \u201cThat\u2019s because the monks I spoke to were dragons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragons!?\u201d You and Twilight blurt out at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Dragons are a race as old as the world itself. They have meditated on the great questions of life since before recorded memory. And in their wisdom, they found the Will of the Universe. Oh dear,\u201d Celestia groaned. \u201cI can never remember the exact words. They did it so much better. Oh well.\u201d The princess sighed. \u201cThey said that one of the most obvious examples of destiny is the pony cutie mark. A cutie mark does more than show a pony\u2019s special talent. It is a part of who we are and helps us understand our place in the world. In this way, they said, ponies are actually privileged over other races because we carry our mark of destiny out in the open for all to see, especially ourselves. We can only achieve happiness by embracing who we really are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this helped you come to terms with what happened to Luna?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt did,\u201d Celestia nodded solemnly. \u201cThey helped me understand that while I hold a portion of responsibility for failing to properly address her concerns, but it was Luna who strayed away from her destined path, leading to her fall into rage and sorrow and eventually becoming Nightmare Moon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what does that have to do with us?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver since formal relations were opened between Equestria and Earth, both worlds have benefitted tremendously. The fact that the average life expectancies for both people has gone up by over two decades is testament to that. Human ingenuity for pony magic has been a most profitable trade for everypony. All seemed quite well until I met your parents, [your name].\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d You ask. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo put it simply,\u201d Celestia explained. \u201cI got a feeling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA feeling?\u201d Twilight repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct. You see, the monks taught me to listen to the Will of the Universe, to feel for its message. When I met you parents, I had this overwhelming feeling that the two of them would make a cute couple. I\u2019m certain you\u2019re tired of hearing the story of how I helped set them up by now. Anyway, I didn\u2019t get any more feelings after that, at least not related to them, but I decided to follow up on it. Your parents and I became close over the years and I can\u2019t tell you how excited I was when you were born, [your name]. When I held you for the first time, I remember thinking that if the only thing that came from that feeling was this precious bundle in my arms, it would have all been worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan in annoyance while Twilight cooed in girlish delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when your parents died,\u201d Celestia continued. \u201cI got another feeling that the best place for you to stay would be in Ponyville. And I think we all see what that has resulted in,\u201d she indicated you and your marefriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t really make sense,\u201d Twilight strained to understand. \u201cWhat exactly do all these feelings mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe feelings are messages from the Will of the Universe. I never know the destination, but they do provide the direction of the journey. You must understand that the monks taught me this lesson a thousand years ago. I have had many feelings sense. One of the more recent was that a blank flank unicorn filly who had managed to hatch and grow a dragon would make a welcome addition to my academy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight\u2019s eyes widened in awe. \u201cSo, the reason you took me in as your prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was because of these feelings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Celestia shook her head. \u201cThe feeling was only that you should attend my academy. It was your studious nature and natural talent which allowed you to rise above your peers and become my prot\u00e9g\u00e9. You did that, Twilight. The feelings merely offered the suggestion that you be allowed to try. And now look at you,\u201d Celestia indicated Twilight\u2019s wings. \u201cWould you have had it any other way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight craned her neck to look at her wings, then smiled when her eyes met yours. Finally she returned to face Celestia. \u201cNot at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that is the Will of the Universe. It is a guide for us to become what we are meant to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what does that have to do with us?\u201d You ask insistently.</span></div></div>",

While she did offer for you to sleep with her in her room, she only did so to make you feel welcome. She was expecting you to choose Celestia in a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-Very well,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then.\" says Celestia. \"I know you all haven't packed since this was a surprise, but I've made arrangements to accommodate all of you with everything you'll need.

It took a while to get there and it was a very awkward moment. The two of you just walked the whole way not saying a word. You knew that Luna had a bit of a had tome talking with others, but this is ridiculous. Then again, you're going to be sharing a room with her, so maybe she's a little nervous. This is a side of the princess that you've never seen before. You remember that one time she came to Ponyville on Nightmare Night. You were rather intimidated by her, even though she meant no harm, now the situation seems to be reversed. Could Luna have a shy side to her? Nah, that can't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you eventually reach Luna's bedroom. The alicorn uses her magic to open the doors. Inside you see a large bed with sheets that matched Luna's coat and had her cutie mark sewn into the covers and pillowcases. To the left of the bed, you see her armoir, to the right of the bed is an empty space. You assume that Celestia might take advantage of that to put your clothes there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Luna says, gesturing to a door on the far left. \"I have my own personal bathroom over there, and if you need anything just... let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" you say. The awkwardness of the situation is just unbearable. Fortunately, you're saved by your phone ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, [your name],\" says the pony on the other line. You recognize the voice as Twilight's. \"The girls, Spike, and I are going out for lunch. You coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll be right there,\" you say. You turn your attention to Luna. \"I gotta go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she says. \"Have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having lunch with your friends, you walk around the city for several hours, then return to the castle where Celestia was hosting a big dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While it is a shame that Shining Armor can't be here due to having some business in the Crystal Empire to take care of,\" she says, \"we should still have as much fun as we can, so eat to your heart's content, everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone proceeds to do just that. Soon, Luna arrives, apologizing for being late. She locks eyes with you for a second, then she quickly looks away. You don't mind it, assiming that it's just one of her mannerisms.

Luna,\" you say. \"You're still undressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess's eyes widen in sheer embarrassment, and she immediately releases you. Her face turns a deep shade of red, embarrassed at the fact that her brief joy caused her to momentarily forget that she wasn't clothed. \"S-sorry about that...\" she says. \"I should get dressed.\" Luna goes over to an armoir, takes out a pale blue nightgown, and puts it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up out of the chair you were sitting in and let out a yawn. \"I think I should get to bed,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna yawns as well. \"I'm feeling rather tired myself,\" she says. \"Perhaps we should... 'turn in,' as they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle, and you both get into Luna's bed. \"Good night,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night,\" she says back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drift into slumber, Luna does something that wakes you right back up.</span></div></div>",

You become absorbed by your work, eyes darting between the sky and the paper; the pencil scratching rapidly as details become whole parts of a greater image. So consumed were you that you failed to notice the guest to your creative flair. And it is only when you are finished that she speaks. \"That's lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice is subdued and your head whips around to see Luna in a dark nightgown standing behind you. She had been looking over your shoulder at your picture while you put the finishing touches on it.  \"You think so?\" you ask her, holding the picture up to better light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she answers with a smile and a nod. \"So few artists are moved to capture the night anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the night,\" you admit, setting the sketch pad down on a nearby table and standing. \"The star patterns. The quiet air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiles at your words and embraces you, trapping your lips in a deep kiss. You return the kiss with an internal smile, wrapping your arms around Luna and holding her close. Neither of you needed words at that moment.

You ready?\" calls Twilight from downstairs. \"We have to meet everypony soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I guess I'm ready...\" you say, unsure of what you're meeting the others for. As you head out your room, you pass by your mirror and notice something that makes you do a double take. If you're not mistaken, you're wearing your costume from your first Nightmare Night in Ponyville, which was almost three years ago. You then take a second to admire how good your samurai costume looks on you, and then you head downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna love the Nightmare Night festival,\" says Twilight.\"It's one of Ponyville's most fun celebrations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then remember the significance of this night. This was the night Princess Luna came to Ponyville to try and make some friends. You and Twilight were the only ones that weren't afraid of her: Twilight because she knew Luna, and you because, well, the only thing that scares you is seeing Celestia angry. You saw that happen once and it scared the shit out of you, but that's a story for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I must be dreaming,\"</i> you think to yourself. <i>\"Nothing left to do but ride it out.\"</i> All of a sudden without any explanation, you find yourself at the statue of Nightmare Moon, with Twilight at your side. The last several minutes must have been skipped. Then again, time doesn't make sense in dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Luna?\" Twilight calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight Sparkle?\" she answers, coming out from the shadows. \"Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is [your name],\" she says. \"He's a good friend of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is ours,\" she says. You then remember how Luna hadn't gotten used to speaking normally yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I'll leave you two alone,\" says Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" you ask. You didn't remember being left alone with Luna. This dream is getting weirder by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised that we're alone?\" she asks. You then turn to look at Luna in surprise. \"This night is really special to me, [your name]. This was the night we first met. When I returned to Canterlot after the Nightmare Night festival, I asked my sister about you. When she told me that she was your guardian, I was rather... intimidated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought that she would be really protective of you, like she was with me when we were younger, so I wouldn't get a chance to tell you how I feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Celestia trusts you around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna chuckles. \"That's a relief,\" she says. \"So, I decided to go into your subconscious and cause you to dream about the night we met, only I changed it so we can spend it together, the way I always wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do?\" you ask.</span></div></div>",

Spending a whole night alone with her, even if it was in a dream, sounded like a marvelous thing. \"That sounds great, Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiles brightly and you take note of her dress. She wore a midnight black dress that was different from the more ornate one she had actually worn on the night. This dress is very form fitting and shows off all of her curves and a large amount of cleavage. She giggles slightly when she catches you staring. \"I thought the other dress was too...formal,\" she says. \"This one is just for you. Let's go somewhere else. This statue is...not the best for a private moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns and starts walking and you can not help but take note of how the dress clings to her backside. You stop staring and catch up to her as you head for the river away from the main part of Ponyville where the festival is. \"So,\" you start, \"why this dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Luna says, blushing a bit, \"you have already done a full-body portrait of me fully in the nude. So, I suppose I don't feel uncomfortable wearing revealing evening dresses around you, [your name].\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" you ask, trying not to blush<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least in private like this,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night is grand. A cloudless sky lets the moon and starts shine bright over the heads of celebrating ponies. You and Luna make it to the riverside, the stars reflected on the calm surface of the water.

However, your focus quickly shifts from her smile to her eyes, because they look different than normal. They were the same cyan color, but here pupils are slitted like a cat's. They look very familiar, but you can't put your finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" says Luna. \"Did I wake you?\" You notice that her voice has a ore sultry tone, one that's very different from her normal speaking voice, and it makes you a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're shivering, my dear. Is something the matter?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... um...\" you struggle to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess giggles. \"You must be nervous,\" she says. \"There's no need for that, darling. Why don't you let me calm you dow-AGH!\" All of a sudden, Luna's eyes shut tight, and she puts a hand on her forehead. She continues to grunt in pain for a few seconds before removing her hand from her head and opening her eyes, which have returned to their normal appearance. Luna then looks at you and realizes how close she is to you, a blush quickly appearing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- how did I get so close to you?\" she asks, backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you were just having a dream and you subconsciously got closer to me,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well... I'm sorry about that. Goodnight,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drift into slumber, you find yourself standing in a white void, as if you were literally standing in the middle of nowhere. \"I must be dreaming,\" you say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely,\" says a familiar, sultry voice. You turn around in surprise and see a dark blue mist coming into view.

You see her cat-like eyes and instantly recognize them; they were the eyes that Luna had not moments ago. You turn around and bolt, knowing that Nightmare Moon was bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, don't run!\" she calls out. The fact that she said those words was enough to make you stop running and turn to face her. \"Why shouldn't I?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me when I say that I mean no harm, [your name].\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" you ask. \"And how do you still even exist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark mare sighs. \"When I was destroyed by the Elements of Harmony, a small fragment of my being remained within the recesses of Luna's mind,\" she explained. \"That fragment wasn't strong enough to take hold of Luna's mind, but it was strong enough to keep me alive. Since then, I remained in Luna's mind, and because of that, I share her memories, including the night she met you on her first Nightmare Night in Ponyville, hence why I know your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I simply want to talk to you,\" she says. \"More specifically, I want to confess something. I don't know if you know this, and I don't know if it's my place to say this, but... Luna has an... attraction to you. I believe they call that a 'crush' these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen in surprise. You had no idea that Luna felt this way about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only do I have access to Luna's memories, but also to her fantasies,\" says Nightmare Moon. \"After browsing through some of them, I saw why she was so fond of you, and I developed feelings for you as well. What you saw in Luna earlier was me trying to take hold of her for a moment so that I could tell you how I felt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you had no right to do that,\" said another voice.

Come with me!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were very confused. On one hand, you could see that Luna only wanted your safety and you knew what Nightmare Moon had done in the past. On the other hand, Nightmare Moon sounded as sincere as someone (pony) can be. And you had no doubt that those tears were real. She must have been awfully lonely, being that, along with Luna, she spent 1000 years sealed in the moon. Not only that, she had her body destroyed and she had it worse than Luna herself. Also, you couldn't quite tell what it was, but you thought that you were beginning to have a crush on Nightmare Moon. You then had an idea.

You had the chance of making friends with Twilight and her gang. And me, of course. Nightmare Moon, didn't had that opportunity. She was alone for far more time than you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"She brought it upon herself! Also, how do we know that she won't try to control me again and repeat what she did in the past?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I thought of that already.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"You did?\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes.

A kiss that you found yourself returning.

So far, Nightmare has been much more passionate when it cane to expressing her feelings for you, while Luna was more conservative and shy with her feelings. That shyness, however, made her that much cuter. You still wish she was more expressive with you, though. Aside from that drawing you did of her, she hasn't really done anything intimate with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get to Luna's room, you look at the time and see that it's five in the evening. Evening... That means that it's officially Luna's turn to spend time with you.

After that, she crawls over you, and lowers her face to yours. \"I want to show you that I can be just as passionate as Nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna leans in closer, and her lips softly touch yours while she wraps her arms around you. Her lips feel incredibly, yet almost unnaturally, soft. Her kiss was tentative and cautious, yet forceful and passionate. Neither of you wanted to let go, but you both needed air, so Luna reluctantly removes her lips from yours. \"How was that?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at a loss for words,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna blushes at your compliment and quickly reverts to her shy persona. \"Well, we should go see Celestia about separating Nightmare Moon from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" you say.</span></div></div>",

Most likely, given the time, she was in her study taking care of some kingdom's matters. Sure, the kingdom's matters are important, but so is the business you, Luna and Nightmare had to discuss with her. After all, Celestia didn't even knew that Nightmare Moon had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"So, I'm business, am I?\"</span></b>, said Nightmare in your mind in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Oh, come on, Nightmare.

Can we come in?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, the answer came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Ask again in a pretty way!

And it wasn't only your aunt's laughter. That mean that she wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><span class=\"cnavy\">*Pffff!!! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!

And what would that be?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon then walked until she was face to face with Celestia and, to everyone's surprise, including you, she bowed to Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Celestia, I humbly ask for your forgiveness. And I ask you that you separate my body from Luna's.\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Celestia, no!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"She's most likely lying!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"She's not.\"</span>, you said, defending her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"(name)! Why do you defend her?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Because I have been spending time with both, Luna and Nightmare Moon.

She also agreed that, until she proves to you that she deserves you trust, she would have most of her magic sealed.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"What?! But, why would she do that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Because, when I watched Luna's memories, I saw the her first Nightmare Night since we were banished, were she met (name).

Then, having most of my magic sealed, or even all of it, then it would be worth it.\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words made you blush, but it also made you very happy to hear that she would give up on her magic just to be close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"I see. Still, what did you mean when you said \"Luna's thoughts about (name)\"?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"I meant that she too has a crush on (name).\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Ah.

I can see that the love you have for (name) is pure and true. So, not only will I separate you and Luna. You'll also, be allowed to have all of your magic.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon was as happy as she could be! And so was Luna. As soon as Celestia said those words, once again, she surprised everyone with her actions. Nightmare run up to her and gave her a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Thank you!

I wouldn't want to force myself on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide not to remind her of the fact that Luna still likes you, too, and that you can't decide who you want to be with more.

You wake up with a loud yawn and you stretch your arms as much as you can to get all the kinks out of your body. As you rub the sleep out of your eyes, you feel the bed shuffle a bit. You take your hands out of your eyes to see what's going on, but at that moment, you feel a pair of lips softly pressing against your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Luna,\" you say with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess removes her lips from your cheek and smiles. \"Good morning to you too, beloved,\" she says lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle again. \"That's the same pet name that Moon has for me. I guess you two really are two parts of the same pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moon?\" Luna said, a little confused. \"Is that what you're addressing her by, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Nightmare Moon is kind of a mouthful, and I don't think it'd be nice to call her Nightmare, since she's anything but, so I decided on Moon,\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it makes sense when you put it that way\u2026\" the princess says. \"Regardless, I've been looking forward to today. Nightmare Moon and I will finally be two separate bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be almost as excited as she is,\" you say, getting out of the bed and stretching again. \"I didn't think you'd like the idea of Moon being her own pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I not like having complete and total control over my body?\" the princess asked rhetorically. \"I'd rather be separated from her than have her randomly taking control of my mind. Besides, I can't help but feel happy for her. She seems to have really changed for the better, and having her own body will help her realize her potential as a genuinely good pony. I suppose you could say that I'm beginning to grow fond of her. I'm beginning to see her less as a darker side of me, and more like a more like a\u2026 less reserved side of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a very mature way to look at it,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna laughs and throws a pillow at you, which hits you in the chest \"Don't you talk to me about being mature!\" she jokes. \"Do not forget that I am more than many times your age!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be, but you've spent a good chunk of your years sealed in the moon,\" you retort, \"and you still act like a foal from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you must be what they call a 'smartass' these days,\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" you answer. \"Anyway, we should get to Celestia's study. We wouldn't want to keep her waiting.\" you say. \"Do you think we should change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" the princess answers. \"Let's get the separation done first, then we can get ready for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you and Luna leave the bedchambers with you wearing your pajamas and Luna wearing her nightgown. It takes about five minutes to walk to Celestia's study, thanks to the castle's great size. A price to pay for luxury, you suppose. When you finally reach the study, you knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she doesn't ask me to use that cutesy voice again,\" you say under your breath, but loud enough for Luna to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" Celestia calls from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Luna walk in to see the princess of the sun reading what appears to be a romance novel. She then looks up and sees the two of you, and when she does, she quickly tosses the book aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw that,\" you say. \"What were you reading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing for boys your age,\" she says, turning her head away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrow suspiciously, then you hear Luna's voice in your head. <i>\"Tia has an interest in erotic fiction novels,\"</i> she explains. <i>\"She has a hidden collection of them in her room.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah,\"</i> you think.<i> \"Oddly, that doesn't surprise me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna clears her throat and says to her sister \"We're ready for the separation spell, sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" says the elder princess. \"Come to the center of the room, Luna.\" The sisters meet each other at said point of the room, and Celestia looks into Luna's eyes. \"Now, I've read the spell's instructions, and it said that you and Nightmare Moon will feel a little weak for a few hours because of the separation, so try not to do anything too strenuous, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nods her head and closes her eyes, instructing her sister to do the same. She then begins to chant an incantation that was in a language unfamiliar to you. An aura begins to emanate from her horn, but instead of the usual gold color, it was pure white. Suddenly, a pillar of light falls on Luna, and all you can see is her silhouette. The younger princess's shadowed figure begins to rise up from the ground, then a huge bump forms on her back. You begin to see a horn sprouting from the bump, followed by a head, then arms, then a torso with wings, followed by two slender legs. It looked as though a second pony was growing out of Luna's back! Soon, you see two separate ponies in the pillar of light, and they float back down to the ground before the light disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there was Luna and Nightmare Moon in two separate bodies. The two counterparts looked at each other in awe, Nightmare Moon being more surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it\u2026\" she says softly, then she shouts. \"I HAVE MY OWN BODY!!!\" She then approaches Celestia and wraps her in a tight hug. \"Oh, thank you, Celestia! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very welcome, Nightmare Moon,\" she replies. \"Now, we should all get downstairs for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four of you walk to the dining hall, Nightmare Moon wraps her arm around yours and holds you lovingly. While it made the royal sisters uncomfortable, each for their own reasons, they decide to just let it go. You finally reach the dining hall, where everypony was already sitting. Needless to day, they were surprised to see Luna and Nightmare Moon in the same room. The breakfast was pretty silent, unil somepony decides to make conversation. Who was the brave soul?</span></div></div>",

Either, physically or emotionally. And I know that he treasures all of you more than anything else. If I did something bad to you or to someone else, I would be hurting him by betraying him and the trust he placed on me. And, like I said, hurting my beloved is the last thing I would want to do!

Despite the fact that she said she hasn't drawn in a long time, that didn't seem to be a big deal, since the drawing was so beautiful. It was a picture of the cosmos, with various stars and planets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you say. \"That's so amazing...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Luna says with a blush. \"I've always been interested in astronomy and the like. I consider it to be a hobby of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" you say. \"I think it's really cool that you're into this. Besides Twilight I don't know many ladies that are interested in the sciences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess blushes at the fact that you referred to her as a lady. \"Well, the castle has an observatory,\" she says. \"If you ever want to go, I'll be happy to take you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, anytime you want,\" you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about now?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now?\" you say, surprised. \"I don't know... everypony's sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that if we remain quiet, we won't wake anypony,\" Luna says. \"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then remember that Celestia asked you to help Luna open up, and she's starting to do that right now. If you deny her request, it'll set you back. \"Sure,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" the princess says with an uncharacteristically enthusiastic attitude. The two of you set out, still in your sleepwear, to get to the castle observatory. \"So,\" she whispers. \"Why did you decide to share a room with me instead of Celestia? I know you didn't choose Cadance for the obvious reason, but why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you whisper back. \"Even though Celestia and I are close, she still tends to tease me and push my buttons, and if I roomed with her, I'd give her ample opportunity to go all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" whispers Luna. \"I can identify with your reasoning. When we were fillies, Tia used to always tease me. I knew it was just her way of showing affection, but she can become quite bothersome. Now that I'm thinking about it, she always used to, how you say, 'hog the sheets' when we used to share a room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here you are wondering why I chose to share a room with you instead,\" you say with a quiet chuckle.\"I'm actually glad I made that choice, otherwise I never would have known that you had this mischievous side to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mischievous? Me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sneaking off to the observatory while everypony's asleep. Sounds mischievous to me,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you finally make your way to the observatory, and Luna shows you a chart of the stars that she made herself. She then shows you the telescope and lets you look through it. \"Wow,\" you say. \"Now I know why you love the stars so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am the one that puts them up in the sky,\" says Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them?\" you ask, \"I thought you just took care of the moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, everything about the night is under my command,\" she says. \"You're one of the first to really appreciate it the way you do,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, isn't this cute?\" says somepony at the entrance to the observatory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

Even Chrysalis was treated like a welcome guest. You remember the first time you met Fancy Pants. It was the night of Twilight\u2019s birthday party. While her party was in the castle ballroom, Fancy Pants was having one of his own in the garden. When Rarity introduced you and the others to him, he said that you were all \u201ccharmingly rustic.\u201d If the word \u201ccharmingly\u201d wasn\u2019t in there, you would have mistaken that for an insult.

Look, I just want you to calm down and stop--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, (your name). I will not! I'm sorry I'm yelling like this, but you will never understand the pain I'm in right now!\" Now that you're near the dresser, she sees the pictures of her and Shining Armor. Without aiming at you, she pushes everything off with just one swing of her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were nearly on the verge of tears. She never scared you like this and you were really hoping she wasn't gonna start now. Once a self portrait was down of Shining Armor, she stepped on it, hard. She didn't even care that some pieces pierced through her heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is only a fraction of the pain I will deliver to that cheating prick,\" she whispers, nearly sounding evil, like Chrysalis when she transformed back to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her arm before she walks out the door with a tear already escapeing your eye. \"Cadance, please... stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance struggles on your grip and soon yanks it out with her other. Somehow, you grab her other and try to restrain her from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Your name), let go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless you calm down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Cadance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the both of you struggling for the dominant hand, literally and figuratively, something had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that would be..?</span></div></div>",

You stand there for a second, stunned that Cadance would hit you like that, let alone at all. You then feel the side of your face where the back of Cadance's hand struck you, then wince at the pain that it causes. The princess looks at you with a face of anger at first, but when she sees the bruise that she left on your face, she is instantly filled with regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did the impact hurt you physically, but the fact that Cadance, your old babysitter, was the one that hit you hurt you emotionally, as well. You walk to the bathroom so you can check on your wound and get away from Cadance. The princess tries to put her hand on your shoulder, but you push it away and continue towards the bathroom, shutting the door and locking it once you're inside. You look at your reflection in the mirror and see the bruise on your face. It isn't too big, but it is a little noticeable. After a failed attempt to open the door, Cadance knocks and tries to get you to listen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name], please let me in!\" she pleads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!

I was just mad, and I wasn't thinking, but I'd never hurt you intentionally. Please let me in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance still doesn't receive a response from you. Realizing that there was no chance of you talking to her again, she leaves you alone. Meanwhile, in the bathroom, you consider skipping dinner tonight. You don't feel like talking to anypony, and somepony's bound to want to talk to you about something. You don't want to sleep with Cadance tonight, either, after what just happened. The bathtub is big enough to sleep in. Maybe you'll sleep in there, or maybe it's not too late to room with Celestia instead? You sit in the bathroom either crying or sulking for hours, then you hear the bell calling everypony to dinner. Despite your earlier plan, you decide to go to dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring dinner, neither you nor Cadance say a word. At first you're relieved that nopony's noticed your bruise, but then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, [your name],\" gasps Rarity. \"What happened to your face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony looks at you and sees the bruise on your face, and Cadance freezes in her chair. In her mind, she thinks that you're going to rat her out, but for some reason, you decide not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was lying down on my back while texting and I dropped my phone on my face,\" you lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you expected, you get a couple of chuckles from Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, you head to the balcony to get some air, when somepony approaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

I just want you to know that I'm sorry for doing that to you... I just hope you'll accept it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a teardrop fall and land on the floor.

I mean, after all of what they went through. The wedding, my attempt to crash the wedding and take over Canterlot, they getting married and King Sombra's attempt to take over the Crystal Empire.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were seeing it but you couldn't believe it!

Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance looks you in the eye, which catches you off guard a little. \"Because you helped me when I needed you the most,\" she says \"Even when I put you in the hospital, you didn't even tell anypony that it was me.

She's also one beautiful mare, both inside and outside. And she's also always been there for me too. There'll be no coming back after this but. I couldn't care less. I have no doubts about my feelings anymore.*</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance stood there, patiently waiting for your answer and, after what seemed like two hours of thinking, which were actually less that 15 minutes, you rose your head and looked straight in Cadance's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Have you decided, (your name)?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"And what is your answer?\"</span>, she asked with fear, excitement and expectation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering with words, you grabbed her left hand, put your right arm around her waist and pulled her into a tight hug. You then lifted her face up with the middle finger of your left hand and kissed her with all the passion you could muster. Cadence then begun to cry, feeling immense joy in the fact that you loved her too, and gladly returned the kiss. Withing seconds, you were making up, your tongues wrestling each other in loving embrace. Neither of you wanted this to end, but you needed to breath. So, reluctantly, you both broke the kiss and looked at each other's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Does that answer your question, honey?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Oh, your name! I'm so happy!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"And I'm happy because your happy.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both then heard a voice that, while it made Cadence jump, it only slightly surprised you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Awww! What a lovely sight!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"C-Chrysalis?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"That's my name. Don't waste it.\"</span>, she said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"How long were you here? And how much did you heard?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"I heard it all. Remember that my room is besides yours, Cadance. I hard some of it from my bedroom, then I decided to get a better place in order to hear better and what a surprise I found.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"P-please, don't-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Cadence, it's okay. She's on our side.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Eh? What do you mean?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, while I was on the way to pick you up to our \"date\", I met with Chrysalis and she had her suspicions. So I told her the truth.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"You told her?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Don't worry Cadence. I understand your worry. But rest assured. For I decided that if I could help you in any way I could, then I would do it. I gave my word to (your name). And I intend to keep it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Chrysalis...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence then let go of you, run up to Chrysalis and hugged her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Thank you, Chrysalis. You don't know how much it means.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"No problem. Also, I think that your name has a couple of things to say to you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Eh? What is it, beloved?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile blushing, because of what Cadence called you, you shot a glare at Chrysalis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Don't look at me like that. The sooner she knows the better.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"*sigh* Fine. I know who was the mare that Shining Armor cheated you with.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"But, he said it was-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I know. But he was lying. I knew the voice I heard and, after giving it some thought, I remembered who the voice belonged too.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"And that someone is?\"</span>, asked Cadence impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"It's Fleur de Lis's.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Hmm. I see. Somehow, I'm not surprised.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said it with such a calm voice that it actually scared you and Chrysalis a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"And what was the second thing, darling?\"</span> she said with her normal tone, which relieved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, I know you won't like this but, I think we should tell everything to Auntie Celeste, Twilight and the others.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"What?! Why?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Because they can help you and because if we don't, how can there be trust between all of us it we keep secrets?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Well, your right about that... All right, tomorrow we'll tell them, during breakfast.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Speaking of breakfast, we should go to bed and rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"She's right.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Well then, see you tomorrow, happy couple.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Chrysalis!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"*chuckle* Save it for later Chrysalis. We're not officially a couple. Not yet.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Alright. Good morning to you, <i>love doves</i>.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Good morning, Chrysalis.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Sweet dreams.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Chrysalis went to her bedroom to sleep and you two did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Good night, my love.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Good night, beloved.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you fell asleep in each other's embrace.</span></div></div>",

You looked to see that Cadence was still asleep, snuggling and hugging you as close to her as she could. You tried to caress her beautiful face without trying to wake her up, but failed. Because at the mere touch of your skin against hers, she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Hmm, good morning, my beloved.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Good morning, hun.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Cadence's turn to blush. Sure, last night you called her \"honey\", but \"hun\" is a more intimate way to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Did you slept well?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"How could I not sleep well when I have my most precious one besides me?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just looked at her, smiling. You both then leaned in for each other and kissed. It didn't stayed that way for long tough. Because Cadence tried to turn it into a making out session. However, you parted the kiss, which made her look at you with sad and disappointed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"What's wrong? You didn't minded it last night.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"As much as I enjoy your kisses, Cadence, my love, we have to get ready for breakfast and you need to get ready for telling the others about our current situation.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"M-maybe we should tell them later-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"No, Cadence. The more time you take to tell them, the more difficult it will be when you do so and the more hurt their feelings will be.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"I know. All right, I'll tell them.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used your right hand to raise her head until your eyes made contact with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Hey. Don't worry. I'm going to be there, with you. Ok?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then kissed her again, to give her courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Ok. Thank you, (your name).\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"You're welcome, Cadence.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, someone knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock, knock, knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Who is it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">It's me. Are you ready for breakfast? Or... Are you going to sped the day on the bed having some \"fun\"?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Chrysalis!!!\"</span>, now both of you were blushing fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Oh, relax. I'm just joking. But seriously, get ready already and let's go.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Okay, okay. Just give us a few minutes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then both changed into usual clothing and opened the door to go to breakfast. Chrysalis was there, waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"You didn't had to wait for us, you know?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Yeah. I know. But I wanted to say this, Cadence. You count with both, (your name)'s and my support, alright?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Thank you, Chrysalis. My friend.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen of the Changelings smiled. Happy that Cadence was finally accepting her as a friend.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------<br>\r\n(<span class=\"cindigo\">Celestia</span>, <span class=\"cviolet\">Twilight</span>, <span class=\"cteal\">Rainbow Dash</span>, <span class=\"corange\">Applejack</span>, <span class=\"cpink\">Pinkie Pie</span>, <span class=\"cgrape\">Rarity</span>, <span class=\"cyellow\">Fluttershy</span>, <span class=\"cnavy\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened and you went in. Needless to say that the sight of you, Cadence and Chrysalis entering together surprised everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Good morning, my dear nephews. Good morning, Chrysalis.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Auntie, you both said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Good morning, Celestia.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you all said your good mornings, you sat besides Celestia and Cadence took a seat right besides you, which everypony, except Chrysalis, of course, found odd. After everyone had eaten, you, Cadence and Chrysalis looked at each other and nodded slightly. The time had come. Cadence then grabbed your hand and begun to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Um, excuse me everyone but, could I have your attention? I have to say something.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Of course, Cadence. We're all ears.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Thank you, Twilight. Well, as you know, the first day we all gathered here, (your name) and me roomed together.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Well, after showing everything to (name), I decided to call Shining Armor, just to check up on how things were at the Crystal Empire. But, when the phone call was answered...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"What happened, princess?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence looked at you and you nodded, having understood that she couldn't go on. So, you continued for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"A <i>female</i> voice answered the phone.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"What? A female, voice?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes. Then Cadence asked who was talking and the voice started breaking. Cadence then continued the phone call on the bathroom, tough, being in the bedroom, I could hear everything. Shining Armor answered and his voice trembled when he found out it was Cadence. She asked why a mare had answered his private phone and he said it was his personal assistant, Sally. But, with his voice the way it was, he couldn't fool anyone. And then Cadence found out that...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Wait... D-don't tell me that...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes, Twilight. she found out that Shining Armor was cheating on her.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone (except Chrysalis): *GASP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"I-I can't believe it!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"That little...!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"How dare him do that to her?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others just nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"There's more. The female voice, when I heard it, it sounded familiar and, after thinking for a while, I remembered to who it belonged.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"And who was that mare?\"</span>, asked Celestia in a tone that it was so dark that it scared everypony. Yet, you continued all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Fleur de Lis.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"No surprise there.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"It seems the rumors are true, after all.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Um, Chrysalis, I know you probably don't care about this but-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Why am I not showing any reaction? Is that your question?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Y-yes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Because I already knew.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Eh?! How so?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, on the day Cadence and I went to the dinner, when I was on my way to pick Cadence up, I bumped into Chrysalis.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"And I already had my suspicions so, I took the chance to confront (name) about it. He then told what had happened.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"She then offered both, to me and Cadence her support and promised that she would do anything she could to help us.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo need to say that the actions of the Changeling Queen surprised everyone. Cadence then looked at you and Chrysalis and nodded, signaling that she was ready to continue. And so she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Also, last night, I woke up to some noise ans I found (name) on the balcony. He was about to call Shining Armor to arrange a meeting between them so he could confront him. He told of of how he felt about what he had done. But, rather than being mad of how HIS actions hurt him, he was mad at how those actions had hurt me and how they would hurt you, Twilight. He IS your brother, after all.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Then, I... I...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"You what, Cadance?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"I... Confessed to (you name).\"</span>, she said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone: \"Eh?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Yes. I know it sound absurd but, I always had a crush on him. I kept quiet about it because of my marriage but, now that this happened, I fully realized my feelings for him. And so, I asked him if he loved me too. He then...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"He then? Wait... You didn't did \"IT\", did you?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"No! No! <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Not yet anyway</font>.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both blushed when she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Then what did he did?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"He grabbed my waist with his right left arm and grabbed my right hand with his own. He then pulled me close to him until our bodies touched each other. He lifted my head up until our eyes made contact and he kissed me passionately.\"</span>, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"But it didn't remained that way. After I kissed her, Cadence turned the kiss into a making out session. I didn't complain, of course.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Rather than that, you returned my french kiss with equal passion.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else, including Chrysalis, for she hadn't seen the entire thing, was wordless, trying to register and process everything that you had told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes, I did. And I have to say. Your grip was quite strong. For a petite princess, you have the strength of a damn stallion.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat elicited chuckles form everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, what are you going to do about the Crystal Empire?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Once I graduate from High School, I'll marry Cadence and the I will rule the empire with her as my beloved queen.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Oh, darling, don't say it that way!\"</span>, she said blushing and looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Why not? It's the truth.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both then leaned in and kissed each other. You didn't cared that everyone was there. You loved each other and that was enough. Everyone just smiled at the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I really hate to interrupt such a lovely sight but... What are we going to do now?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"We have to find a way to get Shining here so that Cadence can divorce him.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Sounds good.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Now that everything is sorted out, let's go and prepare for today's activities.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone: \"Okay!\"</span></span></div></div>",

Heck, even Luna, who was usually reserved and quiet, was having a blast. Rainbow was playing, admittedly harmless, pranks, Rarity was trying to find the perfect spot for inspiration to make new clothing, Applejack was trying to convince Fluttershy to go on a motorboat ride, Celestia, Luna, Twilight, Spike and Pinkie were playing in the water and you, Cadence and Chrysalis were laying next to each other in the sand, sunbathing. Still, even tough you were all having fun, Chrysalis and you couldn't help but notice that Cadence seemed a little dawn. You didn't wanted to see her like that so, after looking at Chrysalis and nodding to each other, you decided to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Cadence?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. Whatever she was thinking about, she was doing so deeply. This time, you tried shaking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Hey, Cadence? Hun?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Uh? What? What is it, beloved?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I'm the one who asks that. You seem a little worried.

It's nothing.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two could easily tell she was lying just so that you could enjoy the day. But you weren't about to let it go. So, using your left hand, you grabbed her chin, turned her face and looked her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Please, Cadence. Don't lie to us. We know there's something worrying you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"And we want to help.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"(your name)... Chrysalis...

Then they all sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"I'm also afraid that <i>HE</i> will try to do something to sabotage our relationship, (your name)! But, the thing that I'm most afraid of, is that, like him, you somehow will go away and leave me. I can't bear to think that, because of me being an Alicorn and you a human, someday death will do us apart!!!\"</span>, she said, crying a lot and hugging her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all hated to see her like that. And, right now, you hated Shining Armor more than anything or anyone, with that bitch Fleur de Lis being second. The thing you wanted the most right now was to beat the living pony hell out of him. His betrayal left Cadence in a worse state than you had thought. Everypony was heartbroken from seeing Cadence, above any pony, in this state. Especially, Celestia and Luna being her aunts, Twilight, since Cadence was her foal sitter when she was a filly and you, being her somewhat of a boyfriend and she also being your former foal sitter. You grabbed both of her shoulders, pulled her close to you and hugged her as tightly as you could without hurting her and looked at her with sad, pleading and compassionate eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Cadence. Please, stop crying. You don't need to worry about anything.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"But-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut her placing a finger on her soft lips. You then pulled leaned in and kissed her like never before. Even tough everypony was there, you didn't cared. Cadence needed you. So you french kissed her with all the passion and love you had for her. After a couple of minutes you broke the kiss, the two of you blushing deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Tell me, Cadence, my love. Did that felt like a dream?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"(name)..</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Also, you don't to worry about HIM. None of us will let him do anything to you or to our relationship. Am I right, everypony?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Yes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Of course!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Y'a can bet on that!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"If he tries something we'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\">\"Yeah! We gotta stick together!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony else just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Guys...But still...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou once again silenced her with a finger on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Cadence, trust me. I'll never leave you. I'm positive that we all can find a spell or something that will let us stay together, without fearing death. Right, auntie Celeste? Auntie Luna?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lowered their heads, crossed their arms and thought for a bit. When they opened their eyes again, they both looked at each other, confirming that they were thinking the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Yes. Of course.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"We think that we might have the solution for that.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Really?!\"</span>, said Cadence, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Yes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, what is that solution?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"We'll tell you later, once we get back to Canterlot. For now, let us enjoy the rest of this day, alright?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Yes. Thank you, aunties.\"</span>, you both said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"You're welcome, our beloveds nephew and nice.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, everypony went back to their activities. You and Chrysalis just stood there, sunbathing and providing company for the princess of love. Eventually, you all packed your stuff and went back to the Canterlot castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, reader, what is that solution that the Royal sisters were talking about?</span></div></div>",

Why should I keep my vows when he threw them away who-knows-how long ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may, to drag [your name] into this is a selfish move on your part,\" the taller princess retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confuses you. First, Celestia was mad at you, and now she's talking like you're a victim. Maybe hearing about Shining Armor's affair, changed her mind about your role in all this. Then again, that's the least of your problems right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not drag him into this!\" Cadance says defensively. \"He offered to help me get over the depression I was feeling, and I took it.

I love him, Celestia, and I'm not gonna let you come in between us, not without a fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she says those last few words, the flame-like aura around Cadance's body dramatically increases in intensity, her intention to protect you being painfully clear.

I really need to hear this.\" How can she be intrigued? She's gonna lose a sister(-in-law).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Two days ago, after agreeing to bunk with Cadance, she tried calling him but someone else answered. I only heard bits of the conversation, since Cadance was very loud.

Anyway, no one caught on since she somehow repressed her feelings. But since I was there, I told her I'd help her in that time of need. I couldn't sleep that night, because I was so worried and I happened to bump into her on the balcony. Cadance was going through so many questions just for them to be answered all in one by saying she did nothing wrong. Hug and comment later, she brings up the fact of whoever is my fillyfriend, she's very lucky. Needless to say, I accidentally told her I didn't even have my first kiss yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... then what about that kiss from the mare over at Pinkie Pie's last party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that really counts.\" She shrugs in agreement. \"She offered to be my first kiss and... I agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw was agape. \"So you <b>still</b> had that crush on her from years ago!\" Twilight says in an accusatory tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, remembering that one accidental giveaway. \"Anyway, we went to a hilarious movie after that, meeting up with Celestia as well. I told Cadance she could have that day as her own since she needed help. After stupidly suggesting a restaurant to eat in and realizing that that's the site for the proposal, we went to get ice cream instead, knowing that it's her favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bring ice cream up, please.\" Oh yeah.You remembered that there was an ice cream eating competition at that party and even with magic, Pinkie is still the undefeated champion. It's Pinkie Pie, okay? No one can explain Pinkie Pie, but she's a ton of fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She licked my nose, getting some off after I finished mine. Another romantic kiss after that and I'm suddenly interrogated by Celestia, who used a hallucination spell and a transforming one. Where did she even learn that anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can thank Chrysalis for that.\" Go figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While we were getting such a harsh scolding, Cadance stood up and even readied herself to fight to be with me. I was shocked as well until Celestia stood down. So she came with a plan for a divorce and we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't necessary to say that Twilight was in complete shock for all this, but mostly because you actually kissed Cadance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her emotional response to all that was...</span></div></div>",

I really appreciate this, especially for being the one that Cadance wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a slight smile. \"Don't worry, man. I'll look out for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles and puts on his helmet. \"Well, I'd better go; I still am the Captain of the Royal Guard, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were slightly shocked. \"You'd think with all that went in just these past three days, you would've been revoked of that position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean. But I am very thankful that Celestia is a reasonable princess. I guess I'll see you around; Cadance doesn't want to see me around you.\" You guess a restraining order was put into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya, Shining Armor. Hint of advice: stay away from Twilight as best as you can. I don't think she'll be as forgiving as anypony else is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see him walk off into his position. Now that everything is resolved, you walk back to the throne room to see Cadance being so very elated right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, (your name)!\" She runs towards and hugs you tighter than what she ever did before. Again, for a princess, she has the strength of a damn stallion! \"Finally, we can be together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally we can--\" you try to say, but Cadance just kisses you right there. Now you have no guilt in doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww! They look so cute together!\" you hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that?\"</span></div></div>",

With Pinkie Pie's help, you make the throne room into a personified disco hall. Rarity insisted that you would dress as a disco king, since your dancing is very professional, but everyone went against it, especially Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meanwhile to where everyone is dancing, you walk out to the balcony, somewhat glad to get away from the loud music. When you're happy, you like to be alone every now and then and tend to enjoy a nice view. Apparently, the silence is short lived since Cadance comes out with you a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's sneaking up on you, about to attempt to scare you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, Cadance,\" you say, without turning back. \"I figured that out years ago already and you still don't drop the act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles at your remark. \"It seems that it's way past you now. What are you doing out here when everyone else is inside, (your name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still don't know me from these few years ago. I like to be outside of the group, simmer down a bit and just be grateful for everything I have in my life, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Cadance said, now leaning on your side. \"I used to be that way as well. Now I have a really good reason to be doing so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I.\" You share a hug with your fillyfriend, her tighter than yours. Where does she get this damn strength!? \"I love you, Cadance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, too, (your name).\" With the moon being out, thanks to a request to Luna, you both passionately kiss to savor this romantic moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, all the other ponies have taken advantage of this and started taking pictures with their phones. You didn't see the flashes, neither did Cadance; basically, it was all too quiet. You separate and get back inside and for some reason, a slow song is playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab Cadance's hand and kiss it, saying afterward, \"May I have this dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, such a gentleman,\" she teases, \"but okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou danced for at least ten minutes before everyone gave in that night.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is an alternate telling of my original MLP interactive, High School Adventures. It's an idea that's bee floating in my head for awhile now, and I've decided to take a chance with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are the main character, and your backstory is identical to the one you had in the original story. You're a human living in a world where humans and ponies coexist with one another. You're seventeen years old and your parents sent you to Ponyville to spend your high school years, so you've been living there for almost three years now. Celestia watches over you, as a favor to your parents, who she is very close friends with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main difference between this interactive and the original one (if you haven't already guessed it) is that instead of your love interest being one of the Mane 6, you will have the option to choose between the Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, and Princess Cadance (with the addition of Queen Chrysalis, as per suggestion by a friend of mine).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story will begin in the summertime, with you and your friends receiving and invitation from the princesses to stay at Canterlot Castle for three weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's a quick summary of your relationships with the princesses and the Mane 6:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's start with the Mane 6, Twilight is your closest friend out of the bunch, having known her since she lived in Canterlot, you live with her in Ponyville. You have a sort-of frenemy relationship with Rainbow Dash. While she is your friend, you two can get at odds with each other often. Pinkie Pie... well, she's friends with everyone, and she seems nice, just a little strange. Rarity is your second best friend since you both have artistic tastes. Applejack serves a big sister role to you, and you find Fluttershy's shyness to be rather cute. On to the Princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia is like a second mother to you. She insists on you calling her \"Auntie Celeste,\" but you refrain from calling her that in front of others. You and Luna don't talk much, but she seems nice. Cadance used to foalsit you and Twilight, so you've known her longer than the other princesses. You even had a crush on her when you were little, but you've long since gotten over that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Chrysalis, all you know is that she tried to sabotage Cadance's wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same rules that applied to the original story apply here as well. (Except rule 2, since I doubt it'll be needed for this version), so have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>NEW RULE!</b></u> (Added 10/13/13): PLEASE have good spelling and grammar in your additions. Any chapters submitted after the date this rule has been added will be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginal story here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1894017-MLP-FiM---High-School-Adventures\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1894017-MLP-FiM---High-School-Adven...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: After some consideration, I've decided to add Twilight as an option now that she's a princess. She will, however, remain a regular unicorn in the original interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT 3/29/13: After less than two months, this interactive has already reached 100 chapters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT 6/21/13: Changed the name of the story to Royalty Edition since not all of the love interests are princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT 6/29/13: Broke 200 chapters today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT 10/10/13: Broke 300 chapters last night!</td>",
