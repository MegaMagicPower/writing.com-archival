Despite the quiet nature of the local area, her Wilkos had been absolutely swamped with customers. She found herself running to and fro, assisting customers and moving all sorts heavy merchandise. They were tasks fit more for the lower staff, certainly, but a few call ins meant they were more short-handed than usual. For seven hours she dealt with the situation masterfully and only one hour was left when her life was changed forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened during her meeting with Liz, the evening supervisor. The two had met up to go over the day's sales and other important information. Liz was stationed at the manager's desktop, clicking through projections, graphs and other meaningless bits of data. Elizabeth stood a few feet to her right, her eyes and attention locked onto something far more juvenile: Liz's massive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it was a bit sad, but Elizabeth couldn't help but stare at those monster mammeries every time her coworker entered the room. They were as large as basketballs and seemed to bounce with each step, no matter how slow or quick she moved. Elizabeth had overheard countless conversations between coworkers in the breakroom and even occasionally customers at how godly the woman's bust really was. Even her conservative, buttoned-up blouse failed to stem the comments<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during this moment that Elizabeth felt her body jolt with an unnatural energy as if struck by a bolt of lightning. Her knees buckled as her mind was flooded with inhuman, alien power. Her perspective of herself, the world, and the universe rapidly expanded as she gained complete control over all aspects of reality. It was scary, for a brief moment, before her renewed wisdom overtook her sense of self. She was a Goddess in every sense of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Even she was not certain of that. What she was certain of, however, was that she could do whatever thing she wanted. There were no limits, she understood, as she...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elizabeth quickly came to the conclusion that Liz need to be punished for her transgressions. Liz herself wasn't a bad person; personality-wise, she was actually fairly easy-going and friendly, aside from her occasional spunky tomboy outbursts. Therefore, it was perhaps better to say that Liz's <i>body</i> was in need of punishment. An anguish experienced by her busty coworker would have been an unfortunate consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as the body was her true target of retribution, this left Elizabeth with a few avenues for transformative revenge. The first that came to mind was to swap her attributes with one of the male employees at Wilkos. Nobody would be staring at her chest if they were too distracted by her manly physique or her facial hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second avenue of punishment that she came up with was a fairly typical weight gain. One of the most striking things about Liz's chest, aside from their purely massive size, was how large they were in comparison to the rest of her. Ignoring her breasts, Liz was otherwise an extremely twiggy woman. Any fat she did gain seemed to add directly to her burgeoning bosom. Perhaps they would have been a lot less impressive if accompanied by a jiggle gut and thunder thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final option that Elizabeth considered was something far more extreme than either of those. The first two revolved around making poor Liz's body worse than it already was. The final one was to transform her utterly into something inanimate. Remove not just the beauty of her body, but the body itself. To make her into nothing more than a simple object. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the goddess that she was, it didn't take her more than a second to actually decide on...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was decided. Elizabeth would modify Liz's body as a whole. The only question remaining, then, was what to turn the woman into? Of all the things that bothered her most about the busty girl's body, it wasn't that she made Elizabeth look flatter than a plank of wood by comparison. Nor was it that the men and even some of the women at the store seemed to constantly fawn over her outrageous figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the worst part of it was that Liz wasn't even <i>trying</i> to be sexy. Her plain, non-revealing blouse that she wore to work were proof of that. She wasn't some skank that left her top buttons undone or that paraded around the store in a low-cut, skimpy tank-top. From what Elizabeth could tell she did her best to draw attention away from her figure. Yet it never seemed to work, only amplifying how truly distinctive her chest was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, were you paying attention at all?\" Liz asked. Elizabeth suddenly snapped out of her mental funk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, I got distracted a bit,\" Elizabeth said as she felt her body swelling with anticipation. \"Say, could you stand up for a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Okay, I guess...\" Liz replied, rising from her seat. Her bust struggled against the strength of gravity as she rose, sagging and bouncing almost comically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove a sock and stick in in your mouth, please. I don't want you screaming too loudly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was naturally puzzled at her coworkers demand, but for some reason she couldn't find the will to refuse. She slipped off her sneaker and plucked her sock off her foot. Without hesistation she jammed the sweaty thing into her own mouth. It tasted and smelled awful though Liz couldn't understand why she was doing it at all. It was only once that the thing was stuffed firmly inside that she felt a ghostly, otherworldly power lift her from the ground. She dangled three feet off the ground, helpless as a rag-doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmpppppphhhhh!\" she moaned, her voice muffled nearly to silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, quiet enough to keep out attention but loud enough for me to hear you panic,\" Elizabeth said sinisterly. \" I know this must be scary for you, dear, but try to see what I'm about to do to you not as a punshiment, but as improvement. I'll turn you into something your body was made for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz let off another silenced scream as her body was hit yet again by a supernatural force. This time it propelled her backwards, slamming her into the wall behind at about thirty kilometers per hour. Despite the speed, the collision was neither loud nor particularly painful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shocking part came after as her body began to physically fuse to the wall. It started with her back and buttocks, as those two areas melted and shifted back into the pearly white plaster, disappearing without a trace. Her head, shoulders, legs, and stomach area merged next, leaving behind her massive jugs to hang disembodied on the wall. For a moment Elizabeth considered leaving them there but in the end she continued on with her plan. They too were then taken in, sucking the last traces of Liz's existence into the plaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the end of it. A few moments later, a white, plastic square formed on the spot where Liz had been absorbed. A fuzzy, imprecise pattern appeared in its interior. Over the next ten seconds it rapidly came into focus and what were once formless blobs gave way to distinctly familiar shapes. It was Liz, bent playfully over an office chair. Her blouse was undone, giving the viewer a long look down her expansive cleavage. Her hair was done up like a porn star's and her lips were pushed out in a \"screw me\" look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, this was the fruition of Elizabeth's plan. She had turned Liz into an actual pin-up girl. A pin-up poster, more precisely. An object of visual consumption. It made sense, really; everyone at Wilkos focused more on her body than her personality, so why not turn into a form that maximized her visual pleasantness? And despite the posters playful grin, Liz's mind was fully intact, taking in her new existence as a sexy poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me, Elizabeth?\" said a voice from behind. It was Rob, one of the younger employees. He was a bit of a slacker and jokester, but overall he was easy enough to work with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Rob?\" Elizabeth replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's a customer from that buisness place next door and they're complaining about something they bought last we...\" he trailed off as his gaze made contact with Liz's new form. His member swelled with blood as he ogled her exposed, sexy pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the poster, do you?\" Elizabeth asked. \"I don't know who put this up, but it looks like Liz was some kind of model when she was younger. A sexual one, it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Isn't this, like, against the rules?\" Rob asked, his eyes still fixed firmly on Liz's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically no. Company policy says that pornographic images aren't allowed in store, but there's nothing pornographic about this. It's just racy. Now then, if you excuse me, I'll go deal with the customer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth turned around, leaving Rob and the poster behind. The young man didn't react at all, simply taking in the beauty of the poster. It was like a fantasy come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, one more thing,\" Elizabeth said, just before closing the door behind her, \"Feel free to pleasure yourself to that poster, Rob. That's what it's used for, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing she saw as she shut the door was Rob unzipping his fly as he bent forward, swiping a single black sock from the floor. She didn't need her god powers to predict what was going to happen next. Though she was impressed; not even five minutes had passed before Liz's poster was already in use! Best of all, she didn't even use her powers to convince Rob to jerk it; that was all natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fun as it was, she had other things to worry about. Apparently some customer was upset, and as it turned out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Elizabeth approached Carly, who looked at elegant as ever dressed ina  black, low-cut top with <i>Beautylicious</i> emblazoned across the chest, a pair of white, boot-cut trousers and a pair of black leather stiletto pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello love, can I help you?\" Elizabeth asked in a polite tone, when she saw how much trouble one of the new girls, Jade, was having with Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Liz?\" Carly asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth maintained her smile. \"I'm afraid she's indisposed at the moment, but I think we can sort this out without her help don't you?\" she addressed Carly, while studying her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want a refund for defective goods, and this girl doesn't seem to know what she's doing.\" Carly sneered, glancing at Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry.\" Jade stuttered apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't do anything wrong poppet, you're doing fine.

It was at that moment that Elizabeth saw Rob return from upstairs. He'd obviously finished masturbating to the 'Liz' poster and was now returning to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy yourself?\" Elizabeth smirked at him as he passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, thank you.\" Rob nodded eagerly. \"Oh... and don't worry, I didn't make too much of a mess.\" he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will clean up.

After parking her car on the loading bay, she just rested her head on the steering wheel and let out a sigh. She's seen an elderly woman hit by a car that morning. And despite Liz's best efforts to stem the bleeding, she had unfortunately died. Seeing another human being expire was a life-changing event, and not in a good way. But what was now on Liz's mind is what the old woman had whispered into Liz's ear just before she died. Three strange words... <i>acquiro caelestis potestates</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing those words, Liz felt a veritable torrent of knowledge flood into her head. All the information she received were about the 'special power' that the old woman had bequethed to Liz before passing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can swap people's bodies in any way??</i> she mumbled to herself skeptically. It was difficult to believe such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at her watch, Liz realized she was a couple of minutes late for work. She grabbed her purse and slung it over her shoulder before exiting her car. She put her alarm on and then went inside Wilkos, where Elizabeth was there to greet her behind the Help Desk. \"Sorry I'm late love.\" she apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you to be late Liz.\" Elizabeth replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had a dreadful day. Saw an old woman knocked down earlier, and she died.\" Liz explained in a sorrowful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" Elizabeth gasped. \"That must have been awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just nodded. Her expression said it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want the day off I don't mind filling in for you-\" Elizabeth offered, but Liz shook her head immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, thank you. The shock will wear off.\" she said. But she kept her new powers a secret. It wasn't as though Elizabeth would believe her anyway. So after chatting with Elizabeth, Liz went upstairs and entered the tea room, where several of her other co-workers were sat drinking and chatting amongst themselves. Strangely, as she surveyed the room and the people in it, she heard a whisper in her head, a quiet, indistinct whisper...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz was thinking intently about this apparent power she had adopted. After a few minutes of staring blankly at her co-workers and specifically at the table before her, she began to laugh softly. \"I must be crazy to believe I possess such a power. It's not feasible.....well, it's just plainly impossible,\" she continued to think to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing briefly out the window of the tea room, Liz saw the bustling streets, filled with all sorts of colorful and vibrant figures, hurriedly going about their day. She saw a young, mustached businessman running to catch a cab, waving his fingers and whistling toward the driver. It turns out a blonde, 40 something, middle aged mother was also gunning for the same cab. Judging by the anxious look or her face and the numerous bags of groceries she was carrying, Liz gathered that the woman had no chance of making the cab. The woman, wearing a long brown skirt and a conservative blouse, had a large bust similar to that of Liz. Although the woman's breasts, due to her age and most notably gravity, had a slight sag to them. Her two children were there behind her, running with their mother to hopefully catch a ride home. Liz felt bad for her and absentmindedly though how easy it would be for her if she had the man's strong legs and stride. Not to mention the muscles to carry those groceries with ease. She shook her head at the though and turned away from the he view outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz....LIZ!\" yelled one of her co-workers. She turned to Elizabeth, who pointed her attention to the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, it appears break is over. Alright, everyone. Let's get to work. You know your jobs and duties for the day...\" replied Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to stand up, Liz turned to close the window because it was getting a tad cold in the room. She glanced outside once more and did somewhat of a double take. She squinted looking for the mother and her children. Where could they be? She only turned her attention away for a few short seconds. Then she saw it, mouth agape. The mother had the body of the young businessman carrying her swiftly to the cab. She had already managed to gather her children inside the cab. She set the groceries in the cab and adjusted her crotch before climbing inside. The man reached the cab just as it sped off. He was holding his briefcase and cursing and stomping his heels on the ground like a 2 year old. He grabbed his cell phone that apparently had been lodged between his breasts. Although faint, he could hear the man taking to his boss and apologizing in advance for his tardiness to his occupation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz once again turned from the window. She didn't know whether to be shocked or excited. She thought again of the man picking the cell phone out from his breasts. This sight made her burst out in laughter. \"He didn't even notice,\" she said. Limitless possibilities began to race through Liz's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz really wanted to do one more test out the window, but she really needed to be getting to work. Plus, she had a number of experiments in her co-workers that would be ripe for the picking. Either way, she knew this power would be fun as she smiled devilishly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How about we just try out a few random things, shall we?\" Liz said deviously. She smirked and was all giddy with excitement, jumping a bit in place and causing her massive bust to bounce wildly. She looked down at her chest. \"I love these things, but boy, do they get in the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to nearby family. She recognized the family as the Donahues, regulars at Wilko. The father of the family was a handyman and was browsing lumber as usual while his wife nearby was chastising her two children for 'touching' things in the store. Specifically, the father of the family was a rugged 40-year-old man with black hair, a trimmed goatee with a streak of gray, and blue eyes. He was a fairly slim man, but still very strong. His 39-year-old wife was wearing a sundress that accentuated her modest curves and large DD-cup breasts. She did her best to completely cover them up, but she still had a bit of cleavage showing. She had bleach blonde hair and green eyes. The family had a 16-year-old daughter with smallish tits, and she was wearing a denim skirt and a lime green tank top as she clicked away on her phone. She was trying to ignore the questions and habits of her younger 11-year-old brother. She had black hair and blue eyes like his father, but he wore beige khaki shorts and a TMNT shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Liz waved a good-bye to her breasts as they deflated from her chest. She felt instant back relief as she looked down her shirt. She saw two pectorals covered in black hair replacing her chest. She rubbed it with her hand. \"Ewww, I'm furry.\" She laughed. The Donahue father was now sporting Liz's large breasts, unrestrained, under his flannel t-shirt. As he leaned over to pick up a 2x4, his breasts nearly popped out the bottom of his shirt. \"Damn tits,\" he cursed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea then crossed Liz's mind. She thought this would be hilarious. First, she surveyed her employees and picked the best victims. She chose Aaron, Natalie and Josh. She swapped Aaron's penis with the mother's vagina, Natalie's and the son's chests, and Josh's penis with the daughter's vagina. The mother and daughter both spread their legs a bit further as long, flaccid penises filled their knickers. The mother's was easily more visible, Aaron's large 7-inch cock pleating her dress in front. The daughter, now sporting Josh's 6-inch cock, didn't give as much away about her new package. The only evidence Liz could make was the outline of a cock head as the girl casually poked it. She must have been texting her boyfriend for the bulge became more visible in the following second. Lastly, the son stopped running around and teasing his sister. His large breasts flailing wildly became hurtful and tiresome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was extremely satisfied with this display. Each member of the family now sported a penis and a pair of breasts. Sex was sure to be interesting between Mr. and Mrs. Donahue with large breasts smacking each other and the husband and wife taking turns taking it up the ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm finally done here family.\" Mr. Donahue said. \"Time to go bra shopping everyone!\" The family all cheered in unison. But, then they quickly remembered how constraining and painful bras were on their assets, and the family consequently groaned in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Donahue whispered in Mr. Donahue's ear. The nipples on the breasts of the husband and wife both immediately went hard, as well as their cocks. The family continued walking on as if nothing was out of the ordinary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz next swapped the torsos and voices of Shaun and Charlotte. Bitchy Charlotte now had the well-defined upper body of a middle-aged man atop her thin feminine legs. She was talking to Aaron and rolling her eyes (as usual). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I hate this place. If it weren't for you, I'd be bored out of my mind,\" she said in Shaun's deep husky voice. Both now sported male torsos and vaginas between their legs. Aaron replied, \"Yeah, tell me about it. But, Liz seems to be fair for the most part.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him perplexed. \"How can you even say that, Liz is the worst! All she does is get mad at you if you're standing around for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uhh....yeah sure.\" Aaron didn't believe Charlotte at all, but there was no use arguing with her. To be honest, though, his concerns were elsewhere as he tried to cross his legs. He had an unpleasant vaginal odor that he hadn't taken care of and was doing whatever it took to distract people from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun, on the other hand, was stacking boxes, but it was much harder with Charlotte's skinny arms. He put his hands on his hips as he let out a sigh. \"Phew, I'm getting quite a workout. He looked at his small arm and tried to flex. He was disappointed. He adjusted his balls with his feminine hand, adjusted his bra strap, and went back to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a height swap, she decided to swap the heads of the tallest man and shortest woman, Luke and Nicola, respectively. Nicola's mature head was on Luke's youthful body. She folded her manly arms as she listened to a couple of her co-workers talk about the latest episode of their favorite Netflix show. She leaned her masculine backside against the wall and kept her legs spread so that her man-meat could breathe properly. Luke was on Nicola's short body that was completely covered in her work attire. He had a healthy pair of sagging tits restrained in his satin bra. He was taking inventory of the lumber as his tight black work pants revealed that Nicola still had a nice butt after all these years. Liz was curious how reality would make it normal for a young man of Luke's age to have a mature vagina that had given birth to eight children! Time would tell for sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, she also decided to swap Steven's virgin penis with Mona's virgin vagina (probably the only two virgins in the store). Steven must have had a decent penis for a bulge appeared in Mona's work trousers. \"I wonder how her devout parents react to having a dick-girl for a daughter?\" Liz was intrigued and curious. She was sitting answering phones at the help desk. Steven was also working alongside her and his pants appeared completely devoid of any appendage in his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust for one final swap, Liz decided to involve yet another customer. This time it was an older woman, another regular in fact. This was 50-year old Mary Rosenbaum. She was shopping for her husband, who was dragging his feet behind her. Liz wanted to try something really weird. She swapped the penis of Liam with the nose of Mary. Before her eyes, Liz's jaw dropped. An uncut penis now hung over the plump lips of Mary, looking disturbing indeed. She turned to her husband and attempted to give him a kiss on the cheek. Liz screamed and quickly tried to switch things back before it got weird. Mary had her nose back on her face as Liz breathed a sigh of relief. Little did she know, her rush of emotions and loss of concentration during the swap resulted in the older couple having each other's genitals. Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it didn't work out with Liam, she decided since she didn't care about ruining him. After all, he was the laziest employee she had ever seen, and he never listened to her. She swapped his head with that of a nearby 7-year-old girl walking with her dad. She now stood only two inches shorter than her own father, as they held each other's male hands and walked out of the store. Liam, in his little purple dress, looked down at his body wondering where in the hell his name tag went. And he really needed to talk to Liz about getting a uniform that fitted his small frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was getting jealous of all these swaps. What should she do for herself? Should she give herself a penis? Should she get a younger, perkier pair of tits? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what about others? Should she swap some lower halves between men and women? Or some head swaps between the young and old? Or some facial hair swaps between bushy men and hairless women? Or...well? She put her finger to her chin and thought of the endless possibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her watch. \"OH my, I should get to work! I mean, I do have this power permanently. I'll have plenty of time to think. She grabbed her clip board and set off to observe employee progress. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Will you keep up kids?\" The Donahue mother, Sandra, sighed as she turned to stare at her daughter and son. She was completely oblivious to the changes the Wilko supervisor had just wrought on her family. Sandra reached down and adjusted her large cock, which had become snagged in her underwear, and as it settled into it's new position... it swelled further from excitement... tenting her dress. Of course she was already hard enough catching sight of her husband Alex's heavy breasts (formerly Liz's) hanging loose beneath his flannel t-shirt, the fabric chafing his nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mum, I'm booooooored!\" Thomas Donahue, 11, whined, scratching one his small boobs under his own t-shirt. As far as the family knew, the kid was definitely on the way to taking after his father in the breast department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop whining kiddo.\" Alex grunted under his breath, berating his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move it short stuff!\" Thomas' sister Chloe, 16, grinned, poking her brother in the back to keep him moving. With Josh's 6-inch penis now between her legs, Chloe continued texting dirty messages to her boyfriend sporting a full blown erection in her denim skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my boobies hurt!\" Thomas complained, glaring at his older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do mine kiddo, but we'll get these things secured before too long.\" Alex winked at his son, ruffling his hair. All Alex could think was that it was a good thing he had a strong back to support his huge breasts. He was going to take his family to buy some clothes next, but first they needed to get served, so they would be in the store for a short while longer yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had been listening to the family's chatter from nearby, smirking all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't think Liz is a bitch?\" Charlotte asked Aaron quietly as she continued effortlessly moving stock with her now muscular, hairy arms, her pectoral muscles flexing under her Wilko shirt as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess... she can be, no fucking doubt.\" Aaron grunted, showing no sign of an attitude change, despite his emasculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right she can be.\" Charlotte frowned, wiping her brow. \"She always assigns us the shittist jobs, gives others preferential treatment, I hate it!\" She grumbled in Shaun's deep manly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know.\" Aaron just agreed with Charlotte for the sake of it. He liked to complain, sure, but she took the art to a whole new level. He settled in for a long 'whining session' from his mouthy, younger co-worker as he continued to work. He began to think about getting home after work and getting his girlfriend Sue to eat him out like she always did. It felt so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz wasn't surprised by Charlotte's attitude towards her, she knew she hated her and she didn't care. If anything it had made her swapping her with Shaun that much more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam!!! Any reason you're not working again?\" Liz next walked up behind the now much shorter employee, who turned and looked up at her. Liz tried to hide her amusement seeing the slacker's head fastened to a little girl's body. But she had to admit... it suited him.  Hell he didn't do any work, so she didn't see any reason why he shouldn't be in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... no Liz, sorry I... I think I might have to pee.\" Liam said, suddenly changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smirked. \"Well, run along then, but come straight back, and no dilly dallying in the toilets.\" She told him, wagging a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam sighed, nodded and then scurried off on his 7-year old girl legs. Liz actually laughed out loud at the sight, it was hilarious. Then she put her clipboard and pen down for a moment and pulled on the top of her Wilko shirt... peering down at the fuzzy hair on her now male chest. The hair was partly grey, due to Mr Donahue's age, and Liz knew she could get herself a better male chest if she wanted, or a smaller set of boobs? The possibilities were endless and the supervisor grinned devilishly as she picked her clipboard back up again and made her way to the next aisle, where Luke was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going from one amusing sight to another, as Liz marveled at the sight of Luke's usual, handsome head affixed to Nicola's diminutive, mature body, dressed in her smaller Wilko shirt, tight black work pants, striped socks and ballet flats. \"Everything alright here Luke?\" Liz asked him, arching an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah Liz, everything's fine.\" Luke responded, not even looking at his supervisor as he tried to reach a top shelf by standing on a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Health and safety regulations Luke, no standing on boxes. Go get a ladder please.\" Liz smirked, scolding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... fine.\" Luke grumbled. \"You'd think the universe would have given me a few extra inches of height wouldn't you.\" He said, shaking his head as he jumped down from the box, his sagging tits jiggling in his bra as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not alone being short in the world, so stop the moping. Look at Kiran for heaven's sake, she's even shorter than you are.\" Liz reminded him. \"And you don't hear  her complaining all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke said nothing, and instead just went off to get a ladder, leaving Liz standing there almost in hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to move on again, after sorting Luke out and preventing a possible accident. As she emerged at the front of the shop, she saw the Donahue family just about to leave after getting served with their goods. Liz had to think fast, did she want the family walking out with two of her employees' dicks and her's and Natalie's breasts? She wasn't sure she wanted those traits leaving the premises, even though the family were regulars. As she was thinking, Steven walked past her, heading upstairs to the toilet no doubt. He would now have to pee sitting down, thanks to having Mona's vagina between his legs, not that he'd think anything was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz decided to....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked around, and saw that the only Donahue shopping for a bra was Sandra, and Chloe, who was looking at A-cup bras. Liz looked over to see  Charlotte and Aaron, who were back to their normal selves. She wanted to keep Liam small in order to punish him, but she felt like that had tormented him enough for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was glad to have her breasts returned to her from Mr. Donahue, but still felt like she wanted to try something new. She felt that Mr. Donahue had a nice enough body, but she needed to take things to the extreme. She wanted to feel what it was like to be like Mr. Donahue for a while, or actually what keeps him from being Mrs. Donahue, so she swapped his penis with her vagina. She felt his flaccid 6-inch cock sprout from in between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was more than happy with this new change, but then watched as the Chloe was being teased by Sandra for having small breasts, which were because of \"her fathers genes, not mine\" according to Sandra. Not being a fan of bullies, Liz decided to swap her chest with Chloe's budding chest, and watched from a distance as Chloe's breasts overflowed her spaghetti strap tank top, and she moved toward the larger bra area. The teasing that Liz had once overhead was now coming from Chloe, and was directed toward Sandra for now being as well-endowed. The Donahues would be back at Wilko tomorrow, as they were scheduled to take a new family portrait in the photo center around 2 p.m., so Liz would have ample opportunity to get her possessions back. </span></span></div></div>",

She had an eventful 24 hours, as she dealt with her new appendage, and the weightlessness on her chest. She no longer caught people oolging her as she walk by, but rather, caught herself starting to oogle people. She would watch both men and women, watching how they walked, and their different body parts. It made her feel as hot and bothered, and caused her new member to often get excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz checked her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1:57 p.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\" Liz thought to herself, \"They'd better show up\". She didn't want what was hers to just walk out of her life, so she needed to make sure that she kept her original parts close to her somehow. Besides, she felt a slight bit of regret for the changes that she had made. Liz had begun to set up the camera in the photo center, when she heard a few voices in a heated discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we just had pizza last night, I'm thinking of preparing a Chicken Alfredo for dinner tonight\", Liz overheard, and she looked back to see the Donahue Family walking towards her. She seen the parents, Sandra and Alex, and their children, Chloe and Thomas. They all matched in red and black long-sleeved flannels with black pants. One thing that Liz noticed that she found a bit funny was that Alex was wearing a pair of tight women's pants, similar to the pair that his wife had on.\"Ugh, Mom whenever you cook, you never cook the food properly!\" Chloe retorted to her mother. \"Young lady I said that we are having the Alfredo and that is that\" Sandra said sternly. Chloe huffed and pulled out her cell phone. The family approached the desk, and Liz greeted them with a happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there you guys! Are we all ready to take these photos?\" Liz said in her best customer service voice. \"Hi there Liz, yeah I'd say we're all about ready\" Alex said, \"We would have been there sooner but these two ladies wanted to take their time with their makeup\". \"Oh luv, it's no problem. You guys are the first family today so we have plenty of time between the appointments\" Liz said. She then led the family into the back photo area, and let them figure how they wanted to be positioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family huddled together to pose for their family portrait. Alex and Thomas both had their hair combed over, with their flannels buttons all the way up. Sandra and Chloe both had their hair curled, and makeup done for their family photos. Sandra had her ample cleavage on display, with a couple of the top buttons undone. Chloe, however, had a majority of the buttons on her shirt unbuttoned, which had her vast bosom on complete display. The remaining buttons seemed to be losing a battle to her bust, as they strained against her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we have the ladies sit down, and the boys stand behind them with their hands on the ladies shoulders?\". Sandra and Chloe sat down, and then Alex and Thomas stood up behind in position. Liz took the first photo, and couldn't help but smirk at what she was seeing. The family appeared normal, except for the pair of gravity-defying breasts that Chloe had on her chest. They dwarfed her mother's own large breasts, and seemed completely out of place on Chloe's small frame. Liz felt her crotch twitch as she watched the two curvaceous women in their seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, looking at Chloe, Liz started to feel bad. She remembered all that she had to endure when she had first developed large breasts at a young age, and thought about Chloe going through similar situations. Liz then focused on Chloe's chest, and imagined it returning back to it's original place. Slowly, The teen's chest began to deflate, and her shirt began to accommodate for the absence of breasts. Liz then felt a familiar weight return to her bosom, and looked down to see that her greatest assets had returned. </span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Donahues visited several times a week to the store, so she didn't seem the harm in leaving everyone in their current state.....for now, at least. She thought it would serve at least one of her employees right (Aaron). Let him live with a vagina for a few days and see how he likes it! She did feel slightly guilty about what she had done to Josh and Natalie, though. Her other employees could be swapped back, but not these two. \"Not much I can do now,\" she shrugged her shoulders. Josh and his wife could at least have sex (though a strap-on would likely be involved), but poor Natalie! now missing her breasts. Meaning her fiance wouldn't have any nipples to suck on the next time they were in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz decided to take her mind off of her guilty conscience by making some new swaps. \"Oh, how exciting!!\" She clapped her hands together like an excited child. Hey, she hadn't swapped herself in a while. She kinda was curious what it would be like to have a penis herself. Not to mention, she was really beginning to miss the familiar weights on her chest, despite their massive size. She looked over to well-built Shaun, now sporting Charlotte's torso atop his masculine legs. He was on his cell phone, taking a peek at a text from his wife, much to Liz's dismay. She hated when employees were on their phones at work, but she knew he was a good employee. She would let him off with a warning. \"Or.....maybe....I could take his penis. Now there's a thought! I mean, he already has a pair of breasts to match.\" Liz wanted a penis around the same age as her husband's. So, she focused on Shaun and quickly made the swap. She saw the bulge in his pants wither up as he rubbed his legs together slightly. Liz looked down at her trousers and saw a penis head taking shape and elongating down her right pant leg. She stared at it and almost drooled. Touching it, she shivered at its sensitivity. Rubbing it, her eyes closed from the pleasure. She shook her head and composed herself quickly. Before continuing with other swaps, she took a brief look down her, well, briefs. She saw a nice, average-sized, middle-aged penis in her pants with a rather large pair of balls. It was very similar in size and shape to her husband's, which made her happy....for some reason. Liz didn't like a penis that was 'too big'. She thought this size was 'perfect'. She adjusted it into comfortable position before walking. \"Alright, now time for a new pair of tits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking out some cosmetics and hair-styling products were two familiar faces. \"Zoe and Carly! Wonderful to see you girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Liz!\" They said in unison,\"How goes Wilkos?\" asked Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The usual....trying to keep some of my lazy employees in line. But, I have to say its been a very wonderful day today, particularly for me.\" Liz giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" said Carly who glancing from her back to the product she was holding in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say I feel like a brand new woman today!\" She giggled again, the two girls not understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Liz, are you pregnant?\" Zoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's smiled turned into a frown. \"No,\" she said bluntly, \"I just feel....refreshed today. That's the best way I can describe it.\" Liz was salivating over Carly's tits as she said this. They were the same age as her previous ones, but, with more bounce. And they were perfectly round and perky. They were also a perfect size. Not as big and back-breaking as her true breasts, but also not too small that it seemed like she had none at all (like her current physical state). She swapped her masculine chest for Carly's C-cup breasts. Liz felt them fill up her work shirt. She breathed a sigh of relief. \"It's great to have a pair of tits again,\" she whispered as she quickly reached up and gave them a squeeze. Her dick twitched momentarily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay Liz.\" Liz heard Carly say. Liz saw her low-cut top laying flat against her chest. She now saw the flat male chest that she once bore, but it was missing the chest hair! That's when Liz peered down at her breasts for the first time and saw a mat of chest hair all over her ample breasts and cleavage. He could actually feel that hairs tickling her feminine nipples. For some reason, the chest hair did not swap! Liz found a way to salvage the situation though. Still a little irked at Zoe asking if she was pregnant (Liz was wondering if Zoe somehow thought she looked fat), she swapped body hair with her. Zoe now had curly black hair leading all the way up to her neck on her chest. The hair matted her large breasts and it formed a jungle all throughout her cleavage. Zoe casually scratched her hairy breasts and picked up some razors. \"Oo, I nearly forgot,\" gesturing the razors toward Carly. Carly gave her a thumbs up. The two said their good-byes to Liz, both wondering why Liz seemed....different today. She certainly seemed more chipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. This is more like it.\" Liz loved her new perky breasts. And how much smaller they were and sensitive too. \"Let's not forget about you,\" she said as she rubbed her member. The thought of what she had done and what she could do with this power to spice up her sex life with Eric began to cause her flaccid penis to become semi-erect. \"Whoops, better keep my thoughts somewhere else for now if I want to control this thing at work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow about some swaps? That would keep her mind off of things. First, some customers. She saw a 45-year-old single mom with brunette hair tied into a bun. She was wearing a modest skirt with a floral blouse. She didn't show any cleavage, but her breasts appeared to be fairly large. They were also unrestrained as Liz saw them sag....quite a bit, and she also saw the outlines of two large nipples. A pink purse was slung around her shoulder. Following her was her 14-year-old son, who was playing on his PSP and wasn't paying much attention to where he was walking. He also had brown hair and wore a t-shirt and basketball shorts. Holding the mother's hand was her 6-year-old daughter. He wore jeans, an MLP t-shirt, and light-up pink shoes. She also had her brown hair tied into a bun, like her mom. Liz closed her eyes to swap them and reopened them. The son's head now adorned his mother's body. The daughter's head was on her brother's body. The mother's head was on her daughter's body. The son pulled his hand away from his mom, confused as to why he was holding her hand. He looked around for his PSP and swiped it from his sister's larger hands. He picked at the nipple under his blouse and went back to playing his game. Meanwhile, the short mom went back up to her much taller daughter and held her hand. The family continued to walk on toward the gardening section. The son's breasts bounced. \"Kyle, wear a bra next time....please.\" The mother berated him. \"ughh, fine.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for some quick employee swaps. \"Random Swapping Rally!\" yelled Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's male backside exploded into a firmer more feminine shape as he gained the hips and ass of 17-year-old Kiran. Meanwhile, Kiran's backside deflated in her high-waist trousers as she gained Mark's hairy male butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swapped the groins and chests of Phoebe and Rob. Phoebe, stacking some canned goods, stretched backwards to pop her back. Her shirt tightened around her male pectorals and showed no sign of her breasts. Stretching also revealed the sizeable penis she had stashed in her pink knickers. She yawned and scratched her chest...and casually, her balls. Little did anyone know, since it had been completely hidden, Phoebe had previously had a butterfly tattoo above her vagina and her vagina had also been pierced. Now, she had a butterfly tattoo on her shaft and had her scrotum pierced. Meanwhile, Rob was on break. For the time being, Liz would not be able to see him, but she could image him having Phoebe's B-cups and her tight pussy. She laughed at what a hormone-driven boy his age would do with that new plumbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swapped the breasts of Jessica onto Steven's chest. Jessica continued talking to Naomi, even as her chest deflated, being replaced by the flat, hairy chest of Steven. Steven, meanwhile, was basically all woman now, despite his lack of female curves or body type. Steven continued stocking with some of the other employees as his new assets clung to his work polo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, she wanted to swap her boss, Elizabeth. But, she seemed to have run low on male employees. \"Hmmm.....\" Liz looked around and saw a bodybuilder. This man, in his mid-30s, had to be one of the hairiest, bulkiest, and most masculine individuals she had ever seen. He was wearing a muscle shirt which accentuted his ripping pectorals and biceps the size of an average man's thighs. He also wore black workout shorts with a dick that was so massive, it had to be the thickness of a coke can. \"Hehe, this will be GOOD!\" Liz swapped Elizabeth's head onto the man's body. The man, his head on Elizabeth's small body wearing a skirt suit and high heels, looked around, confused by his position. Elizabeth was also confused, but she just decided to forget about it and marched her large body to the men's room. She just wondered why she hadn't dressed more appropriately for work that day. \"Off to Big and Tall tomorrow to get me a new suit!\" She closed the stall door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's plenty for the day.\" Liz looked to her watch. \"Already the end of the shift. My, how the time flies by, luv. Who says work can't be fun and rewarding!\" She smiled, although a little disappointed everyone hadn't been swapped. \"Well, there's plenty of time for that tomorrow,\" Liz plainly said as she wondered how everyone's nights would play out with their new additions. She particularly looked forward to her night with Eric. She wasn't sure yet if he would take it up the butt or is she would give him a pair of moist feminine lips to fuck him with. Decisions, decisions.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After such a 'hectic' shift, most of which was spent by Liz rearranging people's body parts, she was ready for home. The thought of walking in on her husband with her new and 'improved' form was exciting her no end, as the stretched fabric of her slacks in front could testify. She'd certainly picked herself a nice cock, and since it was nearly as old as Eric's, that made it all the better. After all she didn't want to be outperforming him in bed. As she made her way upstairs, she grinned and cupped her perkier boobs in her hands, giving them a squeeze. \"Thanks Carly love, I'm sure Eric will love sucking these teats of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the stairs, she ran into a long line of her fellow employees who were all trying to get through the door at once to get back downstairs and outside the store. The end of the shift was what they all lived for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Liz.\" Nicola beamed, looking down on her supervisor in passing. Liz waved, chuckling again, it was weird seeing Nicola so tall. And she also wondered what she and her husband John would be getting up to tonight now that they were both packing penises and Nicola's new male body was about 20 years younger than her husband's was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark shuffled past next, Kiran's former ass and hips stretching his trousers. Then came Phoebe, who gave Rob's former cock a quick scratch between her legs as she went downstairs, and after her came Jessica and Natalie, both of whom like Phoebe were also flat chested thanks to Liz's antics. Liz bid goodnight to everyone as they filed out and descended the stairs to the shop floor and then left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, Liam was the last employee out, but at least this time he had a good reason for lagging behind, the little legs of his 7 year old girl's body could only move so fast. \"Come on Liam, pick the pace up, let's go.\" Liz ushered him along at speed, almost causing him to trip and fly head first down the stairs. That was one swap Liz could definitely say she didn't regret to some extent. Well, to be honest there were a few others too. She was daydreaming and thinking back to all the swapping she had done when Elizabeth walked up behind her. \"All set poppet?\" The now muscle-bound manager smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Liz turned around she was looking at Elizabeth's torso, at the bottom of her chest, that's how much smaller than her she was. <i>Holy crap!!</i> Liz gasped, staring up at Elizabeth's familar feminine head atop the bodybuilder's immense body. She had to be at least 6' 5\" and totally ripped. \"Oh... um... Elizabeth, hi.\" Liz chuckled nervously, having been caught out a little. \"Yes, everyone has er... gone home.\" She then smiled, more confidently this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work today love, as always.\" Elizabeth thanked Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, yeah... I thought so.\" Liz grinned, akin to a mad scientist. She felt Shaun's former manhood twitch in her slacks as she stood there. And that for some reason caused her to look down at Elizabeth's new crotch. Her manager's new cock had to be at least a foot long, and that girth... Liz's eyes bulged out wondering how it was even possible to have one that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get home love.\" Elizabeth smiled, slinging her purse over her beefy shoulder and then beginning to maneuver her colossal, rippling body downstairs. Liz stifled a giggle at the sight of a purse on her boss' shoulders. Such a contrast! Following Elizabeth, the two of them made a final check that everyone was out of the building and then they exited themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight poppet.\" Elizabeth said to Liz, waving with her massive hand as she walked to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might have to adjust your seat luv.\" Liz chuckled after her, feeling justly proud of that particular swap. \"A manager should be imposing and intimidating anyway.\" She nodded, before walking to her own car. She got behind the wheel, then reached into her work shirt and ripped her oversized bra off her body, holding it up for a moment. \"Fucking melon catcher.\" Liz laughed, slinging the now redundant garment into the back seat. She then put her seatbelt on, and as it intersected her perky new C-cup breasts, she looked down and felt her penis stirring again. \"Yeah, yeah, your fun is coming up.\" Liz patted her bulging crotch and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then put her car into gear and drove off the loading bay and down the street, heading home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive home proved exceptionally distracting for her, what with a boner tenting her slacks all the way. <i>Damn, no wonder men are always playing with these things.</i> She thought to herself as she turned her car onto her street and pulled up outside her house. To her surprise, she saw her husband Eric was stood outside talking to their neighbors Martin and Sally Cosgrove, 37 and 35 years old respectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi honey.\" Liz smiled, exiting her car. Her new tits jiggled healthily under her Wilko shirt as she walked over to Eric and her neighbors. Her cock twitched yet again and she exhaled deeply, trying to stay somewhat calm. First a quick chat with the neighbors, then into the house to use her new 'equipment' on her loving husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, while thinking of fucking Eric, she had an idea. Glancing over at Sally, she arched an eyebrow. Hmm, why not, lets give Eric a different experience too, even if he isn't aware.\" Liz thought, quickly swapping Sally's crotch with Eric's. Liz gazed down at her husband's jeans as his familiar bulge disappeared, then she immediately looked over to Sally, who had to move her legs apart a little as Eric's cock slingshotted out of her groin and instantly became erect... tenting her skirt. Eric's heavy, hairy balls were now also compressed in Sally's knickers, and Liz saw her wince. <i>Now I've got a nice pussy to pound.</i> Liz grinned, already starting to think like any ordinary horny guy would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, the neighborly conversation came to an end. \"It was nice talking to you both.\" Liz smiled, waving as she grabbed Eric with her other hand and literally dragged him into the house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz had returned to the shop floor with a clipboard in hand. It detailed the duties assigned to her co-workers. Liz took her position as supervisor very seriously and didn't ask too much out of them. She only asked that they carried out their assigned tasks diligently and efficiently. While on duty, her mind was focused on keeping everyone in line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with the events that had just transpired, Liz found it difficult to focus her attention on her supervising duties. She had to do everything in her will to restrain herself from testing the power immediately, at least until she got off of work. Loud scuffing noises caught her off guard and she looked back and forth across the aisles. Just, then Luke came scurrying from around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, umm, we kinda ripped open a few of those pet food bags that you asked us to stock,\" Luke said casually but cautiously, as he didn't want Liz to be upset. Normally, a lecture about being more careful and 'I told you not to be screwing around' would have been more than appropriate. But, Liz was actually happy, as Luke's blunder brought her focus back to her job and away from the temptation to test out the power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, luv,\" she eventually responded to a relieved Luke. \"These things happen, but you must pay more attention and take the task seriously. That's all I ask. I'll have Steven come and help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, thanks Liz. Again, I'm sorry. You're right. I should've been more attentive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hurry on to the back and grab a broom and mop. We have to keep this place in tip top shape for our customers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, Liz!\" As Luke hurried back over to the spill. Liz quickly jogged on over to the toiletries aisle to find Steven taking inventory. She advised him to head on over to aid Luke in the clean up. \"I guess he was dicking around again,\" mumbled a frustrated Steven, as he went to clean up yet another mess he didn't make. Steven was more frustrated because he wasn't feeling very well today, but he couldn't afford to miss a day of work. The bills don't pay themselves. \"I just need you to take over the stocking for him, Steven\" blurted Liz before Steven was out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz felt bad for Steven and knew the poor man had been fighting a stomach flu. But, he had been toughing it out anyway. But, she needed his strength to quickly get the rest of the pet food bags stocked while Luke clean the mess. Aaron and his strength was not available at this moment due to him being away temporarily at an appointment. Once again her train of thought was interrupted by Helen. \"Poor dear,\" she said looking at Liz and then to Steven. \"I think he's sleep deprived too. I know I wouldn't be coming in if I were him. I wish I could do something to help him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spark went off, and Liz turned to Helen. \"Well maybe you can....just maybe you can.\" A confused Helen looked to Liz. Liz focused on Helen and then on Steven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind went black for a second, and she opened her eyes. <i>Whoooosh!</i> \"Liz, Liz, are you okay?!\" Helen was worried. Liz looked up and saw Helen towering over her, her head perched on Steven's shoulders. \"I was worried for a second there dear. I thought you nearly fainted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Helen.\" Liz smiled softly. Liz looked Helen up and down. Helen lifted herself up on the heels of her shoes as she moved her large male hand to adjust the penis in her pants. Then, she scratched her hairy male ass. \"Is something wrong, Liz?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't feel any different Helen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen smirked. \"I'm afraid not dear,\" she chuckled, \"though for my age, my body still feels fairly limber, so I guess I have no room for complaining.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you said you would like to help Steven? If you're willing, you could take his place for now. But only if it's okay with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love too.\" Helen smiled cheerfully. Liz asked her to send Steven back to her. I mean she did use the power as part of the job, right? So she was justified in doing so. Or at least in her own mind for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven returned a few minutes later, still with a cold. I guess in this reality the cold came gift-wrapped with Steven's new body. Steven was absentmindedly running his hands over his breasts while he had a flushed look on his face. He was white as a ghost and obviously very sick. \"Steven. Why don't you take the rest of the day off, luv.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, I can't afford another day off without pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise it will work it out so that you will still receive pay for today, dear. I'll work it out, I promise. That stomach flu has really got a hold of you, hasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't break it. That, and my breasts and nipples have been hurting all day. And my cotton knickers have been riding up my ass all day. It's been bothering me terribly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz hid her laughter when she heard that. \"It's okay dear, I understand. Just take care of yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Liz. I think a nice hot shower might help. That and some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you need to do. Just get better, hon.\" Liz sent him off. She saw no harm in letting him go home. She could always change him back. She just imagined the thought of Steven lathering up his sticky body, with the cold sweats that accompanied his flu. It was very kinky and erotic for Liz. Meanwhile, she went to check on the clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Luke sweeping the floor, and to the right, Helen was using her (Steven's) hairy arms and shoulders to stock bags of dog food. She threw a large bag over each shoulder and stacked them with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was decided that Liz should get back to supervising the other numerous employees. It was her job after all, and she took it very seriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to do one more small test before she moved on to the other employees. She wanted to see if she could morph her own body in strange ways, specifically swapping two non-matching body parts. She briefly focused on a big and kinky swap. She opened her eyes, and it was done. She quickly ran to the restroom and ran into a stall. She pulled down her panties while sitting on the toilet and was pleased. Nestled between her legs was her asshole hole, clean and an off pink color. She tapped her finger against it and shuddered. Then, she reached her hand behind her and felt between her asscheeks. She could feel the folds of her vagina lips and could feel herself already getting wet from the situation. She stood up and walked out of the stall, pulling up her panties and zipping up her pants. She decided to stay this way, only temporarily. As she walked, she could feel her cheeks rubbing up against her pussy and she almost fell to the ground immediately from the sheer ecstasy. She rose to her feet, brushed herself off and continued on to finding her other co-workers to check on their progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore swaps were in her future for sure, as well as her co-workers. But for now, she needed to get serious about things. Liz walked out of the bathroom and headed off, trying not to look conspicuous. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz went back to the back stock room where several employees were working. Specifically, she was looking for Mark and Rebekah. Walking down the aisles towards the back of the store, Liz decided it was best to swap things back between her vagina and asshole. Otherwise, an orgasm was just minutes away due to her cheeks rubbing against one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving to the back, shouting could be heard. Liz found Mark and Rebekah not necessarily arguing but rather a bit of banter going on between the two. \"Rebekah, you need to stop slacking and help me get this stocked before Liz comes back here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying, Mark! You don't know what's like to have a period, these cramps are killing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe so, but it shouldn't be interfering with your job!\" retorted Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUGh. Whatever Mark. I know you're right, but seriously man, I'm dying over here. Go get some more of the boxes that were shipped in this morning. I'll start stacking them.\" said Rebekah, a bit frustrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, boss,\" said Mark playfully and teasingly. Even though razzled, Rebekah had to smirk a bit at that. She grabbed a few rolls of wrapping paper and stood on her tippy toes to stock them, but she still couldn't reach. She eventually had to resort to tossing it up there, much to the dismay of Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz, eavesdropping on the whole conversation, already knew her next swap. They made it too easy for her. Rebekah was such a sweet girl, and Liz wanted to make Mark understand what Rebekah was going through. She concentrated on the two, looking from behind a shelf so as not to be seen. Rebekah, lifting a box, winced as a large bulge was pushing its way out of her groin into her tight leggings. It was clear Mark had a sizeable penis, roughly 6\" flaccid. The head of her penis was clearly outlined in the leggings and with how tight they were, you wouldn't be surprised if they were cutting off the oxygen to it. Rebekah kept picking the fabric of her leggings and adjusting until it was angled down toward her right leg, still trapped however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark, on the other hand, had no indication of any pleat or bulge in his black trousers. He made a painful yelp, experiencing the cramps that Rebekah had also been experiencing. Liz also decided to accomodate Rebekah since she had trouble stacking the paper. She swapped heights between the two with Rebekah stretching out to 6' 1\" tall and Mark shrinking to Rebekah's petite 5' 5\" height. The two kept on as though nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Liz came out from behind the shelf and smiled at her co-workers. \"How are things getting along you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad,\" said Rebekah, \"though this one over here is a bit cranky,\" she said, nodding her head toward Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you don't know how much having a monthly period sucks. Consider yourself lucky you have a penis.\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do everyday,\" chuckled Rebekah, as she gave her penis a gentle rub to annoy Mark.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you two, I don't mind the chatter but just make sure this all gets done by the end of the day! Keep up the good work.\" interjected Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will, Liz\" the two replied in unison. Turning away, Liz was intrigued by how much Rebekah enjoyed her penis. Liz was starting to wonder if she should get herself a penis. The ultimate experience a woman could have! Actually, no, the ultimate experience one woman with this power could have, and she had this power. She could know different aspects of what it meant to be a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over, Liz decided against a penis for now, partly because she wasn't completely ready yet, but also because there were no other available male genitalia in sight, except the set she bestowed upon Rebekah. And she wanted her to Keep Mark's schlong. However, Liz could make one change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Mark, Liz concentrated again. Her chest deflated like two balloons with the air being let out. Her chest turned into a putty of skin before slowly it began to take shape. Two nickle-sized male nipples formed on her chest followed by a slight belly and a thick mat of hair began to grow all over her new chest. The shirt followed as if it had never been taken off her to begin with. Looking across to Mark, his chest exploded and swelled. A skin putty similar to hers, two large nipples and areolas formed followed by a large swelling up to a size 30H cup breasts. Soft hairless skin followed that and her belly button formed on his new torso. The bra then appeared, taming his puppies, followed by his work shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had completely swapped torsos with Mark! She took her still feminine hands and slapped her belly then reached up her shirt to feel her chest hair. She giggled. Mark, on the other hand, was rubbing his breasts as he tried to pick up a box. He grabbed his back. Liz grimaced and felt bad because she knew what that was like. But now, carrying those weights was his problem. Liz decided to keep her new torso for now. She grabbed her clipboard and headed out of the stock room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed to her next checkup with her Wilkos family. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz was walking around, her shoes clicking across the aisles. \"Grrrroromroorr.\" Her stomach started rumbling.  She was famished. She checked her watch. 11:45 a.m. Nearly lunch time. Her mind, wandering further as she clicked along without missing a beat, was focused once again on one of her most loved, able co-workers, Steven. She still got a kick out of the idea of him showering off his sick, feminine, mature body, lathering it up. It was almost erotic, and it weirdly turned on Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly shook her head, not needing her knickers to be wet at work. Trotting on a bit more, her mind continued to wander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then thought to Helen with her masculine body now. The hilariousness of her situation, a situation she was more than accustomed to considering that's how she's always been. How she thinks she's always been, at least. You can't imagine how her and her husband's love life has been, both taking turns taking anal from one another. She giggled again to herself. \"It's not like they know any different,\" she thought, I mean they have been married for almost 25 years.....well wait....,\" she paused. \"Actually, exactly 25 years,\" she muttered to herself. \"Oh, my goodness!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had overlooked one little detail when she had switched Helen and Steven. She knew Helen could easily have back her body the next day, but that was based on the Liz's misconception that Helen, being a tad more advanced in age, likely wouldn't be having sex with Steven's body tonight. But, it was their anniversary! Sex was sure to be on the table. Liz frantically ran back over to the dog food aisle just as time was called for lunch, specifically for a handful of employees. Helen was setting a broom against the pyramid of dog bags and turned to see Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Liz, we got everything finished for you over here,\" she smiled with her painted lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Helen. You two did a brilliant job.\" She smiled back \"Listen, it's your ..... anniversary, correct?\" Asked Liz, nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, dear! Thank you for remembering. I remember the day my Gerald and I met. We were both shopping for suits for our high school dances. We bumped into one another and chatted. The rest is history I suppose.\" She spoke, all lovey-dovey in her tone and in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow,\" said Liz, uninterested at the story of how they first met. But, Liz did press more for her personal life. \"So, everything okay with you and Gerald then? You got anything big planned for your wedding anniversary?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Liz was talking, Helen was still focused on her story and was fiddling in her brown wallet for sometime. Between a few coins dropping and confetties of old paper landing on the floor, Helen managed to pull a crinkled old photo out of her wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See there!\" said Helen. Liz gently took the photo and saw both Helen and her husband wearing their tuxedos at their wedding, their hands together. They must've been dancing to their wedding song. \"Oh he looked so sharp in his tuxedo.....and not to brag, but so did I.\" She let out a cackling howl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz chimed in again, \"So, any big plans for tonight then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerald will probably get home late. I'm hoping for the two of us to have a candleholders dinner and have some 'fun', if you catch my drift, deary\" she winked. She then whispered, \"I'm even going to take some Viagra and slip him some too so we can go all night,\" she was giddy with excitement. \"She then added, \"I'm even going to shave my balls. Gerald loves it when they're smooth!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's eyes grew wide at that last statement. \"A little too much information, Helen. Just remember, we are still at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're right. Sorry about that, dear. Got a bit carried away. Can you blame me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright. I completely understand. It's brilliant to see how much you two still love one another after 25 years. Here's to some more!\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen nodded to Liz, said thank you and looked at the clock. \"Oh I'd better get going, I need to get some lunch before our break is over.\" Helen, with her manly strides, walked around the corner and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's fear was confirmed about Helen having sex. But, there was nothing she could do. Steven, being sick, was probably already asleep and passed out at home. He probably wouldn't pick up the phone. She felt bad for Steven. She kept reminding herself that's \"It's not like any of them will ever know.\" This was all normal to them. Now what?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had strawberry blonde hair with large DD-cup breasts and had a few wrinkles on her face but she was still very beautiful. Her father was wearing a polo and some long khaki pants, as he appeared to be nearly 6' 6\" tall. His petite, teenage daughter closely trailed behind them with her boyfriend. The girl was wearing a short denim skirt and her B-cup tits nearly spilled out of her tank top. The boyfriend had a raging boner as his girlfriend continued fawning over him. Next to the mother and holding her hand was a little 4 year old boy. She was skipping along with his mommy whilst humming a tune to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you two keep your hands off each other,\" the father snapped back as the young couple. \"Please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter rolled her eyes followed by a mumbled \"whatever\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hon, leave them alone. You remember how we were at their age?\" she pleaded to her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember ever being that way. Kids need to have more common decency. At least when I was that young, I could keep my hormones in check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz wanted to test that theory out. She decided to swap the father with his teenage daughter and the mother with the daughter's boyfriend. Things changed and....also didn't change. The father and mother now could not keep their hands off of each other with their hormone-driven young bodies. \"But I do have to say,\" said the father as a continuation of his conversation before the swap,\"you're still a sexy piece of ass.\" He whispered into her ear, \"I can't wait for you to pound me silly tonight,\" as he grabbed her penis, making her giggle and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, dad! You can't keep your hands off of each other either! So, leave me and Brian alone.\" she said as she pointed her large finger toward him. The daughter turned to her boyfriend who continued to fondle her balls as she rubbed his (formerly her mother's) sagging breasts. Her boyfriend reach up to the mat of hairs on her chest out of her polo and played with them. \"Babe, let's go to the movies later after I'm done with my prostate exam,\"said the daughter and her boyfriend excitedly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz turned back to the little boy and planned to leave him unswapped. But her concentration during swapping must have been off because the little boy also had a swap. The young kid swapped chests with a pregnant young woman. The poor kid nearly toppled over. The nipple outlines were clear in his little sweater and the nipples were leaking milk profusely. The little boy began to cry because he didn't know how to make it stop. The mother came over and comforted him and told him it was alright, and that it happens from time to time. The pregnant woman came over to the young boy with her beautiful baby girl and had a proposition for him. \"I think we might be able to help each other out. My girl here is hungry, and if you feed her, it might help your boobies stop making milk,\" continuing to talk to him like the child he was. He agreed, smiling. He sat down on a bench and took off his sweater. The pregnant mother helped the baby girl up to his erect nipple and she began sucking on it. The boy smiled and said, \"it tickles, mommy.\" The daughter on her dad's hairy body snapped a picture and said, \"Awww, that's so cute. This is so going on Instagram!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her work finished here, Liz decided on one last quick swap. She saw a gay couple walking down one aisle toward her and a lesbian couple walking away from her on the opposite aisle. She wondered how reality would change for gay couples if they were to have the opposite sex's genitalia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gay couple consisted of a large muscular man, probably around 6ft tall and toned, but not built, man who was about 5' 10\". Both had considerable bulges in their jeans and were picking out a dinner set. The lesbian couple consisted of two curvy women, one blonde and one brunette. The were holding hands. The blonde had C cup breasts and wore capris and a tank top. The brunette had the same apparel but had E cup breasts. Liz, with a big bust of her own (usually), felt pain for the woman, she concentrated and swapped the two couples heads around. The women now had the mens' bodies and went back to holding hands. They were still laughing and getting apparently turned on by each other. Now that they had male bodies, you could see how turned on they were as their erections strained their pants. The brunette pulled the blonde in for a kiss as their erections rubbed up against one another. They giggled and held each other's asses. The men on the other hand were still choosing a dinette set. Being meticulous, the formerly muscular men went up to adjust his boyfriends breasts. \"Thanks, Brad. Now I look smoking hot.\" \"Babe you were already hot,\" said the man named Steve. The pressed their breasts together and kissed. Liz laughed uncontrollably, catching the attention of a few passerbys. She blushed and quited down. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Liz, we need you in the back room,\" said Mark's muffled voice on the other end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz rolled her eyes as the hand holding her walkie talkie dropped to her side. This was just what she needed. Something else to go wrong today when she was already largely preoccupied. She tried to be patient with her employees, but she already assumed the worst that someone was screwing around again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem, Mark?\" asked Liz sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, yeah, the forklift went screwy and crashed into a stocking shelf. It knocked over a bunch of lumber and insulation. We are going to need some help over here immediately.\" Mark said, trying to sound convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was about to ask 'how did you manage that?' but she knew it would not have mattered as Mark would have come up with some excuse that he would have sworn by to his grave. So, she did not even bother. She replied she would be back there with a few employees in 15. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz frantically looked for some of her bigger helpers. She searched aisle by aisle....dog food, lumber, tools, lawn and garden,...and...wait, there we are! Liz stopped in her tracks. \"Aaron...AARON?\" Aaron turned his chiseled head towards Liz. He seemed bothered by this letting out a frustrated *sigh*. Liz was surprised to see him back from his appointment so quickly. Once he turned, the previously blocked Charlotte came into view, with her normal bitchy attitude on display in her face. \"I need you two to go help Rebekah and Mark in the back room. \"But, Liz, we are price checking over here,\" interrupted an unhappy and lazy Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you aren't even doing that, Charlotte,\" Liz said sternly, with a fire in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE!\" said Charlotte, as she stormed toward the back room, Aaron following her like a puppy dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl, I swear!\" Liz headed back toward the back stocking room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forklift was over on it side, as chunks of shredded fiberglass insulation and large planks and boards of lumber lay scattered everywhere. Sitting on a couple of chairs were a guilty-looking Mark and Rebekah. They were quietly shouting at one another trying to lay blame as Rebekah punched Mark's boob. He grabbed and rubbed it in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, 'Busty' over here tried to work the forklift,\" said Rebekah, nodding towards Mark,\"...and apparently his big breasts blocked his view of the ignition switch. He just ran head on into the stocking shelf.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only because Rebekah kept distracting me by constantly complaining about how tight her dick felt in her pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to learn to keep a handle on those things,\" said Rebekah, poking Mark's tit. \"Believe me, I'd like to get them reduced but the girlfriend loves them too much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" said Liz angrily, although she had to hold back a bit of laughter from what Mark just said. \"At this point, I don't care what happened. Just clean things up!\" Charlotte and Rebekah went to grab some brooms and mops from the storage/janitorial closet while the 'men', Aaron and Mark, immediately started stacking up the lumber and gathering the insulation. Aaron whispered, \"Rebekah is right, you need to keep a leash on those things, Mark,\" right after Mark jolted up and his breasts knocked the gathered lumber out of Aaron's hands. Liz was already considering swapping something back, considering both of her swaps were technically responsible for the accident. However, she decided to switch things up with everyone in this case. well, everyone in the room that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz first decided to swap her's and Mark's chests back, as her shirt ballooned out and her two nipples nearly poked through her shirt. \"Wow, not having big nipples must have really made me forget hold cold it was in here!\" She left Mark in his emasculated state, thinking he should still learn to understand the pains of having a vagina. Liz then decided that it was time to make the plunge. She wanted a dick like Rebekah. Hell, Rebekah really seemed to be enjoying hers, and it was really starting to make Liz jealous, as she continued to stroke her shaft through her yoga pants. Liz turned to Aaron, wondering if the masculinity in his pants matched that of his physique. Only one way to find out. She concentrated and felt a long thick rod push its way into her knickers. She grabbed and squeezed it as she felt a pop and then another pop. The two testicles pushed their way out of her groin. Aaron was huge....no, SHE WAS HUGE! It had to easily be 7 inches. She rubbed her breasts as she grabbed it, amazed at how sensitive and incredible it felt. She could feel each one of her balls sticking out on either side of her knickers. She had to bring her mind back to the room, however, as she was still at work. There would be plenty of time to play with the large python in her pants later on in the day. She wondered how the reality changed, how her marriage had changed, and how her sex life had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thought process was interrupted. \"Uhhh, Liz, do you...uh...need to take care of something?\" said Aaron, staring at the erection straining against her tight women's khakis. She then took a glance at Aaron's crotch, his camel toe was almost on full display. \"Oh, sorry luv,\" said an embarrassed Liz, who placed her planner in front of her crotch to cover it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, leave her alone, Aaron,\" said Mark,\"like you havent even gotten aroused at work before!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's got your knickers in a wad?\" said Aaron, cursing under his breath. He then laughed and said in an antagonizing way, \"Sounds like someone's girlfriend has not gone down on him in a while. What's a matter, your girlfriend doesnt like eating you out anymore? Sounds like you could use it, considering how uptight you are.\" \"I'm still getting more action that you are. At least I have a girl. When's the last time you've scissored with anyone or gotten any action beside with you dildo.\" Aaron's face filled with anger, as he just started to ignore Mark while he picked up the lumber. Liz knew it was her job as supervisor to stop their banter, but she was enjoying it too much. She decided, on a side note, to keep her tits for now. But, she could not wait to unload them onto some other unsuspecting man later on in the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe next decided to concentrate on Charlotte, thinking she did not deserve any breasts. She transferred Charlotte's tits to Aaron, and to keep things consistent, she also transferred Rebekah's tits to Mark. Charlotte and Rebekah both patted their chests momentarily with a confused look on their faces until the reality change kicked in completely. \"I'm thinking about waxing my chest.\" said Rebekah. \"Why?\" said a snarky Charlotte, \"....all the guys love my chest hair.\" A smiling Rebekah, towering over Charlotte, said back in an equally snarky attitude,\"Well, all the guys I know love a smooth hairless feminine woman who does some good landscaping.\" Charlotte rolled her eyes as Rebekah felt happy with her accomplishment of putting Charlotte in her place. Liz laughed thinking that Rebekah waxing her man chest to make it smooth and hairless somehow made her more feminine. Liz did not think Charlotte was done. This girl needed more things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a stray dog that often roamed around the open door of the drop off station where deliveries were made. He was a bit like the company mascot, if you will. They nicknamed him Scraps. Scraps was panting while laying just outside the open door. Liz was deciding to swap Scrap's tail onto Charlotte to make her look like more of a freak. She also wanted to swap one more thing between her and Aaron. She did not think Charlotte deserved any genitalia and decided on keeping Scraps out of swaps for now. She decided to go back to her previous experiment of swapping non-matching parts. She was going to swap Aaron's asshole with Charlotte's vagina, giving him two pussies and her two assholes. She concentrated and boom, it was done. Since nothing could be observed differently, she could not be sure it worked. But, she trusted her abilities enough. Charlotte did scratch her crotch while Aaron laughed. \"Need to go to the vet and get that taken care of?\" Aaron teased. \"Shut the hell up, Aaron!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz thought that was an awfully weird thing to say. She pondered what that meant but shrugged it off as some sort of new lingo she didn't quite understand. Liz looked to the clock and realized it was 5 minutes til afternoon break. She wanted to go over and feed Scraps a treat, but it looked like he had already gone on break. This day was lasting forever and Liz wanted to desperately make it through so she could see how everything had altered in her personal life due to the recent addition of her new equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Liz, Aaron's comment was more than mere childish lingo. While Liz had concentrated, she was still thinking about Scraps when swapping things between her and Aaron. Charlotte had a pair of furry testicles and a big furry dog dick laying between her smooth thighs while Scraps had a tight pink human vagina between his back legs. But, this was normal to everyone. Liz must have been unable to see the bulge her flaccid dog penis made in her loose fitting work pants. On her way to break, Charlotte kept scratching her crotch. \"Damn fleas. I hope that Frontline works! I haven't been able to jack off in over a week.\" A frustrated Charlotte ran to the bathroom. Meanwhile, Liz and the other employees headed to the breakroom. Despite everything, over an hour had passed, and the stock room had been cleaned thoroughly and was spotless. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the other employees huddled into the breakroom, a ring escaped from Liz's pants. Liz read the screen and realized it was her husband Eric. This was one of the first opportunities she has been looking for to explore how far the reality changes had changed things. She answerd the call, \"Hello, luv,\" Liz said in the usual soft, warm tone in which she typically greeted her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sweetie, I'm just checking to make sure we are all good for our monthly romantic date night,\" he said, excitedly. He added, \"I've made us something very special for dinner. Roast Potatoes, Rotisserie Chicken, and Lemon Garlic Green Beans, mua!  I am planning on making it a very unforgettable evening, if you know what I mean.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz knew exactly what he meant, as this was a common ritual they adopted to keep their sex life active and adventurous. Liz was still curious, though, so she pushed him further. \"That sounds lovely, Eric, I am looking forward to it. Why don't you...uh,\" and Liz looked around as she quietly continued,\"....why don't you tell me more about what you're going to do to me in bed,\" she said seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric laughed on the other end. \"This isn't typically like you Liz. But, it's kinda hot and kinky. Well, I was going to surprise you, but I got us both cock rings so we can last for hours. Oh, and I made sure to pick up the extra-large condoms for you,\" he said in a lustful voice. \"I want us to take turns pounding one another hard in the ass.\" Liz nearly dropped the phone. She couldn't believe what Eric had just said. Without thinking, she began to question him, which thoroughly confused her husband for minutes. She hadn't responded to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Liz? I thought you would enjoy that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think it's a bit odd I have a penis, Eric?\" she said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are you okay? What's wrong with your penis?\" a bewildered Eric asked his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean the fact that I'm a woman, but I have a penis. You don't see anything wrong with that? You don't think it's weird that I don't have a vagina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, listen, there is absolutely nothing wrong with you. Your penis is one of the unique things that sets you apart from all other women that I love. Your penis doesn't make you any less of a woman or any less of the sexy, feminine gal I fell for. You are smart, sexy, and I love everything about you. What's this about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz still couldn't believe it. She was still having trouble grasping how she could be considered a woman yet still have male genitalia. She thought about what Eric said, though, and had to smile. He was always quite the sweet talker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz began to reassure Eric, \"Sorry, it is nothing. It's just been a really....weird and strange day for me. Think I'm just a little off today is all.\" She laughed. \"I promise Eric, I'm fine. I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too. Just, please, I hope you're okay and take care of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well, I'm looking forward to an amazing night with you, dear.\" he said, still giddy for their upcoming sexual endeavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds lovely, I might have to use these big breasts of mine to give you a nice tit job,\" Liz said, giggling as if she were a horny little teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, honey, that sounds fantastic. I only wish I had breasts so you could experience the amazing feeling of a tit job. But, could you imagine? A guy with tits?\" Eric laughed. \"Sometimes, I wonder about myself and the weird thoughts I have.\" <i>A guy having tits was weird but a woman with a penis was a-okay?,</i> Liz thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, no Eric. I'm pretty sure most guys wish they had a pair of knockers to play around with anytime they wanted. It's normal. I'll see you tonight, hon. I love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too, bye!\" Eric hung up the phone. Liz was weirded out by it all. Why was this normal? Why was she bestowed this power? Why did reality change? Why her? On the other side of things, however, her mind was telling her not to question it, to go with the flow. Should she just go with it? Try something new. The idea of having new equipment in the bedroom both horrified and intrigued her all at the same time. Liz looked to her crotch. \"Well, I guess far more intrigued than horrified,\" as she saw her erection throbbing through her pants. If she was going to get through the rest of the day, she knew she would have to take care of this thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz ran to the bathroom and locked herself in a stall. She pulled down her knickers and saw it for the first time. Her erection was standing straight up. Actually, there might have been a slight curve to it. The veins had blood flowing through them vigorously on the foreskin of the shaft. She gently placed her hand around her erection as a shot of pleasure resonated throughout her body. She moved her hand slowly up and down, and she started to breathe hot and heavy. Every continuous stroke of her shaft sent her deeper into waves of pleasure and slower to the bliss of her first male orgasm. Her pace quicked faster....and faster....faster until her whole body tensed and went stuff. A huge load of hot cum sprayed all over the back of the stall door. Her muscles relaxed and she sat there on the toilet in the afterglow, smiling and interestingly enough, kinda sleepy. She yawned a bit and smiled again. \"Wow. If thats how amazing jerking off feels, I can't even imagine how sex must be.\" That she would be experiencing it for the first time with male genitalia later that night. \"...Or that tit job Eric mentioned.\" Wait a minute, Liz thought, maybe she could have a tit job. Devilish thoughts started to fill her mind. She pulled out her phone and wanted to test something. She pulled up a picture of her husband and concentrated. She felt her chest deflate, being replaced by a slightly hairy, flat male chest. She instantly recognized it as her husband's. She pulled up a photo her and her husband recently took with their friends. There stood her with her flat chest and an erection in her tight jeans. Her husband stood there with her H-cup breasts strained against his polo and pressed against her now male chest. Both of them had erections in the photo, and they were nearly rubbing against one another. Liz quickly concentrated and switched back. Oh, she'd be having her dick between a pair of knockers tonight, her husband's. But, she wanted to choose the cream of the crop from the Wilkos family to not only bestow her assets, since she loved the feel and relief of a flat male chest, but also to give her husband a nice bust that she could enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EWWWWW,\" Liz was interrupted. She turned and saw Charlotte there with one leg propped up on the sink and one on the ground with her back turned to Liz. \"Were you masturbating in there Liz? I know having a dick is great and all, but that's disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I was just.....,\" Liz stopped,\"wait a minute, what do you mean by 'you know having a dick is great and all?'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz are you okay?\" said Charlotte as she turned around to face Liz. \"I've always had a dick!\" Charlotte must have been dealing with her flea problem because sticking out of her pants was her erect dog cock, coated with brown fur. Liz stared at it horrified and now knew what Aaron had meant. She had accidentally swapped Scraps with Charlotte. But, without a photo of Scraps, or remembering exactly how he looked, she could not swap the two back. Plus, who knows where Scraps was by now? Liz felt awful, but she knew Scraps would be back later and this could be fixed. \"Oh, how could I forget?\" said a shaky Liz, playing along. Charlotte said, \"Yeah, I've just been dealing with these terrible fleas. Damn vet can't give me a straight answer. He's so incompetent.\" Nice to see Charlotte still had her awful attitude, though Liz. Seeing as though she could do nothing for now, Liz left Charlotte to her troubles in the bathroom and headed upstairs to the breakroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn there, she saw most of the employees, all huddled in their little groups. She scanned the room for a male chest she wanted. She saw Aaron, Josh, Liam and Luke in their usual 'guy' corner talking about all the chicks they've picked up. She overheard the always young and attractive Luke talking about sucking on the tits of this girl he picked up in a bar, trying to be quiet so as not to attract the attention of any of the female Wilkos employees. Liz thought Luke had a nice body, and decided she wanted his chest. She concentrated as her tits once again shrank to a flat, yet this time slightly muscular, male torso with a mat of thick chest hair. Luke's chest ballooned out as he sank forward in his chair under the new 'boulders' heaving from his chest. He let out a slight grunt as each nipple poked out into place. The conversation was the same only the person of focus was different. Luke was now talking about and boasting about how massive his nipples were and how he could suck on each one of them with ease. He grabbed his breasts and lifted them to his face, making a licking motion with his tongue. Josh and Liam, with no understanding of having breasts, found the whole gesture and conversation gross and unarousing and just plain weird as their male buddy talked about sucking on his nipples. It was weird how this reality worked. Aaron, with breasts of his own, was on the other hand very intrigued and asked Luke for tips. For her husband, she wanted a pair of breasts for him that were sufficiently big but around his own age. She settled on Nicola who had a nice pair of C-cups, only slightly sagging due to gravity. She closed her eyes, and it was done. She looked at a photo of her and her husband on the beach. She had Luke's slim male muscular torso while shirtless, while her husband had Nicola's matured breasts, clad in a bikini top. Liz smiled, rubbing her erection. It was going to be one hell of a night. She made one more quick head swap....between Natalie and Josh. Josh adorned Natalie's body beautifully. It was sure to make his sex life more interesting. Natalie scratched her bulging crotch, unaware. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>5:00 PM. Things were starting to (finally) wind down for the day. Liz had been able to keep herself busy for the next few hours, following the breakroom shenanigans that had previously transpired. She checked her watch, eagerly awaiting the moment in which she could clock out. This was unlike her, considering how much she cared about her job and how she always took it seriously. Her fellow employees and subordinates updated her on the status of their daily tasks, where they left off and what had been completed for the day. Of course, she'd still have to confirm the progress of a few of her employees (I'm looking at you, Charlotte and Aaron). Thus was the daily workday end-of-shift ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the employees were lounging around while yet a few others were still working diligently. There were a few patrons in the store, namely a family with a few small children, a middle-aged father shopping by himself, and a petite older woman with grey streaks in her hair. Liz turned to see Helen assisting a fellow middle-aged woman who needed help carrying groceries to her car. The two talked about their lives, little interesting craft ideas, and their husbands. The two chat like a couple of veteran moms. Liz hear the woman talk about how perverted her husband could be. \"Men.\" said Helen, \"I'll never understand why they're so obsessed with sex or why they're always horny.\" The two rolled their eyes and laughed, as Helen scratched her man bulge, which was the answer to her previous inquiry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5:10PM. Time to check in with Elizabeth. Liz walked to Elizabeth's office to give her an overview of the day's events. Elizabeth was finishing a phone call with a business partner as Liz walked into her office. \"Yes, I'm looking forward to it.....okay......mhm.....yes, goodbye...\" Liz heard Elizabeth end the phone call. Elizabeth let out a sigh of relief and shook her head. She looked up to Liz and smiled, \"How are you, Liz? Did the staff give you any trouble today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there were a couple of spills on the dog food. Helen was a massive help out there. Mark managed to somehow crash a forklift into one of the stocking shelves, BUT I promise that it was all cleaned up. He is usually very attentive, and we already had a discussion about it. There's no need to go about that any further.\" Liz pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Liz. I know Mark is a hard-worker, and these things happen. And, I have to say, that Helen is one big help. It's nice to have a female on our staff whose strength puts most of her male counterparts to shame.\" Elizabeth giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you have NO idea.\" Liz giggled back. \"It's her anniversary. I think her and her hubby are going to have quite the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, I wonder how that works, considering how both of them have....,\" Elizabeth trailed off. \"Ramblings of a preoccupied mind. I'm sorry, dear. Forget I mentioned that.\" Liz knew she was referring to them both having male genitalia and that Elizabeth must have stopped since, in this reality, Liz and her husband Eric were also are a couple with two penises between them. \"Do you have any plans with Eric tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is making a romantic dinner. It's kind of a date night thing we do once or twice a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, that sounds lovely. I hope you two have a wonderful time. I need me a mature guy like that Eric of yours. He sounds like the grown-up fellow I need in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who in particular are you talking about?\" Liz was sensing she had a person in mind, considering the tone Elizabeth took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know me too well, that Shaun is a handsome fellow. Hard worker. Chivalrous. Listens well. Nice. Good with kids. Just a manly man, you know? Just like that Eric of yours.\" Liz laughed, considering how her manly-man of a husband currently was sporting a pair of jugs. \"And that body, wowza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fairly well-built for a middle-aged man, I'll give you that Elizabeth. You don't find that very often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just like a good, strong, matured male body like his. Oh, I hope this conversation isn't making you uncomfortable, hun. I should really stop before I say any more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, it is no problem Elizabeth. I'd better get going anyway.\" Liz was thinking this was too easy. She focused on Elizabeth while thinking about Shaun and a flash of light took over the room, due to the drastic transformation. Elizabeth sat in her chair, folding her muscular arms behind her head. She even briefly smelled her armpit and made a wincing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, dear. I have to say, though, he even goes so far as to dress nice for work. What a man! Did you see him dressed in that nice skirt-suit. He's dressing nicer than me, and I'm the one working in the office all day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is quite the gentleman,\" said a winking Liz, who stole a glance at Elizabeth's pants, a growing bulge clearly visible. \"Cute butt too, don't ya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth blushed, her cheeks glowing bright red. \"I guess so,\" acting like she didn't care but obviously feeling giddy like a schoolgirl on the inside. \"Well, yes. I guess he does. He has a beautiful figure. Anyway, I've kept you long enough. Go enjoy your night,\" she said smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Elizabeth. You too!\" Liz turned and left the office. Upon leaving, she heard Elizabeth quietly yelling at her crotch, \"why won't you ever go down while I'm at work. Can't I ever just take care of you when I get home?\" Liz just laughed and headed towards her locker to grab her things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5:30PM. The shift had ended. Liz looked at the store patrons. \"Hmm, why not.\" She turned to the family and scrambled them. The 8 year old son had swapped his head with his father. Then, she swapped the 5 year old daughter's head with her mother's head. The mother and father, adorning their children's bodies, had a harder time keeping control of the kids. The son scooped up his mother in his hairy arms, now wearing a green polo and khaki pants. His mother was wearing a purple skirt with a My Little Pony t-shirt. The daughter did the same with her dad, she was wearing a summer dress and her father wearing a Power Rangers t-shirt and little khaki shorts. The two children carried their parents to the car while saying how 'helpful' they were. This talk revealed the son and father's voices were also swapped, a booming bass coming from the little boy. The mother's and daughter's voices were also swapped. Liz moved onto the solo middle-aged father and the older woman. Liz concentrated, trying to emasculate yet another man. However, Liz mind was still focused on part swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she opened her eyes, she swore she could've seen a pleat or movement in the back of the petite, older woman's skirt. She was quite beautiful for a 50 year old woman, just aged a bit. Smooth skin and beautiful painted lips and hazel eyes. The man seemed very happy and cheerful, with blue eyes sparkling and a stubbled face. His pants were deflated in front. The woman, however, made it difficult to tell since she was wearing a skirt. Liz assumed things went as planned. But, something very weird had occurred. Liz did swap the man's dick onto the woman.....but for her asshole. The woman still had her vagina in its normal place but now had a impressive package positioned between her round, saggy asschecks. Had Liz stuck around, she would have seen the woman checking out the middle-aged father and see her cock tail become erect. Each step she took would have her cheeks rubbing up and down the shaft, causing her immense pleasure. The man, well, he did not seem unhappy with having a tight feminine anus replacing his cock and balls. He and his wife must enjoy their sex life, considering he seemed to be quite the cheerful gentleman. He looked down at his shorts and itched his frontal feminine asshole. Besides, they were regulars at Wilkos, even Liz knew that. Maybe, just maybe, their paths will cross again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill walking, unknowing of the messed up swap she had just caused, Liz saw Natalie's fiance greet her. He hugged and kissed his bride-to-be, who giggled. He reached around and grabbed her hairy ass and the two walked hand-in-hand to his Honda. It was odd to see a male body act so feminine, but Liz was already used to seeing Natalie work that body like a pro She was used to seeing it as hers. Liz grabbed her purse and keys from her locker, as she shook her head, still thinking about her wild power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to quit with her power for the day. There would be plenty of fun to come the next day. She walked out the front door and saw Waggy chastizing Liam for trying to check out early, telling him he had a lot of growing up to do. \"Guess I lied,\" said Liz. She swapped Waggy with Liam from the waist down. For Waggy, this certainly clashed with her slim upper body and her B-cup breasts. On the other hand, it suited Liam quite well. His long brown hair and slim upper body fit in quite well with his generous feminine backside, wearing Waggy's tight black work pants. Liz actually saw him scratch his new ass and saw him sink one of his fingers down the back of his pants to fish out the white knickers sandwiched between his fleshy, hairless cheeks. He had a pussy with stretch marks between his smooth legs, but he seemed not to care or notice much. Liz laughed yet again. She could not wait to mess with the rest of the employees tomorrow and also to swap up some of her previous victims. She wasn't sure if she wanted to swap everyone back and start with a clean slate or continue as is. Or even to get really weird and swap non-matching parts. The possibilities were endless! As she pulled out, she saw Scraps! She could swap Charlotte back.....but she decided not to. Her decision to punish Charlotte was still final, even if it wasn't in the way she originally planned. Besides, Charlotte having fleas was rich, HA! Liz saw a young, big-bootied teenager in the parking lot in a short denim skirt. She swapped her from the waist down with an old man walking in front of his wife. His elderly wife slapped his feminine ass with approval. Liz smiled and sped off. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Outside her house, Liz switched the car engine off and sat back, taking a moment to peep down her Wilko polo shirt at the thick mat of dark hair on her manly chest. A grin then appeared on her face as Aaron's cock twitched in her pants. She gave her throbbing, aching member a firm rub and then exited the car, activating the alarm as she slung her black purse over her shoulder and walked into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed as normal, the lighting in the house was dimmer than usual though and she could hear romantic, 80's music playing in the dining room. \"Eric, honey?\" She called out for her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here babes.\" Her husband's voice replied. Liz smiled incessantly as she put her purse down on the hallway dresser. Then she scratched her flat, hairy chest and walked into the other room where Eric was. There he was, the man in her life, looking as gorgeous as ever. True, he was 15 years her senior, but that didn't matter. Eric's familiar receding hairline and familiar face loomed out of the candle-lit room, and Liz saw he'd dressed for the occasion. He had on a pair of his smart trousers, his best loafers, and a casual blue shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, you're looking amazing honey.\" Liz greeted her husband as they hugged. Liz immediately felt her husband's new breasts pressing against her torso as they hugged. After kissing on the lips, Liz drew back, holding Eric's hands and marveling at how Nicola's tits were distending her husband's casual shirt. Definitely a good choice on her part. Liz felt her erection throb again as her excitement grew. \"How was your day?\" Liz then asked, as she began to remove her Wilko top, exposing Luke's former chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good actually,\" Eric replied with a smile as he ogled his wife's hairy, muscular chest, \"I finally got the old Fiesta in the garage fixed, so we can sell it now. If only you knew how awkward it is trying to maneuver myself under such a small car with these getting in the way?\" Eric chuckled, lifting and squeezing his C-cup boobs together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only imagine.\" Liz smirked, standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, enough about me, how was your day at work?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had no reason to lie. \"It was amazing actually, best day I've ever had.\" She told her husband. \"We can continue this chat in a minute hun, I need to get changed.\" She continued, receiving an understanding nod from her husband, who sat himself down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay honey, but dinner is ready in 15 minutes.\" Eric called out to her as Liz started heading upstairs, her discarded work shirt in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter glancing in her wardrobe, Liz noticed how all her tops had altered in size to fit her new torso. She picked out a plain, low-cut white top that would show off her chest hair and a pair of loose-fitting polyester slacks that would give her 'equipment' room to breath while also emphasing her package. Slipping into the fresh clothes didn't take long, and then Liz slipped her feet into the only pair of flats she owned, a pair of black leather ones that were slightly scuffed at the front. Pulling the scrunchie out of her hair, she then gave it a quick brush while standing in front of the mirror. \"Not bad at all.\" She said to herself, hands on hips as she studied her reflection. She then gave her 'borrowed' genitalia a gentle squeeze, grinned and went back downstairs after applying a quick squirt of perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my beautiful wife.\" Eric smiled upon seeing Liz return to the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm famished, let's eat.\" Liz said, making eyes at her beloved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll through dinner, the couple flirted with each other. Liz slipped a foot out of her shoe and teased her husband under the table, rubbing his legs and even managing to place her foot on his raging boner. As Liz did this, Eric peered across the table at the chest hair spilling out from his wife's top. He couldn't wait for dinner to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a half hour later, their dinner was over. Piling the dishes into the sink, they decided to leave them for the next morning. After all, they had more important things to do tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, in their bedroom, lit by a pink shaded lamp on Liz's side of the bed, they started expressing their love for each other. Liz was the first one undressed, quickly discarding her top and peeling off her polyester slacks... exposing the bulbous head of her cock, which was peeking up past the waistband of her knickers again. Her balls were churning and she'd never felt so horny in her life before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric meanwhile had unfastened the buttons on his shirt, but it was Liz who walked over and pulled his shirt open... revealing Nicola's former breasts sat snugly on her husband's chest, clad in a bra. Her face lit up. \"Hmm, your tits look as awesome as ever honey.\" She paid her grinning husband a compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that hint babes?\" Eric chuckled, feeling his own member straining against his briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it is, stop being coy.\" Liz winked, as she helped Eric out of the remainder of his clothes. A few moments later, Liz finally removed her knickers and flung them to one side. Her impressive cock and balls were now free of their confinements and she was ready to go. Eric had already taken his place on the bed, laid on his back as though they had done it this way forever. Liz shook her head in wonder as she crawled onto the bed. The absence of her heavy breasts was still a little weird to her, but it was also very arousing. For a moment she wondered what Luke might be doing with her tits, and she had a pretty good idea of course considering his discussion in the tea room at work earlier. Liz straddled her husband's body, maneuvering up until she was perfectly placed for a titjob. \"Ready?\" Liz asked, wild eyed as she laid her aching penis and balls on her husband's feminine chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always.\" Eric replied, as he grabbed his boobs and smooshed them together... sandwiching his wife's cock. Liz let out a loud moan as she felt the fleshy orbs encompass her manhood. Then she started moving back and forth, her increasingly lubricated member effortlessly sliding in between her husband's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of her aroused state, it didn't take long for Liz to cum, and she squealed as she felt her balls tense up... then her penis erupted with a thick white rope of semen that shot up onto both the pillows and Eric's face. The feeling Liz felt at that moment... transcended any other in her life up to that point. Her eyes momentarily rolled up into her head and her open mouth emitted a long gasp of relief followed by a moan of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... you're really into it tonight babes.\" Eric grinned, his face spattered with his wife's jizz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz, somewhat out of breath now, just bit her lower lip and took hold of her husband's tits. \"You have no idea.\" She told him, as she then leaned forward and began sucking on his nipples. She couldn't help but notice the stretch marks on Eric's new breasts that definitely identified them as her co-worker Nicola's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having his tits sucked for a while, Eric decided his cock needed to be brought into 'action' now. And so the couple changed positions and Liz took up position doggy style on the bed. They had done it this way before, but this time Liz didn't have her huge breasts swinging like pendulums beneath her. And this time, Liz had male genitalia dangling between her legs that put her husband's to shame. \"I've waited all day for this.\" Eric informed his wife, before parting her ass cheeks and roughly inserting his penis into her anus. Liz moaned again, but also winced as she felt her sphincter dilate to accomodate her husband's man-meat. Her own cock twitched and started hardening again as Eric rammed her repeatedly from behind. <i>Oh... my... fucking.... GOD!!</i> Was all Liz could think as she was fucked in the ass. This was the most amazing day ever. And tomorrow proved to be equally 'entertaining', thanks to her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eric was finished ejaculating into Liz's ass, he then took his turn. And his anus had to really open wide to take in the length of Liz's impressive schlong. Full of renewed vigor, Liz actually giggled as she pounded her husband in his ass with Aaron's cock. Eric whimpered and moaned as his tits jiggled beneath him. Her whole body shuddered and the increasingly warm air of the bedroom caressed her hairy chest as she rapidly approached another orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shooting her second load of the night, Liz groaned and collapsed on the cum-stained bed beside her spent husband. Because of his age, Eric could only last so long, which was fine with Liz, since she had other things to think about too. Namely, just what her course of action was going to be tomorrow at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric fell asleep (as he usually did) in the afterglow, Liz's mind continued ticking over as she stroked the deflating member between her legs and gently teased her balls. With her other hand, she pulled at the hair on her chest, massaging her pectorals while grinning. She definitely liked having Luke's chest, she'd made a good choice for the night. But having Aaron's penis... WOW! Definitely the right choice for fornicating with her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz finally drifted off to sleep while feeling herself up, looking forward to the next morning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The absence of any breasts on her now hairy chest and the stirring of her crotch reminded her of the events of last night. As if she needed to be reminded, what with the room and bed sheets smelling of jizz, most of it hers. As she experienced her first ever 'morning wood', Liz turned her head and glanced over at Eric, who was laid on his stomach, snoring away. The breasts she had swapped onto him yesterday were unfortunately squished beneath his body, out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, hun?\" Liz cooed to her sleeping husband, as she rolled onto her side. Her erection poked Eric in the side as she shuffled closer to him, and this eventually made Eric wake up. \"Are you hard too?\" Liz giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I no doubt will be soon.\" Eric mumbled, his voice partly muffled by his pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz leaned in and kissed her husband on the lips, and he then rolled over onto his back. Liz's eyes grew wide in excitement as she once again clapped eyes on the  breasts on her husband's chest, she'd so loved having a titjob from him last night. Eric closed his eyes again, slowly drifting back to sleep, and that's when Liz got an idea. She lifted the sheets and peered down at not only her own erect member, but also her husband's semi-erect shaft. Picturing Nicola in her head, Liz decided to give Eric a matching set, and she gasped in delight as she watched her husband's 48-year old manhood and testicles shrink away... morphing into Nicola's 'well-worn' pussy, complete with the stretch marks it had gained from birthing eight kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, Liz licked her lips and moved even closer to Eric. She pressed her cock against him and then slipped one of her hands down to probe the outlines of his womanhood. Eric woke again... and moaned as his wife started fingering his slit. He really enjoyed it when Liz rubbed his clitoris. \"This is how you want waking up in the morning isn't it honey?\" Liz whispered, grinning as she let her fingers work their magic on her husband's snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing led to another, and Liz was soon under the sheets eating her husband out. Thanks to his wife's expert oral skills, Eric soon climaxed and experienced a mind-blowing orgasm. After that, he thought it only right that he return the favor. And soon Eric was under the sheets sucking Liz's cock and making her moan like a whore. Flashbacks to last night occurred as Liz felt her penis erupt again... spraying a healthy deposit of cum down her husband's throat. <i>Oh...FUCK...</i> Liz thought, writhing a little and rolling her eyes. She certainly had no regrets about swapping her pussy out yesterday. This was so much more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had finished giving each other oral sex, both Liz and Eric got out of bed and stripped the sheets off to wash them. They then got dressed, with Liz slipping into a clean Wilko shirt and black slacks, then she put her sensible black shoes on and tied the laces before having breakfast with her loving husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, it was time for her to leave for work. \"See you later hun.\" She called out to Eric, deciding to leave him in his swapped state for now after all the fun they'd had overnight and this morning. Liz was all smiles as she approached her car, her purse slung over her shoulder. She got behind the steering wheel, fastened her seatbelt and then gave her cock another rub before setting off for work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she walked throughout the store, she rubbed her hands together as she searched for a new way to test her abilities. She had swapped the eyes of Shaun and Jade, which caused Shaun to remove his glasses because he could actually see, and made Jade squint just so she could read item labels in the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way through the store, making minor changes to customers and employees alike, when she stumbled onto a new challenge. Liz had made her water into the maternity aisle, and seen a very pregnant customer going through baby clothes with her daughter. Liz stopped in her tracks, and a nearly-wicked smile appeared on her face. \"What a great way to test my abilities\" Liz thought to herself\". She planned on swapping her uterus with that of the customer. She hadn't yet experienced the miracle of pregnancy, and seen this as her gold ticket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz closed her eyes, and envisioned the swap, and then opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing had happened. Liz frowned, \"What the hell? That definitely should've worked!\". Liz looked over at the customer, and saw that she was very much still pregnant. Suddenly, Liz could see that her stomach was going down, almost as if it were deflating. The woman's belly became less round, her pants were less tight, and her breasts weren't as full as they had been. Liz smiled gleefully, \"It worked! I can't believe I actually did it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's joy was short lived, however, as she immediately felt the rush of gaining a new life inside of her body. She became somewhat nauseous, so she sat down at a fitting room bench near the maternity aisle. Liz watched as her stomach ballooned outward, stretching her Wilko polo and showing some underbelly. She felt her breasts churn, as they filled with milk, and strained against her bra. She was easily a J or K-cup by the looks of it. The rest of the baby fat ensued, as she felt her pants get tighter in the thigh and ass areas. Her feet became swollen in her shoes, due to the extra weight that she had not put on. She stood up, and wobbled a bit, because she wasn't used to being pregnant and the unbalance that comes with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz walked into the fitting room and looked at herself in the mirror, and decided:</span></span></div></div>",

She looked at Kiran at first as she climbed a ladder to stock one of the top shelves on her aisle, but she shifted her focus when Jessica sashayed back onto the aisle, her high heeled ankle boots clicking on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Laura, who was pretty girly herself, considered Jessica to be 'prissy'. She walked like a catwalk model near enough, and definitely liked to emphasize her cute butt. And just like she thought Aaron needed to be feminized a little, Lara thought Jessica could do with being a tad more masculine. Bring both closer to 'the middle line' so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince neither would be aware, Laura went ahead and aimed the remote at her two unsuspecting co-workers. <i><span class=\"cred\">Zaaap!!!</span></i> A bright red colored beam was emitted from the remote... enveloping both targets as Laura focused on what to swap. Jessica kept changing some scan labels on the shelves, even as her perky breasts deflated under her top, leaving her with Aaron's flat, muscular chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversely, Aaron stood up straight after emptying a cage... as Jessica's boobs sprouted on his chest, pushing out his Wilko shirt. Laura giggled to herself at the sight, before firing again and swapped Jessica's bra over to Aaron too, to provide support for his 'girls'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Jessica humming a tune to herself gave Laura another idea. <span class=\"cred\"><i>Zaaap!!!</i></span> Jessica's voice gradually dropped several octaves until she had Aaron's deep voice. Simultaneously, Aaron's Adams Apple diminished and his vocal cords altered so that he had Jessica's feminine pitch. <i>That's awesome!</i> Laura grinned, nodding in contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tempted to also give Jessica Aaron's genitals, but she refrained for now, thinking she'd done enough. She moved on to find some other 'victims' elsewhere in the store.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Could this have been an effect of the swap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped herself lightly on the face, bringing herself back to her senses. \"Anyways, I'll see you later.\" She said as she glided down the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um...yeah.\" Rebekah muttered. For a second there, she wanted Laura to stop. To do the one swap that she most yearned for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebekah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah gasped and spun around and came face to face with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hi Liz I... um...\" She quickly ran to one of the shelves. \"I'm just working! Yeah! Working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Rebekah, Laura quietly smirked to herself. She knew that look in Rebekah's eyes when Rebekah ogled her now masculine groin. Knowing Rebekah, Laura was quite sure that Rebekah wanted one of those badly but was just to shy to spit it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plan weaved inside Laura's head. Maybe there was a way she could give Rebekah what she wanted and make it look like an accident...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first thing she noticed was how much easier it was to lift the heavier boxes now that she had Aaron's muscular body. But a glance at her bicep would always... always lead to her staring down at the bulge in her ill-fitting trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a mostly male body was definitely an eye-opening experience. Laura couldn't believe how amazing it felt. She was reaching down every few seconds to rub her erection through her pants. She couldn't wait to whip it out later and really play with it. She'd always wondered how big Aaron was, and judging from the size of the protrusion.. .he was a decent size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I just know we're gonna have some fun with this thing.\" Laura said, patting her remote in her pocket. And she remained determined to get Rebekah what she most secretly wanted. Her very own dick. But all in good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\nRebekah meanwhile was deep in thought as she resumed working on her section. She was also berating herself for not having outright asked Laura to swap her vagina out and give her a dick in exchange. Maybe it was because Rob had been there. <i>Chicken.</i> Rebekah grumbled, shaking her head as she haphazardly threw items on the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Rebekah did love having Becca's backside. It was so much bigger than her own, and was sure to get some admiring stares of admiration and jealousy, including from her many co-workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky, can you be more careful with the stock please. Don't throw it around.\" Liz's voice again sounded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Liz, won't happen again.\" Rebekah smiled, letting out a sigh as she turned to look at her supervisor. Rebekah should have known by now that Liz was liable to pop up anywhere... and at any time. Of course, maybe that just meant Liz was exceptionally good at her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah was more dutiful from that point on, as Liz continued observing from afar while checking on other staff.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Out of amusement more than curiosity, probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after conjuring a veritable storm of euphemism down on Steven, almost all of which had to do with his new vagina or inserting something in said vagina, he was feeling somewhat giddy with amusement. The way the conversation came off, it sounded as if Steven were in very deep denial about the whole \"vagina=woman\" and \"penis=man\" argument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob spun around and came face to face with-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!

You can have it.\" Rob kicked it towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" She hoisted it up, wobbling a bit under the weight. Sadly, as much of a hopeless romanticist Kiran was and just how adept she was at spotting the red string between people, she was hopeless when it came to deciphering who looked at her in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob watched the girl of his dreams waddle away.

It's warmer in there you know.\" Kiran mumbled, shivering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't something we want everyone to hear.\" Laura informed Kiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, it's hush hush.\" she said, bringing a finger to her lips. Kiran's curiosity peaked even further at this point, she had to know why all the secrecy..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Kiran asked, looking up into the faces of the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You notice anything strange about me?\" Rob suddenly asked Kiran, causing her to look him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or me?\" Laura smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't leave me out!\" Rebekah almost whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran chuckled a little as she looked each of them over in turn. \"No, you all seem normal enough to me.\" she muttered. Everything did look as it usually did, from Rebekah's 'generous' backside... to Laura's impressive physique (and distinct bulge) to Rob's feminine curves. To Kiran, it wasn't Rob's fault that he had an hourglass figure, no more than it was Laura's fault that she had a penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where you're wrong.\" Laura laughed a little. \"From my neck down... this is Aaron's body. Don't you think it's weird that Aaron has boobs and a vagina? she said to a perplexed Kiran. Rob and Rebekah then also weighed in and informed Kiran of their own swaps with Natalie and Becca respectively. \"I think you'll only become aware of our changes once you've seen a swap actually happen or if you've been swapped yourself.\" Laura then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to swap me?\" Kiran frowned, as the minutes of the break ticked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll love it, believe me. And it's totally reversible, I promise.\" Rob reassured his 'crush'. He couldn't believe how wet his pussy was as he imagined doing all kinds of naughty things with the petite girl stood in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... okay, guess I'll go along with it. But - what can I have swapped?\" Kiran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing's first, let's get into the tea room before break ends. We can do the swap there once you've picked who you want me to swap you with.\" Laura suggested to her friends. They all agreed, and shuffled out of the cold locker room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she was walking she noticed an old shop, she couldn't make out the name.  Walking closer she noticed the name, '<i><b>Ithwarda's Magic Shoppe</b></i>'. \"I wonder what will be in there, I've never noticed this shop before and it looks kind of old too.\"  Jade said as she walked closer to the door.  It looked to be straight out of the middle ages with wrought iron worked into the wood for reinforcement.  It took all of Jade's strength to push it open.  As she stepped inside, she noticed the unmistakable odor of old books, the kind of odor one would find in a library or bookstore.  She browsed around the little shop which looked a lot bigger on the inside than it did on the outside, for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you Miss?\"  came a voice from behind some of the books.  Jade made her way around the pile of books to see an old lady with her hair as white as newly fallen snow, but somewhat disheveled with some bits of hay and twigs intertwined within it, as if she was awoken from a long slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was walking and I got lost, but I guess I will be having a look look around.\"  Jade replied back to her with a kind and courteous manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.\"  The old lady said as she lit an old pipe filled with fragrant tobacco.  \"You can't find this place if you know what you're looking for.\"  She started to take several puffs from her pipe as she talked in her mysterious manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\"  Jade replied back with a perplexed look upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying that you have to be lost to find exactly what you're looking for, my child.\"  She answered back still with mouth still attached to her pipe. \"I think I have several items that will peak your interest.  If you would like to have a seat over there while I get them for you.\"  She said as she pointed to a chair with jars of organs and piles of human bones resting upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, but I will just wander around your shop if that is okay with you?\"  Jade replied back with a small look of disgust on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.  Just don't touch anything.\"  She said as she waved her pipe around as if she was trying to make a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade browsed around the shop making sure not to touch anything.  She found many strange and mysterious items. The was a skull shaped pendant which appeared to be made of Jade, several scrolls with some runic symbols, and a coin with a face on it.  \"This stuff is weird, but I think the skull looks pretty much my style.\"  She chuckled as she heard the old lady returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go.\"  The old lady said with a grunt as she sat back down.  \"I am getting too old for this.  Anyway this is what I have to offer you.  First, we have an incantation that will swap the genitals of multiple people in a setting.  Secondly we have this toy train that will make any body feel and look younger by playing with it.  Lastly we have a coin that will allow you to swap personalities around between two people.

That particular incantation is very old. You should have seen the fun a nobleman once had with it in Paris... oh forgive me, I'm rambling now.\" The old woman stopped herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nobleman?</i> Jade thought. <i>This old biddy is certifiable.</i> \"And won't people freak out when this happens to them?\" Jade asked out loud, deciding to play along for the time being. \"I mean... will the other people be aware of the swaps like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will have to find that out yourself my dear.\" The old woman's smirk was almost 'mischievous'. \"Now run along, I'm afraid I need to have my afternoon nap.\" she told Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... okay, but if this doesn't work, I'm coming back here.\" Jade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she stepped out of the quaint little shop and into the cold January air. She gazed down at the piece of parchment in her hand and bit her bottom llip, she had to wonder if the incantation would even work or not. Glancing back at the shop she had just stepped out from, Jade did a double-take. \"What the hell...\" she gasped, seeing the shop had gone, replaced by an empty building with whitewashed windows. Jade had to wonder if she was tripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the old bat was telling the truth.\" Jade mumbled, glancing at the parchment in her hand again.  She then glanced at her watch and zipped her coat further up to keep the cold out as much as she could. She set off on a slow walk towards Wilko, her place of work. She started her shift there in an hour and she had to wonder... whether that was the perfect place to test out her new incantation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She really didn't want to try it on the way to work, only because she didn't know if anyone had any diseases that she wouldn't really want.  \"I will try it out when I get to work.\"  She said to herself as she rounded the corner and soon found herself in front of the Wilko storefront.  \"Now lets see if we can have an interesting night.\"  She said with a chuckle as she made her way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Jade.\"  Steven said addressing her as he saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Steven.  You having a good day so far?\"  Jade wondered as they made their way up to the tea room so that they could settle down and get ready for their shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the normal.\"  Steven announced as followed Jade.  \"How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, same.\"  Jade lied as they made their way into the tea room and they went their separate ways.  Jade went over to the window as if she was going to look out of it while they waited for their shift to start.  But in all actuality, She was going to scout out the tea toom for potential test subjects to see if it would work.  Soon she found her first person. 'Sorry Steven, but you are going to be the first person.'  She thought to herself as she searched for another person to pair him up with.  She looked around and saw Natalie walk through the door. 'Sorry Natalie, but this probably won't hurt.'  Jade thought about the 2 individuals as she said the incantation \"Temere genitalibus commutationum\"  As she was saying the words, it sounded as if she was speaking in a tunnel and heard a slight reverberation of her voice.  Glancing back over to Natalie, Jade noticed a slight bulge in her pants and knew that it was Steven's member in her trousers.  \"I think tonight is going to be interesting\"  She said to herself as she noticed the new guy Josh walking in to start his shift too.  She then looked around to see _______ and said the incantation once more.</span></div></div>",

Jade glanced at the bulge in Natalie's trousers and smirked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nats.\" Jade managed to respond, without laughing too much. Then she focused on Josh who was about to sit down. Luckily, Phoebe was stood sending a text message on her phone. <i>\"Temere genitalibus commutationum\"</i> Jade whispered loudly, just to nobody could hear her. Again there was the slight reverberation in her voice, even when whispering, and the lights flickered briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incantation once again worked like a charm, and Jade watched in fascination as Phoebe's black jeans bulged out slightly. Somehow, Phoebe remained oblivious as her vagina was replaced with Josh's 'equipment'. <i>This is so awesome</i> Jade thought as she shook her head in amazement. Phoebe finished sending her tet message and then pulled up a chair to sit down. She winced slightly and reached down to 'adjust' herself as her backside hit the chair. Natalie did thr same thing when she sat down next to Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's two down</i> Jade smiled mischievously. She already had it in her head to emasculate ALL the guys she worked with, just for giggles. With Natalie's pussy now between Steven's legs and Phoebe's between Josh's, Jade had to decide who to swap the other guys with, and when. She decided there was no mad rush, since she had all shift to do it. But there was the urge inside her that wanted more fun at her co-workers' expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you smirking at?\" Steven suddenly asked Jade, when he saw the silly grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. Just thinking about random stuff...\" Jade shrugged, glancing over at Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes ticked by, and more staff members arrived for work, taking their place in the tea room. Jade kept to herself, smiling the whole time. \"Oh well, better have a pee before we start work.\" Natalie sighed, getting to her feet. As Natalie headed out of the tea room, everyone else began getting to their feet too, since none of them wanted to be late downstairs for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was the last one on the shop floor, and she took a cursory look around. Elizabeth, her boss, (dressed in her usual red blouse, black skirt suit and high heels) was stood behind the help desk doing something on the computer. And Jade could hear Liz's voice, indicating the supervisor's presence in a nearby aisle. \"Oh well, better get to work I suppose.\" Jade mumbled, setting off walking again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But we can't decide who should be the one to carry it, me or her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade had to stifle a giggle. \"Really? Wow, that's not a problem most couples have.\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Josh nodded, \"but our circumstances are unique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They certainly are.</i> Jade thought with an inward chuckle, as she glanced down at Josh's groin. She knew that underneath his trousers... was the vagina of a 20-year old girl. Jade was thoroughly enjoying her little purchase. Best \u00a310 she'd ever spent. She decided to head back to her section before Liz caught her. \"Well, thanks for the chat, we'll have to talk some more later maybe.\" she smiled, nodding at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.

It's this weird coin I bought earlier. I'll show you, but first I need to do some shopping. I just picked up my paycheck, and I need some new clothes. The ones I have are way too drab; I need something fabulous! I don't know why I've never treated myself like this before. I totes deserve it. Meet me after work, and I'll show you.

Without this inflow of cash he'd be out on the streets in no time. \"Look, Elizabeth, I understand.\" Her eyes opened wide. Not once since Luke was hired did he ever sincerely seem regretful for his actions. It was almost enough for her to let this incident slip by. \"Please trust me that by tomorrow I will work twice as fast. Promise.\" Luke crossed a hand over his heart and held his other hand up to signify his serious attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"If you're so sure, then fine. But anymore issues from you and I'll put you on suspension!\" Elizabeth stated flatly to Luke.

A bright light shot out of the device and struck the spot Luke was aiming at. Suddenly, a fully clothed copy of Luke appeared Terminator style (minus from the damage and fire). \"Holy crap!

Blake, where'd you go?\" Luke almost blew a fuse when he remember he had set that clone to only 45 seconds. He breathed a sigh of relief and put a hand over his rapidly beating heart. \"That freaking scared me. Gotta get used to that.\" Luke went back to reading the instructions, surprised to find he was on the last page already.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was like any other normal day at Wilkos. Well, if you count body-swapping as a 'normal day'. Rob just got done head-swapping his neighbors Jet and Deanne Wilson. That's right, head swapping. You heard correctly. Early this morning, Rob was cleaning out his attic before work as his mother instructed him to do. He found a small cupboard in an old desk mirror and inside was a remote and a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEARLIER....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Whom It May Concern, Before you is a device unlike anything you can dream up or imagine. This device has the power to swap traits. Heads, limbs, parts of the body. It even has the power to change the very essence of reality itself. I have hidden the remote away where I believe no one will find it. However, if you are reading this, it means you have stumbled across it. This may read like a note, but I promise you, this is a warning. Although you are the one to control the swaps with the remote, it has a mind of its own. It can cause unimaginable chaos and destruction, turmoil and ruin. I implore you to resist the power of this remote because once you get started, you will not stop. It is an addiction, and it can lead you out of control is a hurry. I say this from experience. If you don't think this is serious, let me put it for you this way. My mother now has the body of a dog, my sister has the penis of a middle-aged man, and my father has the vagina and breasts of a teenage girl. While they are unaware, the remote would not allow me to swap them back. It didn't want me to swap them back. It feeds off chaos. I tell you this also. The remote CANNOT be destroyed. I hope and pray that you do the right thing. Beware. Signed, A. M. P.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob, being the uncaring and irresponsible teenager he was, quickly disregarded the note and tested it out on his single mother. He was highly skeptical, but he decided to try out the head swap button on her. \"Go big or go home I guess\" Rob laughed. His 42-year-old mother was a portly woman with sagging C-cup breasts, wide blue eyes with blonde hair. He picked out the young postal worker who was just coming up to the house to deliver mail. He was handsome with green eyes, combed brown hair, and a very decent build. Plus, he was tall at 6' 3\". Rob fired the device and two white beams shot out and engulfed the two. Once this smoke dissipated, he saw a scene he will never forget. His mother was not only now wearing the postal worker's clothes, but she had his body! She scratched her new younger body on her male ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get my bag?\" asked the postal man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarb, Rob's mother, looked at the bag hanging on her muscular shoulder with a puzzled look. \"I'm not sure,\" as she handed the bag back over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries,\" he replied as he shoved one of the pieces of mail between his cleavage. \"I guess that's one way to hold onto your mail,\" Rob chuckled. He was not sure if he should swap the two back or not but eventually decided to leave them that way for many reasons. He mainly didn't care, he's the same mail man every day, and he figured it would be fun to observe them. His mom went upstairs to undress and take a shower. He followed her up there and looked through the crack of her bedroom door. He saw her drop her pants and take off her shirt, showing her hairy male body. She grabbed her penis and looked at herself in the mirror. Then, she went into the bathroom and turned on the shower to wash off. \"Gross,\" said Rob at just having seen another man's penis. \"But, still amazing that she doesn't even notice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob checked his watch and realized it was time to head out for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBACK TO THE PRESENT....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust finished with the Wilson's swapping, he continued on his way to work. He also swapped the genitals of a young woman in her 20s jogging with an old, fat cop on the sidewalk writing a parking ticket. The old, and suprisingly big penis stretched and pushed it's way into the woman's spandex shorts as the cop's pants deflated, being replaced by a tight and surprisingly virgin pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swapped the breasts of a 30-year-old mother onto her 12-year-old son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swapped the faces of a 40-year-old bearded dad and his 20-year-old daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swapped the heads of a large and plump black businesswoman in her 40s with a muscular college jock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swapped the bodies 70-year-old man with his 65-year-old wife (while they retained their identities.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swapped the lower halves of a young latina cheerleader in her teens with a 25-year-old nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe next swapped the heads of an old man and a 35-year-old full-figured woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, he swapped the genitals of a 20-year-old black man and a 40-year old woman walking with her husband and teenage son. He then swapped the husband's chest with a 15 year-old girl, getting her B-cup breasts while she got a hairy chest in return. And the 14-year-old son had his penis swapped out for the immature vagina of a nearby 8-year-old. The little girl tapped her penis as it went erect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused with himself, Rob thought ahead to swapping at work. He was looking forward to messing with many of the people from his work that he hated or despised. Not to mention Liz, who was always giving him shit for 'not doing his job'. Although that was true, Rob hated when people bossed him around. He was only a quarter of a mile away now, and his mind was racing with all the possibilities. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mainly because he was having a good day, so he didn't mind showing up a tad early. \"At least Liz can't bitch at me,\" he said, \"....speaking of which....\" He trailed off as he noticed Liz's husband had decided to drop her off today. She and him were over in one corner of the store talking and laughing with one another. It was still 15 minutes before work started, and they were making the most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make things interesting, shall we?\" Rob aimed the remote at the two as two white beams shot out once again. Liz's work polo deflated as her most prominent assets disappeared. Seconds later, her husband took a step back and arched his back as her H-cup tits erupted from his chest. Deciding against swapping her bra over, Rob watched the two as they looked bewildered but otherwise thought everything was normal. Liz, thinking no one was looking, leaned in and rubbed her husband's bulge with one hand and one of her former breasts with the other. It was clear Eric enjoyed it as his eyes rolled back in his head. She even pinched his erect nipple then slapped his butt before kissing him goodbye. He looked happy as he left the store, unknowingly, with his own wife's knockers. Liz looked strange in once sense because of how Rob was used to seeing her. But he thought the hairy flat chest of her husband suited her. After all, her big breasts were always a stark contrast from her petite stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was interrupted as his slacking buddy Liam came up to him. \"Hey man! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, dude. Not much. Not looking forward to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we ever?\" Said Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say,\" said Rob, wanting to test something,\" do you think Liz looks odd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam looked over. \"You mean besides her normal bossy nature? Nah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think it's weird she is a woman without breasts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,I guess I really never gave it much thought. But not really, no. I mean my neighbor is a woman without breasts. But her son has a decent pair of knockers. So it's not like it's THAT uncommon.\" Rob started laughing because the two people that Liam was referring to were the same ones he had swapped on his way to work. He couldn't believe how amazing and instanteous the reality change was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....I guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked Liam up and down and decided he wanted to mess with his friend. After all, that's what friends do. Rob looked around for the first woman he could find. He spotted Naomi who had just walked in while listening to her music with earbuds in. Rob aimed the remote at the two and pressed the button.<br>\r\nBoom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi's black skirt bulged impressively in front. \"I guess Liam was packing..\" Naomi's new 6\" cock snaked down her tights a bit under her skirt, the head was outlined underneath. Liam's pants deflated, his dick being replaced by Naomi's Asian vagina... with full bush. She continued to listen to her iPod unaware. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know actually, you're super right.\" He continued. \"After all I mean, you're a guy with a vagina.\" Said Rob, wanting to see Liam's reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And proud of it!\" Liam beamed with pride. \"Some girls find it to be a nice suprise. I'm glad that's the way I was born.\" Liam further stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was starting to walk to the center aisle, which meant she was about to give out the duties for the day. He decided he could make one more quick swap. A head swap. He shot the remote at young Melissa and the older Shaun, who was helping her carry something to the stock room as Liz instructed her to do. He zapped the two and Melissa now stood 6 inches taller and atop Shaun's well built body. Shaun meanwhile had the petite body of Melissa with her perky young breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Shaun, I've got it!\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" He said, sweating from what would normally have been an easy job with his former body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" She smiled and thanked him and used his, well her, but muscles to carry the box to the back room. She didn't even know she had a middle-aged male body with a large dick. Neither did Shaun know he had a young woman's body with an off-the-charts sex drive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I need to get back into shape....and build some muscle!\" He tried to flex his skinny arm and gave up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention everyone!\"  Liz called....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Right, pay attention everyone, so I don't have to repeat myself.\" Liz addressed her staff, her eyes lastly settling on Liam as he idly scratched his vagina through the fabric of his trousers. Liz also casually adjusted the strap of her bra, which now hung pathetically against her hairy chest, under her polo shirt, with nothing to fill the large cups anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening.\" Liam spoke up, knowing Liz's words were mainly directed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Liz sighed gently, her eyes briefly glancing over to Melissa, who was now taller than all the other girls in the store, even Charlotte. And Shaun, who was stood between Mark and Luke, looked tiny in comparison. Rob couldn't help but chuckle to himself at the sight. \"Shaun, I'm putting you to work with Josh today on the Seasonal aisle, so make sure you don't try to lift anything heavy. That's what Josh will be there for.\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Shaun nodded, sighing and feeling somewhat inadequate because of his delicate stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naomi, you can work with Natalie on Toiletries, and Rob - you're with Jessica today on the pet food section.\" Liz went on to hand out more assignments, including Rob's. He smiled as he looked over at Jessica, who didn't return the look her gave her. Jessica could be like that, tending to keep to herself unless she had something to say to someone. But she was still friendly. As Liz was focused on handing out other assignments, Rob took another cursory look around, and his eyes settled on Josh, who of course was Shaun's work buddy for the day. <i>What can we do with you?</i> Rob thought, rubbing his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching sight of Mona, stood by the side of Laura, Rob smirked. <i>Maybe a new hairstyle?</i> Rob managed to nonchalantly lift the remote and fire off a blast aimed at Josh and Mona. The beams struck the intended targets and Mona's wavy black hair was sucked up into her scalp as it formed into Josh's haircut, lightening in shade as it did so. Josh's hair conversely cascaded down around his shoulders as he gained Mona's Persian black style. Rob thought Mona now looked somewhat like a pretty lesbian with Josh's short hair, which amused him. And Josh... well he looked like something out of an 80's metal band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob glanced back over at his flat-chested supervisor as she neared handing out the last assignments, and he figured he had time for one more swap. This time he picked out Helen and decided to give her a height boost. Mark was the unfortunate (and unaware) donor this time, and Helen shot up 6 inches in height after being zapped by the remote... while Mark shrank to her former height of 5'7\". Amazingly, their work pants altered to fit their new size. <i>Awesome!</i> Rob grinned, as his eyes went wide in giddyness. He had to admit, Helen looked good standing at 6'1\" tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lastly, Liam... you're with Nicola tonight, so she can keep an eye on you. You're both working the Housewares section.\" Liz suddenly announced, handing out the last assignment to the emasculated Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Liam groaned, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry luv, we'll have fun I'm sure.\" Nicola, who was also unimpressed, muttered sarcastically. Nicola had noticed that lately, Liz put Liam to work with either her, Waggy or Helen, because they were the older, more responsible workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's all, you can all start work.\" Liz then told everyone, clapping her hands a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was the last to leave the help desk, and he caught a glimpse of Elizabeth just walking through the door from upstairs onto the shop floor to check how things were going. Having patience, Rob decided to exercise them. He knew he'd get to everyone in time with his nifty remote. And some people would undoubtedly be swapped multiple times, he knew as he walked with Jessica to their section.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rob turned his attention back to Liz, who had finished giving out duties for the day and was about to head upstairs with Elizabeth to update her on the events of the day. She looked out of the ordinary, to say the least, having a hairy flat chest that belonged to her much older husband.  Rob considered the possibility of making their relationship that much more interesting. But, he needed to find an adequate target for her. He knew a couple of the guys in the store were fairly well-built, including Shaun (now Melissa, I guess) and Aaron as well. He decided he could make things interesting in two ways. Using the remote again, Rob decided to swap Shaun's (Melissa's) middle-aged penis over to his supervisor. Liz's knickers began to distort as Shaun's cock sprouted between her feminine smooth legs. Meanwhile, Melissa's pants deflated as Liz's pussy was now nestled between her meaty male thighs. Melissa now had Shaun's well-built body and Liz's pussy. It was truly a hilarious sight to behold. Rob now had made Liz a penis-packing woman. He wondered who now wore the pants in the relationship. Sure, Liz's hubby still had a penis, but he also had a large female bust on his new chest. Either way, the two would be screwing each other up the ass from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Rob saw Becca's large ass swaying from side to side as she was heading toward the stock room. Her beautiful ass soon deflated to be replaced by Aaron's muscular butt. Rob had to admit, Aaron's ass fit pretty well on Becca. But, he laughed at how Aaron now had a heart-shaped feminine ass distending his work pants. Not only that, he also received her asshole from this swap. Aaron let out a girly fart as he began work causing Waggy to slap him on the shoulder. \"Aaron, that's disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" he laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay goodbye to that, referring to Aaron's personality as it was soon switched with Waggy's. Now, Waggy let out a nasty fart as Aaron berated her for it. \"Ewww, that's gross,\" which sounded weird coming from his masculine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, man. Deal with it.\" said Waggy. Next, Rob thought the situation needed a little more. \"She should have something to match that manly personality... how about a dick?\" Rob fired the remote at Waggy and her vagina sealed up as two large testicles popped out followed by a long penis that snaked its way into her trousers. The head of her penis was clearly visible. Aaron, now emasculated, adjusted his pants and tightened his belt a bit, further accentuating his large butt and lack of a penis. He now had Waggy's stretch-marked pussy between his masculine legs. He began to walk in a ladylike manner as Waggy scratched her junk and told Liz she had to go 'drop a deuce' before she began working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, it's great to be powerful.\" said Rob, who caught up in his swapping, didn't see an unhappy Liz gunning for him. She already noticed him slacking and was disappointed.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luckily, the remote gave him a way out, and Liam just happened to be in sight. Zapping his supervisor again, this time Rob swapped her work ethic with Liam, basically turning her into the worst supervisor ever. Liz instantly lost interest in berating Rob, idly scratched her cock through her slacks and then walked off, barely picking her feet up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the best device EVER!\" Rob kissed the remote in his hand, grinning incessantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, when Liam got onto his section with Nicola, the older woman was surprised to actually see doing some work. In fact, he seemed to be much more interested in his job too, as though... he had a whole new attitude towards work. If only Nicola knew the truth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was safe from Liz's wrath, Rob could have fun to his heart's content. And two more of his co-workers, Suki and Mark soon fell under his eager eye. Mark had already been reduced in height, and now Rob targeted him again. Mark's muscles, which weren't as impressive as Aaron's or Shaun's (Melissa's), suddenly diminished as they were transferred to the usually skinny Suki. The Indian girl's clothes filled out a little as Mark's muscles were transferred to her. <i>And let's try... this as well...</i> Rob smirked, zapping the pair again and swapping their ethnicities. Mark became an Indian man, and Suki became a young white woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing can do ANYTHING!\" Rob gasped, surprised at just what the remote was capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing two customers, a man in his early 40's and his 15-year old daughter, Rob quickly zapped them and gave the teen girl the same treatment he'd just dished out to Liz and Waggy. The girl's short skirt tented in front as her father's schlong emerged between her legs... causing he to slightly change her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob wasted no time in moving on to more customers in the vicinity. A 30-year old woman lost her perky C-cup breasts, which sprouted moments later from the chest of a 9-year old boy walking with his mother. The boy then received more swaps as Rob zapped him a couple more times. The boy received his mother's vagina, which took up residence between his skinny legs, but then that became moot when Rob swapped the boy's head onto his mother's shoulders and vice-versa. This meant his mother still had her own vagina and another woman's breasts, but everything else from the neck down used to be her young son's. Meanwhile, the young boy, with his head now on his mother's feminine, adult form, had his own small penis back and he had his mother's tits to play with too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProud of himself, Rob moved on to have some more fun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He swapped the heads of the two as Steven just finished ringing out the mop. Rob also decided to try something new and swapped roles between the two. Steven, now on Caroline's slightly older body, wiped the dust off his breasts and his work pants. \"Alright now, Caroline.\" Once you're finished with this, I need you to get back to stocking shelves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was now the assistant supervisor at Wilkos. Caroline, on Steven's tall male body, responded. \"Sure thing, Steven.\" She adjusted the balls in her pants which were being suffocated by her briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Steven said. \"Now, I'm going to go check in with Liz on yours and others' progress in the store. I'll see you at break in the tearoom.\" Steven said in a respectful, authoritative tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven turned, adjusted his bra strap and headed to find Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about something for you husband-to-be to play with?\" Rob said, referring to Natalie. He realized the impressive Luke had not been swapped yet and quickly exchanged the groins of the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's trousers inflated in front as two large testicles popped into her new sack and a long 9\" penis extended down her pant leg. Meanwhile, Luke had his pants deflate in front as his penis morphed into Natalie's beautiful vagina. Luke's girlfriend would have to enjoy eating him out while Natalie's fiance Mike was gonna have a field day sucking his future wife's dick from now on. Just for fun, Rob also swapped Natalie's beautiful locks of hair with Luke's crew cut. Then Rob swapped their voices as well, and an Adam's apple bulged out of Natalie's throat. Now, The manly looking Natalie adjusted herself, as people usually seemed to do after a swap, and cleared her throat in a deep bass as she attempted to spike up her hair in front a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke shook his long hair out of his face as his new pussy was being rubbed between his muscular thighs. He hummed a popular song in his new high-pitched tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob decided to involve a customer for a moment, mainly because there were no unswapped co-workers left in sight. He saw a husband and wife in their 40s arguing and decided a lower half swap would be adequate. The man, not much taller than his wife, shrank a few inches as his lower half turned into the shapely legs and ass of his wife. He also got her stretch-marked pussy that had given birth to their 3 children, though Rob did not know this piece of information. The wife looked down at her top and down and accidentally caught a glimpse of her cleavage which caused her penis to immediately begin tenting in her pants. She reached her dainty little hand down her pants between her hairy thighs to relieve the pressure. \"Haha, they may be arguing now but I'm sure she'll be giving her husband a good pounding in bed tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he watched Steven walking away from him, his new feminine ass swaying in Caroline's former slacks, Rob's dick hardened still further. And that was when he realized he hadn't swapped himself in any way yet, which seemed a waste really. Here he was jumbling up his co-workers' body parts and he wasn't involving himself in the fun. He knew that would have to change, and ASAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first female trait Rob wanted to try out was a pair of tits, as all he could think of at that moment was Liz's husband carrying his wife's 'melons' around on his chest thanks to Rob and his remote. But whose did Rob want to \"borrow\"? He started browsing the 'goods' as he walked the aisles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to pick out a nice pair of breasts for himself, Rob had fun with another couple of his co-workers too. Josh, who had Mona's hair, was working alongside Shaun, whose almost bald head was still sat atop Melissa's sexy, young body. Rob decided to give Shaun a penis again, since he was feeling generous/kinky, and one quick zap of the remote caused Josh's manhood to shrink in his pants, replaced by a feminine slit with dark pubic hair. Shaun's women's cut slacks meanwhile pushed out in front with Josh's 7-inch dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that up with another swap, Rob grinned and zapped them both again. This time the perky B-cup tits in Shaun's new polo shirt (with Melissa's name badge attached) deflated into nothing, only to sprout from Josh's chest moments later... distending his shirt. Josh now had Mona's feminine hair, and Melissa's tits and pussy on his otherwise manly frame. Whereas Shaun was now a man again... technically, albeit with a feminized body from the neck down (except his groin and chest of course). Rob's cock was about ready to rip through his boxers and his trousers at this point, and he expedited his search for a pair of tits for himself to 'try on' for size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, he decided on a customer, a fetching raven-haired beauty in her late 20's wearing a black halter dress and high heels pumps. To Rob, she seemed a little overdressed for a shopping trip, but he wasn't complaining. For she had a nice juicy pair of D-cups filling the top of that sexy dress. At least she did... until Rob siphoned them off. The woman continued reading the back of a box of hair dye even as her boobs melted away, forming into Rob's flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here they come!\" Rob grinned, breathing heavily as his hands shot up up his chest...to feel his flesh expanding into the woman's impressive knockers. As they expanded under his hands, Rob nearly creamed his pants right there. He was so turned on it was unreal. Once his new tits had finished growing, Rob gave them a firm squeeze and jiggled them about, deciding against swapping the woman's bra to him too. Liz happened to walk by, but with Liam's work ethic now working against her, she didn't seem too concerned about one of her staff feeling himself up on the shop floor. The sight of Rob playing with his boobs though did give Liz a hard-on, which amused him no end.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's not until much later that he discovered what exactly he had found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is lunch time and Steven is taking his usual break along with a few of his colleagues.

Across from them Suki is chatting with Becca or rather Becca is talking the Indian girl's ear off on the subject of her latest crush. Steven gives Suki a sympathetic look and sits opposite Elizabeth, the store's acting manager. She is pecking at a salad with a pile of paperwork spread out in front of her.

So she skims over them but the intention seems clear enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s like a truth or dare thing.

Then again being taller would be super useful, she could swap her height with one of the guys.

She tugs at her close fitting work trousers and after a brief struggle with her buttons she pulls them down enough to reveal her standard issue M&amp;S cotton knickers barely containing a decidedly non standard bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no mistaking the outline of male genitalia stretching out the thin white fabric and Steven gawps at Elizabeth as she blushes and quickly covers herself.

His eyes go wide as he grabs at the crotch of his jeans finding an empty space where his manhood would normally be. Alarmed but not yet ready to accept the reality of his situation he pushes a hand inside his pants and under the waistband of his boxers. His fingers run over a smooth mound until they find a soft cleft. He takes his hand away as the delicate folds of his new pussy part under his touch. He can hardly believe his own senses but even without touching it he can feel his new anatomy, a strange new world of sensation nestled between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround him the others are making similar discoveries and reacting with varying degrees of surprise, alarm and curiosity. It takes everyone a few minutes to calm down enough to accept the fact that they have all switched genitals. After some discreet self examination and  awkward conversations about things none of them ever expected to discuss (size, shape, personal grooming habits, etc.) They are able to work out who has swapped what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven learns that he now has Becca\u2019s recently shaved vagina while Elizabeth has his normal 'equipment'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth\u2019s blonde bush and the pussy that goes with it has been transferred to Luke while his manhood has gone to Becca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki and Josh find that they have swapped privates also, meaning that all the guys are technically now girls and the girls are guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all agree that since the rules seem to suggest they can all go back to normal after the game is over the best thing to do is to play on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh picks up the spinner again and flicks the plastic arrow.

As he watches they expand into full breasts, not that big but well shaped and sagging slightly under their own weight.

To suddenly lose that was a terribly blow for her, perhaps even more distracting than the thick cock pressing against the inside of her skinny jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuki?\u201d Steven asks gently \u201cAre you okay love?

Fine lines appear around her eyes along with other almost imperceptible changes that combine to transform her from a pretty girl into a beautiful woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as dramatic as her physical changes is her change in attitude.

Suki\u2019s long black hair. Josh\u2019s broad manly chest. Josh\u2019s mouth voice and American accent</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.

She is always changing her hair color, but it was currently a blood-red color, slightly gothic in appearance, but not a lot.

Steven's plain cotton boxers. Josh's life and identity,  as far as the rest of the world is concerned she is and always has been Josh</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.

You liked the style of the era the house was built in so you didn't care how bad the condition of the house was in, at least at the time you didn't. There was a lot of work required in the old house and you were short on supplies luckily there was a cheap hardware store in the middle of town you could get some supplies at called Wilkos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way out of the door, you step on an old floorboard causing it to crack, and temporarily trap your ankle. You manage to wriggle your way free from the floor without causing any injury. You then sit down so you can inspect your ankle further, it's a little sore but other than that it's perfectly okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look into the hole that was the broken floor board, you spot something shimmering. You reach into the hole and pull out a small gemstone, but before you can inspect it properly, it melts away in your hand and seems to seep into your skin. You hope that it doesn't cause any issues but for now you aren't in pain and you suspect your brain was just playing tricks on you. So you ignore the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have an uneventful trip to Wilkos, you spot a girl acting as the greeter to the store and politely smile and nod at her. <i>Use your power on her</i>, a voice in your head tells you, but you just brush it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the power tools section, though you weren't sure which brand to get so you tried to get the closest employee you can find to help you, you spot a young man with long brown hair, tied up in a ponytail, looking disinterested.

You could even disassemble yourself, but the voice didn't tell you if you would be able to reassemble yourself or not if you did such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?\", Elizabeth notices you've drifted off and touches your shoulder, to get your attention. You feel a static shock and turn around just in time to watch her fingers fall off her hand. You see her stare in shock as her hand forearm and upper arm fell from her shoulder and dropped to the floor, before her second arm did the same thing in the opposite order, she was about to scream but soon her neck and head detached as well, no longer giving her access to her lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch, silently as her hair, falls off her head, like a wig. That same thing happens with her eye brows, making it look like they were glued on. Her eyes fall out of their sockets, which for some reason are replaced with smooth skin, with no indication she ever had eyes. Soon her nose and mouth also fall off leaving her with a blank face. Her ears also come off making her head look like some strange ornament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her body, it divides into three sections, the torso, belly and pelvis. And as she was falling apart you noticed her breasts were no longer attached either. Given that her mouth was gone you could only assume her privates were also removed. Finally Her legs fell apart in the same way as her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was now a pile of body parts, mixed in with her clothes. Unable to help yourself, you decided to inspect her, spotting further changes such as her nipples detaching from her breasts, and her belly button was also gone. You reach down into her pants and pull out her detached vagina. You then stick your finger further into it and it starts to vanish, making you assume it has formed a pocket dimension with all it's inner workings. For now you pocket her vagina, deciding that will be a part you'll keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look down at the rest of her body, and know someone will stumble upon this mess shortly so you....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You realize your legs are two different heights. Luckily, Elizabeth's heels were still on the floor. You grab one and place it on the foot of the shorter leg. This mostly evens you out, but it still feels weird. Your arms were also mixed up. You had one of your own and one of Elizabeth's. You clearly had her hair and breasts. You guessed that Suki thought she was putting together Elizabeth when she made you, as you were wearing her clothes. A tightness in your shoulders made you feel like those were probably your own. And the fact that her skirt didn't fit quite right made you thin you had your own hips as well -- though you certainly now had Elizabeth's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask Suki for a mirror. It was your facial structure, which made sense since your brain was in there, but you had two different colored eyes now -- one had makeup as well, the other didn't. You had Elizabeth's lips and nose, but your own ears. Suki had done a pretty good job of aligning things on the face. This was a bit of a relief, especially when he say Elizabeth come up next to him with all the body parts he didn't get.

It was the <i>TraitSwapApp</i>, and Becca's iphone was the only device which such an app. She had carried out a few tests at home on her own family, and had been amused by the results. Seeing her parents with their heads on each other's bodies particular tickled her. So much so that she left them that way for the night, only swapping them back before leaving for work today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here she was, sat around the table at Wilkos with her co-workers, who were unaware of the fact that the shop was now Becca's laboratory - and that they were all her 'guinea pigs'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there being silent, surrounded by her chatting friends, Becca brought up Rob's image on her phone, selecting him as her first 'subject'. <i>Hmm, what can we do first?</i> Becca asked herself. <i>His hair maybe....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca grinned in amusment as Rob's hair suddenly began growing. It lengthened to half way down his back and gained a silky black appearance. Kiran meanwhile, chatting with Melissa nearby, acquired Rob's short haircut. <i>Hmm, not bad, but maybe a different style would suit him better.</i> Becca thought, as she messed with the app some more. This time Rob's hair shortened a little and he became a 'carrot-top' as his hair morphed into Jessica's style. Becca smirked, thinking he looked better ginger. But she decided to try another style. A few clicks later and Rob sported Rebekah's long blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, definitely a blonde.\" Becca whispered, nodding in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around, Becca saw that Kiran still had Rob's hair, and now Jessica had Kiran's hair and Rebekah had Jessica's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling adventurous, Becca next highlighted Rob's chest. <i>This should be fun to watch</i>. she mused. She took a cursory look around and then clicked the appropriate buttons on her app. Rob's shirt suddenly ballooned outwards as a pair of D-cup breasts formed on his chest. Conversely, Helen's chest had deflated, leaving her completely flat chested. <i>Wow, they actually suit him</i>. Becca chuckled (on the inside). <i>But maybe a little smaller...</i> Rob's new tits quickly shrank to a C-cup, while a couple of seats over - Natalie's breasts pushed against her shirt as they grew larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's better.</i> Becca grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca's fun however was brought to an abrupt halt when Liz entered the tea room and clapped her hands. \"Okay guys, let's go, time to start work.\" The supervisor said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, suppose I can continue in a bit.\"  Becca told herself, getting to her feet. She chose not to reverse any of the swaps she had just made, since she knew she'd have plenty of time to 'put things right' later. Besides, her fun had only just begun. She slipped her phone into her fleece pocket and headed down to the shop floor to start work. Or at least... give the illusion of starting work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After having her fun with Rob, Becca had a kinky - and hilarious idea. What if she feminized all her male co-workers? They wouldn't be aware of anything as she swapped out their masculine traits and replaced them with feminine ones. Becca giggled to herself. And since her female co-workers outnumbered the male ones, she'd have plenty of traits to choose from. A little mix and match would suffice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca knew however that she would have to be careful not to get caught with her phone on the shop floor. Since it was a breach of company rules to have any sort of personal electrical device on your person during work hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering who to start with, Becca looked around to see if any of her male colleagues were in view. She'd made a good start upstairs giving Rebekah's hair and Natalie's breasts to Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo!\" Becca grinned, as Luke walked into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke had always annoyed Becca for some reason. The way he always tried to chat up any new girls that started. She thought that behavior was arrogant, thinking that any girl would find him irresistable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's see...</i> Becca mumbled, activating her app and pairing Luke up with a random female co-worker. She smirked when she saw Luke's hair morph into Suki's full head of black hair. Not stopping there, Becca made another swap, and Luke's shirt pushed out as Nicola's sizeable breasts sprouted on his chest. Becca snorted a little as she burst out laughing. Now on a roll, she decided one more swap was in order, before Luke disappeared off the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca ran through the list of people on her phone, then made her selection. <i>Doubt the girls will fancy him after this</i>. Becca thought with a smirk. The slight bulge in Luke's trousers deflated as he lost his manhood - gaining Helen's mature pussy in exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Luke had walked off oblivious to his changes, Becca went off to find Helen, as if to confirm the swap had worked for both. She found Helen working on her section, still flat-chested, and now she had an evident bulge in the front of her trousers. \"It suits her.\" Becca chuckled, quickly returning to her section. But she didn't stay for long, as she was eager to find her next 'victim'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she passed by Rob's aisle, she decided she may as well 'finish him off' while she was there. A few quick clicks later... and Rob's cock and balls had been replaced by Kiran's tight little snatch. Becca nodded in satisfaction once she saw the bulge in Kiran's waist-high trousers. This was fun!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam was her next target. The shop 'slacker' was moping around in his usual manner, working at his own, slow pace. \"Prick!\" Becca grumbled under her breath as she shook her head at Liam. She then had to duck behind some shelves when she saw Liz suddenly appear on Liam's section to try and get him moving quicker. This gave Becca her next idea. <i>Maybe if he had a reason to move slow....</i> she smirked, fiddling with her app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca then looked up and grinned as Liz's huge breasts deflated like two punctured tires, being replaced by a flat chest. But the best part was when Liam's shirt inflated drastically...being distended by Liz's huge tits. His new nipples were practically poking through the fabric of his shirt. <i>That'll fix him</i>. Becca laughed under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Can't have you keeping your dick though Liam.</i> Becca then said, selecting another 'donor' from her phone. Liam's cock immediately withered away, followed by his balls, and he gained Waggy's pussy, with it's blonde pubic hair. Waggy's trousers meanwhile bulged out with Liam's cock. To finish Liam off, Becca quickly swapped his scraggy brown ponytail with Helen's black, shoulder-length hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then did Becca move on to locate her next target, which turned out to be Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca had always got along well with Steven, she even liked him a little, but that didn't mean he was safe from her 'feminization plan'. <i>Far from it. Right, what can we do with you Steven?</i> Becca mused, as she went through the images on her phone. It didn't take her long to decide who to swap him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Steven lost was his shaved hair. Steven became a 'carrot-top' as Jessica's brilliant hair erupted from his scalp, forming into a ponytail (Rebekah now had Steven's hair). Becca smiled, then made the next swap immediately after. Waggy's breasts swelled under Steven's shirt - pushing it outwards, and Becca definitely approved. <i>Almost done</i>. Becca chuckled, tapping her phone a few more times. Steven's manhood rapidly shrank away, along with his balls, replaced by a feminine slit. Meanwhile, back on Liam's aisle, Liz's trousers tented out as Steven's cock and scrotum sprouted between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, multiple swaps later, Becca was feeling incredibly turned on. This is what spurred her on, to keep going. She soon located Aaron and set about emasculating him as well. This time she started from the bottom up. Aaron's 'pride and joy', his cock, was sucked up into his body as his genitals morphed into Rebekah's blonde snatch. Then he lost his manly pecs as Melissa's breasts grew on his chest. It took a moment for Becca to choose whose hair to give to Aaron, but eventually she made her choice. Aaron's short, black hair suddenly morphed into Nicola's long, dark brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Shaun wasn't working that week, Becca now knew she only had one guy left to swap, and that was Mark. The tallest individual in the shop, he unfotunately wasn't the brightest individual. Not that it mattered. She quickly went through the images again on her phone and made the same three swaps to Mark as she had with the others. Once Becca was done, Mark sported Laura's plaited hair, Mona's tits and Natalie's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Job well done!\" Becca congratulated herself, slipping her phone back in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back to her section, she bumped into Liz. \"Hi Liz.\" Becca chirped cheerfully, trying to hide her grin as she glanced down at the bulge in Liz's trousers. And without her big breasts as well, Liz definitely looked weird to Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... hi Becca.\" Liz responded. She wondered why she was so cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Liz knew....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time later, after getting most of her current task done, Becca found her mind wandering again. And after overhearing a conversation in which Kiran described how 'hard' her boyfriend got her last night, Becca set off towards a random aisle again. She soon wound up on Liam's aisle again, and she was surprised to see poor Liz was still trying to get him to work faster. <i>She's really wasting her time.</i> Becca thought, as she watched Liam slothing about. Everytime he bent over or ripped open a box, his huge tits jiggled under his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idle prick!\" Becca grumbled under her breath. She took her phone out again and brought up Kiran's image again. Becca knew exactly how to 'fix' Liam again. As if giving him Helen's hair, Liz's large breasts and Waggy's pussy wasn't enough. She smirked contently as Liam suddenly suffered a drastic height loss... dropping down to just under 5' tall. Kiran conversely had been boosted to 5' 8\", her trousers being too short for her legs now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And this...</i> Becca mused, making a few more taps on her phone. She watched Liam's backside swell larger... pushing against his trousers. Nicola's ass meanwhile had shrunk considerably. Becca did happen to know that <i>she</i> actually had the biggest ass in the shop, but she wasn't giving any of her traits to Liam. She'd much rather steal traits from her female co-workers and pass them onto Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam, you'll need some ladders to reach the top shelf. You should have brought some with you when you started work.\" Becca heard Liz berating Liam. \"And if I catch you standing on a tote box again, I'll send you to Elizabeth's office for a little chat on Health &amp; Safety.\" Liz grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Liz.\" Liam sighed, setting off walking Becca's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca decided it was time to move on, and so she ducked into another nearby aisle as Liam trudged past. \"Hi Becca.\" a familiar voice suddenly said, causing her to turn around. She saw a smiling Waggy standing there, waving at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca smiled back, then glanced down to see if she could notice any sign of a bulge in Waggy's trousers. After all, she had been the recipient of Liam's penis. Becca did feel slightly guilty about that one, since Waggy was always so cheerful and friendly. Of course Waggy now also lacked any breasts, since Becca had grafted them onto Steven's chest. But she didn't feel guilty about that one for some reason. They suited Steven better anyway, Becca thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Waggy asked, as she emptied a tote box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca sighed. \"Just wondering how the hell Liam got hired. He's crap at his job!\" she shared her frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaggy nodded in agreement. \"I know, he's pretty much useless. But... maybe Liz can give him a kick up the ass.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca's face then contorted into a smirk. \"And why the hell isn't he wearing a bra? You'd think he would given the size of his boobs.\" she said to Waggy, wondering what her response would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's too 'manly' to wear one.\" Waggy joked. \"The other lads aren't wearing one either though are they?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but they're nowhere near as big up top as Liam is.\" Becca replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaggy smiled again. \"Maybe I should offer my bra to one of the lads, I mean... I don't even know why I wear one.\" she mumbled. Waggy went on to explain how she used to wish she'd developed breasts when she was younger. But now she didn't mind so much. The reality altering power of her app amazed Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I'd better get back to my section before Liz scolds me.\" Becca said, bidding Waggy farewell for the time being. But before she left the aisle completely, she took her phone out again and gave Waggy another little 'gift'. <i>Going up...</i> Becca giggled, as Waggy grew in height to 6' tall, her trouser legs retreated up her legs a couple of inches as she received her growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff on his aisle meanwhile, Steven had shrunk to Waggy's height of 5' 5\", his trousers bunching up at his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca grinned to herself, then went back to her assigned section to finish her work before break was called.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz had soon given up on trying to get Liam to kick it up a gear, and instead she called break time over the tannoy. <i>Finally.</i> Becca sighed, quickly making her way upstairs after several of her co-workers. When she entered the ladies toilets, there was a peculiar sight indeed. Rebekah and Laura, both with short hair were stood checking their reflections in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the three toilet stalls were Kiran, Natalie and Waggy. Becca took a quick glance under the doors and saw that all three of them were stood up to piss, no doubt aiming their dicks with precision. Becca heard the sound of multiple streams of urine hitting water. She couldn't help but smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\nMeanwhile in the gents toilets, where there was only one stall, so there was a cue forming. \"You'd think they'd put more than one shitter in our toilets.\" Aaron grumbled as he tried crossing his legs to keep from peeing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the girls have three in theirs.\" Rob sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam, who was stood behind Rob, winced as he lifted his big breasts. They were starting to hurt him a little and pull on his back. On top of all that, now he had to wait to have a piss. He hated work so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\nA few minutes later, most of the staff had managed to relieve themselves, and the tea room had filled up. The staff were sat or stood around the room, chatting and enjoying a beverage. Becca was sat in between Mona and Jessica and keenly observing everyone, trying not to laugh. She glanced to her left as Mona scratched her flat chest, then she looked right, she had to admit Kiran's long black hair actually suited Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca sipped on her coffee, content with her actions so far. \"Chocolate, Becca?\" Jessica suddenly held out of her bag of sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks.\" Becca smiled, taking one and slipping it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Becca decided to start fresh. She got her phone out again in front of everyone (it was just a phone after all) and hit the red Reset button on the app. A few seconds later and everyone's swaps had reversed themselves, all her co-workers were back to normal. As if to confirm it, Becca looked over to Rob, who looked completely normal again. But Becca was far from done, and she sneered as she turned to Liam again. The slacker was sat in between Charlotte and Melissa, drinking his coca-cola. Becca decided to 'borrow' from the two girls either side of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought up the appropriate images and made what alterations she wanted. Then came the fun part. She watched as Liam's hands and arms shrank slightly and his fingernails gained a familiar coat of purple nail polish. Charlotte conversely gained Liam's arms and bigger hands. Then Liam's shirt pushed out again as he sprouted Melissa's tits. They were nowhere near as big as Liz's were, but it was still fun to watch. Becca smirked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah... I know.\"</i> Becca then mumbled under her breath. A few taps later... and Liam's teeth morphed into Rebekah's - giving him her braces too. Becca heard the clink of metal hitting metal when Liam brought his soda can to his mouth again for another drink. She tried to stop herself from laughing out loud. Rebekah unfortunately was oblivious to the swap, otherwise she might have enjoyed losing her teeth and their 'metal overcoat'..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca was having that much fun, she didn't notice the time. But she knew break was over when Liz stood up and clapped her hands once. \"All right people, as much as I hate being a killjoy, back to work please.\" she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit.</i> Becca thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone started to get to their feet, and Becca was the last to move. She reluctantly slipped her phone back in her pocket and vacated the tea room, heading straight back into the ladies toilets for a couple of minutes. She had a quick pee, which she hadn't done earlier, and then washed her hands. Then she went back down onto the shop floor to get her next task off her supervisor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Becca obediently followed Liz into the Goods In area, not quite knowing what job she would have to do next. She was bummed out when Liz handed her one of the big sweeping brushes. \"Okay, I want you to pull all the cages of stock out and give the floor a good sweep.\" Liz said. Becca took hold of the brush and sighed, and she really had to bite her tongue. <i>Could have given Liam this shitty job.</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Liz.\" Becca nodded, trying not to sound too annoyed. But Liz knew all too well that none of staff liked sweeping the floors. But it was a job that needed to be done, and Liz - as the supervisor - had to assign someone to it. That someone, this time, was Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come and see me again when you're done okay love.\" Liz smiled, patting Becca on the shoulder before leaving Goods In.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca reluctantly set to sweeping the floor, knowing that the sooner she started the sooner she'd be done. However she didn't plan on Luke wandering in to get some stock off one of the cages. \"Nice to see a woman doing what she's supposed to.\" Luke joked, causing Becca to stop what she was doing. She looked up at Luke and scowled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Becca muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke just smiled at her. \"Didn't say anything.\" he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you must be hearing things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You basically just said that sweeping up is a woman's job, right?\" Becca growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nice that you realize that.\" Luke just smirked, as he then walked out of Goods In with his arms full of stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca just stood there, not believing what she'd just heard. \"Someone is asking for trouble. And he's gonna get it too.\" she said. But she wasn't about to abandon the job while it was half done. She kept sweeping and soon had the floor swept. She then grabbed the dustpan and brush and got the rubbish off the floor, dumping it in the Biffa bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, now for a little payback.\" Becca chuckled to herself as she dusted her trousers off. She left Goods In and emerged back onto the shop floor. Instead of finding Liz, the first thing she did was pay Luke a quick visit on his section. She didn't engage him in conversation initially, she instead got her phone out and brought her app up. It took her a moment to decide what to do with Luke though. It wasn't until Helen walked onto the aisle to return his safety knife, that she knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca swapped Luke's head onto Helen's 45-year old body - and vice-versa. Then when Helen had left the vicinity, Becca walked onto the aisle and slowly approached Luke from behind.\"Are you not done yet? Keep this pace up and Liam will have some competition as the biggest slacker.\" she said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke frowned at Becca as he stood up straight and adjusted the strap of the bra that supported his D-cup breasts. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd stop playing with your bra for five minutes, you might get more work done.\" Becca smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was joking all right. Pull the stick from up your fat ass.\" Luke said, referring to what he said earlier. But with insulting Becca, he only made his own situation worse. Not that she seemed too hurt by the insult. Instead she just tilted her head as she looked down at Luke's new backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not exactly slim in the ass department yourself dipshit.\" Becca chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke sighed, glancing down and behind for a second. \"Look, do you want something?\" he snapped at Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca just smirked. \"I already got it.\" she replied. <i>Satisfaction.</i> she then thought, as she turned around and walked off the aisle. She would be keeping Luke as he was for quite some time. In fact, she might even pay him another quick visit later. She didn't know yet. She didn't like to plan too far ahead. Right now, she had to find Liz and tell her she'd finished sweeping Goods In.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She shook her head and headed straight for Liam's aisle, where she found him slacking - as usual. The perky tits and feminine arms Liam now had at least provided Becca a little amusement. But she was still pissed that she had to work with him. \"Hey, come on, we've got to work together.\" she told Liam, in a tone that nidicated her displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Liam complained. He was as chuffed about it as Becca was. As he sneered, the glint of metal in his mouth reminded Becca that she had also given him Rebekah's teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just move your ass, and you'd better not take the piss and let me do all the work.\" Becca barked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" Liam replied, in his usual lackadaisical manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were soon down in the warehouse, and Becca wanted to make sure Liam did as much work as she did. Otherwise... well, her special app would be getting a further work-out. It was either that or kick Liam where it hurts. And Becca preferred to take Liam's balls away from him instead of kicking them.

He'd been working reasonably well so far, but only because he knew he was being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do? Suki asked, holding her arms up by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca threw a box on the shelf, then looked back at Suki. \"Help Liam if you want, he probably needs it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a mistake on Becca's part.

She was able to sneak a look at her phone. She wondered if she could swap something like...a piece of the brain. After all, Liam's slacker-nature had to be stored in there somewhere. As did Liz's hard work ethic. She tried to subtly search the app as Liz lectured, thinking she may have found just the thing. Then she gave Suki's sunny disposition to Liz as well, leaving Suki with Liz's more realistic way of looking at the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Are you ignoring me and looking at your phone, Becca?\" Liz questioned with authority as Becca hit submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, uh, no.\" Becca lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries,\" Liz replied with a sudden bubbly sound to her voice, \"And sorry for being so hard just now; just sort of get it all done when you all have the chance, please! No need to rush! Seriously, thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca smiled. Having a sunny, easy-going boss seemed like it was going to be the best thing. Then she turned around, Liam was already back to work. Becca tried to extend her smile, having Liam as a hard-working co-worker was going to be even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Suki sighed to Becca, \"Let's just get this done. That bitch probably will give us more crap to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca thought it was odd that Suki was talking like that. Liz may have had a more pessimistic outlook, but she never swore. Then again, Liz also had to portray a leadership image, Suki did now. Liz might've always just grumbled like that to herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had given Jessica the color of Suki's dark Indian skin, but her features and red hair remained the same. It looked very out of place, but that was the idea. Looking back over at Suki, she looked strange as well with the hue of her skin now being Jessica's pale complexion, her dark hair now seemed to contrast it so much.

Not that she could do that, since Liz was still currently the supervisor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooh, I wonder...</i> Becca thought, producing her phone again.

Sure enough, the slight crow's feet that had been on Liz's eyes earlier in the day were now on hers. But it really wasn't just her eyes. She now also had a gray hair or two on her head, and even her breasts seemed a bit less firm. Then she realized, instead of simply swapping jobs with Liz, she must have also swapped experience -- which inadvertently meant swapping ages. Becca was beginning to think this wasn't such a great trade off, but maybe there were other options in order to make this work.

Simply swapping breasts with another woman was one thing, but if she swapped ages with a teenager for example... would she still be the supervisor? Or would an unknown factor kick in again and strip her of her newly-acquired authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommon sense... or more likely uncertainty won out in the end, and Becca decided to leave her age as it was for now.

First, she took advantage of the fact that Liz was a slacker boss and asked for an official break. Liz, of course, didn't seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca made her way out to the other shops. She knew who she was looking for; it was just a matter of finding her. Then she saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena Yukimoto was 23 years old. She often hung around the area, acting like she owned the place. In a way, she sort of did. Her father owned much of the real estate that many of the businesses rented space from, including Wilkos. Today, she was hanging out in Internacionale, gabbing on the latest iPhone with someone. All Becca really cared about was that she was rich AND young. But what exactly was she going to swap? Life experience? Or something like that. She wouldn't have to work at Wilkos anymore. Heck, she wouldn't have to work at all. She loaded the app and swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Becca knew she was wearing designer clothes and lots of jewelry. Serena now wore Becca's old Wilkos clothes. She was chatting on a much cheaper, outdated phone now. \"Ugh,\" Serena said to the person on the other end of the phone, \"Like, I can't believe my break is almost over, and I have to go back to that totally lame store to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca smiled.

She did her thing... and moments later she saw Natalie's biceps swell larger... filling the short sleeves of her polo shirt. Her arms also lengthened a little and her dainty hands grew larger, enabling her to grip the shelf better. Of course her gold engagement ring disappeared too.

However she needed to see if the app had a function for that first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked through the app and found that it had listed all changes she'd made and it had an undo button as well. Further exploration showed that each person had their own profile with two more options, revert and awareness. By the looks of it, revert would give a person back all their original parts by swapping with whoever currently had their part. This meant, for example, if she swapped pussies between Liam and Rob and reverted Waggy, Rob would gain Liam's dick instead. She decided to leave that option for now and instead check the awareness button, as expected everyone's but her's was set to off. She partly wondered what would happen if she swapped a part with someone else then turned the awareness off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly gave herself a dick, just to experiment and turned her awareness off. Suddenly all her memories of ever having a pussy was replaced with those of a dick. The only reason she knew it wasn't actually hers is because she made the swap.

In a flash of light... Carly's head was swapped onto Steven's body nearby. Steven now found himself stood in front of Liz, with Carly's petite body and wearing her Beautylicious top, white skirt and black high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, can you get back to work please? You and Carly can catch up on your own time okay.\" Liz gently berated her employee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.. sorry Liz.\" Steven apologized, clicking off in his size 4 pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly returned to talking with Liz, slightly confused as to her sudden shift of location, but otherwise oblivious to the fact that her head now adorned a male body. And Liz didn't notice it either. But Josh had this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow!\" Josh exclaimed, seeing what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See!\" Becca smugly grinned. \"I guess we both have to be holding the thing.\" she mumbled, looking at her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Josh was unaware of all the other swaps she had made to Rob, Liz and the others, she quickly hit reset on those swaps, returning those co-workers back to normal. She watched as Liz's large breasts returned to their rightful place... distending her supervisor's shirt. But she left Steven and Carly as they were, so that Josh could marvel at them in their swapped state. \"So, wanna have some fun?\" Becca asked Josh, striking a feminine pose as she waved her phone at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... sure, I'm game.\" Josh nodded, beginning to smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His hands were normal except for the french tip manicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, you look so cute in a skirt 'Carly'\" Becca suddenly laughed out loud, getting Josh's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny!\" Josh sighed, rolling his eyes.

I swapped with Jade.\" Becca mumbled, a little disappointed. She looked down at the tighter trousers she was now wearing and the black lace-up shoes that Jade normally wore.

There was Carly's best friend Zoe laid down having her eyebrows waxed by another woman, who was now wearing Zoe's Beautylicious uniforms and heels. Zoe's long, luxurious brown hair also adorned the woman's head, while Zoe had the woman's short red pixie-cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Carly luv,\" the woman waxing Zoe's eyebrows greeted Josh. \"Just finishing Miranda's brows.\" It didn't take long to figure out that Zoe and this 'Miranda' had been life swapped as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry for interrupting... um.. Zoe.\" Josh replied nervously, as he closed the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird.\" Josh chuckled to himself as he headed to the other room where Carly usually waxed her clients. That is whenever she wasn't doing someone's nails that is. He stopped when he saw his reflection in the mirror on the wall.. \"Holy sh...\" he stopped himself from swearing, just as he stared at himself. He could still recognize himself, but the smooth, tanned skin, plucked eyebrows, make-up and the blonde head of hair he now had... made him look like a tranny. Of course the feminine attire he now wore did as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe of course felt self-conscious, even when on his own. But he knew everyone saw him as Carly, so he was safe from ridicule. \"Damn this thing rides up.\" Josh grumbled as he tugged on his skirt a bit, moving it further down his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few minutes of checking out his new business, Josh couldn't help but wonder how Becca... of 'Jade' as she was now known, was getting back in the store with the others.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she was walking to find Luke, she noticed the many swaps that have occurred.  First she saw Shaun had swapped with Elizabeth and was dressed in her usual skirt suit and pumps.  Liam looked like he had swapped with Rob and now Rob was the one who was standing around and not really doing anything.  Towards the front of the store, Becca noticed that Mona had swapped with Steven, with Steven watching the Help Desk.  \"This is getting weird.\" Becca said to herself as she kept on her adventure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jade.\"  Becca turned around to see Carly dressed in Josh's uniform and she had his shorter hairstyle, she seemed to have his American accent too, which was odd.  \"How's your section going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Good, why do you ask?\" Becca wondered as she looked over to Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no reason.

Along the way, Becca noticed that Waggy had swapped with Mark and then Becca hatched the plan in her head.  She quickly made her way to the back and found Liz looking for something in the back.  \"Can I help you find something?\"  Becca asked Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for my knife, have you seen it lately?\"  He wondered as he continued to look around the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I found it over near Waggy and Mark.\"  Becca replied back to him.

So do you have a question?\"  Luke wondered as he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I mean yeah, I have a question over in Pet Foods.\"  Becca told him as they walked together.  Soon they reached the section that Becca reportedly saw the knife.  Becca then pulled out the PAID and shot it towards Waggy and then towards Luke.  There was a light and then Luke had Waggy's breasts and vagina.  'That will teach him to be such a bitch towards me.'  She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you saw my knife here.\"  Luke asked Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I saw it, I guess I was mistaken.\"  Becca answered back to him as she left to head back to her section.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once 'Kay' had gone into the back, Josh sat down at the small table where Carly usually painted her clients' nails. The smell of nail polish and other beauty supplies filled his nostrils. The acetone in the nail polish remover was particularly strong. And as he sat down, Josh felt his skirt pulling tight against his backside and hips. Glancing down, it was impossible to miss the 'tent' he was pitching in his skirt. Apparently this whole thing, living Carly's life, was exciting him somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of beautician has a hard on?\" Josh chuckled to himself, as he swept his bangs to one side again. He then held his hands out in front of him and wiggled his manicured fingers. He still felt weird, but also kind of 'special' in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began inspecting the small vials of nail polish, the nail files and scissors in a rack beside him. And a part of him couldn't help but wonder... whether he'd be able to successfully paint anyone's nails without screwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thought pattern was interrupted by the sound of voices coming into the reception area from the back. 'Zoe' had finished with her clients eyebrows, and now the real Zoe - now 'Miranda' - was paying her bill and politely being shown the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya!\" Josh waved to the real Zoe as she walked out of the salon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But something felt missing, he thought about it for a moment and then realized something. \"You gave her my education too.\"  Josh said practically yelling at Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, do you think I was going to let you have both of them?\"  Becca said with a smile.  Josh knew she was right, but he still thought he would still remember his time at the university.

Josh hung his head as he knew what was coming.  He felt a tug in his groin and then nothing at all.  He quickly brought his hand down, patted it and felt nothing.  \"And since you nearly left without getting that, I will give you something else.\"  Becca stated to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that going to be?\"  Josh wondered with fear in his voice.  But instead he felt himself shrinking down in size until he reached Carly's height of 5' 2\".  \"Why did you do this?\"  Josh wondered over to Becca.  They were now practically eye level, well, that is with his heels on, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were way too tall, with the heels on you were pushing 6' 2\".  I felt that you could use a change in scenery. That's all.\"  Becca said with a smile.  \"Do you need anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just shook his head. \"I'd better head back, I have an appointment coming in 15 minutes.\"  As he said this, Josh turned on his heels and headed out the door.  He now knew what he was doing and wouldn't have to ruin Carly's good name by messing something up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Becca stayed just out of sight as she saw 'Liz' approachng the help desk, where Steven was stationed.

Living Josh's life, Carly was now 5' 10\" tall and she had a distinct bulge in the front of her pants, caused by Josh's penis and testicles.

It was still her face, her body... mostly, except Jade's familiar hairstyle had replaced her own, and Jade's clothes had replaced hers. Then there was the bulge now distorting Jade's trousers.

She wanted to swap into another life, but without giving up Josh's penis, which she still had between her legs. She was half tempted to reverse all the swaps she had made, except for the ones between herself, Josh and Carly. As she was thinking about her next course of action, she suddenly saw Josh tapping on the window outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, he's really got used to walking in those shoes.\" Becca thought in admiration, as she watched Josh confidently strut down to the exit in Carly's pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca looked around for any signs of Luke (Liz) or Shaun (Elizabeth), and when she saw the coast was clear, she nipped to the exit to have a word with Josh. She really wanted to see if he would notice the 'addition' she now had between her legs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just don't do anything that I wouldn't do.\"  Becca replied back and laughed at her comment.

He had Carly's height, this he was thankful for, Carly's vagina in between his legs. \"I don't see anything different about myself.  Did you use it on yourself?\"  He wondered as he looked over in her direction and saw that she was now nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I used it on myself.  I will give you a hint, it has to do with my lower body.\"  She hinted to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lower body, huh?\"  Josh repeated as he looked at her lower body and saw that she still had her normal bulge in between her legs.  \"Are those your legs?\"  He wondered towards her as he saw that she had a huge grin on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got them from Liz, what do you think?\"  Becca lied to him.  'He didn't notice that I have his cock.  I might just be able to keep it, if I wanted.'  She thought to herself.  \"Is that all you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just didn't know what to do.\"  Josh admitted.  \"I guess, I will be myself and try not to get too tangled up with it.  Oh, I just wanted thank you for the extra 2 inches too.  Believe it or not, they have been a lifesaver.\"  He smiled and waved goodbye as he turned to leave the store.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Charlotte.\" Josh answered, waving a little. He noticed the purple nail polish on Steven's fingers, just before Steven disappeared into one of the stalls.

Oh, this revealing top.\"  She held out what looked to be a pair of hip hugger jeans and a pink v-neck top.  \"I think you can keep your underwear on.\"  She said with a giggle.

We are all girls here, and you can change here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed as he heard this and agreed.  <i>'I may be living a girl's life, but I don't really have a girl's body'</i>  he thought to himself as he started to get undressed.    Josh noticed he had her bra on his flat chest and her knickers on, constraining his penis.  He then started to put on the clothes that she picked out and noticed that they fit him perfectly.  He then made his way over to the mirror that was near the door and looked in it to see what he looked like and was shocked to see Becca's reflection with the revealing top.  \"Oh my god.\"  Josh said as he looked toward Becca's direction and motioned for her to come near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?\"  She wondered as she made her way over and saw Becca and Laura staring back at them.  \"This just got more interesting.\"</span></div></div>",

Laura's dad was now living his wife's life, and he was wearing her clothes and had her hair. And vice-versa. \"Don't make too much noise upstairs honey.\" Laura's dad said in his deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries mum.\" Becca called back, and she and Josh headed upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca immediately dug into Laura's wardrobe and selected an outfit, a pair of jeans and a red t-shirt with a revealing neckline, as well as a pair of flats.

But she had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Tamara, can we talk?\" Becca asked Josh, as the real Tamara (now living Samantha's life) did her own thing nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Josh chirped, as he smiled at Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll come straight out with it. You're not Tamara, you're Josh!\" Becca stated. Needless to say, this brought an intense frown to Josh's face, and he stopped getting changed into a new skirt for a moment while he looked at Becca gone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Josh suddenly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca sighed. \"Everyone's lives have been swapped by an app I've been using on my phone. Don't you remember?\" And you are Josh, you're 32 years old, and you work at Wilko. You have a wife too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh justs hook his head. \"Girl, whatever you've been smoking, give me some of it.\" he responded sceptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't smoke drugs.\" Becca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's facial expression turned to one of 'yeah right'. \"Megan Louise Thomas, you are SUCH a liar. What about that time at Beth's house, when her brother offered us some stuff?\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeirdly enough, Becca could remember herself (actually Megan) smoking weed in a friend's house. \"It was hardly crack cocaine.\" she shrugged, not wanting to admit she statement had been wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still smoked it, and enjoyed it.\" Josh winked in typical 'Tamara' fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca knew she was beating her head against a brick wall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She made her way over to him to see if she could at least 'tap' on the glass of reality to let him know that she was there, but first she wanted to have a little bit of fun.  \"Hey Tam, I think this one would look fabulous on you.\"  She said holding up a pink and grey dress that would go down to her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I think your right Megan.\"  Josh said with a smile on his face as he took it and sized it up to his body.  \"It's pretty, but I think I need something a little shorter.  I like to give the guys something to think about when I pass by.\"  He giggled as he put it back on the rack.  He saw something, it was a light purple and grey blouse.

America.\"  he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca heard this and gasped.  \"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had this weird feeling, Megan.\"  Josh said to Becca.  \"It's like I've been to America.

Just then a little girl who looked to be about the age of 10 walked in with Josh's uniform on.  She went over to the toiletries section and started to work the stock onto the shelves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly?!?  Lilly are you in here?\"  A woman around Josh's age walked in looking for her daughter.  \"There you are, why did you run off?\"  The lady said as she saw Josh and made her way over to his location next to Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca can you undo this?\"  Josh wondered over to her.

Josh looked at her with wide eyes, the kind of eyes you would see when somebody is about to die.  \"Listen, just come back here tomorrow afternoon and I will change you back.  I don't think that the range will reach where you are about to go and besides if you need to talk to me just call the store, I will be here for the rest of the shift\"  Becca explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh let out an exasperated sigh.  \"Fine, but you will owe me one.\"  Josh said as he pointed to her.

We are late for Emily's sleepover.\"  The lady said as she dragged Josh away.  Josh then looked over to Becca who was laughing at his situation.  Soon Josh was brought outside by the woman who thought he was her daughter.  \"We only came by here to pick up some supplies.  Now that we got them, let's head out, alright poppet?\"  Josh didn't know what to do so he just nodded and followed the woman to her car and got in the back where he found a backpack full of items and a pink sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   Back at Wilco   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca was laughing at seeing Josh being dragged out of the store by a lady much shorter that he was.  She looked around the store to see who everyone else had swapped with.  It appeared that Steven had swapped with Carly, Zoe with Kiran, and Charlotte with Liz.  \"This is going to be much more interesting than last time, but I certainly am going to miss having Josh's cock.\"  Becca said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, you need to come and help me with this section.\"  A little voice said to Becca. She turned around to see Lilly wearing Josh's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, mate.

Josh then saw a group of 3 - 4 ten year olds soon made their way to Josh's car and opened the door for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly, I'm so glad your here.\"  A young blonde girl said to him. \"Now we can start the fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I couldn't wait for it.\"  Josh said back to her halfheartedly as he grabbed the backpack and the sleeping bag and made his way into the house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wasn't disappointed however.  He looked into the mirror and was shocked to see Carly's own reflection looking back at him.  Every face he made and every expression he did to the mirror, was reflected back at him.  \"This definitely got really, freakin' awesome.\"  Josh said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, Carly?\"  Mona said as she made her way over to Josh.

Soon he was able to reach the front doors of WIlko with Carly's heels clicking the entire way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe how easy it is to walk in these.\"  Josh said to himself as he did a small turn to show himself that he could indeed to do it.  He went inside and noticed Becca immediately, he clicked his way over to her and met her with a \"Hello\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Josh  You really have fun walking in those down don't you?\"  Becca commented as she noticed his level of expertise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down past his bulge in his skirt and to his feet encased in Carly's heels.  \"Yeah, you want to know something really odd?\"  He looked back up to Becca and noticed her looking at him with some intrigue.  \"I was able to do her work too. Manicures, waxing, and styling, all of those I am able to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... that must have been part of the life swap.\"  Becca commented as she looked down at Josh's bulge.  'I think he needs to look more like a lady if he is going to be living the life of one.  I wonder if he will notice if I take his cock?'  She thought to herself as she waited for his back to turn and took out her phone a quickly did the swap between herself and Josh.  As if on queue, he turned around and she noticed his lack of bulge in the front.  She brought her hands down and caressed her new equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really have to do that in front of me?  Feeling yourself up should be done in the restroom.\"  Josh said to her with a small bit of disgust on his face.  He decided to see if he could find Carly and see how she was doing with his life, not that she would notice anything odd about it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She took out her phone again and brought up Josh's and Carly's details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And down you go luv.\" Becca laughed, watching as Josh shrank down to 5' 5\" (with his heels on). Carly of course enjoyed a growth spurt but was unable to enjoy it due to her being unaware of everything that was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing another swap occur instantly gave Becca a full-blown hard on, and she gazed down at herself in amusement and joy. \"God this thing feels nice, I'm glad I took it.\" she giggled, pushing Jade's former hair behind her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of chatting with Carly, Josh returned to Becca, still not knowing what she had done to him.

He now wore her usual uniform, but instead of his closely cropped hair, he now sported her dark blonde hair which was tied up in a ponytail tonight.  \"Hey Laura, how is everything going tonight?\"  Becca asked her gender swapped friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked up to see who was greeting him.  \"Oh hey Jade, it's going good.\"  He said with a grin.  \"I can't wait to get out of work tonight so that I can meet up with my boyfriend.

It was then that Becca had a devious idea.  She looked to see if Laura was anywhere nearby and soon found that she was.  She then proceeded to take out her phone and brought up Steven's and Laura's profiles, she selected their groins and chests and proceeded to swap them.  \"I honestly do.  I mean, it is our anniversary and it's only right that we get intimate.\"  Steven said to Becca.  Becca then looked back over to him and noticed that he now sported Laura's perky B-cups and had a flat crotch to signify that he would enjoy his date tonight more than he would have before.

He didn't know whether to invite 'Liz' to accompany him and Becca or not. He knew Becca might be pissed at him. He took the easy way out in the end. \"Better ask Jade, I mean...

If I can talk Josh into swapping with them, we can still go to the pub.</i>'  She thought to herself.  '<i>But if I do that then I might have to sacrifice this gift from Josh</i>'  She gently caressed it once more.

Josh made his way over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Josh wondered as he fixed his bra strap.  \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know that Waggy wants to join us, right?\"  She asked Josh and he nodded to her. \"Well, there are two people in there that we can swap with that are already friends and we can then go to the pub as them. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at her and asked,  \"Who do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's Melissa and Naomi, they're from Parkgate.\"  Becca asked as she looked at his gears going in his head.  \"What do you think?\"  She held her breath at as Josh made his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\"  Josh asked.  \"I think I will try it out.\"  Becca's face lit up when she heard this.  She was so excited, that she grabbed his had and dragged him inside.

He still had 'his' breasts and vagina, and he was still standing at Carly's 5' 2\" height. Without her high heels on, the height loss was keenly felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how's that feel?\" Becca grinned as she adjusted to Melissa's clothes and looked down to see the welcoming bulge still in her new pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty comfortable actually.\" Josh nodded in approval, as he ran his fingers through his long, straight black hair. The tits he had got from Carly (unknowingly) nicely distended Naomi's former Wilko shirt. \"And will you stop doing that!\" He suddenly said, as he saw Becca rubbing her crotch again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you stop adjusting your boobs, yeah.\" Becca snapped back, with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Josh sighed, dropping his hands by his sides,\" I'll stop too.\" He then glanced over to their two oblivious donors and watched them go about their new lives. He had to admit, Naomi's clothes were both cute and comfortable. His feet still hurt a bit from wearing Carly's heels for so long. But now he had a pair of flats on his feet, and was wearing tights with his skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should keep Waggy... I mean 'Liz' off our backs now.\" Becca nodded with certainty<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but she'll probably pester someone else now.\" Josh said. \"You ever think 'Liz' gets lonely at all, I mean... being supervisor? Maybe she just wants to interactive with her staff more out of hours?\" he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca didn't care too much. \"Well let her mingle with someone else.\" she grumbled, waiting for ths shift to end, which thankfully... it soon did.

Did you forget that I was picking you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at the 20 year old Japanese woman with shoulder length black hair with a purple streak that went over her left ear.  As he looked at her, instantly a name came to mind.  \"Sorry Akiko, I totally spaced out.\"  He instinctively bowed slightly.  \"Do you mind if we give my friend Melissa a ride home?\"  He asked respectively.

Her first two victims were a couple in their twenties just leaving a fish and chip shop. <i>\"You look like a slut!\"</i> Becca thought, eyeing up the woman's short skirt and revealing top as she shoved a chip (fry) into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later the man was the one wearing his girlfriend's slutty outfit, including her 'fuck me' pumps. He also had her long hair and her identity. He looked downright ridiculous, which Becca approved of, but to help the guy out a little, Becca fiddled with her app again and swapped the woman's breasts to her boyfriend too. Becca watched as the man's low-cut top inflated out with some decent cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the next stop, Becca saw a couple of children, around 12 years of age, and an older girl of about 17. Obviously siblings, and the older girl was in charge of looking after her younger brother and sister. A mischievous smirk played around Becca's lips, then she made a swap between the 12-year old boy and his older sister. After just a second, Becca studied the young lad dressed in his sister's white t-shirt, Nike jacket, black leggings and tennis shoes, he even had her ponytailed hair... not to mention her life. The boy was now the one talking on the phone to his sister's boyfriend, discussing their plans for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older sibling in comparison was now teasing and arguing with her little sister, just as a snotty brother should. She looked peculiar with her younger brother's crewcut and boyish clothes (especially the C-cup breasts stretching her 'Iron Man' t-shirt. But compared to the last couple, it was a tame swap. And Becca refrained from making any part swaps between the siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Akiko's car pulled up outside Melissa's apartment, and Becca got out of the car. \"Good look 'Naomi', see you at work tomorrow.\" she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Josh rolled his eyes, as he shuffled his ballet flat-clad feet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then made her way up the steps to the front door of the building that housed the apartment that she now lived in, well at least for the night.  She looked in the bag that she was carrying and located a key which she thought would unlock the door.  Upon hearing the click, she was amused to see that it did indeed unlock the door.  She proceeded to make her way inside to her apartment and used another key to unlock it.  '<i>I can't believe how much memory I have of her life.</i>'  She thought to herself as she made her way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hey there Melissa.\"  A female voice called out.  \"You're home early.\"  She came around the corner and Becca noticed that the voice belonged to a woman about 5' 6\" tall with shoulder length dirty blonde hair who had small B-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Jen.  A friend of mine was nice enough to give me a ride home.\"  Becca responded almost out of habit.  \"She didn't have to, but she talked her sister into helping me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was certainly nice of her.\"  Jen said back to her.  \"So do you want to watch a movie with me?

She soon found what she was looking forward to the most.  Josh's penis seemed to know that she was looking forward to it.  It began to stir, ever so slightly, then became fully erect when she fully undressed.  \"Sorry Jen, but I will need some time to myself.\"  She giggled as she made her way to the bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was marginally good looking, wore glasses and of course the uniform of the pizzeria he worked at 20 hours a week. \"Margherita with pepperoni?\" The guy asked Jen, trying not to ogle the two girls now in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Jen smiled, grabbing her purse to pay him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca happened to have her phone in her hand, and she was certainly tempted to use the app at that point, just for 'funsies'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone was exactly how she had left them to previous night. Waggy was still scurrying around dressed in Liz's uniform, checking up on 'her' staff.

She tapped a few buttons, first bringing up Liam's and Jessica's profiles, then Rob's and Kiran's. \"And... bingo!\" Becca smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam's Wilko blouse suddenly inflated with Jessica's tits, while a slight bulge formed in Kiran's trousers.

Liz didn't look too bizarre with Waggy's platinum blonde hair and her clothes.

Becca had done a reset and swapped everyone's lives again and Josh had ended up swapping with Naomi once more. Seemed like he wasn't destined to escape Naomi's mother's opinions yet. Letting out a prolonged sigh, Josh then looked over at Becca, who was sat nearby. Becca had an inquisitive look on her face and she was now wearing Phoebe's clothes, and she also had her pink and purple hair in Phoebe's usual pigtails, not to mention her nineteen tattoos and heavy make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more staff members had obviously arrived in the tearoom in the time Josh and Becca had been talking. Becca had hoped she'd swap with one of the guys, but she wasn't too downheartened. After all... she still had the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing off to her right, Becca saw Waggy still sat there, or rather Aaron dressed in Waggy's clothes and with her platinum blonde ponytail. She stifled a giggle and looked at the three other staff members who were in the tea room with them. Shaun and Helen were now dressed in each other's clothes, and Shaun had Helen's shoulder-length black hair while Helen had hardly any hair at all. And then of course there was Phoebe, now dressed in Becca's clothes, and with her dyed, blood-red hair atop her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gestured to Becca as he stood up and walked across to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca smiled, then followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I got Naomi's life again. Did you do this on purpose?\" Josh had to ask Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was totally random, see.\" she replied, gesturing to the others, and also down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can't you swap us again?\" Josh pressed Becca, who immediately shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, it's not really that bad being in Naomi's shoes is it?\" Becca smirked, enjoying Josh's discomfort. \"If it makes you feel any better, I'm a bit miffed that I didn't swap with a guy.\" she told Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled his eyes, sighing in frustration. \"Alright, whatever!\" he said, walking back over to his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you looked more like Naomi, you wouldn't be as moody.\" Becca muttered to herself, a wicked little grin forming on her face as she whipped her app out again and made a few adjustments to her and Josh. The first one was the most important. Becca highlighted her's and Josh's groins and then hit 'swap'. Becca moaned silently as she felt Josh's cock grow between her legs again, bulging out the black jeans she had got from Phoebe. \"Oh god, that's better. I was missing that already.\" Becca giggled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't notice a thing as his manhood once again morphed into Becca's pussy. Just like he didn't notice when Becca proceeded to have her fun with him and Naomi. <i>Much better.</i> Becca smiled, having swapped Josh's ethnicity with Naomi. Josh was now Japanese, as his skin tone and Asiatic eyes could testify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to tell him I think.\" Becca continued to chuckle to herself. She'd really gained a mischievous streak since acquiring the app. Her grin grew wider when she saw a now Caucasian Naomi, with short hair and dressed in Josh's clothes, enter the tea room momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, everyone who wasn't already at work, had arrived on the shop floor to start their shifts. Or rather... the shifts of whoever they had swapped with.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked odd from her normal Japanese appearance, now she appeared to be from European decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had to do something before I came over here.\"  Becca announced as she looked around the aisle to see some of the other swaps walking by.

Liz turned to see her and out of kindness waved back to her as she continued on her way.  She wanted to look around some more, but decided to get some work done before she headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I wish I was taller.\"  Naomi said with a frustrated manner.  \"It gets tiresome having to use the ladder all the time.\"  Becca turned to see her standing on her tip toes trying to put something on the back end of the top shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here, let me help you out for a bit.'  Becca thought to herself as she remembered that Josh was nearby and had some easy work to do with some of the lower shelves.  She highlighted the heights for both Josh and Naomi, then did the switch.  Naomi quickly finished with her shelf without the need of the ladder that somehow was moved out of the way.

Nicola now had Charlotte's 'bun' hairstyle atop her head and was dressed in the younger woman's Wilko shirt, black leggings, underwear and purple plimsolls. And nearby, still 5'9\" tall, Charlotte had been deposited into Nicola's life and the older woman's clothes had resized to fit Charlotte's much taller body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, pretty tame.\" Becca scrunched her face up, indicating she was unimpressed. But when she moved onto the next aisle, she was a little bit more amused to see Mark's lanky frame dressed in Melissa's clothes, and with her long brunette hair on his head. \"That's more like it.\" Becca chuckled to herself. She didn't have to see what Melissa looked like now in Mark's outfit, she could imagine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Becca moved on to also find that Mona had swapped with Jessica, Carly had been involved again and had swapped with Luke, and the beautician looked more than a little odd again with a short haircut and dressed in Luke's male uniform and shoes. And Becca ended her search with another 'tame' swap, when she discovered that Carly's friend Zoe had swapped with Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca looked at the list of life swaps on her phone, all the while grinning to herself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerself - Phoebe<br>\r\nJosh - Naomi<br>\r\nLiz - Natalie<br>\r\nAaron - Waggy<br>\r\nSteven - Elizabeth<br>\r\nShaun - Helen<br>\r\nRob - Suki<br>\r\nLiam - Rebekah<br>\r\nLaura - Kiran<br>\r\nCharlotte - Nicola<br>\r\nMark - Melissa<br>\r\nMona - Jessica<br>\r\nCarly - Luke<br>\r\nZoe - Jade<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at the list a certain sense of 'pride' came over her, a sense of accomplishment.

She'd had her fun with him, robbed him of his penis and swapped a lot of his physical body with Naomi's to match his new life.

She then brought up Aaron's and Waggy's profiles and swapped out their genitals.  She smiled, knowing that it meant that Waggy would be happy with a penis, even if she thought it was totally normal.  She then made her way over to where Rob was working.  \"Oh hey, how is stuff going over here?\"  Becca said, not remembering whose life he now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob turned around and Becca remembered that he now had Suki's life.  \"Oh hey Phoebe, it's okay.\"  He replied not knowing how to respond to that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a question for you.\"  Becca wondered not really wanting to hold anything back.  Rob looked over to her and gestured slightly that it was okay for a question and he was ready for it.  \"Well, I was wondering what your parents think about your skin color.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked at her with an offended expression.  \"What the hell, Phoebe?\"  He yelled at her.  \"That is a low blow and quite personal.\"  Becca then brought her hands up as if to say that she surrendered.  \"You need to go back to your section before I report you to Liz.\"  He still seemed to be upset over what Becca asked him.  As she left the aisle, she got her phone out and brought up Suki's and Rob's profiles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if he will forget what was said after I swap out his skin color with Suki?\"  She wondered as she performed the swap.

Becca was happy about the swaps that she had done and felt that they were for the good of the life swaps.

She looked so odd in fact, that he started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you laughing at?\"  Becca wondered as she looked at Josh and gasped.  \"What are the odds that we would swap with each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know but it's weird having this hair everywhere.\"  Josh said slightly angry as he tried to get his new hairstyle in control.  \"How do you deal with this stuff all the time?\"  He grabbed a small handful of hair and tried to get it to cooperate.  Apparently he pulled a little too hard and winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to be careful with that.\"  Becca chuckled.  \"All you really have to do is tuck it behind your ear, it tends to work better that way.\"  She got up and helped him with his new hair.  \"See like this.\"  She grabbed some and brought it behind his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, this is better.\"  He said as he took out his new phone to check out his reflection and noticed that it's Becca's old phone.  \"So do I have the app now?\"  He unlocked the phone and browsed the apps that were on the phone and couldn't find it.  He looked over to Becca and saw that she held out his former android phone with the app opened on it.  \"I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it goes with me where I go.\"  She replied with a matter of fact tone.  Becca looked around to see how else had swapped.  It seemed that Natalie swapped with Aaron and now sported his shorter hairstyle.  She then saw that Aaron's tall frame looked certainly out of place with Natalie's shoulder length brown hair and her more feminine outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird.\"  Josh said as he pointed over to Liam.  It appeared that he had swapped with a female as well.  \"I don't know who he swapped with do you?\"  Josh turned to Becca who was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe he swapped with Mona.\"  Becca pointed out the black hair and the outfit that she knew that she knew belonged to Mona.  She then looked over to Josh who was preoccupied with his new appearance and walked over to window to see what he looked like better.  She took this opportunity to swap back the genitals, that she enjoyed so much the last time.  She let out a soft moan as she felt it grow out from within.  \"That is much better.\"  She lightly stroked it and noticed that it certainly felt different in Josh's boxers that he usually wore.</span></div></div>",

A delighted... or rather satisfied smirk appeared on Becca's face as she surveyed the results of this new swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Steven makes a good mother, since he never liked kids much.\" Josh chuckled, oblivious to the fact that Becca had robbed him of his manhood again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He loves them now, he's Waggy remember.\" Becca laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two giggling about?\" Aaron suddenly asked as he walked by with his empty coffee cup.

He wanted to get down onto the shop floor to find their other co-workers.

If it was 'his' performance that was under review he wouldn't have been as nervous. But it was Becca's performance under review, and he was now technically Becca. On top of that was the weirdness of being taught and 'lectured' at times by a woman much younger than he was.

Josh had to sit through an embarrassing few minutes as 'Liz' told him that his work rate could improve if he 'gossiped' less with the other staff. Of course he would have felt worse had he also known that the vagina between his legs wasn't actually his, that Becca had stolen his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Liz, I'll try and work better.\" Josh sighed, after Suki had finished her 'pep talk' to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all I ask love.\" Suki smiled, speaking as Liz would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, Josh stood up and neatened Becca's former shirt, glancing down at her name badge that he wore. \"I'd like for you to work with Josh tonight okay luv, and remember what we discussed okay.\" Suki smiled, giving 'Becca' her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you!\" Josh nodded somewhat dejectedly.

Of course you're married, but do you know exactly how your wife feels.\"  Becca lectured to him.  <i>'I think I got him with that one.'</i>  She thought to herself as she saw him thinking about it more and more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long are we going to do this for?\"  Josh wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say a week and I will let you pick the person you will turn into.  Sound good?\"  She asked him.  He seemed to think about it for another couple seconds and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"  Josh agreed and he looked around the office to see who he would like to be.  Then he turned to Becca.  \"And I would like to choose, Melissa.\"  He pointed in her direction to emphasize his choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Interesting choice.\"  Becca said as she then looked around as well.  \"I will choose, Aaron, I want to see what it feels like to have some muscles.\"  She took out her phone and proceeded to set the timer for the swaps to occur.  She then scanned Aaron and then herself.  After hearing a single beep to signify that the swap was inputted correctly, Becca took her phone and scanned Josh and looked over to see that Melissa was talking to Mona and Jessica.  She had a hard time getting a lock on Melissa, but after a small bit of trying she was able to get a lock and heard the app beep twice, which she thought was odd.  She looked down and noticed that 2 people were selected instead of one.  <i>'Well, looks like Josh will have some fun.  I wonder who he got?'</i> She thought to herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And what was even more weirder, was that her clothes fit him perfectly, just as Aaron's clothes and shoes fit Becca now. \"Hmm, subtle swap to start off with, I like it.\" Becca grinned, as she stared down at her \u00a3150 men's sneakers and wiggled her toes in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wonder if mine will be as subtle.</i> Josh wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better get back to work for now, we can meet up again in a bit.

Then his fingernails lengthened and gained a coating of yellow nail varnish. This instantly puzzled Josh, since he remembered Melissa wearing crimson red nail polish. The only woman he'd ever seen with yellow varnish on her nails was... Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did Becca do?\" Josh muttered to himself, while running his now dainty hands over his expanded rear end. He naturally assumed his new backside had come from Jessica as well. \"Did she zap the wrong person?\" Josh shook her head in annoyance. Not that swapping with Jessica was a bad thing, since she was cute too. But still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about leaving his section again to ask Becca about the apparent mix-up, but he decided that it could wait until break.

The final part of the swap was her blood-red hair being sucked into her scalp, forming into Aaron's dark, short haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty obvious she had now swapped all her body hair with Aaron.

I wonder if that's what I look like when I change.\"  She wondered aloud as she looked over to Josh and noticed that he was changing once more.  \"And it appears that you're not done yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  He said with Mona's voice and he looked down and noticed that his chest seemed to be growing in size.  Soon he had Jessica's modest C-cups under his uniform top.  \"Great.\"  Josh muttered under his breath as he felt them with his hands.  More like testing the weight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those look nice on you.\"  Becca said wondering whose they were originally.  \"Looks like I will be next, hopefully.\"  In all honesty, she was hoping for more changes for Josh so that she could see him finished.  She then noticed something.  \"Josh, what happened to your wedding ring?\"  Becca wondered as she looked down at his hand.  Josh looked down at his feminine looking hand and noticed that she was right, he indeed was missing the ring on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"  He then looked down at his feet and blushed slightly.  \"I'm not married anymore.  I have a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Becca to giggle slightly.  \"Aww.  That's cute, I get a smoking habit and you get a smoking hot boyfriend.  I am truly jealous.  What's his name?\"  she asked trying to see who he got swapped with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is James.\"  He said slightly blushing then he realized something and his mood fell greatly. \"If I'm not married, then where do I live exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I think we will worry about that later on.\"  Becca said trying to comfort him.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her first stop was Mona's aisle, where she was working with Melissa and getting along well apparently. The first thing Becca noticed was Mona's flatter backside, and then when she spoke to Melissa... a deep, U.S-accented voice emenated from her lips. As she moved closer, she could see a considerably greater amount of hair on Mona's arms, not to mention a very light stubble on her face. Becca knew that all of Mona's body was now as hairy as her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too funny.\" Becca smirked, as she moved on to locate the lovely Jessica. Except... she was getting less lovely and more manly with each swap that happened to her. Becca soon arrived at her second destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Becca!\" Jessica chirped, a broad smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca gazed upon Jessica's deflated blouse, thinking she looked weird completely flat-chested. And Jessica worked on opening a box, which was a lot easier now with her stronger hands, and without manicured nails to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jess. How's your wife doing?\" Becca asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's fine. Still working at the University in Sheffield.\" Jessica replied casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice.\" Becca said, feigning interesting as she continued surveying her co-worker's odd appearance. \"Well, sorry to interrupt, keep up the good work.\" Becca said, before walking off the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, she got her phone out again and smirked. She had an urge to mess with another couple of co-workers. But, she also knew that she'd probably be getting another trait from Aaron any time soon. She was excited, trying to guess what it might be.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She turned around to see Aaron walking up in her old outfit, complete with her black flats on his feet.  \"You've heard about Laura's boyfriend, right?\"  He wondered, trying to get some attention for a cause he believed in, spreading the word on what's going on in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca looked at him.  \"No what's going on?\"  She honestly knew what he was going to say, but decided to humor him a little.

Not because he's dating Laura, but because I just don't really care right now.\"  She replied back with his deeper voice.  Aaron looked at her like she just called him the most vulgar name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I am wasting my time here.\"  Aaron said as he turned in Becca's flats and left the aisle.

Had she cranked up the pace of swaps between him and Jessica? As Josh raised his arm, he noticed how dark the fine hairs on his arms looked, he couldn't remember Jessica's arms quite looking like that. But... the hands he had were definitely Jessica's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know another couple of traits were incoming that would help him make sense of what was happening. First off he started dwindling down in height, losing five full inches and stopping when he was 5' 5\". \"Woah, not sure I like being shorter.\" he mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had that happened, he watched and felt his clothes shimmering. In a few seconds... they changed into a familiar looking work uniform. It wasn't Jessica's however, he knew that. He was now wearing a smaller sized Wilko top, a pair of black jeans, striped socks and some black, white-etched, hi-top sneakers. \"These are... Mona's clothes!\" Josh frowned intensely, as he ran his manicured hands over his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I'm swapping with Jessica, now Mona. These are definitely her hands.\" Josh told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit him, the reason he was probably getting two traits each time. He was swapping with two girls, not one. \"What the fuck did Becca do?\" he grumbled, tempted to scamper off his section and find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Josh just rubbed his forehead and let out a sigh. This knowledge certainly changed things for Josh. And he realized that his body hair, his voice... and maybe his new ass too were also Mona's. It was process of elimination, since he knew his breasts, hands and his boyfriend were most definitely Jessica's. And now he had Jessica's height as well. Off on her aisle, a flat-chested Jessica now stood over 6' tall in her high heeled ankle boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Liz's voice in an aisle nearby, Josh shook himself out of his mood and got back to work. But he was definitely going to have a word to Becca about what she had done at the earliest opportunity.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just then she saw the shimmering happen again, but this time centering around her head once more.  No sooner did it start than it stopped.  \"I wonder what I got now?\"  She responded as she thought about the things in her life.  Thinking about the items in her old life, Becca then realized that she now lived at a different location.  In her old life, she lived with her sister in a flat.  But now, she had a male roommate in a flat just a few miles from work.  She was taken out of this thought by somebody coming up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca, I need to talk to you.\"  A soft female voice called out.  She turned around to see that Josh had shrunk down 5 inches and had a change of wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, I see you got some new stuff too.\"  Becca responded back to him.  \"How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured out why I am getting twice the number of swaps.\"  He answered back with an excited tone in his voice.  \"I think you must of targeted Jessica and Mona.  Did you know this was happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I had no idea.\"  Becca lied to him.  \"Trust me, if I knew I would have done something about it.\"  Josh eyed her suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you.\"  Josh said to her.  \"Can you fix it so that I only have one person instead of two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca took out her phone and looked at the app.  \"Sorry, it's a no go.  It says that the swaps are \"Locked In\" and we will have to wait until it's all done.\"  Becca said.  Well, it was half true.  She could stop it if she wanted to, but she won't be able to switch the targets until they swap everything back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we are stuck.\"  Josh sighed as he looked down at his clothes and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not all that bad.\"  Becca said to him.  \"I got another swap, I now have a new place to live.

Swapping with one girl would have been plenty, but two? Just as he was about to put some more stock on a shelf, he saw the shimmering again in front of his eyes, and he knew that two more traits were incoming from his two female 'donors'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his body, he kept watch for any changes, but none seemed to occur. It took him a moment to realize that he had received not one - but two mental traits, one from Jessica and one from Mona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u0645\u0646 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0628\u0644\u062f\" (I can speak Persian)... Josh mumbled under his breath, more than a little surprised. He now had Mona's language skills, her native language, and since he already had her voice too, it sounded normal. English was now his second language, though like Mona, he could still speak it fluently. After saying a few more phrases to himself in Persian, Josh focused on the second trait he now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one was a little more complex. He thought back to his childhood, all his birthday parties, his first dress, his school days, even his first kiss. He could now remember growing up as a girl, he had all of Jessica's childhood memories. And this made Josh feel somewhat uncomfortable about the parts of his body (one in particular) that were still very much male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, this feels weird!\" Josh mumbled, as he kept rummaging through his new memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork suddenly didn't seem important anymore, though Liz would definitely not agree with him. Josh set off towards Becca's aisle again and the first thing he did was look her up and down to see if he could see any more of Aaron's traits on Becca/ He couldn't, so instead he described to her what had happened to him. And he proved it by rattling off a few sentences in Persian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's... a pretty major swap.\" Becca smirked. \"The Jessica one I mean, it must be confusing to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think?\" Josh blurted out in Mona's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sure your mind and body will adjust to the changes.\" Becca tried reassuring him. Josh wasn't so sure. If he'd been swapping with one girl he might have gone for it, but he was concerned that his two sets of traits might try to cancel each other out. What if he went crazy?? He let out a sigh, then inhaled deeply. Becca could see he was growing a tad concerned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We had a picnic that day.  Then it started to rain, a drizzle at first then torrents coming down.  We were soaked to the bone.\"  Josh laughed slightly at this and then realized what he was doing and shook his head as if that would free him of the memory.  \"See what I mean?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it must be weird and abnormal, but if anything happens that you don't like, I will hit the reset button.\"  She said reassuringly to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh seemed to perk up at this fact and looked at her.  \"You can do that?\"  He wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I found it when I was looking at it about an hour ago.\"  Becca said to him.  \"It will turn us back to normal.

Even her big bum firmed up somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Becca was receiving all of Aaron's muscles, Josh was trying to stay calm while two more parts of his body were swapped out.

You're going down that route?\" Josh glared at her, not appreciating her laughing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but... yeah, it actually suits you.\" Becca giggled. \"What other swap did you get? From Mona?\" she then asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My legs, I think.\" Josh grumbled, lifting a pant leg to reveal what was definitely a female leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, definitey not yours.\" Becca smirked, as she continued reveling in her new found strength. She'd never been this strong before, naturally, and it was like a high. \"God I feel like I can lift anything.\" Becca said, as she paced back and forth.

Not only because of his own mis-matched appearance and conflicting memories, and not because of the way Becca had just picked him up and swung him around with ease. Josh had seen the 'pleasure' Becca took in swapping Liz's head onto Liam's body, and he started to wonder if Becca was maybe letting the power of the app control her a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the fact that he had been swapping with two girls instead of just one. He now was leaning more towards the thought that Becca had done it to him on purpose, to see him squirm. He wouldn't say this to her of course, he wasn't stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking to himself, half expecting another change at any moment, Liz happened to stroll onto his aisle to have a little chat with him. Josh looked up and winced at the sight of Liz's ponytailed head affixed to Liam's unkempt, 18-year old body, particularly the slight bulge in her trousers. \"Josh can I have a minute of your time please?\" Liz asked very politely as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... sure Liz, what is it? Josh stood up straight. What he instantly noticed was that he was now about three inches shorter than his supervisor now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about Becca,\" Liz started, \"she'd a bad influence on people sometimes and I have noticed you've been spending a lot of time around her. I just don't want your work rate to suffer because of her. You're a good worker, and I value your input.\" Liz smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was taken aback, this was a side of Liz he hadn't really seen yet.

But now he saw her as 'caring' in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... thank you Liz, I appreciate that.\" Josh squeaked in Mona's voice. \"And yeah, I do know Becca can be annoying.\" he chuckled, looking up at Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were stood talking, Josh suddenly noticed the shimmering return and envelop his already altered body. Liz of course didn't see anything, and she raised an eyebrow when she saw Josh acting funny. \"Is everything alright Josh?\" The supervisor inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... y-yeah, just a moment of dizziness.\" Josh replied, forcing out a smile, even as his shoulders narrowed and his waist pulled in as the rest of his torso morphed into Jessica's. At the same time... he felt a worrying 'sucking' sensation in his groin as his manhood disappeared. <i>Oh god..</i> Josh thought, realizing he was now for all intents and purposes... a girl. Mona's vagina had replaced his usual male genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, just think about what I said okay, about Becca.\" Liz smiled again, once Josh had stopped acting 'strange'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely... I will, thanks again Liz.\" Josh nodded, before watching Liz walk away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then let out a deep sigh as he looked down at his feminized body...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Actually, I think it's weird that you're swapping people out.  I think you should stop it before stuff gets too out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you should fucking worry about yourself and not about what I'm fucking doing.\"  Becca nearly yelled back at him.

Her first 'victims' after Liz and Liam, were Charlotte and Rob, who were doing some work together on one of the aisles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see what we can do with that bitch.\" Becca mused, looking at Charlotte. \"She can lose those for a start...\" Becca mumbled, focusing on Charlotte's chest. She felt nothing as her B-cup breasts deflated into nothing, replaced by Rob's flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca then brought Shaun's profile into play when she saw him nearby. Another quick fiddling with her app, and Charlotte was practically bald, while middle-aged Shaun now had Charlotte's 'bun' hairstyle on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the third change to Charlotte, as Becca swapped her height with Kiran's. \"Fucking hilarious!\" Becca chuckled, as she watched Charlotte shrink down to just 5' in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thinking about also giving Charlotte a dick, but just as Becca was wondering who to pick as the 'donor', she saw the shimmering envelop her already altered body some more. \"Oh... shit!\" Becca grunted in Aaron's deep voice, as she felt something pushing out of her groin. She knew instantly what it was. And a smile played around her lips as Aaron's erect cock tented her trousers. \"Fucking... yeah!\" Becca moaned, rubbing her new hard on through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she looked up again, Charlotte had disappeared off the aisle, and there was only Rob left working there, with his new B-cups pushing out his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll maybe finish the bitch off later.\" Becca smirked, before making her way to another aisle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He now found himself stood on the toiletries aisle, a pack of shampoo and a safety knife in his hands, which were now small and had long fingernails painted a dark red. The pack of shampoo tumbled from Josh's hand and onto the floor as he lowered his head to take stock of himself. He was still wearing a Wilko top, along with a pair of waist-high black trousers, a pair of thin black socks and a pair of black ballet flats with ribbons on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell am I...?\" Josh wondered, as he fiddled with the name badge on his shirt, trying to read it upside down. He eventually got it into a position so he could see it read '<b>Kiran</b>'. \"Holy shit! Guess that explains why everything seems to big.\" Josh said, looking at the shelves in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a girl!\" he then stated, as his hands sort of roamed up to his chest on their own to feel the perky tits under his shirt. He was 90% correct, his head was still very much the same, and now it adorned Kiran's petite body. He ran his manicured fingers through his short hair and then scurried off the aisle in an effort to locate Becca, or at least whoever now had her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh noticed a definitely 'wiggle' to his walk as he traversed the store, searching aisle afer aisle. And another thing he noticed was how comfortable Kiran's ballet flats were on his tiny feet. \"No wonder girls wear these all the time.\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Becca's voice called out from behind, startling Josh and bringing him to a halt. \"Hey Josh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh spun around, and took a moment to pull his knickers out of his butt crack. Then his jaw dropped open in shock when he saw Becca's grinning face atop of Aaron's athletic body. \"Aww... don't you look cute.\" Becca giggled as she walked over to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh began to blush, suddenly feeling very self-conscious as he took another look down at himself. When he looked back up at Becca, he saw her rubbing the obvious bulge in the front of her trousers. \"This thing feels awesome!\" Becca giggled again. Then she took stock of Josh's appearance. \"So... how does it feel being a girl? Especially such a short one?\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't know quite what to say. \"Um... it's... different.\" he mumbled, giving his boobs another squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\" Becca asked, only to shake her head a second later. \"Never mind, you'll find out how good it is having a vagina when you get home, no doubt.\" she winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay then.</i> Josh thought to himself. Part of him couldn't wait to get home now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Elizabeth had swapped with Shaun and now Shaun was walking around with her body below his head. \"Now that's a sight.\"  Josh said to Becca as he pointed to Shaun and she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who Steven swapped with.\" Becca wondered as they continued their search.

She was figuring on asking a few more of her co-workers if they also wanted to head to the pub after work. Josh wasn't sure if that was a good idea or not. But he kept his reservations to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz is watching, we'd better not talk too much.\" Josh mumbled quietly to Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca glanced back at Liz's head atop of Zoe's 5' 10\" body and smirked at the <i>Beautylicious</i> logo emblazoned on her black top. <i>Not setting a good example by being out of your work uniform Liz</i>.

There wasn't much said, Josh basically saying he liked Liam's purple plimsolls. Of course Josh was just messing with Liam, and Becca knew this.

But Josh was really starting to worry about any possible reactions from his wife when he went home having a 17-year old girl's body from the neck down. He somehow doubted his sex life would be the same. But would it be better or worse? Would his wife happily eat his pussy out for instance? Did Marcie even own a strap-on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were some of the questions racing through his head as he tried to concentrate on his work. And his work was that much harder anyway with his reduced physical strength and deminuative stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour of working, Becca soon came up behind Josh as he bent over, slapping his shapely teenage ass. \"Hey baby girl!\" she chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh jerked up straight and sighed in annoyance. And this put him in the mood to confront Becca about his situation directly. \"Hey look, I'm not sure I want to go home like this anymore.\" he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you're not backing out now. We made a deal.\" Becca smirked devilishly as she stood over Josh looking intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if Marcie notices something? Or what if our sex life is altered?\" Josh protested, as he shuffled his little ballet flat-clad feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca rolled her eyes. \"It's bound to be altered Princess, you don't have one of these anymore.\" she smirked, rubbing the bulge in between her own legs. Josh could see Becca was really enjoying having her head on Aaron's masculine body. Maybe a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca!\" Josh sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca continued to smirk. \"Look, tell you what I'm willing to do. I'll initiate another mass swap if you like, so you can get a different body. But I'm not including myself or Aaron.\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I could end up with Nicola's body instead.\" Josh frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the chance you take.\" Becca chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wondered whether he should just keep Kiran's body for now, until the planned two days was up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was nothing about Becca's home, in fact it was a little untidy, with clothes all over the place. A plate from last night's meal had been left on the coffee table in front of the TV. \"Sorry about the mess.\" Becca apologized as she strode into her living room. She immediately whipped off Aaron's Wilko shirt, revealing her muscular torso... and the large tattoo on her upper back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think, the body suit me?\" Becca asked, flicking her blood-red hair from her face before flexing her biceps. Becca was loving the feeling Aaron's body gave her, and her cock was even harder than her muscles at that moment. It took all the resistance she could muster not to just reach into her pants and start playing with her new penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, very manly.\" Josh chuckled as he watched Becca posing. He actually felt very 'insignificent' at that point. That was one way of putting it.

He had good reason to feel a little strange, given that his head was on the body of a teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go to bed if you want.\" Becca suddenly said, before realizing how that sounded. \"Oh... er... I meant alone, you know... separate rooms. I mean - unless you want to... \" Becca stopped herself right there, chuckling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's gaze once again fell on Becca's muscular torso, and he felt his pussy getting wet, a whole new experience for him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, what was the point in having the app if she wasn't going to use it on people? As Natalie continued chatting to her, Becca kind of zoned out as she thought of her next course of 'action'. If she initiated another mass swap, she'd be leaving herself, Josh, Natalie and Steven out of it, since she liked how things currently were. Or... she could just randomly swap those in the immediate vicinity.

Just in case it was real, she didn't want chaos or hysteria to run rampant.  She turned to her assistant and best friend.  \"Zoe, I think I am going to nip over at Wilkos for a moment to see what they have on promotion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe, seemingly not too phased at what was going on, nodded her head.  \"We're not too busy here and I think we could use some supplies.\"  She replied as she looked over at the front of the store, where Kay, the receptionist, was substituting any work that needed to be done with a new game on her phone.  She took a quick moment to jot down a few items on a piece of paper and gave it to Carly.  \"Here, I think that will just about do it.\"  Carly graciously took the note from her and made her way out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Wilkos not being too far from the salon, Carly found her way there in almost no time flat.  She walked through the automatic doors and saw her friends working vigorously to get ready for the upcoming holiday and the summer season.  So, she grabbed a shopping trolley and started to go down the main aisle.  \"Hey Carly.\"  Steven greeted his old friend as she passed by the aisle he was working with Jessica.  She waved to him and continued to look around the store.  Josh, the new guy from across the pond, was working with a couple customers, trying to help them look for an item they so desperately needed.  Phoebe was working an aisle over, trying her best to get the work done since Josh had to leave her to help the customers.  Becca was getting berated by Liz towards the back of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Carly replied to herself as she took out her list and started her shopping.  \"I think this will be an excellent place to see if the gift I received is real or not.\"  She started to find some of the items on the list.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The customers were both young women who wanted DIY advice on some electrical sockets for their new apartment. Carly assumed (correctly) that the women were lesbian lovers, the first was a 23-year old blonde standing 5'4\" tall, she was pretty and had nice C-cup breasts only slightly smaller than Carly's, though they were perkier than Carly's. She was wearing a yellow halter top, white cardigan, a denim skirt and black flats. The other woman, a 22-year old brunette with a pixie cut standing 5'7\" tall, was a little plainer in appearance, not as curvy as her companion/lover and had small B-cup breasts. She had on a sky blue t-shirt, a navy Nike jacket, jeans and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how about some muscles for you, since you obviously like to think of yourself as the 'man' in your relationship.\" Carly mused, smirking a little as she looked over to the slender brunette with short hair. \"Sorry luv,\" Carly then muttered, glancing to Josh, \"but this is necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was explaining something to the two women when his body started tingling all over, especially in his upper arms and abdomen. The pixie-cut brunette also experienced the same thing. \"What the hell...\" Josh mumbled, feeling himself getting noticeably... 'weaker'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" The brunette woman, whose name was Stacey, gasped as she felt her clothes getting tighter on her body. The sleeves of her t-shirt were strained by her growing biceps underneath her jacket as she stood there, her stomach muscles hardened somewhat, and the rest of her body gained obvious muscle mass too. \"What's happening to me?\" She asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong babe?\" Her blonde lover, Kate, asked in a concerned tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stunned Josh, whose clothes now hung looser on his body, could only stare as Stacey removed her jacket, handed it to Kate, and then flexed her biceps. Josh patted himself down and couldn't believe what had happened. It took him a moment to realize it fully, but it was as thought he had lost his muscles to this woman. He certainly wasn't feeling as positive about the swap as Stacey was. \"Oooh... \" Kate mumbled, running her hands over her lesbian lover's new biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly, who was watching closely, decided to include Kate in the fun too. \"And for you... a little boost.\" She giggled, swapping her height with Josh, who immediately started shrinking a full six inches in height, his trousers bunching up around his ankles as he dwindled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...!\" Kate gasped, as her body started growing taller, her skirt retreating several inches up her legs as she reached 5'10\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" Stacey asked in shock, as she watched her more attractive lover gain a three inch height advantage over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Josh grumbled, \"but this sucks!\" The American-born Wilko employee was now somewhat diminished with hardly any muscles and reduced down to just 5'4\" tall. Even Carly realized that in her high heels, she had a one inch height advantage over Josh now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, Carly now knew her power worked perfectly. Even though she'd left three very confused people standing in the DIY aisle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But in a matter of seconds, they were gone and replaced with a rather hairy, male looking chest.  \"Oh my god.\"  She gasped as she looked over at Steven who was as amazed as she was with the sudden appearance of the C-cups on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\"  Steven wondered as he started to feel the new bumps on his chest and let out a small moan of ecstasy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you stop doing that?\"  Jessica grumbled as she smacked his hands away from her chest.  \"It's not polite to do that in public and besides, I think we need to go find Liz or Elizabeth to see if they know what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven nodded his head and followed her out of the aisle, groaning as he felt the unnatural rise and fall of his new chest as he took a step.  Carly couldn't help but feel proud of herself as she walked away.  She decided to see how the guys of Wilko would deal with some of the feminine traits in the store.</span></div></div>",

Let's see if we can change that.\" She snickered, following Phoebe around until she saw someone suitable to swap her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe stopped suddenly as she felt a tingling in her crotch, then the distinct feeling of something 'worming' its way into her cotton knickers. \"What the fuck?\" She blurted out, despite the presence of customers, as a healthy (and young) set of male genitalia took up residence between her legs. Meanwhile, in one of the aisles close to Phoebe, a 10-year old boy was trying to convince his mother that his 'willy' was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe tugged on the waist of her trousers and stared down in shock at the small bulge in her knickers. \"Oh shit... nooooo!\" She screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her panic got worse when the same tingling affected her scalp. Phoebe suddenly saw a young boy (the same one who now had her vagina) sporting two pink &amp; purple dyed pigtails. She kept one hand on her crotch while reaching up with her other one and running her hands through her short crewcut. In shock, Phoebe made a beeline for the Goods In area, which seemed to be a refuge for any staff member who got swapped. The young boy's mother meanwhile had now noticed her son's feminine hairstyle and started to believe his 'tall tale' about his penis being gone too. She took his hand and the two bolted from the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that was fun.\" Carly grinned, moving on to another aisle to look for more 'victims'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She had her arms folded and leaned her head back as she breathed some fresh air into her lungs. She exhaled and then sat down on the pavement. Looking at her watch, she saw it was 12:15pm. \"Still 30 more minutes of break.\" She sort of just twiddled her thumbs and observed the passerbys. Multiple people passed by as she studied their faces, their habits. She then suddenly laughed and shook her head again. \"There's no way, there's just no way.\" She saw a young, businessman, around 22, looking very dapper. His black suit complemented his slender physique as he was quite sharply dressed. The dimples, meeting his stubbled cheeks, became visible as he laughed while talking to his much older and much larger female co-worker. The overweight woman, in her 40s, had green eyes and visible signs of wrinkles on her face. However, she was quite beautiful. She wore a purple skirt suit that barely went past her knees on her fat, stubby legs. The lady flipped her blonde hair slightly and her painted, plump lips smiled. \"What am I supposed to do? Yeah, like this will work?\" Zoe sarcastically waved her finger between the two and rolled her eyes. \"Magic!\" She laughed and gazed upon the two. Her eyes widened and her mouth dropped open. The man's handsome head sat atop his fat co-workers body. He was tugging on the bottom of his purple skirt to make sure it wasn't riding too high. He barely was able to even bend over. His large G-cup bust prevented him from even seeing his lower half. The woman, meanwhile, stared down from her new 6'0\" height at the man. She used her hairy hand to smooth the back of her co-workers skirt at his request. Her large male hands seemed tiny compared to the size of her former feminine ass. \"Phew, thanks Darlene.\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Bob. You have a nice butt.\" It was obvious Darlene had a crush on her younger co-worker, but now she had the hots for her own body!\" Zoe still did not know how to react. She, by this time, was standing up. \"No freaking way. No way. NO WAY.\" She couldn't stop saying it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Yeah, but I'd like to lose some weight.\" Bob said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you look great, luv. Take it from an older woman, all the gals like a guy with a fat butt!\" Darlene winked at her co-worker, who began to walk and work his thick body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe laughed. \"I guess, reality changes too. This is wicked!\" She thought of all the infinite possibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over an saw a group of nuns, 3 to be exact. All three of them appeared to be young, two in their mid-twenties and one in her early-thirties. Nearby, there were three hairy, overweight construction workers. They wore orange vests and blue jeans covered in dirt. They were also wearing hard helmets. She decided to try and swap the genitals of the three middle-aged men with the nuns. \"Forgive me father, for I have sinned!\" Zoe said as she flicked her wrist. Luckily, the nuns were sitting at a cafe table drinking tea. A large bulge appeared in each of their long black robes. Had they not been sitting it may have been hard to tell. The nuns shifted position as each of them had two large testicles pop out below their massive new appendages. The construction workers, meanwhile, lost their considerable bulges as their jeans fell flat in front. This didn't destroy their confidence, however, as all three men continued to cat-call at women walking down the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA family of four walked down the street. This family consisted of a tall, 45-year-old father, his 43-year-old wife, and their 10 and 15-year-old sons. Walking from the other side of the street, there was another family. This one consisted of a 35-year-old man, his 34-year old wife, and their twin, 14-year-old daughters. \"This should be fun!\" She swapped the genitals of the twin girls with the two sons from the first family. Then, she swapped the large penis of the 45-year-old father with the pussy of the 34-year-old wife from the second family. The mother's jeans bulged out in front as her husband idly rubbed her penis and then gave his wife eskimo kisses. The two twin daughters were grossed out by this. Both were preoccupied anyway since their testicles were popping out of their knickers. The were now identical in every way (one sister had the bigger penis and made sure her sister knew it!). The family now completely sported penises. On the other side of things, the other family completely sported vaginas. The 45-year-old dad casually scratched the empty space between his hairy, aged legs. He just wish he hadn't worn such loose fitting underwear! The two were both feeling pain as each were experiencing their first periods. Zoe felt satisfied, almost. She hadn't swapped the 43-year-old wife from the first family or the 35-year-old man from the second family. \"I can fix that,\" as the woman's DD-cup sagging breasts deflated in her bra and were transferred over to the other husband. Her nipples were evident in his thin t-shirt. His wife and him now both had a pair of tits and dicks to play with, while the other parents sported flat chests and vaginas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she saw a teenage girl bitching at an old man who was apologizing for taking his time crossing the streets in front of her. The old man was in his 60s with greying hair and a weathered face. Zoe thought the girl was in the wrong and decided to give her some payback. She swapped the lower halves between the two, and the girl gained a pair of frail legs in gray slacks. Not to mention the wrinkled penis in her tighty-whiteys. She was now trudging slowly over to her boyfriend who cupped her new junk as she yelped in excitment. The old man now was moving along the side-walk rather swiftly in his pink pumps. He adjusted his mini-skirt. He noticed a penny on the ground and got excited. \"Must be my lucky day!\" He leaned over and picked it up, revealing the purple thong he was wearing over his beautiful new teenage ass and pussy. \"Ohh, if only you knew how lucky your day really is,\" Zoe laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, a mother was trying to discipline her 5-year-old son for misbehaving. The little boy screamed, \"but I want ice cream!\" He began to cry. \"Here you go, pal,\" She swapped the head of the little boy and the head of the young, chubby ice cream man about to serve an ice cream to a little girl. The boy suddenly found himself towering over his mother while holding a ice cream sandwich in his hand. He smiled and began stuffing his face. \"Man, that kid has really packed it on,\" Zoe laughed at the size of the boy's new belly. She looked to his crotch, \"...and he's packing a monster in his pants too!\" She looked at the boy's large black pants being held up by a belt. He had a sizeable, sweaty cock hidden in there. The ice cream man climbed his tiny legs onto a step-ladder as he continued to serve ice cream to kids whose height he now matched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the street and walking back from the pool were a young couple in their 30s. The woman was still wearing her one-piece with her B-cup breasts snugly secured within. Her boyfriend, who had a mat of dark brown hair covering his chest and was very muscular, walked along side her in his brown board shorts. Zoe swapped genitals and hair between the two. The man's chest was now completely smooth as hair was now sprouting out of the woman's one-piece. A bulge formed at the bottom inside of her swimsuit. Her new 6-incher was situated upwards in her swimsuit to avoid being crushed. Her balls began to poke out so she quickly wrapped her towel around her waist. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, tightened his swimsuit bottoms a bit so they wouldn't fall off. The wet board shorts revealed the signs of his vaginal lips. \"A little too revealing for me,' chuckled Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked back at her watch. \"Ooo, I've only got 15 minutes left! I might as well grab a bite to each across the street.\" She stepped off the pavement. As she walked, she couldn't see the harm in another quick swap. She saw a 17-year-old jock-of-a-son with his 40-year-old, blonde-haired mother. She had some of the biggest child-bearing hips Zoe had ever seen. She was wearing a frilly, long, floral skirt that accentuated her large butt. She wasn't fat by any means, just very curvy. She swapped the muscular lower half of the son with his mother's curvy lower half. The boy continued to eat some chis as they walked towards the sports shop so his mother could buy him his football gear. \"Dear, I think you should lay off those. Those chips will go right to your hips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's my carb blowout day, Mum! I've earned this. Plus, Becky loves my hips!\" He said this referring to his girlfriend, the head cheerleader. The mother just shook her head, wondering where he got those legs, hips and ass of his. It surely wasn't from her or her husband with their manly, muscular legs. Zoe was content and smiled. \"This. This has been fun.\" She swung her arms back and forth and glided across the street to grab a bite.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The food stand guy was working as fast as he could to serve people, and Zoe looked at the short line of people in front of her. Adjusting her bra strap underneath her Beautylicious salon top, Zoe decided to swap some of them with people passing by... just because she could. A wicked little grin appeared on Zoe's beautifully made-up face as she rubbed her hands together. \"Let's start with you.\" Zoe said, while looking over the younger woman stood in front of her. The woman was plain in terms of appearance, and also a bit on the chubby side, she had unimpressive shoulder-length blonde hair and was wearing a grey Addidas hoodie, a pair of hip-hugger jeans that emphasized her 'muffin top' and a pair of sneaker flats. Zoe raised an eyebrow, apparently in disapproval at how the young woman kept herself. <i>Is it that hard to stick to a diet and make an effort with your clothes? I mean seriously.</i> She thought, deciding to 'help' the woman out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe waved her hand in front of her and swapped the woman's lower half with that of a 35-year old man talking on his phone nearby. The man felt nothing even as his body from the waist down became female.. and 10 years younger. His black t-shirt and casual suit jacket clashed with the jeans he now wore. His legs were shorter, smoother and thicker than his former ones had been, and his hips looked set to burst his new jeans. <i>Lets hope he knows how to drop weight.</i> Zoe chuckled. Meanwhile, the woman in front, who was now closer to Zoe's 5' 10\" height because of her new male legs, scratched idly at her penis for a moment, adjusting it to a more comfortable position as she kept playing with her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Zoe moved on to the person in line ahead of the woman. A skinny man in his late twenties, wearing a striped shirt, black bomber jacket, corderoy slacks and hiking boots. In Zoe's opinion... a fashion disaster. <i>Men and their tastes.</i> She rolled her eyes, deciding to get him out of the food stand line altogether and speed things up for herself a little in the process. Zoe gave another quick gesture of her hand and the man's head shifted onto a new body some 15 meters away. Funny thing was the guy was still skinny, since from the neck down he now rocked the body of a 15-year old schoolgirl of Chinese descent. He looked bewildered for a moment as he looked around, then down at his body and the school uniform he was wearing over his delicate form. He had gone from being 5' 11\" to a petite 5' 3\", and he had small A-cup breasts, very slender shoulders and no real curves. <i>Hmm, maybe he'll develop a figure, she was still growing.</i> Zoe thought, referring to the schoolgirl, whose confused noggin' now sat on the man's shoulders in the food stand line. \"Hey... that guy has my bag!\" The girl shouted, pointing out the man now sporting her body from the neck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-- sorry, I don't know how I got this.\" The man responded quickly, not wanting to get into bother. He walked over to the girl, his grey pleated skirt blowing in the wind, and his slender legs looking 'cute' in the girl's former knee-high white socks and ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl snatched her bag back, scowling at the man for a moment, before nodding and giving a quick \"Thank you.\". The girl then walked off on her longer legs, slinging her bag over her broader shoulder as the man got back in line, now behind Zoe. <i>Hey, I didn't technically push in, he left the line.</i> Zoe thought to herself with a cheeky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another person got served, Zoe stepped forward one more space, keeping an eye on the time all the while. She didn't want to be late back to the salon, as Carly would not appreciate it. They might have been best friends, but Carly did have a business to run and they had clients to tend to. Zoe was making sure her own appearance was fitting for a beautician. Zoe's long, dark brown hair was pulled back into a tidy ponytail today. Her 'smart' outfit consisted of her black, short-sleeved Beautylicious t-shirt, which was low-cut and gave everyone a nice view of her imposing D-cup cleavage. And the top went nicely with the black, knee-length skirt, zebra-print ladies belt and a pair of high heeled black pumps.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she was distracted by a couple of 'loud' voices approaching, and Zoe looked up to see a couple of employees from the nearby <i>Natwest</i> bank approaching. One female and one male, both in their late thirties and obviously friends. <i>Why must people speak so loud? I doubt anyone wants to hear anything about their personal lives.</i> Zoe thought with a frown, waving her hand again. The adams apple in the man's throat suddenly disappeared and transferred to his female co-worker as Zoe swapped their vocal chords. She smirked as she now heard the two friends talking in each other's voices as they passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Zoe was a step closer to being served. She glanced off to her left and saw another family approaching, the two parents were in their thirties and they had a 12-year old daughter in tow, gossiping in a way that reminded Zoe of one of her friends, Christie. \"Hmm, lets give the girl a head start in life.\" Zoe mused, once more flicking her wrist. First the mother's C-cup breasts rapidly shrank in her bra, leaving her with two small nubs, more akin to a girl on the cusp of puberty. Conversely, the 12-year old girl's chest stretched outwards with her mother's tits, giving her a nice rack under her pink t-shirt, her new nipples were evident since she wasn't wearing a bra of course. <i>\"And again.\"</i> Zoe grinned, waving her hand. The 12-year old busty girl now started filling out all over her pre-teen body, her muscles swelling and expanding under her clothes as her father's physique was transferred to her. <i>My, my, you're a big girl.</i> Zoe laughed, enjoying the power she had over people. \"I think we need to buy you some new clothes sweetie.\" The mother said to her daughter as the family passed near the food stand, when she saw how her daughter's biceps were testing the seams of her t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you Miss?\" The food stand owner suddenly asked Zoe, when it finally was her turn to be served. Zoe jerked her head around, smiling nervously as she was forced to break her attention from the family of three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just a takeaway salad please and a small blueberry muffin.\" Zoe made her order, producing her purse to pay. A couple of minutes later Zoe was on her way back to the salon, with barely enough time to eat her meal. As she shoved a forkful into her mouth, she couldn't help but giggle as she glanced back at the middle-aged food stand owner, who now had to stand on a stool to serve people after having his head swapped onto an 8-year old girl's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was halfway down her salad when she walked back into the salon. Carly was there, tidying her nail desk, when she looked up, smiling as she glanced at her watch. \"Cutting it find love.\" She said to her best friend and employee. Carly looked her usual radiant self, with her stylish, cropped blond hair, and her shapely body dressed in her Beautylicious top (identical to Zoe's, just in a smaller size), a pair of boot-cut, white slacks that hugged her ass and hips, and a pair of black leather stiletto heel pumps that took her height from 5' 2\" to 5' 5\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sorry, there was a que.\" Zoe chuckled, sitting down behind the reception desk to finish off her salad, realizing she'd have to save her muffin while later. Zoe had been dieting for weeks now, but she felt like she was entitled to a treat now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, we've got a slow afternoon anyway, our next two clients both just cancelled.\" Carly sighed, as she sat down and crossed her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe frowned a little. \"Oh, that sucks.\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly nodded as she flicked through her diary. \"Yeah, but maybe we should take this as a message that we should go and buy some supplies. We're running low on wax strips and several colors of nail polish.\" She told Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Wilkos?\" Zoe muttered, eliciting a nod from her friend and employer. Zoe then sat back for a moment and smiled, recalling each and every swap she had just made to the passersby outside. Not only had it been fun, it had also turned her on, she rubbed her thighs together under her skirt as she felt her pussy getting wet. And with her and Carly now having to pop down to Wilkos, Zoe smirked at the thought of having some more fun with all the customers there, but also the many store employees who worked there, some of home Zoe knew by name and often talked to, such as Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is going to be very... enjoyable</i>. Zoe mused, as she glanced back over to Carly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls both clicked their heels in unison as they headed toward Wilko. Little did Carly know, Zoe wasn't only going shopping for simple beauty supplies she planned on going swapping for body parts as well. Zoe snuck a peek at Carly who was fixing her hair in her small compact mirror. \"If only she knew....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before heading into the store, Zoe saw a brand new mother to two baby twin girls, breast-feeding both of them simultaneously. She had quite a bit of trouble holding them both up at the same time. Sitting next to her on the bench was her young handsome husband. \"Honey, could you hold one of them up to my breast? My arms are getting tired.\" The husband looked frustrated by this request and used his hand to provide support to the girl sucking on her right tit. Zoe found a way to take some weight of the woman's shoulders.... and her breasts. A young, pregnant girl in her late teens was walking and holding hands with her boyfriend. Her breasts had swelled to a very large size during her pregnancy due to milk production. The girl was wearing a long maternity dress and rubbed her large belly. Zoe settled on swapping their heads. Their heads were swallowed by their bodies and then reappeared on the other's body. The man had soon sat back down and spread his legs open to let his pregnant belly hang down a bit. \"Here, hand over Gracie.\" He seemed much more gentle and helpful now. He pulled down the maternity dress, exposing his left breast as his little girl latched on. The husband and wife were now each feeding one of their baby girls. Meanwhile, the young teen boy and the teen girl with the man's body, with a decent bulge in her pants, walked out in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe smirked and headed inside the doors with Carly. \"Zoe, what's the hold up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?....OH, I'm just admiring that man over there. So helpful with his wife, helping her breastfeed and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lucky girl. Not only a helpful man, but also a hot one with a great rack!\" Zoe had a funny look on her face. She was amused that this was normal to Carly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey first saw Steven while heading towards the toiletries and cosmetics aisle. \"Hey, Stevo!\" said Zoe, pointing her fingers towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girls. How's your day going?\" Steven inquired, warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow...and boring. We are just here to get some new supplies mainly.\" Carly interjected before Zoe could continue speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, well, let me know if you ladies need anything. There's a sale on razors, by the way. Have a good one!\" Steven rubbed the back of his hand and turned back to continue mopping the floors. The 6'0\" man scratched his rear end secretively so as not to embarrass himself in front of the girls. But Zoe saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Steven is such a sweetheart,\" Carly said putting her hand on her heart. Zoe listened in a bit, but she was a bit preoccupied in finding a swap part for Carly. She was shopping after all. She remembered how she wanted to try out having a penis. \"Maybe doing a test first would give me a better idea of what it would be like.\" She decided to swap Steven and Carly's genitals. She waved her hand between the two and looked down. She looked over at Carly's white slacks as a long penis started to swell at the front. It lengthened and stretched down her pant leg. Carly immediately stopped and grabbed it. \"Zoe, I'm sorry, but holy shit, my dick hurts.\" She sat down in a nearby waiting area, and Zoe sat down next to her. She saw Steven mopping the floor, his male ass shaking in their face from their POVs. He turned and his work pants were noticeably flat in front, as he had lost his equipment to Carly. Carly continued to rub her dick in pain from it being in her tight slacks. Zoe thought this was the chance to see how her friend Carly's reality had shifted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, sorry if this is forward, Carly, but why are you and your husband getting divorced again? What happened?\" Zoe said this cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Zoe. Like you don't know? He was an asshole, always bossing me around, blaming me for everything and....well, apparently, I could never do anything right! Not to mention, I think he was sleeping around on me, but that's still to be determined!\" Carly was fuming while discussing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleeping around? Really...? He didn't seem the type to....\" Zoe stopped as Carly began to interrupt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the prick is the type. The reason I suspect is because he said he needed to try out a pussy sometime! Can you believe that shit? One of the original reasons he claimed to 'love me' was because he loved my dick. You know what I think? I think he was just jealous mine is a monster compared to his. Yeah, that's it! He couldn't handle my prized python!\" She stroked her dick some more, and judging from the size, Steven (well, Carly) had to be at least 7 inches. \"Yeah, my husband was only average, between you and me. But, I'm packing.\" Carly's mood lightened at that as she nudged Zoe in the breast and wiggled her eyebrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's a penis like?\" Zoe inquired some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's fantastic!\" Carly's eyes lit up. \"I really wish you could experience it, especially when you, well you know...\" Zoe knew well enough. But, she didn't know, neither had she experienced, the ecstasy that Carly seemed to describe in the following minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe eventually stopped her. \"Well, now that you and your husband are almost through, what will you do now?\" Carly thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know really. I wish I could find a guy that would treat me right. Hell, sometimes I think my husband was right. I'd like to try some pussy too, but I'm not into girls.\" Carly sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....what about Steven?\" Zoe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly bellowed. \"Steven....isn't he a virgin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you said it yourself. You said he was a sweetheart. Plus, the fact he's a virgin means you can rock his world, and he'll think it's amazing.....plus, he has a vagina\" Zoe winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's expression turned from amusement to intrigue. \"My darling Steven over there has a pussy? Hmmm. Ouch!\" The thought of her having sex with Steven was too much as her penis was throbbing but was still constrained in her pants. \"Come on, I know they sell some work slacks here. Let's get you into something more comfortable!\" Steven bent over as his ass was pointed straight towards Carly. She just imagined his tight little pussy and had to get her mind off it before she burst at the seams. Zoe was happy for Carly and now, it was time to acquire her own cock. She surveyed the building. Washing the windows was the hunky Aaron. Zoe personally thought he was douchey and narcissistic. But, he did have an amazing physique. She figured this translated to being well-hung. She waved her hand and felt a major tingling in her groin. She felt a pop as a long flesh rod began to protrude from her groin. Her vagina then closed up as she felt two large pops as two new testicles found a home between her feminine thighs. Aaron, on the other hand, continued washing the windows as Zoe's feminine slit formed between his meaty thighs. Zoe rubbed her appendage. As she did, it began to tent her black skirt, making it obvious to a nearby mother who covered her young 7-year-old daughter's eyes from this scene. \"I think I'll get a pair of those work pants too.\" She said as she swapped the penis of a 16-year-old boy with the little girl wearing a sequined black summer dress. The mother no longer felt the need to cover her daughter's eyes since the girl was sporting her normal erection. Her mother just stared at her little girl and couldn't believe how 'big' she was getting. The boy, meanwhile, still had his arms wrapped around his girlfriend, but she longer felt a hard dick up against her ass. The two embraced in a lasting kiss as the groped one another. They left before anyone saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver by the dress slacks, Carly and Zoe picked up a few pairs and were holding them up against their legs, trying to find an attractive pair to wear. \"Ugh, these are atrocious.\" said Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they ain't gonna be pretty. We just need something that's not too tight on our junk but not too loose that it's obvious,\" she said, gesturing to her groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile searching for the most fashionable pair they could find (including a decent color), Zoe thought back to Steven and thought he could use another swap. Just to see how Carly's view of him would change. She swapped the large bust of Liz, the store supervisor, with Steven's flat, hairy chest. Liz's 'balloons' deflated, which was comical, since it was pretty obvious yet neither her nor the man she was helping noticed. Moments later, Steven winced as two large orbs swelled from his chest. They stretched the fabric of his polo shirt to its limits as he reached down to wring out the mop. He then tripped over his shoe falling straight on his breasts. \"Fuck that hurt!\" He got to his feet and rubbed his nipples. Good thing he was wearing a bra, his shirt was all soaking wet after he fell chest-first on the floor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Carly, what about Steven's breasts? How do you even feel about those?\" Zoe stared at her friend and co-worker, eagerly awaiting a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's eyes made their way over to Steven's bust. \"He can't help the way he was born. I mean, I'm not complaining. They are huge!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BE honest, girl, you would totally fuck those tits.\" Zoe giggled and shoved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly laughed. \"You're such a dirty bitch,\" she shoved her back, teasing. \"I mean, I definitely wouldn't say no to a tit job if he offered. She licked her lips seductively. She was almost drooling over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe peered back at Liz, who was done showing the middle-aged man to the lumber aisle. \"Eh, why not hand out some more 'lumber'? She swapped the penis from the man onto Liz and a modest bulge appeared in the front of her boot-cut trousers. The man walked away with his wife, emasculated. Zoe planned on swapping her back soon enough. They hadn't been in Wilko but ten minutes. There was still plenty of time for more. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Not sure I can wait to get back to the salon before changing into some of these.\" Carly winced again as she draped several pairs of pants over her arm. Her and Zoe's leering at Steven's tits and thoughts of screwing Steven's virgin brains out had given her the most uncomfortable 'stiffy'. Her current white slacks, skin-tight, left nothing to the imagination, and also compressed her balls as well as her shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always warned you against wearing trousers that tight luv.\" Zoe responded with a cheeky grin. \"I mean.. it would be fine if you were like other girls, but you have a dick and it needs room to breath.\" She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says you, slut.\" Carly joked back at her friend, gesturing down to the obvious bulge in Zoe's black skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe grinned. \"Hey I never pretended to be a good girl. And I only want to wear pants now for appearance sake, you saw the way that woman looked at me when she saw me pitching a tent over here.\" She said, gesturing down to her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda funny since her daughter was pitching one in her dress,\" Carly chuckled, as she remained completely unaware of the fact her best friend had swapped her vagina for Steven's penis. \"I swear some of these younger girls are so lucky having such a big dick at that age.\" Carly then commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right. She'll be popular with the boys in school for sure.\" Zoe laughed, as the two penis-packing beauticians both walked over to the cosmetics section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Carly was browsing the nail varnish, picking out several colors they needed back at the salon, Zoe's attention turned to a couple of new customers who had just entered the store. A buff looking man and his petite, skinny blonde girlfriend. <i>Oh please... they're practically begging to be swapped.</i> Zoe grinned, shaking her head in disbelief as she flicked her wrist again, swapping the heads of the couple onto each other's bodies. The skinny blonde was now not so skinny anymore, in fact she was ripped with her boyfriend's body, wearing a tight black t-shirt and jeans sporting a huge bulge that dwarfed both Carly's and Zoe's own penises. \"Much better!\" Zoe said, smirking in satisfaction as she then glanced at the man's head on his girlfriend's skinny, 5' 2\" body wearing a loose white top, denim shorts and pink sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carly, Zoe, nice to see you both!\" A familiar voice suddenly got the beauticians' attention, and Zoe turned to see Liz there, looking somewhat shrunken without her big boobs distending her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Liz, how are you?\" Carly answered back, as Zoe just smiled, taking a quick glance down to the supervisor's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, been a busy day, and we've had some really awkward customers in. Including one who trailed mud all through the store on his boots, that's why I got Steven mopping the floor.\" Liz sighed, gesturing over to Steven, who now sported her former 30H-cup tits. With each thrust of the mop, his mammoth breasts sloshed around under his polo shirt, which caused stirrings in the crotches of all three women as they looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people don't care if they cause a mess.\" Carly shook her head, glancing down at the floor, which was now mostly clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, buying a 'few' pairs of trousers huh?\" Liz then commented, seeing the bundle of clothes in Carly's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly nodded, flicking her blonde bangs out of her face while looking a little embarrassed. \"Yes, well... made the mistake of wearing trousers this morning that are way too tight on my dick.\" She said quietly, moving the clothes she was carrying enough to one side to reveal the outline of her long penis tucked down her pant leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz winced at the sight. \"Wow, yeah, that looks... painful actually. I never liked wearing tight trousers, but then again I'm not as 'big' as you two.\" She chuckled, referring to the middle-aged prick that now filled her knickers, courtesy of Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its not how big it is, its how you use it right?\" Zoe winked, nudging the much shorter Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So true girl,\" Liz nodded, \"and I've had no complaints from Eric so far.\" She winked back at the tall beautician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while they talked, Zoe felt the blood pumping through her new cock, and she could feel herself getting hornier. Her balls were churning, she knew it, and she'd have to find the time to release some 'pressure' soon enough. She could only grin at the thought of wanking herself off back at the salon in between seeing clients. Hell, maybe one of her lesbian clients like Joanne might be willing to assist her in the task. Zoe grinned as she got lost in her thoughts, and her large penis strained against her ill-fitting knickers further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zo?\" Carly brought her friend back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, daydreaming there.\" Zoe apologized, as she adjusted her skirt a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz glanced at her watch. \"Well as much as I'd love to chat all day with you girls, I have to get back to work, I'll speak to you both later okay?\" She beamed, before giving both beauticians a quick hug and walking off to check on Aaron's progress cleaning the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ahh that was fun.</i> Zoe smirked to herself, as Carly went back to picking the cosmetics they needed for the salon. Zoe didn't help Carly in choosing the items they needed to buy, instead she took a long look around at the people in the store with them. From the middle-aged man who now had Liz's pussy between his legs, to the rest of Liz's employees going about their usual business. <i>I'm sure Liz won't mind if I amuse myself a little further</i>. Zoe grinned, feeling her cock throb again as she looked over at the now flat-chested supervisor ordering Aaron around at the front of the shop.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zoe and Carly had picked out their pants and were satisfied, though the dirt brown color wasn't ideal to neither of them. \"At least the brown matches our tops....well, kinda.\" Carly stated disappointedly. Zoe looked at the pants she was to purchase and determined that she didn't care. As long as no one would notice her new equipment, brown was the perfect color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were still searching for different shades of lipstick as well as some eyeliner. Carly was more involved in finding the supplies they needed for Beautylicious while Zoe was much more preoccupied, naturally. She stole a glance back at Liz who was started to get a bit aggravated with Aaron. Apparently, he was trying to half-ass the job, and Liz was having none of it. \"Boy, she really has a pair of balls,\" Zoe said, but she meant it figuratively even though Liz now had a literal pair dangling between her legs. She felt slightly guilty for Liz, considering the penis she had given her was of a total stranger. Looking back at the man, she saw him heading arm-in-arm with his thunder-thigh wife toward the exit! Zoe quickly waved her hand, and her vagina was soon back at home between Liz's legs. \"Oh, I promise it's only a temporary layover,\" she smiled. Josh, washing the windows alongside Aaron, stood idly by as Liz yelled at Aaron. He didn't have to endure Liz's wrath due his adequate job. \"Why can't you be more like Josh?\" Liz said, as Josh cheesed a smug smile towards Aaron who looked ticked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about, why can't Josh be more like Aaron?\" said Zoe, as she emasculated the man to match Aaron. Josh's work khakis deflated in front, and he absentmindedly responded by tightening his belt by a few loops. Liz leaned back slightly as a protrusion began to emerge from her groin. Once again, the flesh rod slowly grew out from above her feminine vagina as it once again closed, leaving no traces of its existence between her legs. This was followed by two large testicles that popped out, one after the other. Josh, nearly the same age as Liz, turned out to be an ideal target. He seemed to be much more well hung compared to the previous man's phallus. Liz scratched her cock and left to go elsewhere, irritated at the moment with Aaron's work ethics. Aaron cussed out Josh for being a suck up as the two pussy-bearing men returned to washing the windows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was wondering something else. She was wondering if her power extended beyond just switching people in person. There were a couple of magazines near the check-out register that featured some models in bikinis and swimsuit wear. None of it seemed too risque. She wondered, though. Surveying the area, she looked for a swap that she could find amusing. She spotted a married couple in their 60s. The slim wife wore jeans and a purple blouse with a small white jacket over that. She seemed very spry and moved around very well for her age. Her husband was a tall, 6' 5\" man, who let himself go over the years, though his body wasn't as bad compared to some of the other regular customers. He had a belly covered by his flannel shirt, which was tucked into his jeans with a black belt holding them up. He didn't move around as well as his wife, however. Zoe focused on a buxom, young 5' 5\" tall woman, wearing panties in a bra on one of the covers of the magazines. Her B-cup breasts were not her most prominent feature. That belonged to her huge jiggling butt. Zoe focused on the woman and tried to swap her head with the elderly man. Ouila! The man was still walking beside his wife, but he now clicked alongside of her in a lace bra, panties and heels. The purple set of undergarments left little to the imagination. The grey-haired man's wife walked behind him, watching his tantalizing ass sway back-and-forth in her face as she stared approvingly. He slapped his tight butt check, causing it to wobble. \"Gertrude, not in public!\" She shrugged her shoulders. Back on the magazine cover, the blonde beauty now had an elderly man's podgy body beneath her pretty head. However, she no longer was wearing the man's clothes, but was rather modeling a male speedo. Her large gut, complete with grey chest hair hung over her speedo, which concealed her wrinkled package. The woman continued to smile, as she had been born this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, interesting and hilarious. Should I swap her back?\" Zoe pondered, but decided against it....for now. She had a photographic memory and her power allowed her to exchange people in multiple ways. She could always swap them back by just thinking about them. The man adjusted his bra, jiggling his B-cup assets. She knew to keep this mind for the future. For now though, she would focus on the Wilko family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back toward Steven, she saw the large mammaries swaying back and forth underneath his polo as he leaned over a new corner of the store to begin mopping. His tits must have been slapping together as he swished the mop. He winced and reached back to rub his back as he momentarily stopped. Still wanting him to keep a pair of tits (just in case Carly and him hooked up), she decided to swap Liz's large mammaries onto Natalie. The young Natalie's work polo contained her perky young breasts. Zoe watched as her bust swelled up to Liz's H-cup size. Zoe smiled as she knew Natalie's fiance Mike would love sucking on those babies. Steven now didn't slouch over as much as the weight on his chest was considerably less. His breasts were also perkier and housed large, pink, puffy nipples. Zoe saw them healthily bounce underneath his polo as Steven hummed a tune in his deep voice. She knew Steven could give one heck of a tit job with those beautiful assets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with this, she turned to Natalie. She still thought it would be much more amusing if a man had to handle Liz's breasts, but she didn't want to take the gift she had just given to Natalie. Shaun was the guy she had in mind. She thought the well-built man could use some nice big breasts to compliment his big muscular arms. Luckily, Zoe caught sight of a curvy, 27-year-old brunette who was headed toward the cosmetics aisle. Just walking in the door, her white top displayed her generous cleavage, courtesy of her G-cup breasts, to the world. The woman clicked in her heels and arrived to the aisle, immediately searching for a burgundy-colored lipstick. \"Perfect,\" said Zoe. She didn't mind swapping a random part with a customer when it came to breasts. Her line was drawn at permanently swapping genitals between a customer and an employee. She waved her hands and she swapped Natalie's (Liz's) breasts over to Shaun, the woman's breasts to Natalie, and Shaun's muscular, hairy pectorals to the woman. The woman's G-cups deflated, revealing a flat chest that began to take shape. Two muscles under either one of her feminine nipples. The nipples then shrunk in size, forming into Shaun's male nipples. Hair then began to sprout on her chest as she briefly looked at herself. She grabbed a razor and looked at it, but then decided against it. She, however, did pick up some \"Just for Men\" hair dye touch-up. She thought dying her chest hair from a gray to a dark brown to match her beautiful head of hair would make the guys drool over her. With the Just for Men and lipstick in her hand,  she headed to the check-out. Focusing on Shaun, Zoe saw his chest balloon outward as two massive breasts appeared. She saw the nipples under his fabric grow in size and stand erect. \"Hehe, must be cold in here,\" Shaun rubbed his nipples with both hands. Zoe only imagined how his girlfriend would love those babies. Meawnwhile, Nat lucked out. Her breasts were a couple of years younger and were much bigger than her original breasts. They weren't too big, though, that her back would hurt from their weight, like Liz's. She assumed with his strong back muscles that Shaun could more than handle those things. And was she ever right! Shaun, just radioed over to the pet food aisle to stack some food, jogged easily as his massive assets flailed about. He slowed himself a bit, not because they were too much to handle, but because he was afraid of putting someone's eye out with those things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit down the aisle, Zoe recognized another face. It was Mark! But, he was dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. And his girlfriend was there. \"I think her name is Vicki??\" Zoe said curiously. \"Hm, must be his day off.\" She concluded. Vicki was looking at tampons as Mark kind of twiddled his thumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up, Vic. The movie starts in 25 minutes!\" Mark tried to rush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Mark. 5 minutes please! I need to pick the right brand.\" Vicki said, frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, they all do the same thing. Just pick one!\" Mark threw his hands up and aggressively grabbed a box. He extended it out to Vicki with a blank look as if to say 'here, take it and let's go already'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't understand. The right brand makes a difference. Not to mention the right type!\" Vicki received the bow before waving it in Mark's face and placing it back on the shelf. Her expression was a rebuttal that was saying 'how about, give me some damn time. I'll be ready when I find the right brand!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he'll understand alright.\" Zoe flashed a mischievous grin and waved her hands. Suddenly, Mark's pants deflated in front as his penis was sucked up into his body. This left a hole that morphed into his girlfriend's hormonal nether region. He now had Vicki's vagina between his manly legs. Vicki winced as a noticeable pop was heard by Zoe herself. The front of the girl's jean skirt began to bulge out as she gained Mark's equipment. Now, Mark was the one complaining to Vicki to let him take his time. She looked at her watch, concerned they'd miss the movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking forever, plus, we don't get to have sex this week because of your period. This sucks!\" Vicki folded her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you stop complaining, I'll give you a blow job.\" said Mark, compromising. Vicki's ears perked up, and she sealed her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was satisfied.....for now. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm, why stop there Zoe.\" Zoe chuntered to herself, smirking as she studied the couple in front of her. Not content with just giving lanky Mark his girlfriend's vagina, Zoe went further, flicking her wrist a few more times. She watched Mark's jeans suddenly fill out considerably in the rear as his ass expanded into his girlfriend's shape, then with the second flick... his long, hairy legs began shrinking by several inches and becoming smooth, shapely. And with the third sharp wave of Zoe's hand, Mark's size 12 feet rapidly shrank in his sneakers, becoming his girlfriend's slender feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicki meanwhile underwent the opposite changes, her prominent ass deflated under her denim skirt, her legs cracked and stretched out as they gained a thick coating of hair, and then her feet began growing inside her shoes, but as they threatened to rip them apart... Zoe expertly flicked her wrist again and swapped the couple's clothes from the waist down too. Vicki's skirt began to lengthen and cover her now hairy legs as they morphed into Mark's jeans, and then her knickers changed into her boyfriend's boxers and Mark's socks appeared on her massive new feet as her girly sneakers morphed into Mark's masculine ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark, who was now wearing his girlfriend's skirt and had his shapely new legs on display, finally picked out the tampons he wanted and Vicki rolled her eyes in relief. \"God, finally!\" She groaned, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't start on me,\" Mark whined, looking up at his now slightly taller girlfriend, \"it would be different if you were the one having the period instead of me.\" He grumbled, nudging her in the gut as he walked back up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing it's not then isn't it babe.\" Vicki grinned, cupping her package as she leaned in to kiss Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Zoe grinned from the sidelines, as she felt her cock twitching under her skirt. She had a full blown erection, and all this swapping was only turning her on more. As she let Mark and Vicki go about their business, she turned her attention to another couple of customers nearby. This time her targets were a woman in her early forties and her teenage son, who looked to be about 18 years old. Problem was, while the son was in good physical shape, his attitude sucked, as Zoe saw when he didn't even offer to help his own mother carry a heavy bag of compost to the checkout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a dick!\" Zoe scowled towards the teenager. \"You don't deserve that upper body strength.\" She ordained, much like an omnipotent being. Again, Zoe's hand quickly moved through the air in a sweeping motion and the fun began. The woman, named Carrie, 42, suddenly found carrying the compost to be much easier as her back muscles strengthened, her shoulders broadened, her biceps swelled against the sleeves of her white cardigan and underneath her tank top... her abs firmed up into a six-pack... her son's to be exact. Even the woman's hands had swelled in size, losing their manicure as they became her son's hands. Last to go were her sagging, D-cup breasts... which deflated into her now muscled chest, forming into male pectorals. \"Come on Scott, pick your feet up.\" The mother chastized her son, as she carried the compost easily on one shoulder now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes to the son had amused Zoe even more. His shoulders narrowed, his arms lost their muscle and gained fat instead, his washboard abs disappeared as he gained a gut more befitting a middle-aged woman and his once well-defined chest exploded outwards into his mother's sagging tits, his large areolas and nipples evident under his t-shirt... which was stretched to its limits. \"And of course...\" Zoe grinned, quickly swapping the mother's upper body clothing with her son's, giving her his muscle t-shirt, while the son now wore his mother's bra, tank top and cardigan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done.\" Zoe said, briefly following the mother and son towards the checkout. With another quick wave of her hand, Zoe swapped the son's cock with that of a 5-year old boy walking hand in hand with his mother in another aisle. The little boy's shorts bulged out massively in front with his new 7 incher, while the lazy son's jeans deflated in front as his penis shrank into a nub. \"Excellent Zoe, well done.\" Came the self-congratulatory pat on the back that Zoe gave herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zo, what about this color lipstick to expand our range?\" Carly turned to her friend, still holding the collection of work pants in her arms. She held up a tube of lipstick for Zoe to look at. But Zoe was more interested in staring admiringly at Steven's former cock... tucked into her best friend's tight slacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nice, I like it.\" Zoe nodded, clicking over to Carly in her high heels. Zoe normally wore flat shoes to work, but every now and then she liked to be taller than most of those around her. With her heels on, Zoe stood 6' 1\" in height, compared to Carly's 5' 5\" with her stiletto heels on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll buy a few of those as well then.\" Carly smiled, before wincing again as she felt her penis pulsate in its fabric prison. As Carly collected the lipstick, Zoe briefly reached down to rub her hard on through her skirt, grinning the whole time. Then she walked over to a stack of baskets nearby and picked one up. Carly threw their shopping into the basket, which was on wheels, and began pulling it behind them as they shopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you going to make a move on him or not?\" Zoe asked Carly out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you talking about Zo?\" Carly answered with a slight frown etched on her gorgeous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm talking about Steven. He's single, right? And a virgin remember. He'd never cheat on you, I think you'd make a great couple.\" Zoe said to Carly as they clicked through the aisles together. Steven was not in sight right now, but Carly had to admit, Steven did look pretty hot to her right now. Those succulent C-cup tits hiding under his Wilko shirt, and she could imagine that tight little pussy of his ready to be fucked. Little did Carly know that Steven's vagina used to be hers up until moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop playing matchmaker Zo, you're married remember. That means you're not qualified.\" Carly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah ah, I beg to differ. Its means I'm fully qualified, my relationship was a success, me and Chris were perfect for each other.\" Zoe winked, bragging off a little. \"We're proof that having two dicks in a relationship doesn't foil your love, it enhances it.\" She said, toying with Carly a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but if not for a surrogate mother, Rissi would not have been born.\" Carly retorted, referring to Zoe's young daughter Arissia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but it was still Chris' sperm, and I breastfed the little muffin.\" Zoe grinned, feeling her cock get ever harder. It felt as though it was about to rip straight through her cotton knickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Carly laughed, \"if it will shut you up, I'll ask Steven if he wants to go out one night, okay?\" She said to Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl.\" Zoe winked. \"You can be the one who breaks him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carly shook her head and smiled at her friend's attempts to hook her up with Steven, Zoe turned her attention back to the people around her, and another couple of the Wilko staff caught her attention. She recognized the male employee as Rob, though she'd never spoken to him personally herself, and the petite Japanese woman who was his co-worker was called Naomi. Zoe didn't know her at all, but could already tell she was a nice enough person. \"Rob, can you just put these bottles on the top shelf please? I can't reach.\" Naomi asked her colleague, who let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever heard of a ladder Naomi? They're wonderful things.\" Rob responded as he walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't need one now luv.\" Zoe grinned again, waving her hand. Rob's and Naomi's heads were sucked down into their bodies momentarily... then seconds later they re-emerged atop each other's forms. Both looked a little confused, but after blinking a couple of times, they carried on as normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you expect me to reach that shelf?\" Rob asked, putting his dainty hands on his hips. Rob's head, complete with short dark hair and a bit of facial stubble, was now attached to Naomi's 5' 1\" body, dressed in her work shirt, black skirt, tights and ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, it doesn't matter, I can reach it myself.\" Naomi muttered, causing Rob to roll his eyes and return to what he was doing. Naomi adjusted her 6-inch cock in her pants and then picked her box back up to continue working, oblivious to her head swap with her male co-worker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zoe and Carly proceeded down the aisle the two employees were on, Zoe couldn't help herself when she saw Rob struggling to reach the second to top shelf, even when standing on his dainty tip toes. \"You should get a ladder luv, they're wonderful things.\" She teased Rob, who was now a full foot shorter than she was in her heels. Carly nudged Zoe slightly and giggled at her comment as she two continued browsing the store's aisles together.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, As the day got later, she just felt a little bored. Then she realized, duh, of course, she had something that could make the day a lot more fun -- her power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the women currently in the various chairs. Two of them caught her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was an elderly old lady, Mrs. Pope. She was a demanding, cranky old client, but everyone always greeted her with warmth and a smile, because they all knew she had money. Was being rich a trait? Zoe decided she had to try. Right after doing so, Mrs. Pope snapped at the young woman cutting her hair. Unlike normal, the woman snapped back, saying that if she didn't like the service, she could go somewhere else. Zoe smiled. Without all that money, people were a lot less tolerant of Mrs. Pope's rudeness. And of course, Zoe knew her bank account had just benefited as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the woman next to Mrs. Pope. Zoe didn't know her name. She was probably only about 18 or 19 years old. Zoe looked at her and concentrated hard. She noticed crow's feet start to appear in the corner of the young woman's eyes. Her breasts started to sag just a little bit. Zoe felt a little bad about it until she looked at herself. She had swapped ages with the young woman and was now about a dozen years younger. She smiled. She could really get used to these powers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all started on that stormy summer night when the dark clouds came rolling in, blocking all the stars and the moon from view. The wind kicked in and the first raindrops started to fall. Moments later, the rain started coming down harder and harder, and it was followed by rumbles of thunder and bright flashes of lightning everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was home alone that evening. She had just returned home from completing her shift at Wilko that evening when the calm evening turned into a stormy night. She let her dog out and she turned on the lights everywhere. She quickly made some soup and a sandwich in the kitchen then lightning struck very close by, scaring her and Bear, her little cocker spaniel. The loud thunder was followed by all the lights going out in the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! An outage!\u201d she sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went looking for that little flashlight, which she found in the kitchen. When she tried to switch it on, she noticed that a very faint ray of light emitted from the lightbulb. The batteries were almost dead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! This is useless! Come on, Bear! Let\u2019s go in the bedroom!\u201d she said to her dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully walked into the bedroom, feeling her way around the dark house. When she got into the room, she crawled on her bed, allowing her dog to lay next to her. As thunder and lightning continued to light up the sky outside, she covered herself completely with her sheets and closed her eyes. She dozed off in just a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the strangest dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a pleasant voice. A voice of a young man calling out to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura! Laura!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? I\u2019m here! I\u2019m right here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Very good! It is time for you to receive your powers, dear Laura!\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of powers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, you are a Goddess, my sweet girl! You can do everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wait and see when you wake up in the morning. You will be in complete control!\u201d he answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn control? Of what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely everything. Goodbye, Laura!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, Laura was awakened by Bear\u2019s tongue licking her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Bear! Stop\u2026 Okay, I\u2019m up! I\u2019m awake!\u201d she groaned as she glanced at the clock. But the time was incorrect since it was blinking. The power had returned following the nasty thunderstorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked for her cell phone and she slowly got out of bed. It was probably time to get up anyway since she had to go back to work. Then, she remembered the strange dream she had. Something about her becoming\u2026 A Goddess? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at her digital clock, which was blinking. She quietly wished it was showing the current time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the display changed and it was showing the current time! It was 7:14 AM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! The clock got fixed\u2026 All by itself?\u201d she sighed. \u201cOr\u2026 Did I just do that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she stared at her messy bed in her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy bed needs to be made and my clothes need to be laid out on my bed right now\u201d she uttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, her bed was neatly made up with the sheets and the covers straightened out. All her work clothes were spread out across her bed, including her pants, her Wilko shirt, her socks, her panties and her bra. All she had to do was take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh wow\u2026 Something weird going on\u2026 I just need to take a nice shower with warm water\u2026\u201d she mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had instantly teleported to her bathroom where she was standing in the shower stall with nice, warm water running over her body. Everything she wanted was happening, exactly the way she liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, this feels so good\u2026 I\u2019m gonna have a good day at work!\u201d she smiled as she grabbed the bar of soap. She couldn\u2019t wait to go to work now, as a young Goddess who was in complete control of everything!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A grin appeared across the omnipotent girl\u2019s face as she realized how easy everything was now. She could literally do anything she wanted, no limitations whatsoever. After conjuring up a quick meal, she then teleported herself to work instantaneously, appearing at the front entrance of Wilkos. <i>Nice!</i> She smirked, nodding before strolling in the front doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Laura.\u201d Liz greeted her when she walked by the front help desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt certainly is.\u201d Laura replied, as the numberlock on the door leading upstairs began operating by itself... by Laura\u2019s command. The door then swung open and Laura walked through and headed upstairs. In the tea room, she saw the usual faces of her co-workers, some of whom greeted her, like Nicola and Rebekah, and some who didn\u2019t bother, such as Aaron and Charlotte. Laura just smiled at everyone and made a hot cup of coffee appear on the table in front of her. She might have been all powerful now, but she still had a taste for her favorite beverage. While she was sat there, she looked around at the tea room, which she had always thought looked drab, not to mention the cracks in the ceiling in places. \u201cHardly a fitting work place for a goddess.\u201d Laura said, waving her hand as she smiled. The entire room changed, luxury curtains appearing in the window overlooking the street below, a coat of pink paint appearing on the walls and a fancy artexed ceiling also appearing. Several picture frames and other decorations sprang up throughout the room, giving it a more cosy feel. All her other co-workers said nothing as this all happened, since Laura had wished that they didn\u2019t react/notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Liz\u2019s voice sounded over the tannoy, calling all her staff members onto the shop floor to start work. As everyone else walked over to the sink to wash their cups and put them back in the cupboard, Laura just made her cup disappear. They all then went downstairs to start work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Laura noticed when she got downstairs, was a customer struggling to reach something on a top shelf. The woman was in her thirties, Laura estimated, was obviously a mother since two kids were nearby. \u201cI bet they\u2019re a handful for such a short woman.\u201d Laura thought, noticing the woman was only about 5\u2019 tall, roughly the same height as Nicola. Laura decided to give the woman a helping hand and she spotted another customer not far away, a young single man who was about 6' in height. \u201cUp you go luv.\u201d She chuckled, looking at the mother as she held a hand out and raised it slowly. As she did so... the woman began growing in height... gaining a full foot in height, making her 6\u2019 tall. Conversely, the male customer was shrunk down to the woman's former height. Both their outfits automatically altered to fit and neither reacted, as per Laura's wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling proud of herself for that little change, Laura then followed her co-workers to the help desk to get their work assignments from Liz.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura was assigned to the checkout counter which was located near the far back corner of the store, right by the exit. In a way, it was a nice spot, because it was near a dead corner where there was just a bench and a rack with greeting cards and gift cards located behind her and nothing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after about an hour of standing there and being bored, a man in his 40\u2019s walked in with his teenage son. The boy was a bit stocky and looked like he was about 15 years old or so. Both the man and his son had jet black hair and brown skin. They were obviously from India but they had friendly faces. The boy wore glasses and he looked like one of those nerdy smart kids in school who got the highest grades in class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Tanmay, I\u2019m going to look for those blinds that mother wanted. So, just sit over here and wait for me, okay? After that, I\u2019ll take you to soccer practice!\u201d the father said to the boy, who sat down on the bench behind Laura\u2019s register. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man walked away, leaving the boy behind. Obviously, the boy was bored out of his skull. But, being in plain sight of a Goddess just meant that she could have some fun with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura used her powers and scanned his mind. She discovered that his name was Tanmay and that he was in fact 14 years old, but he looked older because he was tall for his age. The boy was indeed almost 6 feet tall although he was a little pudgy. He was extremely smart and had the highest grades in his class. But his dad was very tough on him and never let him have any fun, which explained why he was a bit overweight. Tanmay had a lot of admiration for gymnasts and wrestlers and he just played soccer for fun even though he was terrible at it. He did it just to stay in shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to fix up our Indian kid\u2026\u201d Laura thought to herself as she quietly decided to take over Tanmay\u2019s body. \u201cI want complete control over this kid\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanmay felt an odd tingling sensation as he sat on the bench, looking over at the shelves and the long aisles before him. He was so bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, buddy\u2026 Stand up so you can grow\u2026 More muscle!\u201d Laura whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanmay suddenly had an urge get up from the bench, for no reason at all. He had to stretch his long, brown legs. Luckily, he was wearing shorts. Suddenly, he was overcome by that weird, tingling feeling again. His calves inflated with more muscle, growing into firm, hard muscle the size of soccer balls. The confused boy reached down with his hand and felt his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with my legs?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, his quads started to grow in every direction, growing thicker, wider and deeper. Layers of muscle appeared above his knees, giving him the look of a cyclist or a runner from the summer Olympics. His quads grew and became so wide, that they filled out his shorts and became wider than his waist! Laura quickly transformed his shorts into smooth, Lycra shorts which neatly covered his thick, bulging thighs and his groin, with a nice bulge visible in the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026. What the heck?\u201d Tanmay groaned, feeling his thighs grow with insane muscle. As he looked down, he realized that his legs now resembled those of a junior bodybuilder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura just giggled as she watched the poor, confused, Indian teenage boy. He looked so cute with those thick, muscular legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s gonna improve your soccer game a lot, my friend\u2026\u201d Laura grinned, as she focused on his upper body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Tanmay felt his upper body tingle all over the place! His torso grew wider and wider, his flat stomach suddenly sported a set of very well-defined six-pack abdominal muscles, and his pectorals bulged from his chest, pushing outwards and sideways like two large orbs of large spheres of rock-hard muscle. His shoulders grew incredibly thick and wide, showing large muscular lumps of delts on top and wide lats under his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, his biceps and triceps inflated all at once, causing the muscles on his arms to inflate so quickly that it looked like he had a pair of bowling balls implanted in them! Tanmay had a huge set of muscles on his arms, forcing him to make fists and flex his enlarged guns as he was standing in the back of the store, almost ripping the sleeves of his shirt to pieces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026. Holy shit!!\u201d the boy gasped as he felt a surge of physical power course through his body like he had just finished a grueling workout in the gym. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a small mirror appeared on the back wall, and Tanmay turned around and studied his reflection in it. He could only smile when he realized how buff he had become. He looked like a nerdy kid with a body of a total jock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly frick!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura almost doubled over laughing as she studied the expression on the boy\u2019s face. Oh, this was so much fun! She just LOVED this and she was determined to grow more muscle on other guys. This was just the coolest trick EVER she could do with her Goddess-powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make things less obvious for Tanmay and his friends and family, she altered reality so that nobody would ever find it strange that the teen suddenly became big and buff in the store. That way, everybody would find it perfectly normal for him to be so muscular. In fact, she implanted in him the urge to get a membership in the gym and to continue to work out and lift weights. In addition, she would make it extremely EASY for Tanmay\u2019s muscles to grow! Just by working out a little bit, Tanmay would grow bigger and stronger very quickly from now on, so next time he would visit the store, he would be even BIGGER! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was very pleased with her work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Laura do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Laura served a woman who had walked up to her counter, Laura took a brief moment to peer into her mind. Her name was Sophie, who was in the middle of a messy divorce with her husband Brad, and she was on her way to meet up with her best friend Louisa for a coffee and a chat. Sophie was in her mid thirties now, and as Laura delved into her mind, she saw how unhappy she was with her life as it was currently. Laura decided she'd be better off with a woman instead. Since her friend Lousia was bisexual, Laura tweaked Sophie's sexual preferences to make her a lesbian. Seeing a young girl walk past close by, Laura also siphoned off a few years of Sophie's age and gave them to the 10-year old, making her 15 and Sophie thirty again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice day ma'am.\" Laura the Goddess said to the woman after serving her. No sooner had Sophie left the store with her shopping, Laura spotted another customer entering, a boy of about 12 years old, accompanied by his older brother and his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two siblings were talking about something, but Laura only caught the last part of the conversation. The older brother, Derek, 18, smirked at his little brother. \"Yeah well maybe when you're as big as me kiddo.\" He said, patting his younger brother Leo's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura took 'bigger' in its most base sense, glancing down at Leo's jeans. Laura's nose wrinkled a little and she pointed at the pre-teen boy, who suddenly stopped dead in his tracks when he felt a weird tingle in his crotch. \"Bigger!\" Laura whispered to herself, as she willed Leo's genitals to grow. Leo winced a little and stared down in disbelief as he felt his dick growing... pushing against the fabric of his underpants. Going from roughly 3 inches to six inches was quite a growth spurt, and Leo's balls expanded in tandem as they started churning. The onset of puberty for Leo had arrived months early thanks to Laura, and his cock was now comparable to a grown man's (he was now more well hung than his brother was). \"Enjoy kid.\" Laura smirked, as Leo hobbled after his family, who would think it normal for him to be so 'blessed' in the genital department. For an extra boost to Leo's confidence, before he was out of sight, Laura added some muscles to his small frame, as she had done with Tanmay... but not quite as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Laura.\" A familiar voice made Laura turn her head. It was Rebekah, one of her co-workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Becky, lovely to see you.\" Laura smiled, waving at the girl. Rebekah used to be her best friend at work, and would still have been had Laura not become an all-powerful goddess. 'Friends' were simply beneath her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've finished the job Liz told me to do, do you um... need help around here?\" Rebekah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, as you can see, its not that busy.\" Laura's reply was abrupt, but truthful. \"But... we can chat if you like.\" She suggested to Rebekah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad idea, what if Liz catches us talking? You know what she can be like.\" Rebekah voiced her concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura just smirked. \"A little chat won't be that bad.\" She said, even as she was also paying attention to other customers and co-workers walking in nearby aisles. She knew that her fun had only just begun. So far she had used her powers to improve people's appearances, give them a helping hand so to speak, but Laura knew her powers could also be used to punish or just plain mess with those less deserving of her divine assistance. She hadn't yet been annoyed by anyone, but the day was still young, and there were a few of her co-workers who were naturally 'annoying'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would just wait to see how each person behaved, and what 'treatment' they warranted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That muscular, Indian teen went home with his dad as a happy camper, even though she could still control his body whenever she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen things got slow and she had nothing to do, she would close her eyes on focus on Tanmay, the 15-year-old Indian muscle boy. She really liked that kid. She could see that he was in his room, reading and studying. So, she decided to have some fun with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from a distance, she could control his cock. Tanmay\u2019s cock suddenly became hard and his balls started to vibrate. He was having an erection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 Oh man!\u201d he groaned, quickly pulling his shorts and his underwear down. His 8-inch cock popped out, hard as a sewer pipe. Of course, the boy had no idea why he had become so aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happened. A thin stream of cum shot from his cock! He started to moan quietly as the orgasm continued. What the heck? The pleasure was intense! After a minute or so, the orgasm ended and his cock became soft and the sticky, white cum was all gone! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026 what happened?\u201d Tanmay gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt great\u2026 strong\u2026 powerful\u2026 and confused, following that sudden orgasm in his bedroom, which came out of nowhere, all thanks to the Goddess who had complete control over his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 Now that I know I can do that, I should try it on someone closer to home\u2026\u201d Laura grinned, silently vowing to return to Tanmay later. The kids at his school could use some more pleasure as well! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, trouble came her way\u2026 for real! It was Liam, the biggest slacker at Wilko! The 18-year-old with long, brown hair in a pony tail. He always had that laid-back attitude! He came strolling buy just as the delivery guys unloaded a pallet of boxed up AC filters. These were very light boxes (filters aren\u2019t very heavy at all, they\u2019re just packaged cardboard) so Liam was checking them out when he spotted Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, hey there cupcake!\u201d he grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Laura smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothin\u2019 much\u2026 Just checking in\u2026 stuff\u2026\u201d he grinned, while looking over Laura from head to toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ought to be checking in the merchandise\u2026. Not your co-workers!\u201d Laura said coolly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026 Yeah\u2026 Right\u2026 You got it!\u201d Liam stuttered, getting the hint that he needed to get back to work. He strolled over to the large stack of filters (stacked 10 feet high) and turned around, looking at Laura as she walked back to her register. Then, he lazily leaned with his shoulder against the stack, assuming it was sturdy enough to support his weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt supported his weight for exactly 3 seconds, until the entire stack of hundreds of filters toppled over, coming down with a large CRASH in the middle of the hard floor, right in front of the register where Laura was working!!!! Not to mention, Liam ended up tumbling to the floor as well! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH NO!\u201d Laura gasped, as she walked over helped him get up. \u201cYou\u2019re such a klutz, Liam! Are you alright?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Yeah\u2026 Thanks\u2026\u201d Liam wheezed, as he got back on his feet, looking over the huge mess he created. Hundreds of thin, rectangular boxes were scattered all over the floor! To make matters worse, they were all sorted by filter size, and now they were all mixed up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Now we gotta sort out this frickin\u2019 MESS\u2026 Ohhh man, Liz is gonna be livid when she sees this!\u201d Liam groaned, as she started to pick up the filters one-by-one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura realized she needed to act quickly. But she had to get rid of Liam for a moment. She turned towards him and willed for Liam\u2019s bladder to fill up to the max, so he had to take a really long piss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 I gotta use the men\u2019s room\u2026 I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d Liam groaned, as he hobbled his way to the bathroom. He needed to urgently expel a LOT of liquid, so he would be gone for at least a minute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Liam was gone and Laura was all alone, she waved her hand and caused all the AC filters to pile up in sorted order, neatly grouped together, the way that they arrived before Liam knocked the stack over a few minutes ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew! That was close!\u201d Laura sighed, just as she spotted Liz walking by and smiling as she spotted the stack of filters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Liam finally returned from using the men\u2019s room, he walked up to Laura and he was amazed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You fixed this mess up really quick!\u201d he exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, I saved your butt this time. Liz was just walking by. You owe me one, hot shot!\u201d Laura said to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? When do you go on break? So, I can\u2026 repay you?\u201d Liam grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can go on my break right now!\u201d Laura said, signing out from her register. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the two walking into the lounge break room, where they sat down for a cup of coffee. They talked for a moment, when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His balls filled up and his cock became rock-hard like a steel pipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhmm\u2026 Holy shit\u2026. Laura! How did you know\u2026. Argh\u2026\u201d Liam gasped as his cock was becoming painful\u2026 He had to unzip his slacks and pull down his underwear\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, my dear\u2026 I\u2019ve seen the male genitals before!\u201d Laura giggled as she watched Liam struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam let his cock come out, which was sticking out like a fire hose. Finally, in the nick of time, a thick stream of white, sticky cum began to stream from the tip of his 7-inch cock, leaking his salty semen all over the hard floor, right in front of the spot where Laura was sitting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrrhhmmm\u2026. I\u2019m sorry! I\u2026 can\u2019t\u2026 help it\u2026. Arrgghh!!\u201d Liam groaned as he was overcome by an unstoppable orgasm which continued for several minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Liam! You\u2019re having this orgasm because of me\u2026 So, enjoy it!\u201d Laura whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh\u2026.. Uhhh\u2026. Say what?\u201d Liam gasped, gasping for air. The orgasm just wouldn\u2019t stop! He was panting and sweating. It felt great but it was wearing him out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m responsible for this orgasm, my friend\u2026 Are you enjoying it?\u201d she grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUHHHH\u2026. It\u2019s too much\u2026. Make it stop! Please!! I\u2019m gonna pass out!\u201d Liam groaned as he continued to squeal and groan in his chair due to the uncontrollable orgasm. \u201cUURRGGGG!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura just waved her hand and the pressure in his cock finally turned down, and the cock went limp and the balls quit pumping. Liam was panting and sweating like a pig!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygod\u2026 Ohhhh wow\u2026 What the hell\u2026.Ohhh man\u2026\u201d Liam said as he just sat there, sweating and gulping for air. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecret\u2026\u201d Laura giggled as she stood up. \u201cAnyway, I gotta go back to my register\u2026. I hope you enjoyed your orgasm\u2026 I can do it again later\u2026. After work!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura got up and turned around. First, she waved her hand, and all the cum disappeared from the floor. The room was completely clean and the odor of semen was gone. Then, she opened the door and walked out, leaving Liam sitting there, all by himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell did she do that?\u201d Liam mumbled as he put his pants on and got up. His pants and his underwear were completely dry, like nothing happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just stumbled out the door, knowing full well that he had just experienced an incredible orgasm in the lounge. Was he dreaming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura just laughed as she went back to work. This was so awesome. She knew how to grow muscle and how to make men have orgasms. What else would she try next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the evening was uneventful for Laura. After she had given Liam his enormous orgasm, the afternoon and evening were pretty quiet. She occasionally closed her eyes and received visions of Tanmay at school and then riding the bus home after class. She picked up on the fact that he HATED to ride the bus because the kids weren\u2019t even allowed to talk on the bus because of the old, grumpy bus driver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe hates to ride the bus, hmm?\u201d Laura wondered. \u201cI need to find some other way to get my boy to school\u2026 But, what? I need something creative\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura went home and enjoyed a salad for dinner at home. She focused on the Indian teen again and saw that he was quietly studying and reading a book on his bed before dozing off. She really liked the kid a lot and she wanted to do something special for him, she just didn\u2019t know yet what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got up the next morning, she closed her eyes and saw that Tanmay was already at school. A couple of boys were standing in a circle and they were bopping a balloon around, in a small area just outside the entrance to the main building. The boys used their hands to volley the balloon to one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne boy hit the balloon too hard and the balloon drifted over to one of the trees, where it rubbed against one of the sharp branches and popped, abruptly ending the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww man\u2026 We lost our balloon! And we still got fifteen minutes before class starts!\u201d one boy named Eric grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes anybody have another balloon?\u201d Aaron wondered out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a balloon but it\u2019s at home! Dang it!\u201d another kid named Charlie sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need something light, that doesn\u2019t weigh anything, just like a balloon\u2026\u201d Tanmay said sadly. \u201cSomething that\u2019s practically weightless\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was following the conversation from her bedroom since she could easily tune into Tanmay\u2019s eyes and ears. She saw everything that Tanmay saw and she heard everything that Tanmay heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA balloon? Weightless? That\u2019s IT! I\u2019ll make him weightless!\u201d Laura cheered. \u201cAnd, I\u2019ll change reality so that everybody will think it\u2019s perfectly normal for Tanmay to be floating around like a balloon! YES!! He\u2019ll love it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn it! I wish we had something we could toss around\u2026\u201d Eric grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAAAAHH!\u201d Tanmay screamed as his feet suddenly left the ground. Tanmay\u2019s body suddenly began to rise up and off the ground and remained floating in mid-air, about four feet above the floor, just as if he was\u2026 weightless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d Aaron shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck out Tanmay! He\u2019s floating!\u201d Eric noted, as he walked over to Tanmay and reached out with his hand and pulled him towards his own body by his right sneaker. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t weigh anything!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean\u2026. Tanmay\u2019s as light as a balloon?\u201d Charlie asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wrapped his hands around Tanmay\u2019s waist and he hurled the boy in Aaron\u2019s direction, sending Tanmay sailing through the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Whooaaaa!\u201d Tanmay gasped as he soared through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got him!\u201d Aaron cheered, extending his arms all the way and catching Tanmay by his waist.  \u201cDamn! He\u2019s as light as a feather!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron lowered Tanmay a bit and looked him in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! You gotta eat, man! You don\u2019t weigh a thing!\u201d Aaron giggled as he turned to face Charlie. \u201cIncoming!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron raised Tanmay high above his head and hurled him through the air like a football, sending the boy soaring through the sky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoooaaaa!\u201d Tanmay shouted. By now, Tanmay was actually starting to enjoy the rides. Also, he realized that his speed would slow down as he came closer to the ground so he wasn\u2019t so scared of crashing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got him!\u201d Charlie cheered, as he ran back far enough to catch Tanmay with his hands. \u201cDamn, dude! You\u2019re like a balloon! What\u2019s going on here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know!\u201d Tanmay gasped. \u201cI just started to float out of nowhere!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the first bell rang, signaling that it was time to enter the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie let go of Tanmay and he grabbed his backpack. The other boys did the same, leaving Tanmay floating around in the schoolyard all by himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGUYS! What about ME?\u201d  Tanmay shouted at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 You can\u2019t walk cause you\u2019re floating\u2026. Sorry, dude!\u201d Aaron said. Aaron ran back and grabbed hold of Tanmay\u2019s hand, running back inside of the building with Tanmay floating behind him like a flag blowing in the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got inside of the classroom, he let go of Tanmay and allowed his friend to float above the chairs and tables in the classroom until the math teacher, Mr. Woodard, came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone take your seats\u2026. Uhhh\u2026 Everyone except Tanmay, of course\u2026 You just float above everybody else\u2026\u201d Mr. Woodard stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the kids just grinned as the watched Tanmay float about 6 feet above their seats and desks, which looked really bizarre but for some reason, all the kids just accepted it as normal. When the class was over, the boys took turns holding Tanmay and taking him to their next class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, this was nothing, yet. Things got REALLY bizarre when classes were over and the students lined up outside to catch the school bus home\u2026 Laura was watching through Tanmay\u2019s eyes and decided to do something very special for her favorite preteen boy\u2026. What does she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The most bizarre thing of all happened when Tanmay got in line for the bus ride home that afternoon. The final bell had rung and all the students were eager to get home, of course. The last thing that stood in the way of total freedom was that dreaded ride home on the school bus. Tanmay hated it with passion. He stood in line, hating every minute of it. The kids waited for the bus driver to let them in so they could all get home and enjoy the rest of the afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s get on board! Everyone, be nice and neat! Get in your seats and stay quiet so we can all get home on time!\u201d the bus driver, Mr. James, shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanmay started to slowly walk towards the main entrance to the bus when something super weird happened. As he strolled to the bus, his body started to levitate! He was still walking when he began to rise up and off the ground, rapidly ascending straight up and into the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026. Whooaaaaa!\u201d Tanmay gasped as he ascended higher and higher. Luckily, he had his backpack strapped around his shoulders. He wasn\u2019t carrying anything in his hands so his entire body remained still, rising upward in the perfect vertical position with his tennis shoes still pointed towards the ground! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Where\u2019s Tanmay going?\u201d one of the boys shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang! How did he do that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh man! I wish I could do that!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sure as hell beats riding the bus home!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanmay started to drift towards his house, floating away from school as his body floated over a hundred feet above the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap! W-w-what is g-g-going on here?\u201d Tanmay stuttered as his body slowly floated over the city, hovering above the streets, the buildings and the crowds below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tanmay floated high above and looked down, he saw several people looking up at him, wondering what was keeping him afloat so high above the ground? All they could see was a preteen boy floating above the ground without any wires, parachute, wings, balloon or anything! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanmay recognized the buildings and the streets as he looked down. He spotted some landmarks which indicated that he was getting close to his house. At first, he felt very scared but as time went on, he started to feel comfortable. After all, it appeared as if his own body was acting like its own balloon and he was floating on his own power. There was absolutely nothing which was keeping him suspended in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy house! There\u2019s my house!\u201d Tanmay cheered as he started to descend and head towards the lawn of his house. He had no idea who or what was steering him or directing his flight, but this was better than riding the bus for sure! Within minutes, he hovered over the lawn and he slowly descended until he gently touched down on the sidewalk before the entrance to his house. It was awesome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygod\u2026. I must be dreaming\u2026. This is crazy! Did I really just FLOAT from school to my house?\u201d Tanmay mumbled out loud. \u201cHow the heck did I do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tanmay saw the school bus turn into his road. It was still a few blocks away. Tanmay had beaten the bus home by floating home instead! What would his classmates say? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to just stand there, before his house, and wait for his friends to arrive on the school bus, when he started to levitate again! He began to feel VERY light, as his body started to rise up and ascend into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, a strong gust of wind came and pushed him away, sending Tanmay\u2019s body tumbling through the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaaaahh!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanmay spun around in the air as if he was as light as a feather! The wind blew him further away, sending him higher and higher into the air. As the kids got off the bus, they just laughed as they pointed to the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook! It\u2019s Tanmay! He\u2019s blowing in the wind, again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be nice to be weightless! Lucky guy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong wind gust took Tanmay and blew him over a mile away from his house, sending him tumbling and spinning around through the air. Tanmay closed his eyes because he was getting dizzy but he opened them again when things calmed down. Then he gasped when he saw that he was hundreds of feet above the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap! I\u2019m like\u2026. Very high up\u2026. How am I gonna get home?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt something pulling him down\u2026 Very gently\u2026 His body started to float back towards the house again\u2026 Minutes later, his shoes touched down on the front lawn, very gently. He let out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d better go inside before I get blown away!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanmay dashed and found himself floating again, once in the house. His mother walked up to him and greeted him, gently holding him by the arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sweetie! Did you have fun at school today?\u201d she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mom! I just\u2026 uhh\u2026 floated around\u2026\u201d he giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, boy! Now, go and change in your room so we can have dinner!\u201d his mom ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanmay used the walls and the furniture to push himself off to move around the house. He would also inhale and exhale forcefully, using his breath to make his body propel forward or backward. His feet would not touch the floor at all since he would just float around the house like a human balloon and everybody would find it completely normal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at her house, Laura was just enjoying all the fun she was having with Tanmay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha ha ha! Tanmay\u2019s floating to school and back again! That\u2019s just hilarious!\u201d Laura laughed to herself. \u201cMaybe his mom will have him come by the store to buy something one of these days? That will be fun! In the meantime, he will float to school and back to the house every day!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura realized that the day would come that she had to reveal herself to the boy. She just had to figure out how, where and when to do it. Having Tanmay come to the store was one neat way of accomplishing it. But, she wasn\u2019t in a rush. She was just having way too much fun making the kid feel special. What does she do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tanmay was home studying as always so his dad invited the boy to come along. His big, muscular son could always help carry some things, after all. They had to get a few cans of paint since the backyard fence needed painting, so Tanmay was more than happy to tag along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived at the store, dad went off to the paint section while Tanmay just wandered around near the entrance of the store where all the tools were located. Laura knew that the boy was in the store and decided that it was time to reveal herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout anyone else noticing anything unusual, Tanmay suddenly started to hover in inch off the ground and he began to float to the cashier counter where Laura was working. Luckily, there were no customers there at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What am I doing here?\u201d the boy wondered as he touched down right in front of Laura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I finally get to meet you in person, Tanmay!\u201d Laura smiled as she greeted the teen. \u201cI hope you have been enjoying your daily flights to school and back home again!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanmay immediately recognized her voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow! Are you\u2026. God, or\u2026 my Goddess? \u201cTanmay grinned as he walked up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Tanmay embraced one another briefly. Laura then ran her hand through his black hair as she finally was able to look him in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s me! I\u2019ve been having fun with you over the past couple of weeks! I can tell you have been enjoying those rides over the city! It beats riding the bus, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh yeah! This is the coolest way to go to school\u2026 Or anywhere, for that matter!\u201d the boy grinned. \u201cThank you so much!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to keep an eye on you! Maybe you can come here and work here over the summer, alright?\u201d Laura suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d appreciate that!\u201d the boy smiled just as his father walked up with two cans of paint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura greeted his dad and rang him up. He paid promptly and she waved goodbye to the friendly, Indian boy. She knew that she would continue to see him again as time went by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Laura decided to focus on her goofy co-workers for the time being. They desperately needed her attention. She had a large store with plenty of coworkers who had different personalities. So, who would she mess with, first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She may have been twenty, but she still acted like a teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz then smiled at the two new starters, Jade and Suki. She was going to pair them up with other staff, just until they learnt the ropes more. Jade was put to work with Nicola, and Suki with Waggy. \"If you need help with anything, just ask okay.\" Liz assured the two 'newbies'.

It might be the faulty air conditioning releasing fumes or something. I've phoned head office and asked them to send someone out tomorrow to look at it.\" she said to Charlotte. \"I've also told Liz to get a few carbon monoxide detectors off the shelf and to get one of the lads to fit them on the ceiling through the shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fumes?\" Charlotte mumbled incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get back to work please Charlotte.

Take a seat if you want.\" Liz replied, gesturing to the many seats around, including the ones that the cashiers sat on during the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Liz.\"  Carly said gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Liz had disappeared upstairs for a moment, Zoe looked around and shuddered. \"Brrr, is it cold in here or what?\" she asked Carly, as she paced back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colder than usual I think.\" Carly responded, rubbing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two beauticians progressed further into the store to browse some of the goods, they didn't hear the lock on the door automatically click behind them. \"We should pop in here at lunch tomorrow and buy some more nail varnish Zoe, we're running low.\" Carly suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need some more wax strips too.\" Zoe murmured as she fiddled with her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile upstairs, Liz had rumaged through all the drawers and filing cabinets, gathering up all of Andrea's old pay slips. With that done she made her way back downstairs to find Carly and Zoe.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But he knew he had to. \"Becca?\" he mumbled... in the voice that had been annoying him for the last half hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like me!\" Becca said in her lower pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you... like me.\" Rob muttered as he stood up straight. \"We... we swapped voices?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca nodded. \"Seems like.\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... how?\" Rob squeaked in Becca's higher, irritating voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to report this.\" Becca stated, as she ran her hand over her neck. She was sure she could feel an Adams Apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think??\" Rob huffed. He didn't know which was worse, that he had somehow switched voices with a girl... or that he had Becca's voice in particular. Things like this didn't just happen. They had to tell Elizabeth about this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two of them drew the short straw and so it was up to them to clean it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivately, they wondered if this incident would be remembered in the workplace for years to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it would have if an even more unbelievable event hadn't occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Helen bent over to pick up a discarded paint can, a tingle ran through her body. This was followed by another strange feeling that she could only describe as if she were being pumped full of water. Indeed she must've been expanding, as she felt her formerly baggy clothes grow tighter on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it started, it stopped, leaving a confused Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaun, did-\" She froze.

Her poor, stretched clothing clearly outlined her muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" They looked to each other and then at themselves. For a brief moment, silence prevailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the two of them were pretty level headed people, so Helen came to the logical conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should tell Elizabeth about this...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Five minutes later, Zoe finally returned from upstairs with two glasses of water. \"Sorry for the wait, needed to pee as well.\" she apologized, handing a glass to Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought you were digging a well or something.\" Steven joked, receiving a nudge in the arm from Zoe in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, my work isn't going to do itself I suppose.\" Steven grumbled, glancing around at the empty and half empty boxes on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let us stop you.\" Zoe chuckled, taking a sip of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them, and the rest of the as yet unnaffected staff were completely oblivious to what was happening elsewhere.

She wanted answers, but she knew the chances of getting them - were slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to let Liz know. And Elizabeth.\" Nicola suddenly said, turning to face Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... no!\" Charlotte protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola rolled her eyes. \"I know it's embarrassing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think!?\" Charlotte barked. She then let out a sigh as she recalled how she had swapped hands with Luke earlier. She now knew that hadn't been a hallucination. And then another thought entered her head. <i>Is this Luke's penis??</i> she thought, grimacing as she fidgeted on the toilet. The thought that he might have been responsible then entered Charlotte's head, and she got to her feet, ready to go back downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola glanced down at the distinct bulge in Charlotte's pants. \"You sure you want to go back downstairs like this?\" she asked Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got no choice.\" Charlotte grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola just nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst however, Charlotte realized that she also had no choice but to empty her bladder. She lifted the toilet seat and unfastened her pants, taking <i>her</i> penis out, while Nicola watched her from behind. Charlotte gritted her teeth and closed her eyes as she felt the urine begin to flow. Perhaps inevitably... she sprayed everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jade had proven to be a pretty fast learner to the inner workings of the store (not that much of it was all the difficult to understand), and, aside from the occasional guidance from Mark, now basically worked on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that goes there.\" Mark said, pointing at a shelf one above the one she was peering at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until yesterday, Jade had been hunting for jobs, sending her application out to all sorts of companies. Only two panned out. This store and a grocery store across town. The pay was better and the building was closer, so Jade went with Wilkos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Jade now wondered if she made a mistake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner did she think then when she suddenly felt a strange tingle run through her chest. The sensation caught her so much by surprise, causing her to drop a glass jar, which hit the ground with a loud crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark spun around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, Jade! I- Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the jar survived it contact with the floor. However, Mark quickly forgot about it as he stared at Jade, wide-eyed, as he saw her chest suddenly deflate, until all that was left was the outline of what was obviously a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade's gaze slowly panned down to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not again.\" Luke muttered as he felt the tingly sensation run through him once again, this time, focused on his chest region. With an almost painful tightening, he felt two mounds push their way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was not Luke's day.</span></div></div>",

His short, dark hair lengthened and lightened into a dark blonde color... before shifting itself into a plait that reached half way down his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squeal on one of the other aisles nearby then caused Becca to scurry around to find it's source. There was stood Laura... now sporting Rob's short haircut, and she was frantically running her fingers through her new hair. \"Becca... what's happened??\" Laura asked in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca shrugged. \"Er... you got swapped.\" she said in her deeper tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rob appeared behind Becca and Laura saw her hair atop his head , her jaw dropped. \"What the... hell?\" Laura gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were only telling me the other day you wanted a new style.\" Becca chuckled at Laura, trying to make light of the situation. And to be honest, as with her own swap, Becca found the whole thing quite amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Rob however - did not.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hell, they couldn't even just send everyone home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Liz and her were back to doing rounds. This time, Liz walked in Elizabeth's direction and Elizabeth walked in Liz's direction.

Mark was equally gobsmacked as he looked at the flat-chested girl in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... er... alright?\" Mark asked, not sure whether that was an appropriate question considering he had just seen a girl's breasts vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My tits!!\" Jade exclaimed, using the terminology men usually used. \"They're gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded, swallowing hard. \"I can see that. But... how?\" Mark responded, an intense frown etched on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade shook her head, obviously having no idea. She pulled on her top again and looked down at her chest. It was definitely a male chest, but not excessively hairy. And the nipples definitely weren't feminine. The peculiar thing Mark noticed was that Jade seemed to look around her, on the shelves and the floor, as though her breasts might be laying around somewhere. Such was her shock and befuddlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should tell Liz about this.\" Mark suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade blinked a couple of times, then nodded in agreement. Though she wasn't sure what Liz could do.  Her and Mark walked off the aisle and started looking for Liz, only to hear a commotion on the toiletries aisle. As they made their way there, they saw Elizabeth, Nicola, Luke and Charlotte all frantically discussing something. Mark looked down at Jade and shrugged. \"Something's going on, obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade then looked at each one of the group in turn. First Elizabeth, then Nicola, then she looked at Charlotte, who had her hands in front of her crotch for some reason, as if to try and hide something out of embarrassment. Then Jade's eyes fell upon Luke... in particular the two 'mounds' pushing out his shirt. She acted on impulse... speed walking straight up to Luke and lifting his shirt, despite his attempts to stop her. \"YOU took my tits!??\" Jade screamed at Luke, who just turned red in embarrassment as everyone in the vicinity saw his new breasts. Both of Luke's now feminine nipples were pierced, which is how Jade recognized the breasts as hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't take them... um... I swear!\" Luke insisted, shaking his head as he pushed his shirt back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth grabbed Jade's arm and pulled her back. \"Jade, he didn't do it. There's something weird happening in this store. There have been several swaps occurring, and none of us know why.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte interjected, addressing Jade directly. \"At least you didn't end up with this idiot's dick between your legs.\" she growled. \"Think yourself lucky you just lost your boobs.\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky??\" Jade spat. \"Look at me!\" she said, putting her hands against her flat chest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at ME!!\" Charlotte snapped back, revealing the firm bulge between her legs. Jade recoiled slightly at the sight, as did Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... ENOUGH!!\" Elizabeth raised her voice. \"This is nobody's fault, so stop blaming each other and stop arguing!\" she ordered her staff. \"Now as hard as it is... no pun intended Charlotte, sorry, all of you just get back to work. Maybe it will help you take your mind off what's happening.\" Elizabeth suggested. Though she knew that wasn't going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade took another long look at Luke's bosom, then shook her head in disgust before storming back to her section. Mark followed her, but he knew better than to try and calm her down at that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is SO fucked up!\" Charlotte grumbled. By now her penis was fully erect and her knickers were struggling to contain her new genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come and work with me if you want love.\" Nicola suggested to Charlotte, who agreed. As long as she didn't have to work with Luke anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth then just looked at Luke and patted him on the shoulder. \"I know this must be difficult, but stay strong okay. And if you have any questions about... you know...\" she mumbled, gesturing down to Luke's groin, \"...just come and ask me okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god!! I hope Charlotte wasn't on her period...</i> Luke thought in horror, his face contorting. He reluctantly got back to his duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then bent over, putting yet more strain on his trousers, to unfasten one of his boots. He then slipped his foot out, whipped off his sock... to reveal a feminine foot with crimson painted toe nails. \"Holy shit!\" he gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe stared at Steven's foot... recognizing the nail polish as the color she had applied to her own toes just 24 hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confirmed it. \"I think... we swapped bodies from the waist down!\" Zoe stated, reaching up to her chest to check that her boobs were still there.

After a visit to Internacionale, he wore a short leather dress with black high heel pumps. He makeup was coated on thick -- too think for daytime.

He dug through the bag that now contained the clothes Suki had been wearing when they first swapped and luckily found hers. Hitting the unlock button on the chain, he eventually found her car. It was a piece of crap, but it ran well enough to get him home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a bubble bath, stripped his clothes off, and relaxed. Suki's body must've been tired, as he dozed off amongst the bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting where (and who he was) the next morning, he awoke in shock. Partially because the water had gotten so cold overnight, and partially because he still wasn't used to being in Suki's body. He toweled himself off and got dressed into another set of clothes he had bought yesterday -- a satin top and a tight pencil skirt. He finished the look with the black pumps and a dangling pair of earrings his deceased wife had owned -- one of the few items he had kept to remember her.

She had tried to dam up her feelings, her panic, but cracks were forming and some emotion leaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'm here.\" Elizabeth wheezed out as she turned into the aisle that she thought she heard the scream come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Elizabeth! Thank god!\" Natalie said, stepping forward. Elizabeth quickly realized that whoever had screamed was not here, after all, she had assigned only women here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the second worker, Suki, gave Elizabeth a timid glance before awkwardly waddling around a corner, out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, another swap... It was probably another genital swap, considering how the girl was bent over.

His already loose trousers were now bunched up around his ankles a little. Liz had the opposite problem, her trouser legs had retreated up her legs a few inches as she grew to 5' 10\". But because she wore long length, boot-cut trousers to begin with, it wasn't too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, l... let's stay calm here.\" Liz said as she looked down at herself. Like Elizabeth, there were slight cracks starting to appear in Liz's constitution, but fortunately she was emotionally stronger than Elizabeth was. \"I know this is bizarre, but... we have to stay calm.\" she repeated, regaining her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm??\" a frantic Shaun bellowed, looking up into Liz's face. \"I've lost my muscles, my dick and now my fucking height.\" he cussed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz frowned at Shaun. \"Stop swearing, that's not going to help anything.\" she berated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz continued checking herself over, to make sure nothing else had changed. Apart from 'suffering' a sudden growth spurt, everything else seemed normal. She rubbed her forehead with her fingers and started pacing back and forth, while Shaun took another horrified glance down his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaun... I'm sorry this is happening.\" Helen suddenly mumbled. For some reason she felt partly responsible, since it was her who now had Shaun's physique. Though she was as much a victim as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun didn't say anything, instead he just closed his eyes and took in deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clicking of high heels behind them heralded Elizabeth's arrival on the aisle, and Liz seemed relieved. After a cursory glance over her manager's body to make sure she was normal, Liz walked towards her. \"Liz I just... woah!\" Elizabeth gasped, noticing how much taller the supervisor was. Even though Elizabeth had her high heels on, Liz was still a couple of inches taller than her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I exchanged heights with Shaun!\" Liz stated obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth swallowed hard, glancing past Liz at a shorter, clearly distraught Shaun. \"I can see that.\" she nodded. \"Incidentally... has he had any other...\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded solemnly. \"He's got a vagina too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth sighed. \"Well I just checked in on Suki, the poor girl has grown a penis. I guess it must be Shaun's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" Liz asked her boss, who couldn't give her any answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I knew.\" Elizabeth mumbled. \"I'll try and comfort Shaun if you can check on the others. Are you still up to doing that?\" she asked Liz, who didn't hesitate before nodding at her manager. \"Thanks Liz.\" Elizabeth smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz took another look at Shaun, then glanced to the floor, turned around and walked off the aisle to continue her rounds.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She did however hope that whatever had happened would reverse itself. She idly scratched her flat chest, then walked away, ducking into the doorway at the bottom of the stairs (that led up to the tea room) to remove her top. As Steven waited for Carly to return, he saw the way Zoe was looking at him, or rather the way his erect nipples were almost poking through his shirt. \"Zoe?\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe snapped herself from her stare, then winced again as she shuffled her feet. \"Steven... I need your boots.\" she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven thought he hadn't heard right. \"I'm sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your boots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the same reason you need Carly's bra. A matter of comfort!\" Zoe told him straight. Steven stepped back and looked down at Zoe's feet, she was wearing flats, which could hardly be called 'unisex' footwear. \"And... can I have your boxer shorts too?\" Zoe pushed her luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" Steven asked acerbically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe bit her lower lip again. \"Might as well have your trousers too.\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven sighed dejectedly. \"Whatever!\" he grumbled. He and Zoe then set off in pursuit of Carly, to a more private place they could exchange clothing. A few minutes later, Steven was feeling pretty stupid. He was still wearing his own Wilkos shirt, but now he had his new tits secured by Carly's bra, and he was wearing Zoe's clothes from the waist down, her trousers, knickers and flats. All fitted perfectly of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, that feels better.\" Zoe sighed in relief, now clonking about in Steven's work boots. Her cock had more room to breath in the boxer shorts she now wore, which was a good thing. Since she felt a pulse of sexual energy shoot through her 'member' every time she looked at the breasts pushing out Steven's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself.\" Steven grumbled, staring down at his feminine attire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her bra was now sitting idle on her flat, slightly hairy chest. Liam on the other hand couldn't believe what had just happened. He'd grown a pair of tits... Helen's tits to be precise.

Won't that be funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up...\" Rob muttered, knowing it would make no difference. Ever since they had been reassured by the manager, this is where they had been. Becca yammering Rob's ears off and Rob doing his best to ignore that he was annoyed of the sound of his own voice and brushing strands of hair that were definitely not his own out of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, he strongly considered abandoning his post, walking to the restroom and locking himself in one of the stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know you're curious, but could you not fondle it in public?\" The distant sound of Liz's voice came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.

He dropped his tools and ran to the end of the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And stopped at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh crap, they got her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob used to be much taller than Liz, but... that didn't appear to be true anymore. While he didn't make it a habit to ogle his supervisor, he also noticed her chest was a lot smaller than he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what bothered him the most was the girl next to Liz, Rebekah. Maybe not the H cups that she now sported, but the firm, obviously erect bulge in her pants on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz let out a noticeable sigh of relief when she saw Rob, and the quickly advancing Becca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything to report?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Rob said, which caused Rebekah to noticeably recoil in surprise. \"Nothing unusual has happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that moment when he wasn't assaulted by Becca's incessant chatter, Rob felt... happy. Happy that he was no longer being annoyed, that he seemed to be pulling through this incident fairly well, and that his swaps, while annoying, were not as incredibly life changing as the ones the women in front of him had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he felt the tingling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...which seemed to focus on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...which he felt retract into his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NONONONONONONO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...leaving behind little more than a slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, everyone stared in silence.

She knew that whatever was happening can't have been good. However eventually her curiosity for the better of her and she started wandering. And she first came across a sulky looking Aaron and a somewhat 'tickled' Waggy. It took a moment for Mona to realize what was different. \"Woah... Waggy you're... taller?\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty weird right?\" Waggy chuckled in response. She tried to keep her tone down so as not to irritate Aaron. \"Me and Aaron just swapped heights, out of the blue.\" she explained to her young, Iranian-born co-worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that possible?\" Mona muttered, stealing a glance at Aaron as he paced nearby, rubbing the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaggy continued. \"I don't know, but apparently there's swaps happening all over the store, to nearly everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone is switching heights?\" Mona asked with a puzzled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just heights, other things too.\" Waggy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like...?\" Mona pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got her answer shortly after this, and Waggy didn't have to mutter a word. Mona looked down and fidgeted slightly as a tingle ran through her nether region. Waggy noticed Mona's distraction and also looked at the girl's crotch. \"Uh oh!\" It was as though Waggy knew what was coming. The tingling increased in intensity and then Mona bent over slightly as she felt something strange happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" Aaron suddenly swore, off to Mona's left. He unfastened his trousers and reached inside his boxers just in time to feel his manhood get sucked up into his body along with his balls. A feminine 'opening' formed in their place, and the skin tone was definitely a little darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona stood up straight and grunted as Aaron's cock and balls formed in her knickers, creating an impressive bulge in her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" Waggy mumbled, unable to take her eyes off Mona's groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona immediately started panicking and she looked down in shock at herself. \"Oh my god!\" she shrieked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None of them knew quite what to think about what had transpired tonight. Nicola glanced in the rearview mirror at Rob with his new feminine hairstyle, and he kept putting a hand into his trousers... then recoiling it. Mona was in the passenger seat, hardly able to take her eyes of her crotch. She hadn't yet seen her new penis in the flesh, and she wasn't sure she wanted to either. \"Why aren't you more upset with what happened to you?\" Mona suddenly asked Nicola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola could feel her empty bra still fastened around her torso. She now had Mark's flat, hairy chest... yet she wasn't too bothered. \"I don't know, guess I'm just thankful that I can go home and see my kids.\" she shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you've got no boobs. What will your hubby say?\" Mona then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I'll find out when I get home.\" Nicola smiled a little, turning to glance at Mona before setting her eyes back on the road. \"Besides, I could have ended up with one of those...\" she mumbled, gesturing to Mona's crotch bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I did end up with one.\" Mona sighed forlornly. \"My parents are gonna kill me!\" she repeated, worried about setting foot in her own house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola did run a few things through her head as she was talking to Mona and watching Rob's amateurish exploration in the back seat. What <i>would</i> her husband say when she got home looking like this. She was a grown woman without breasts. How would she feed her baby? The last one was simple, it would have to be with bottles. Though she had always preferred breast-feeding her youngest. She was determined not to let the situation get her down. After all, compared to some of her co-workers, she had got off lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while they arrived at Rob's house. \"This your house?\" Nicola turned to Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" came the solemn response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck!\" Nicola wished Rob, before he exited the car. She then waited until he had slowly entered his parents' home, before driving off to Mona's house. \"Guess we'll find out how his night went tomorrow.\" Nicola chuckled to Mona, who just frowned at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola's 'peppy' attitude was a little creepy to 20-year old Mona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Mona was out of the car too and stood at her front door. She turned and gave Nicola an uncomfortable wave, then watched as the older woman's car disappeared into the night. <i>Right, let's get this over with...</i> Mona thought, opening the front doot and going into her house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oftentimes, after taking off her clothing, she would just leave it on the floor. Maybe a couple days later, she would finally remember to put it in the laundry. She distinctly remembered putting yesterday's clothing at that spot, a pair of trousers, a pair of red knickers and a blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the clothing was the same, but her knickers were replaced by a pair of same-colored boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, that was odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpurred on by this discovery, Zoe proceeded to search the rest of the room. Thankfully, almost everything was exactly where she left it, only some of her 'lower half' clothes seemed to have changed.

Get changed into comfier non-work clothing and then... maybe call it an early night and hope that this was all a dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, one by one, her clothing came off, until she stood in nothing but underwear and bra. And that was when she saw herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were much hairier, but she supposed that if she trimmed it down, she could probably get it to resemble what she had before,,, kind of. However, nothing could really be done about the very unfeminine bulge in her boxers. At least unlike Carly, she got to keep her breasts. And... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a certain stiffening as her eyes lingered on her chest. Was she getting aroused just from looking at herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck!

Every time the bus drove over a speed bump... her huge breasts jiggled in Liz's former bra. She had to admit... she loved having Liz's boobs, it was a serious turn-on. evidenced by the fact that Liam's former penis was happily 'tenting' her tight pants. <i>Oh god...</i> Rebekah moaned silently, rubbing her bulge - while at the same time making sure nobody saw what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a particular teenage boy towards the front of the bus who kept staring at Rebekah, no doubt in awe at her impressive bosom. Rebekah spent 10 minutes glancing at the boy, leading him on, adjusting her bra straps, basically being a tease. She didn't have a boyfriend at the moment, but she wasn't really interested in one either. She felt it wasn't quite the right time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her stop arrived, Rebekah grabbed her bag and stood up, and for a moment she thought the boy would freak at seeing her fabric-covered 'boner', but he didn't. On the contrary the boy seemed to be even more attracted to Rebekah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked to the front of the bus, she made sure her pace slowed when she reached the boy. <i>Nobody seems to have noticed my dick...</i> Rebekah thought to herself with a wry smile, <i>at least not in a bad way...</i> Rebekah had to ask herself... had reality somehow shifted outside the store while all the swapping was occurring inside? <i>That would be for the best</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy seemed unhappy seeing Rebekah depart the bus, but she gave him a little wave as she walked away, then proceeded straight to her house. Once inside, Rebekah began getting nervous about her parents' reactions to her altered body. She had way bigger boobs than her mom now for crying out loud. And would her dad freak out that his daughter now had a penis?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she confronted both parents in the living room, she got her answer. They saw nothing out of the ordinary, and once they had welcomed Rebekah home, she disappeared up to her bedroom. Curious, Rebekah immediately opened her underwear drawer. <i>Oh... right</i>. she smirked, seeing the assortment of boxer shorts and underpants she now owned, as well as the 30H-cup bras. That settled it, reality had changed to fit her new 'appearance'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bigger, more confident smirk appeared on Rebekah's cute face as she peered past her huge breasts and eyed the obvious bulge in her pants once more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course they didn't need to know the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stalling in the hallway, he decided to go ahead and just barge into the living room. \"Hey you two!\" he greeted his parents, who were watching TV.

He took his time, first his belt came off, then he unzipped, before taking a deep breath and letting them drop to his ankles. His 'deflated' boxer shorts were in full view.

Mona was still shocked about what had happened. How could people just switch body parts like this?? It made no sense. As she pondered her situation, she looked into her wardrobe, but all her clothes were still there, and normal. She just had a niggling feeling that something wasn't right.

Mona's trousers were off, along with her knickers, and she was staring down in absolute disbelief at her growing erection. <i>This isn't right.</i> she mumbled, slumping her bare backside onto her bed. \"Ow\" she winced, as she partially sat on one of her balls. <i>How sensitive???</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting there, half naked, Mona was at a loss over what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by her erection, her new manhood was in need of some 'lovin', but Mona couldn't even bring herself to touch it yet.

So instead she slipped on a pair of her boxers, followed by a comfortable pair of pants, and she slipped her feet into a pair of her flats before heading back downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona hoped things would remain as calm as they were now when her dad saw her too. She had an idea it would, since judging by the contents of her underwear drawer, she had drawn the same conclusion as several of her co-workers had.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say that Jade was in a 'mood' when she eventually got home, was an understatement. Thinking back to when she had the choice of two jobs, she'd wished she had taken up the offer of the other one instead of choosing to work at Wilkos. But then... how was she to know that she'd lose her breasts and pussy? She stormed into the house, part fearful over her family's reactions and part not caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living room was empty, which wasn't unsual for this time of night. Her father was normally in bed before 9:00pm since he had to be up early for work. Jade found her mother in the kitchen, folding the laundry. \"Oh, hey sweetie.\" she greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum, you notice anything odd about me?\" Jade immediately asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother gave her the once over, then shrugged. \"No honey, should I? Have you had another piercing done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I haven't. I just...\" Jade mumbled, feeling the large cock in her knickers stirring again. <i>Oh god...</i> she sighed. She had thought it weird that nobody on the bus had  said anything about her flat chest. Then again... some girls do have tiny boobs. However... Jade had NO boobs, she had a flat, manly chest and a penis. And yet here her mother was, stood in front of her, acting perfectly normal. What had changed? Other than Jade's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother smiled at her. \"Well good, you don't need any more piercings honey. You've got enough.\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they dad's?\" Jade suddenly inquired, noticing the clean boxer shorts her mother was putting in the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother gave her a little frown. \"No, they're yours sweetie. You know your father only wears briefs.\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade just rolled her eyes, rubbed her forehead and then backtracked into the hallway before making her way upstairs. On the way she bumped into her younger sister Amber, 18. \"Hey sis!\" the younger girl said on passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade barely acknowledged her sister's presence. \"Hi.\" she just mumbled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Amber frowned, turning to view Jade as she shot upstairs and towards her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could say that.\" Jade grumbled back, before disappearing into her room and slamming the door. Leaning against the back of the door, Jade then rested her slender hands on her flat chest.... before moving one gingerly down to the bulge in her trousers. She moaned as she gave it a quick rub. Her penis immediately reacted, becoming as hard as it possibly could and testing the fabric of her knickers. When she did eventually pull her trousers down, she saw the menacing 'eye' of her cock peeping over the top of her underwear. <i>\"Holy shit!\"</i> she grimaced slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered how her body could be aroused and repulsed at the same time. \"Yeah, just awesome!\" Jade murmured to herself in dejection.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When they had been just kids, just barely into their teens, Maddy was just starting to come out with her sexuality... and Charlotte volunteered to be the test subject. After a bit of fooling around, Charlotte had decided that homosexuality (or bisexuality) was not for her. However, Maddy would never shut up about that time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because I made you jizz all over your face doesn't mean that I see you as my personal fucktoy or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat girl was worse than passing teenage guys when it came to pickup lines. At least their's were just stupid. Hers was not only incredibly unsubtle, but also lewd to a point that not even Charlotte was comfortable. Hell, many of the times, she went beyond bad pickup lines and nosedived into downright creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, just a sip.\" She would say with a lecherous smile while looking at a point that Charlotte was positive was not her face... or her breasts for that matter .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte got the feeling that Maddy just did it to make her feel uncomfortable.Eventually, Charlotte managed to ditch Maddy and make it back to her apartment. She took a deep breath once she got to the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moment of truth.\" She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she flung the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Huh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much had changed, at least on the surface. She had been half expecting that she would find her room covered in sports posters or something. Her room looked remarkably unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or maybe, the changes were more subtle. Before she even knew what she was doing, she was ripping drawers out of cabinets, trying to find that one, insidious change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned out that she didn't need to look hard. Immediately, she learned that all her knickers had been swapped for male underwear. Searching other places, she found that her little pack of birth control pills got swapped out for a pack of condoms. Her tampons had been traded for... a box of tissues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, the damages weren't as insidious as she expected. While she would miss some of her knickers, it could have been much worse...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuddenly, a pit in her stomach formed. If all of that changed, then... did that mean?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe practically dove under the bed, reaching deep into it, to where she kept her \"super secret safe of super secret stuff.\" She pulled out the unassuming, large black safe. After inputting the code, 4321, it opened up...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd she let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSafe! All of it!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe gave a wide grin, then-<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWait a minute...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe pulled out the large, purple, rubbery object from the top.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWasn't this supposed to be two sizes smaller?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe was happy that her precious dildo was still with her... but still. This was awkward.</span></div></div>",

The rest of her shoes also fit her new larger feet, and so she slipped on a pair of flats similar to the ones she had had to give to Steven. She was sat at the kitchen table sipping a cup of coffee when she herad the front door open and the familiar voices of her husband and daughter. She let out a deep sigh. She'd been dreading this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mummy!\" Arissia shouted in excitement, running up to Zoe, who would have normally lifted her up and put her on her lap. But for obvious reasons, she just hugged her precious little girl and gave her a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya sweetie, I missed you so much.\" Zoe smiled, addressing Arissia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes was Zoe and Arissia then just having a little mother/daughter chat, while her husband Chris put the shopping away. It was then up to Zoe, as always, to tuck Arissia into bed. When she crouched down beside Arissia's bed and kissed her goodnight, Zoe was at least thankful that she had got to see her family again, and that nothing else had happened to her while in Wilkos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later Zoe returned back downstairs, and Chris was in the kitchen with a glass of wine. He passed a matching glass to Zoe, who didn't need any coercement to have an alcoholic beverage. As she drank her wine with one hand, she poured her cold coffee down the sink with the other. She then got a start when Chris came up behind her and rubbed his hands over her considerably smaller backside. \"Ahh...\" Zoe gasped, her cock instantly beginning to stiffen. <i>Moment of truth.</i> she thought, turning to face her husband. The two kissed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe then felt Chris' hand gently cup her 'package', giving it a rub until she was hard as a rock. <i>This is too weird.</i> Zoe couldn't help but think. And when Chris 'helped' Zoe out of her top and she looked down at her own boobs again, her excitement went through the roof. She found her thoughts drifting away from her husband as she remembered what Steven had looked like after the swap. The sight of Carly's breasts filling Steven's shirt had got her so hard,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Chris had got Zoe's bra off, he started caressing and sucking her nipples. Zoe was too embarrassed at that moment that she was about ready to cum already. \"Wait!!\" she abruptly stopped her husband as he was about to unfasten Zoe's trousers. \"Um...c... can we do this tomorrow? I don't feel very well.\" she stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was obviously disappointed, but he nonetheless agreed to postpone their little session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chris headed upstairs to get ready for bed, Zoe leaned on the table and sighed. Her bare breasts were hanging loose and she was halfway to having her first ever male orgasm. Not knowing what else to do, Zoe unfastened her own trousers, dropped them and her boxer shorts to her ankles and exposed her hairy legs. Then she took hold of her erect penis and began instinctively wanking herself off. It took only a few tugs before she felt the inevitable 'release', and she blew a 'rope of cum' across the kitchen and onto the floor. \"Oh my... god!\" Zoe gasped, smiling as she experienced her orgasm. She had to admit, it felt great....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the frown... as she realized she now had to clean up the mess. <i>Crap!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd got re-dressed and cleaned up the cum off the floor, she made herself her usual cup of hot chocolate and went upstairs to her and Chris' bedroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hell, she suspected that the majority of women would be distraught, not only had she exchanged her godly melons for a much smaller pair, but more importantly, she lost her hole and gained a pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the end, the only anxiety she had felt was the brief moments when the door opened. And the moment Eric did not seem to notice her modifications, even that had evaporated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she just went along with the usual routine and headed upstairs to get changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a few minutes, and I'll be ready for you.\" Liz said with a suggestive wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric grinned backwards, and, as she left, gave her shapely rear a playful grope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz discovered what her many coworkers were discovering around this time, that somehow, reality had altered outside of the store. Her knickers had been switched mostly for boxers, her bras had resized themselves, and she noticed that her birth control had been replaced with a couple of packs of condoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...There was probably more changes, but Liz wasn't really looking for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz decided to switch over to a plain blouse and a pair of yoga pants. Both easy to take off once primal desires struck her and her husband. Liz was little known (or even imaginable) to her coworkers and even her manager, but Liz and her husband were quite kinky and amorous when out of public view. Sex was a daily event, sometimes multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz frowned slightly when she saw the bulge in her pants. This was going to be... different. She wouldn't deny, at times, she had wondered what it would be like to \"play for the other team.\" Sometimes, she had even been envious of her husband for the risk-free orgasms he had. But now that the moment was fast approaching, she couldn't help but feel a bit of anxiety. Would it go alright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, one thing had lead to another, and Liz found herself sitting on a chair with her boxers down and cock hanging free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was... rather surreal, to see one of those and know that it belonged to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had mostly followed Eric's lead, as she had little idea how to have sex with a penis. Nay, despite that only one part of her body was no longer female, she felt herself reacting rather differently. While before, she quite welcomed foreplay, it was the best part of sex to her. Now, well, she felt a longing, a need for Eric to get to that one part that mattered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, Eric kneeled in front of her, his mouth open, ready to envelope her 'rod'. He leaned in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sucked a breath in and closed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoment of truth... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Liz spasmed as what felt like an electric shock of pleasure ran through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, this thing was a keeper.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had an incessant smirk on her face as she pulled her Wilkos shirt up over her heavy breasts and threw it to one side. Her bra followed, and... there they were, her supervisor's boobs in their full, massive glory. They really were weighty, much more so than her own B-cups had been. She ran her hands over them and tweaked her nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she played with her new mammaries, the more 'rigid' her new cock became. And before long Rebekah had taken her trousers off along with her ill-fitting knickers, allowing her penis to see the light of the bathroom. A gasp escaped Rebekah's lips as she struggled to see past her large breasts and as she took hold of her erect shaft. The fact that it used to be Liam's didn't seem to bother her. It was attached to her now. It <i>was</i> hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah's hormones were racing by this time, she was seriously aroused as well as delighted with the changes to her body. She knew she was tehcnically a she-male now, but she didn't see that as a bad thing. Between Liz's huge tits and Liam's cock, she had the best of both worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow wearing only her socks, Rebekah stood over the toilet and wondered how men were able to pee while they had a hard on. After trying to figure it out, Rebekah shrugged, deciding she'd have a wank to get rid of her erection. Another amused grin appeared on her face as she gripped her cock and thought back to the porn video she had watched once with a friend. She copied what the male porn star had done to himself, and in no time she was well on her way to her first orgasm with her new 'equipment'. As she jerked off, her huge boobs jiggled on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily neither of Rebekah's parents heard the rather loud moan come from the bathroom a few minutes later. <i>GOD...</i> Rebekah groaned audibly as her balls clenched and her cock shot a healthy deposit of semen into the toilet. Then as she descended from her climax, Rebekah began giggling to herself. She maintained her grip on her penis as it began to soften a little, and after a few more seconds she was able to start urinating. That was more relief than pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd done peeing, Rebekah brought her hands back up to her breasts and lifted them a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm gonna love being 'stuck' like this.\" she said to herself, a grin on her face once more. Just like Liz, Rebekah was viewing her situation as more advantagious than calamitous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid this make her a pervert? She didn't care if it did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And he really wasn't. Since arriving home, he had discovered all his 'manly' underwear had been replaced with more feminine garments, and bras had been added to his collection too. And even more disturbingly, he'd found a strap-on in his bedroom. The thought that he would have to attach a big plastic dick to himself to have sex with his girlfriend was... too much. There was also the fact that he was only an inch or two taller than Susan now, whereas before he had towered over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I least I get a night's rest.\" Susan chuckled, as she continued watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Susan then looked at Aaron again, who was still in his work clothes. \"Did you go to work without a bra on?\" she asked him, noticing the lack of an outline under his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron just looked at her blankly for a moment.

Aaron then accepted that he would sooner or later have to see his new sex, and so he removed his trousers and boxers... revealing the pussy he had between his legs now. The contrast between skin tones more or less confirmed that it was Mona's vagina that he now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fucked up!\" Aaron grunted to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he disappeared into the bathroom to take a piss, Aaron realized he would now be sitting down to pee for the rest of his life.

It was understandable that he did, but completely unnecessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, then.\" Liam muttered as he walked out of the bathroom, flicking the lights off as he went. He walked down the hallway, past large stacks of cardboard boxes that his mother swore up and down that she would one day sort through.Honestly, Liam found himself oddly indifferent to all of this. The only difference it really made was if he could get pregnant or not, and its not like he planned on getting married or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the living room, flopped down onto the couch, and flicked on the TV. On a good day, he had maybe an hour or so before his sister came back home and the television became a contested territory. He intended to make the best of it.</span></div></div>",

She didn't hold any malice against her little brother, after all accidents happen. But wow... that was pain like she had never experienced before (obviously), and now she knew that boys she played with when she was little weren't exaggerating when they took a knock to the groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain had traveled right up into her stomach, which she rubbed as she made her way upstairs. <i>Oh god...</i> she grimaced, walking tentatively over to her bed, where she carefully sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, and everything looked as it should have looked. That is until she idly opened the top drawer of her bedside dresser and that all her knickers were gone, and in their place... male briefs and boxer shorts. As with some of her co-workers, she would also soon find her birth control pills replaced by condoms, and other such minor changes. Suki let out a deep sigh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had no idea why or how she had been swapped like she had. But as she took a first... hesitant peep into her pants and saw the sizeable, pale penis practically staring up at her, she had to wonder... how would she adjust to such a drastic change to her anatomy? What was she now? Was she still a girl? A she-male? Technically the latter was correct, yet she assumed (correctly) that she'd still be viewed as female, despite the piece of 'meat' between her dark-skinned thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, life went on. Suki pushed all those questions to the back of her mind and began to get changed out of her work clothes. She'd just try and do her best to ignore the erection that was already forming again in her knickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as though the thing had a mind of it's own...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why did she have an erection first thing in the morning? It was a question asked by men everywhere, and now by quite a few of the female employees at Wilkos and Beautylicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Mona threw the bed sheets back and headed straight to the bathroom, which thankfully was free, to take care of her problem.

She was sure to clean up the mess she made when she missed the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Mona then slumped on her bed again, gently relieving an itch on one of her balls.

She couldn't afford to skip work. She had hours before she was due to start at 4:00pm anyway. And the store closed to customers at 5:30pm, so it wasn't as bad as it could be. But at the back of her mind, she was wondering whether tonight would be a repeat of last night. The last thing she wanted was to be swapped again. But seriously.. what else could happen that was worse that what she had already experienced?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a freakin' penis for crying out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting lethargy, Mona forced herself to get dressed.

Thankfully she made it to the bathroom without incident and she locked the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes (and a few subdued moans) later, the chain flushed and Rebekah poked her head out of the door, before scurrying back to her room. Having had her second male orgasm since last night, she was now ready to start her day. She put on a bra to secure her impressive tits in place, then she slipped on some boxers, a skirt and a t-shirt, along with a pair of her flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were up late honey.\" her mother said when Rebekah entered the kitchen for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Was I?\" came the innocent reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother gave her a funny as she finished cooking breakfast. \"Well 1:00am is late in my book sweetie.\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah shrugged. \"Sorry if I disturbed you and dad.\" she apologized, as her mother put a poached egg on toast in front of her. She was famished, and wasted no time in scoffing it down. As she ate, she wondered if today's shift at work would be 'normal', or a repeat of last night. She'd have to wait and see. But a part of her was afraid that what had been given to her last night, might be taken away tonight. She didn't want that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cradled her 'girls' on her chest as she looked down, smirking as she squeezed them together. The inevitable tent appeared in her skirt under the table as she fondled her boobs while her mother wasn't looking. It certainly didn't take much to turn her on now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got plans for today honey?\" her mother asked, as she eventually sat down with her own breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah smirked a little. \"Plans are overrated. Guess I'll just kill time.\" she replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was partially awake, her eyes remained closed and the movement underneath the sheets made it apparent that she was subconsciously masturbating under the sheets. A contented smile appeared on her soft, delicate features and a slight moan escaped her lips as her left hand continued massaging the length of her cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other hand, which was idly caressing her bare, B-cup breasts, occasionally moved 'south' to help her left hand. This continued for at least 10 minutes, a slow, methodical handjob that could only have one inevitable result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that time came, Suki frowned a little, then bucked her hips and gasped as the 'release' came...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was at that moment that her eyes flew open, a look of horror on her face. She tossed the sheets back and was greeted by a sticky mess. <i>Oh my god!! Gross....</i> she grimaced, realizing she had ejaculated. There was cum all over the sheets, her crotch, legs and her hands. She'd never felt so embarrassed. She had to wonder if this was how men started their mornings. Now fully awake, Suki glanced at the clock. 8:50am. No way could she get back to sleep now. She let out a dejected sigh, then made her way to the bathroom to clean herself up. Then the bed sheets came off to be washed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't believe I did that...</i> Suki shook her head, angry with herself.

She adjusted her underwear, then set off walking across the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bundled her bed sheets in the washing machine, turned it on, and then got to fixing her and her younger brother something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a feeling it was going to be a long day...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A part of her was a little happy that Carly was gone. Towards the end there, things were starting to feel a little awkward. Carly's eyes seemed to linger on... certain parts of her, while Zoe couldn't help but flush a bit when she looked at Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with the salon to herself, Zoe got to work, pushing tables around, setting up cleaning products and removing tarps. It wasn't a ton of work, but still, she couldn't help but miss Kay a bit. Even if Carly was the official owner, the three of them had started the store together, and it felt so empty without Kay around. Still, she had to let the girl chase her own dreams...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Kay didn't get caught up in the utter mess that was yesterday. Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe frowned at the tent that rapidly formed in her pants. It had been... how long? Ten minutes? And it still hadn't gone down. God this was so annoying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked around. Meh, the store looked pretty close to ready, she could afford a break to take care of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe headed off to the restroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn't lie to herself, she was scared to enter again. But as she saw customers coming and going from the store, she knew that the chances of something similar to last night happening at that moment were slim, if not zero. She pushed her fears aside and went into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was inside, she headed straight to the toiletries aisle to buy waxing strips, tweezers, nail varnish and a whole lot of other things she and Zoe would need at the salon. Carly certainly wasn't expecting to run into one of their other friends. \"Carly, hey!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Christie.\" Carly smiled nervously, suddenly feeling even more self-conscious about her lack of breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie was 33 years old, same as Carly, she was about 5' 5\" tall and had a little more meat on her bones than Carly and Zoe did. She was definitely attractive, dyed blonde hair with natural dark roots, and she wore it down all the time. She also had similar sized breasts to Zoe, and wasn't shy about showing them off to people. She was wearing a low-cut, white t-shirt, a red skirt that emphasized her shapely backside and a pair of peep-toe black suede pumps that took her height to 5' 8\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just on my way to the salon to make an appointment. I need my nails done.\" Christie chuckled, showing Carly her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly maintained her smile. \"Yeah, that makes two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie looked at Carly's plain, even dull-looking fingernails. \"I noticed. It's not like you to be missing a manicure.\" she chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the conversation went on, the two women wandering the store together doing their shopping. And Carly was at least glad to see that it was a different team of Wilko employees manning the store that time in the morning. Liz and her people weren't due to start while late afternoon. Once Carly had what she wanted, Carly set off back to the salon, with Christie in tow, their high heels clicking in unison on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they walked in the front door and the bells tinkled again, they saw Zoe just emerging from the back, neatening her Beautylicious top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya Zo!!\" Christie waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Christie.\" Zoe smiled, scratching the back of her neck as she walked behind the Reception desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is gonna be awkward...</i> Carly sighed, as she set her purchased items down nearby.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Charlotte looked up, she had expected to see the gossipmonger of Wilkos, because, with her luck, she needed two people who would talk her ears off. Instead, she saw-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob?\" She said, utterly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Rob looked up. \"Oh, hi Charlotte.\" He said with little enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte flinched slightly.

Wouldn't she get worried?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she's fine.\" Charlotte leaned closer. \"She's louder than Becca.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat in the cafeteria section. After their chance first encounter, the two decided to hang out for a bit. Neither of them had much plans before work after all. Besides, it comforted them both a little to be in the company of one who shared the same predicament. Even if they didn't know each other that well, let alone, get along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Rob gestured toward Charlotte. \"How about you, how are you holding up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte twitched. \"How do you guys deal with it?

The smell of her husband's aftershave permeated her nostrils, and as she inhaled deeply she felt her manhood stirring to life again... slightly tenting her trousers. Part of her wanted to just throw her husband on the floor and take him up the ass right there. But she managed to resist the urge. Elizabeth wouldn't be impressed after all, and neither would the few other customers that remained in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, have you got a minute please?\" Jessica suddenly appeared on the aisle, heralded by the clicking of her high heeled ankle boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, give me a second love.\" Liz responded. \"Come see me before you head home.\" she then said to Eric, this time planting a kiss on his lips. She smiled and then reluctantly left her husband's presence for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled away to himself. Liz definitely seemed a lot hornier than she used to be. Not that it was a bad thing.

She dropped what she was doing as he approached. \"Why are you here? You know I'm working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded. \"Yeah sorry babe, just called in to get the house key from you.

As it turned out, Liz, for some reason, had forgotten to assign Melissa a section and, almost as an afterthought, assigned her here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte worked in complete silence and stood a little ways apart from the others. Being the only one who was swapped out of the group, Charlotte felt a hint of self consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was part of the reason. The other reason was that after she had talked to Rob, she had been feeling a little strange... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis feeling was new to Charlotte, and hard to describe. Back when she had the CORRECT genitals, she would feel a certain longing for those hunky male characters she saw in movies. This feeling ran the gamut anywhere from wanting to be held, to feeling a certain wetness. Nowadays, when she was by her friend Maddy, she recognized her feelings as raw animalistic lust. Basically, at a primal level, she wanted to empty her balls in one of Maddy's many orfices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was different, though. Sure he was cute and had a nice rear, but it was... hard to describe for her. Just being around him brightened her day, and in turn, she wanted his life to be a little bit brighter. Alongside the lust was a certain sense of contentment and longing when she thought about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Come to think of it, Kiran had been staring at her for a while now. Also, why was Melissa taking a couple of large steps backwards, almost as if she expected something big to happen. Charlotte tried to decipher this situation with her usual tact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kiran didn't respond, her glassy stare bore into her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So beautiful~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran's voice had a strange slur to it, as if she were half asleep. It was a little disturbing, so Charlotte backed away slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she exploded with energy, charging right up to Charlotte's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How beautiful! This maiden's heart longs for her knight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte gasped and backed away. She didn't know Kiran that well, but the one she knew was usual much more heart spoken. Where did this come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-uh...I... y'know.\" She motioned downwards as her eloquent response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That matters not!\" shouted Kiran. \"It doesn't matter if the damsel or the knight wields the sword for true love to blossom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran's dangerous gaze glanced around the room, suddenly intensifying on Melissa, who was quietly trying to sneak out of the goods-in area. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, you will assist us!\" Kiran pointed at Melissa, who froze. \"Let us give Charlotte her happily ever after!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But hey I've nearly done these tickets, so I'll help you look for him if you want.\" she volunteered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er.. sure, thanks.\" Natalie smiled, accepting Jessica's assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're in for another night of weirdness.\" Jessica mumbled as she slipped the last ticket into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's why I need to find Mike, maybe hide him upstairs of something. And I might hide with him until the store opens up again.\" Natalie nodded, rubbing her forehead. She had never felt so worried before. The two women set off searching the rest of the store.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Charlotte's trousers meanwhile were bunching up around her ankles. \"Oh crap!\" Charlotte growled, as she and Kiran looked at each other after the tingling subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Charlotte who now had to look up into Kiran's face.

Kiran wasn't going to let a 'minor' thing like this stop her from helping Charlotte. If anything, this made it more imperative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte looked puzzled. And instead of protesting Kiran's 'calm' reaction to their swap, she agreed to trade trousers. But Charlotte coudn't help but wonder what else was going to happen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While the genital swap was still one of the worst things to ever happen to her, this height swap ranked very high in the discomfort level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store was so much bigger, so much disorientating now that she had shrunk by nine whole inches. Her new pants painfully clenching down on her new ballsack whenever she adopted a posture that was anything other than ramrod straight was the icing on the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Liz was nowhere in sight to yell at her to get back to work (although one of those screams that Charlotte ignored earlier sounded suspiciously like the supervisor).

Charlotte felt that feeling again. As before, it was hard to describe. Sure, she felt basic lust, as Charlotte's eyes did linger on Rob's rear... but there was something else.

Liz was stood to one side, hands over her mouth, but a cursory glance told Elizabeth that Liz hadn't changed... well, anymore than she had already. But when she looked at Jessica... Elizabeth's jaw dropped open. Jessica's high heels were discarded, torn at the sides due to the sudden growth of her feet, her trousers were skin tight... ripped in places (and also emphasizing a sizeable bulge), and her red company blouse was torn under the arms and at the sides due to her broader, more muscular torso, which included a flat, hairy chest. Jessica's pretty head looked more than a little peculiar perched atop such a masculine body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica I...\" Elizabeth began to say, before her eyes darted to Natalie fiance, who was now swimming in his clothes, his shoes far too big for his dainty feet, the crotch of his jeans showing no signs of masculinity, and evident on his chest... a pair of perky breasts pushed out his t-shirt. He was definitely shorter than before, yet as with Jessica, his head remained unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...?\" Mike bellowed in his usual deep voice, as his now manicured hands shot up to feel his newly grown breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie would have tried to comfort her boyfriend had she now got her own problems. One... problem specifically to be precise. Elizabeth noticed where Natalie was staring, down at her own groin. Elizabeth arched an eyebrow at the 'tent' that had formed in Natalie's boot-cut trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric?\" Liz addressed her husband, grabbing him by his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric didn't know quite what to say or do. He fidgeted slightly and looked down, then he placed a hand briefly on his crotch. His pants gave way under his hand, indicating the absence of his usual male 'equipment'. \"Fuck!\" he mumbled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, this might sound ridiculous, but - everyone stay calm.\" Elizabeth said, holding her hands up. \"Jessica, we need to get you some new clothes.\" she continued, trying to prioritize. She had a sense of deja-vous. But unlike with Mona upstairs, Jessica's clothes were too badly torn for Mike to wear, so she would have to dig out some clothes for him too. No way would he have worn high heels anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babes...\" Mike tried talking to Natalie. He was obviously in shock, as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... go with Elizabeth.\" Natalie shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica remained silent, but she winced as she set off walking. Her ill-fitting trousers were not being kind to her new male genitalia. And when she started (reluctantly) getting her first erection, that just made matters worse. She hurried after Elizabeth as fast as she could, and Mike followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric... look at me. It's not the end of the world okay.\" Liz reassured her husband, trying to get him to think positive, despite the fact he had just lost his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie licked her lips as she felt an odd... yet pleasant swelling sensation between her legs. <i>Great, I'm getting a stiffy...</i> she realized. Then she looked daggers at Eric, as though it was all his fault. She correctly worked out that it was Eric's phallus that she now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet more lives had been irrevocably changed by this second night's events.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

SO CUTE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before Charlotte could think anything beyond \"What the?\" She was lifted off the ground and spun around in a circle by the romanticist herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just had the cutest blush when you were talking to him and when he spoke, it was just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she had learned to do with Maddy, Charlotte tuned her out. So Kiran had actually gone to watch her? In hindsight, she should have seen it coming. Still, try as she may, she couldn't conjure up any emotions worse than \"mild annoyance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-I KNEW you had it in you! You sometimes act brusque and rude, but deep down beats the heart of a maiden!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Kiran finally set her down. Charlotte took a deep breath in, trying to calm down her frayed nerves. She caught a glimpse of Melissa out of the corner of her eye. She was giving Charlotte a look of extreme sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks?\" Charlotte tentatively said. She knew a losing fight when she saw one, and she did not want to see what other can of worms would open if she actually tried to engage Kiran in this state.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zoe eventually got up too and helped Carly clean off the waxing bed. Cum stains would not look welcoming to their clients tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose we should go home.\" Zoe sighed as she pulled her clothes back on.

Natalie glanced at her fiance in the passenger seat, dressed in the substitute Wilko clothing Elizabeth had provided. But even they were slightly too big for his slender new frame. Natalie looked at Mike's dainty hands, in particular his long fingernails with yellow nail varnish on, and she sighed. There was another swelling sensation in her pants as she sat there looking Mike over. \"Come on, let's get in the house.\" she mumbled to him, and the two exited the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the house, Natalie suggested they have supper, but Mike didn't have an appetite. Neither did she to be honest. Instead Mike went straight upstairs while Natalie fixed herself a coffee. She sat at the table for five minutes nursing her cup, thinking what a horrid night it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did eventually head upstairs, Natalie noticed the bedroom light was on, indicating Mike's presence, but when she walked in she was unprepared for what she saw. Mike had stripped naked and was studying himself in the full length mirror. Natalie's jaw fell open. There was Jessica's nude, shapely body, complete with a neatly trimmed pussy and perky breasts, with her fiance's stubbly visage perched atop of it. \"What the hell...?\" Natalie mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my body now right? Might as well get used to seeing it.\" Mike shrugged his slender shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Natalie had a full blown erection, and after watching Mike feeling himself up for a few minutes, Natalie realized she needed some 'release'. But the idea of having sex with Mike in their current states was not very appealing to Natalie. She had a dick for christ's sake, and it wasn't a young one either. Apparently though it was still capable of 'rising to the task'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike had more or less accepted the changes wrought on them by god knows what. But he could see his fiancee hadn't. He sighed, then stepped over to Natalie and started unfastening her trousers with his delicate fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Natalie frowned, backing off slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helping you.\" Mike stated. \"Now stand still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Natalie's erect cock and hairy ballsack were in full view, and both she and Mike stared down at it. \"It's pierced?\" Mike gasped, noticing the glint of metal. Eric had never told him he'd had that done. Seeing how uncomfortable Natalie was, Mike took her hand in his and led her to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is bad idea.\" Natalie shook her head, as Mike wrapped one of his feminine hands around his girlfriend's manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body isn't thinking so at this moment right?\" Mike smirked, as he started giving Natalie a handjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie just moaned and fidgeted a little, making no effort to escape Mike's 'gentle' grip.

She really didn't want to go, but maybe, just maybe, Dr. Braha could help her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squirmed as she sat in the waiting room; she didn't feel like she belonged there any more. When she was called in, she got undressed and changed into a paper gown. The nurse took her vitals as she waited for the doctor. She felt even more awkward waiting this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going today?\" Dr. Braha asked when she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" Was all Suki could think to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the good news is that you don't need x-rays. We found nothing wrong with your uterus the last time you were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki nearly cried, \"I still have a uterus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Braha looked confused, \"Haven't you always?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki pushed her gown aside, \"Now I have this too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Braha looked more confused, \"Yes, that's also nothing new. It's why we need x-rays to look at your uterus. As you know, you are a young, healthy woman with plenty of childbearing years ahead of you. However, if you hope to start a family, we do need to talk about your penis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Suki's turn to look confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears to be much older than the rest of you for some reason,\" Dr. Braha continued, \"While many don't think there are any problems with that when it comes to having children, there are. I remember in the past, you mentioned you did want to have children some day. If you want to have them with yourself, I recommend doing it sooner rather than later, otherwise I'd advise a donor. Obviously, due to your duel organs, natural insemination is impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki's head was spinning. She could have a child with herself? The thought seemed very weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki missed some of what Dr. Braha said in the middle, but the end of the talk was unmistakable, \"And because of this, we will need to conduct a prostate exam today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki gulped as she watched Dr. Braha snap a plastic glove onto her hand.</span></div></div>",

Even if it wasn't that night, she knew that everyone would have to sooner or later. Her day suddenly got worse when she saw Megan, one of her classmates from college. She wasn't exactly Jade's favorite person, even less so now that Megan still had had perky C-cups and her vagina, while Jade had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stop thinking about it...</i> she grumbled to herself. Not that she had to think about it. The 6-inch prick that she now had in her pants reminded her of her situation every time it stirred. And then there was her chest. She let out a sigh, hoping Megan wouldn't notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jade, over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, too much to ask for I guess.</i> Jade rolled her eyes, stopping in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You missed class this morning.\" Megan said, as she shook her head in mock disapproval. Jade frowned, then remembered she'd had college that morning, and of course with all that had happened to her, she'd forgotten. \"Professor Smith was not happy.\" Megan smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade just shrugged. \"Yeah well he can suck my...\" she suddenly stopped herself. <i>Why would I say that?</i> she asked herself subconsciously. <i>I know I've got a dick now, but still...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... Jade?\" Megan waved her hand in front of her classmate's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, zoned out there.\" Jade smiled nervously, happening to catch a glimpse of Megan's cleavage. Not that she was turned on by the sight of breasts now (unlike poor Zoe), but she couldn't hide the jealousy she now had for Megan and basically every other girl with breasts equal to or superior in size to the ones she had lost the previous night. Hell... she was even jealous of some of the guys from work, who now had tits after the mysterious 'swapfest' that took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just going shopping if you wanna tag along?

She then glanced over to Rob and noticed that his clothes were now hanging off of him like a young child trying on their parent's clothing during dress up time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, what gave you that idea?\"  Rob said sarcastically back to her.  He took a step and nearly tripped over his own trousers.  \"I think we swapped muscle mass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... we swapped what?\"  Becca asked back at him not knowing exactly what he was talking about.  But then she realized that it wasn't the only thing that changed.  \"Love, I think we swapped heights too.\"  She pointed out with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bollocks!\"  He exclaimed back at her.  He then did a quick check and noticed that he had indeed lost some height.  \"This is starting to get weird and we need to go see if Elizabeth knows what's going on.\"  He said as he tripped over his trousers, yet again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a solution to your problem, but I know you're not going to like it.\"  Becca said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what is your idea?\"  Rob said with trepidation as he was trying to pull up his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should swap clothes, I mean, they really don't fit us anymore.\"  Becca said while pointing at each of their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob hesitated and sighed as he replied back, \"I think you're right, but just the pants and shirt right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca nodded in agreement as she said. \"Well of course, I don't think my shoes and knickers will fit you,or will they?\"  She said giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they won't, but I think you're right.  I really can't go around trying to hold up my trousers up through the entire store.\" Rob said in defeat and they made their way to a corner and started to swap their clothes.  After a couple minutes, they were done.  Rob now wore Becca's shirt and trousers.  \"The only problem I see with this is that it will be a little loose up top here.\"  He said, gesturing toward Becca's top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we might swap that later on.\"  She said, giggling in Rob's voice..  \"Come on, we need to go find Elizabeth.\"  Rob nodded and they were soon on their journey again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Elizabeth didn't immediately notice that they had also swapped shirts too, since apart from the size, all Wilko polo shirts looked the same. But when she got closer, she noticed Rob's name badge read '<b>Becca</b>' - and vice-versa of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth happened?\" Elizabeth asked. And she got a bigger shock when Rob answered... in Becca's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know. We just... keep swapping stuff.\" he mumbled. He then gestured to the taller Becca stood beside him. \"She has my physique, my height and my voice. We had to trade shirts and trousers so they'd fit us properly.\" he explained further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth now knew that this was a series of unexplained incidents, since she'd seen Waggy and Aaron a moment ago, and they had switched heights too. Still, Aaron looked no where near as 'diminished' as Rob now did. \"Well, this hasn't just happened to you two.\" Elizabeth told the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca's eyebrow arached. \"Really?\" she muttered in her deep pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waggy is now taller than Aaron, so I think they somehow swapped heights too.\" Elizabeth nodded. \"And I'm just going to check up on Helen and Shaun, because I think I heard their raised voices earlier too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... okay. So... what do you want us to do?\" Becca's voice again left Rob's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was unsure what to tell her two employees. \"You can go back to work if you want, maybe for the distraction. But I'd understand if you don't really feel like working anymore.\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't work like this.\" Rob shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Elizabeth smiled. \"Just... try to stay calm. And maybe whatever is causing these swaps will go away soon and everything will go back to normal.\" she said, in vain hope. Even she didn't believe that was going to happen. But she was the manager, she had to put on a brave face since everybody automatically looked to her, or to Liz, for guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth clicked away from Rob and Becca in her high heels, leaving them eyeing each other up again. \"This sucks!\" Rob sighed dejectedly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had to admit they certainly smelled nice.  He then looked up to Charlotte and said. \"Now we are tied at 3 each.

Becca's ass meanwhile lost it's feminine shape and size as it shrank considerably, along with her hips. Becca's non-declared title of 'Booty Queen' of Wilkos was now gone. That 'honor' was now Rob's.

Then he just left the aisle, leaving Becca to inspect her new 'dimensions'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Charlotte and Steven were continuing to search the store together, looking for either Liz or Elizabeth. \"This store isn't that big, where are they?\" Steven whined in Charlotte's voice, as he pulled his new trousers up a little. Kiran's trousers fit him in terms of length now that he was only 5' tall, but he lacked the feminine hips to make them fit perfectly. Not that it really bothered him, they weren't that loose to be honest. And Kiran's name badge was still attached to the Wilkos shirt Steven wore, not that he had noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're probably busy trying to calm some of the others down.\" Charlotte shrugged, as she kept studying her male hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped in their tracks when they ran into Aaron, who was still pissed about switching heights with Waggy. But when Aaron saw the condition Steven was in, he knew he probably wasn't that bad off. \"Fucking hell, what happened to you two?\" he grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say it's pretty obvious wouldn't you?\" Steven replied, Charlotte's best 'irritated tone' leaving his lips as he pushed a single, annoying strand of his long hair out of his face. Steven was really annoyed that even though Aaron was now only 5' 5\", he still had to look 'up' at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah, I guess. Man you got fucked up worse than me!\" Aaron said to Steven, then glancing at Charlotte with her shaved head and the larger hands attacked to her slender female arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for stating the obvious!\" Steven responded, his glare intensifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte quickly got bored with the conversation. \"Look, with all that's happening, I don't think it's wise for us to form groups.\" she stated. Aaron frowned at hearing Steven's voice leave Charlotte's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd only then did he notice the glint of metal in Steven's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment one of their superiors appeared in view, much to Steven and Charlotte's relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out the way!\" Steven pushed his diminuative form past Aaron and headed for his superior. And Charlotte followed, with Aaron close behind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her bra cups soon hung empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Steven exclaimed... as he stared down at his chest and watched two mounds slowly form under what had been Kiran's work shirt. \"I've got tits!\" he then grumbled, reaching up to feel his newly grown breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got my boobs!\" Elizabeth confirmed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Charlotte and Aaron could do was look at each other in shock.

So despite having just lost her breasts to Steven, she maintained her professionalism. \"All right, cut it out, both of you!\" she ordered. \"Aaron and Charlotte, go back to your sections for now, and don't go near anyone else if you can help it. And Steven... um... come with me for a minute, I'll give you my bra.\" Elizabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Great!\"</i> Steven sighed dejectedly. He had to admit he needed it though, His new, feminine nipples were already chafing against his polo shirt. He followed Elizabeth into the Goods In area where they both removed their tops, and Steven got a good look at his new breasts before donning his boss's bra and then slipping Kiran's work shirt back over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth had to quietly agree with Charlotte, Steven was looking increasingly feminine. She decided to leave his company incase anything else was swapped between them. \"Just... let's hope this all sets itself right soon.\" Elizabeth muttered, not sounding very confident at all. She then went back out onto the shop floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven glanced up as his manager left the Goods In area, then he took stock of his mismatched appearance. Kiran's height, Elizabeth's breasts, Charlotte's hair, mouth and voice. He had to wonder what he was going to gain next. As he continued to grope his breasts... he found himself getting hard... as indicated by the growing bulge in his new waist-high trousers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted to be closer to her mum.\"  Josh replied as he didn't stop with his task of trying to find a good tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We work nearby at the \"Beautylicious\" salon.\"  Zoe added to the conversation. \"Carly here owns it and I work with her.

Becca's flats shouldn't even fit Rob. \"How did you get into those anyway?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was nervous, in fact too nervous to answer Liz's question. Becca had to do it instead. \"Liz... we swapped feet!\" she stated. Of course Liz thought she had misheard her younger employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, don't you mean shoes? And... I can see that. The answer I want is why?\" Liz chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca sighed. \"No... I mean me and Rob swapped FEET!\" she emphasized. She then kicked off Rob's shoes, which she had only just put on, and then sat down on the floor to pull the socks off her feet too. \"See, they're his feet.\" she said, pointing and wiggling her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz studied Becca's feet for a moment. They did look a little large to be on the end of Becca's legs. But it was just so hard to believe. To further convince her, Rob slipped his slender feet out of 'his' flats and silently pointed down at them. Liz gasped this time, there was no doubt Rob had a girl's feet. They were far too small to belong to any male his age. The pink varnish was the thing that really convinced Liz though. \"Okay, I believe you - I guess.\" Liz mumbled. \"But how on earth did this happen?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell us!\" Becca grumbled, putting 'her' socks and shoes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob eventually managed to say something. \"We heard some ruckus towards the front of the store too, so maybe it's not just us.\" he told Liz, who instantly began to get curious. But not yet curious enough to abandon her rounds. \"Look, as weird as this is, just... keep working okay.\" Liz told Rob and Becca, both of whom were stunned by their swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Becca sighed, nodding at her supervisor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks!\" Rob grumbled, as he looked down and wiggled his dainty toes in his new flats.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jade's hair meanwhile retracted back into her scalp... forming itself into Josh's short hairstyle. Before either of them could react to the change, Josh felt another tingle run through him. This time he started to shrink down several inches, his clothes beginning to hang loose on his body. At the same time... he watched in astonishment as Suki grew to his 5' 10\" height. Suki's trousers became terribly short and her shirt and underwear grew tighter on her as her muscles swelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This couldn't get any worse!\" Josh whined in his new voice, having now swapped hair with Jade and muscle mass/heights with Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki meanwhile couldn't hide her own astonishment as she looked down at herself, flexing her new muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!!

Then she gestured down to her own narrow hips and the belt holding her skirt up. \"My hips and bum got swapped with Steven, embarrassingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz stared at Steven's new curves and was a little surprised. \"Wow, it really is widespread. Becca and Rob got hit too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's more, trust me.\" Elizabeth said. \"We need to find out what's going on.\" she said. \"If we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get out of the shop.\" Liz stated. \"Has Josh had any luck with the exit?\" she asked her manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth shrugged. \"Doubtful, but I'm not sure. I did hear a commotion at the front a while ago. I wouldn't be surprised if he's been swapped too. He was talking to Carly and Zoe at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" Liz mumbled forlornly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Carly's voice sounded out loud and clear. \"No I couldn't get the doors open, sorry.\" Everyone was shocked when they turned to see Josh standing there. Having fled Jade and Suki's aisle, he now looked drastically different. He was a lot shorter and slender in appearance, he had a feminine hairstyle that Liz recognized as Jade's, and Steven was the first to notice Josh was wearing Suki's clothes... with her name badge still on her shirt. And then of course... there were his hands and his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit mate, whatever's happening... it really got you.\" Steven said to Josh, looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" Josh whined in his female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah meanwhile was continuing to work as the four people on her aisle kept chatting. She listened, but remained silent. She didn't want to admit that she was confused and scared.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They decided to cut their losses before they had something else swapped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Carly and Zoe had fled the store in a hurry, Elizabeth and Liz arrived at the front. \"Well, it seems we wasted our time laying those blankets out on the floor.\" Liz grumbled in Liam's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, we weren't to know.\" Elizabeth said, as she adjusted her bra strap, trying to get used to her bigger tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get everyone out of here while we can.\" Liz suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As they are?\" Elizabeth asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't swap them back,\" Liz sighed, \"and at least if they're out of the store, nothing else will get swapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, gather everyone up and send them home.\" Elizabeth said, dishing her final order of the day out to Liz. Not long after that all the staff, including a few lucky ones who had got away without being swapped at all, had gone home. Liz, who normally called her husband to let him know she was on her way home, decided against doing that tonight, for obvious reasons. He wouldn't recognize her voice now anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching Elizabeth drive off, Liz got in her own car and headed home for the night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But he grew to like her new breasts and her voice.  She opened her eyes and felt like something was off.  She looked down to see that her breasts had indeed grown back to their normal 30H size.  \"What in the world?\"  She said as she quickly woke up.  \"I could of sworn that I had smaller breasts from Elizabeth last night and I had Liam's voice too.  But I don't know what happened.\"  Just then Liz's husband walked in as he heard his wife's voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you got your voice back\"  He said calmly as he made his way over to the bed to give her a quick peck on the cheek with his toothbrush in hand.  \"Do you know what happened?\"  He asked her as he continued to brush his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just shook her head as she heard her mobile ringing.  \"Hello?\"  She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, this is Elizabeth, did you find yourself back to normal this morning?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't know exactly what happened, but when I woke up, I noticed it too.\"  She replied back.  \"Do you think everyone else is back to normal too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, but we will have to wait until we get back to the store to find out.\"  Elizabeth told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLIz nodded and replied back, \"Yeah.  I will see you then.\"  She then hung up the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at Josh's house, He woke up with a start.  He could of sworn that he was changed.  \"It must have been a dream.\"  He said to himself as he made his way out of bed.  He reached out for his mobile to see what time it was and saw his hand.  They looked like his hands, but they had light purple nail varnish on them and it appeared that they had a manicure done to them. \"Honey?\"  He questioned out loud hoping for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, luv.\"  Came the response from his wife, Marcie.  \"What is it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, this may sound weird, but did I come home changed last night?\"  He asked his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you did and when I woke up this morning, I noticed that you changed back.\"  She replied back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank good, because if I had to go through another shift like that I don't know what I would have done.\"  He said as he sighed out loud.  \"Do you know what happened to my hands, did you do this?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, luv.\"  she answered back. \"But I think the color looks good on you.\"  She said with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess, I will stop by that salon to see what happened.'  He thought to himself as he looked to find his uniform.  \"Well crap.\"  Josh said out loud as he noticed his uniform.  He held it out in front of him and noticed the name tag said '<i>Suki</i>'.  It appeared that it would fit his old body, even the knickers that he borrowed last night.  \"I guess I will be wearing this tonight, since I haven't got anything else to wear.\"  Josh said to himself as he got into the shower to get ready for the day.</span></div></div>",

You can have a seat over there.\"  She said as she gestured to the waiting area.  Josh nodded in agreement as he made his way over to the waiting area and had a seat.  He noticed several beauty magazines sitting on the table in front of him and he picked one up and started to thumb through it.  It didn't really suit his fancy, but he looked through it nonetheless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see anything in there that I can help you with?\"  Came a voice from last night.  Josh looked up to see Zoe looking down at him.  Josh quickly put down the magazine that he was looking at and quickly stood up to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason why I came over is because of this.\"  Josh said as he held up his hands to show off the light purple varnish that had adorned his nails.  The young lady that was behind the counter let out a small giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well last night after we got out of Wilko, Carly and I made our way over here.  I was distraught about what had happened so Carly offered to help me with my nails.  So of course I accepted.\"  She started explaining. \"That is why they look like that.  Just think of it as a free manicure.\"  She said to him with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can you at least help me get the stuff off?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that, I think that is a good color on you.\"  Zoe said with a smirk.  \"Sure just follow me this way and I will help you out.\"   She motioned to the manicure station nearby.  Josh followed her over and Zoe noticed his uniform and he had on.  \"I see you still have the uniform from last night too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but the strange thing is that it changed with me too, which I thought was odd.\"  Josh said as Zoe continued to strip the polish from his nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what happened last night?\"  Zoe asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and I don't know if it will happen again or not.\"  Josh said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, all done.\" Zoe said as she finished up.  \"Could I interest you in a wax while you're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not today.\"  Josh said back to her.  \"Perhaps next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will make sure you keep that appointment.\"  She said with a smile on her face.  \"Now off you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh got up and thanked her for her time and made his way out the door and found his way back to Wilko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe got up from her station and made her way back to the back to help Carly with inventory.  \"Who was that, luv?\"  She asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was Josh, the bloke from Wilko last night. You had his voice.\"  Zoe replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, what did he want?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wanted to get the polish off his nails that you put on last night.\"  She answered back.  \"You know it will be a great business opportunity we have there and it would be a shame to toss it aside.\"  She then went on about her plan to get more business for the salon with what might go on with Wilko.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But Carly knew that if they both went to Wilko again that night, the same thing could happen. They would be swapped around with the employees again. \"Well, if it does happen again, I suppose some of the women might need a new manicure.\" Carly shrugged as she stood there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and even if it's only temporary, it's money in the kitty for us.\" Zoe nodded, sounding confident about her plan. She had recovered fully from the 'trauma' of losing her hands and her hair last night. She was glad to have her parts back safe and sound. She had half expected Steven to have cut her hair or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay but for now we've got clients to take care of, and your next one is here.\" Carly told Zoe, gesturing to the woman walking in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jingle of the chimes caused Zoe to turn and look at her client, Linda. \"Heya luv, just pop in the back, I'll be right through.\" she said politely. \"And I'll speak to you in a bit.\" Zoe said to Carly, who then went back to her salon duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe let out a sigh, and then continued with her own job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, at 3:00pm, all the salon's clients had been seen to, and after a full day of doing waxes, nails and lashes, both Carly and Zoe were ready for home. However, they were instead going to head straight to Wilko, where they knew the evening team would be arriving for work by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe packed a lot of nail polish into a small bag, along with some hair grips, a brush and some scissors just incase. Carly had her own bag with some other make-up inside it. \"You know we're probably not going to need all this.\" Carly mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know.\" Zoe shrugged. She then looked over at her friend. \"You look apprehensive luv, you okay?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly continued pacing the room, her heels click clacking on the floor as she went. \"I'm just nervous that's all, considering what happened last night. I don't really want to be swapped again.\" she admitted to Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe tried to persuade her to think more positive. \"Well, it was only temporary last night, so IF it happens tonight, chances are it will be temporary again.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, maybe not.\" Carly remained unconvinced. But she nonetheless followed Zoe out of the salon and down to Wilko when the time came. They both took a deep breath before walking into the store just before they closed the doors to customers. Elizabeth was stood behind the help desk on the computer, checking some inventory levels. When she saw the two beauticians enter the shop she smiled. \"Oh... hi you two. Didn't expect to see you in here again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I didn't expect me to be here either.\" Carly smiled nervously. \"Is Liz in?\" she asked the store manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth nodded. \"Yeah, I'll call her for you.\" she said, before activating the tannoy system and calling Liz to the help desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Liz arrived, the usual, friendly chat took place, and Zoe explained to Liz and Elizabeth why they had brought some make-up and nail polish with them. Needless to say the two Wilko senior staff were a little perplexed. But they had no problems with Carly and Zoe staying for the shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, so... I guess we wait?\" Zoe mumbled, as she glanced to her right to see Laura and Mona arriving for their shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the staff were soon present and accounted for.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shaun and Helen were also sitting together talking about last night, from what Josh could overhear.  He sat down at the table by himself while reading a book until the start of the shift.  \"Hey Josh, glad to see that you're back to normal.\"  Josh looked up to see Suki standing next to him.  He motioned for her to have a seat and he put up his book for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Suki. Glad to see that you're back to normal too.\"  Josh replied back.  \"Sorry, I can't give back your uniform, but it kinda grew with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem,\"  She said back to him. \"I kind of can't give yours back to you either.\"  She sat there looking around the room at the others and asked him. \"Do you think it will happen again tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know, but if it does, we know that we will change back to normal the next day.\"  He replied back to her with some certainty to his voice.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unaware of what had happened to Josh and Carly at the front of the shop, Becca and Rob continued to chat between themselves. Ever since they were swapped yesterday, they'd become better friends. But that didn't mean Becca's voice still didn't get on his nerves when she talked too much. \"You getting that sense of dread again Becca?\" Rob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... I am actually, yeah.\" Becca replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, and then Rob stopped working again. \"I just know it's gonna happen again.\" he stated, negatively. Becca said nothing this time, instead she just shared a nervous glance with Rob and sighed. They were both startled when Elizabeth suddenly appeared at the end of the aisle. \"Are you two doing alright on here?\" she asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of.\" Rob answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're okay.\" Becca nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well remember, if anything happens, don't panic. Things will probably go back to normal tomorrow morning again.\" Elizabeth tried reassuring the two of them, and herself at the same time. Becca and Rob then watched as Elizabeth disappeared off the aisle, her high heels clicking on the floor and slowly fading as she got further away from their aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob resumed putting stock on the shelves, while Becca decided to try and fix her safety knife, the blade of which had come out. It was then that they both felt the by now familiar tingling sensation. It was centered on their heads. \"Becca...\" Rob mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" Becca cut him off sharply. \"Brace yourself!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca suddenly felt her blood red hair being sucked up into her scalp, and she dropped her knife, bringing her hands up to her head as her hair changed into a man's short style. \"Fuck! I only dyed it again two days ago.\" Becca grumbled. Hearing an annoyed mutter from Rob, Becca looked over to him to see that he now had her long red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got a scrunchie of something, or even an elastic band?\" Rob growled angrily, as he pushed his hair behind his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't like ponytails.\" Becca answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Rob rolled his eyes, kicking a box down the aisle and scuffing one of his flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca put her hands on her hips and shook her head at Rob. \"Yeah that's gonna help the situation, just kick the crap out of everything.\" She then sighed. \"Look, just deal with having my hair for tonight, and you'll be back to normal tomorrow. You heard Elizabeth.\" she told Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Rob said, reluctantly returning to work and trying to keep his new hair out of his face. Becca ran her fingers through her short hair and shrugged, she at least liked how much cooler it felt not having long hair. She also returned to work, wondering along with Rob, whether that was going to be the only swap they suffered that night. They doubted it very much.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't look quite right for some reason, but Elizabeth couldn't immediately identify what was the matter. That is until she saw Liam traipsing behind Liz... his Wilko shirt now distended by two large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh!\" Elizabeth muttered, figuring she'd better check up to see if Liz was doing okay. She hurried down the aisle, her high heels clicking on the floor as she went, until she caught up to Liz and Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz... I just...\" Elizabeth started to say, but when Liz turned around and Elizabeth saw the supervisor's flat chest, she was unsure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, don't worry. I'm just going to give my bra to Liam, now that he has my boobs.\" Liz said to Elizabeth, reading her mind. \"It actually feels kinda nice not having to lug the girls around, even if just for one night again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not nice for me!\" Liam grumbled, as he manhandled his loose-hanging tits. His nipples were already chafing against the fabric of his taut shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look at this as a learning experience,\" Elizabeth told Liam, \"maybe now you'll have a little more respect for women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I don't see the link between back ache and respect.\" Liam responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck it up!\" Liz scolded Liam, silencing him. \"And get in here if you want my bra. Otherwise you can work without one, but I'd advise against it.\" Liz then smirked, dragging Liam into the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know if you need anything Liz.\" Elizabeth called out just before Liz and Liam disappeared from view. Elizabeth then sighed, and turned around, also catching a glimpse nearby of Josh's new shapely legs and his tight skirt. \"Oh yeah, things are in full swing alright.\" Elizabeth muttered to herself, as she began to hear a couple of raised voices on one of the other aisles. They were both female voices, and so Elizabeth had to wonder if it was just a normal argument between two of the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the aisle, Elizabeth saw what the problem was. Charlotte and Kiran were mouthing off at each other, only it was Charlotte who was now barely 5' tall, and Kiran had shot up to 5' 9\", or Charlotte's height. \"Elizabeth... I hate this already!\" Charlotte growled. Since she was wearing leggings, there wasn't too much of a clothing issue for Charlotte, but Kiran's trousers were way too short now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlotte... just give Kiran your leggings, please. Remember this will probably just be for one night.\" Elizabeth sighed. \"And stop shouting at each other. This is nobody's fault remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little comfort.\" Charlotte grumbled, as she removed her plimsolls and began to strip out of her leggings right there on the aisle. Kiran quickly did the same, and in no time, they had donned each other's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat situation diffused, Elizabeth continued with her rounds until Liz returned from the back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The last time she had been this flat was when she was 11 years old, shortly before her boobs started growing in. \"It does feel weird though, it... itches a little.\" she winced, scratching her slightly hairy chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do we have any idea what's causing all these swaps yet?\" Nicola inquired, as the three stood chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and we probably never will.\" Liz answered. \"I guess we'll just have to learn to live with them.

Josh and Carly have swapped legs and hips, he's parading around here in a skirt somewhere.\" she mumbled, glancing around her.

Aaron was still pissed at having lost his muscles to Laura, and when he saw Steven's face plastered on Liz's body... he was a little taken aback. \"Woah... shit!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Language Aaron!\" Liz berated her employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah, whatever.\" Aaron grumbled. He couldn't take Liz serious anymore for some reason. But she was still his supervisor, regardless of whose face she wore. She proceeded to make this clear to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the lecture was over, both of them suddenly felt the familiar tingling sensation. <i>Oh not again.</i> Liz thought, looking down at herself. After a few seconds it was clear that the tingling was centered on her crotch. <i>Ooh... here it comes</i>. Liz sighed, bracing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!!\" Aaron cried out as he felt his cock being sucked up into his body, along with his balls. After a few moments he had a fully functioning vagina and female reproductive system. \"My nob!!\" he was quite distraught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now I know what Nicola was experiencing.\" Liz muttered, looking down at herself. She now had Aaron's cock forming a bulge in her trousers. And she had to admit... her first erection felt... nice. She just had to rub her new appendage through the fabric of her slacks, much to Aaron's chagrin as he found himself rubbing his new pussy through his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Return to your section Aaron. This is only for one night, remember.\" Liz told the bad-tempered 'man' standing in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz then headed off, having to adjust the way she walked slightly because of her new genitalia. Liz had to wonder why she kept swapping with guys. First Liam, then Steven and now Aaron. And she had lost what made her a woman, her vagina and her ample breasts, even her voice and face. Yet... she managed to retain her composure despite her drastic changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even supervisors could get curious. So she quietly slipped upstairs to the ladies toilets to check out her new penis.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No sooner had she done that - she felt another tingle start to affect her. She began to hope, that maybe... she'd get an interesting swap this time. But the only other person near her was Suki. Or so she thought. As it happened Rob was passing by heading to the toilets, still trying to keep his dyed red hair out of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being swapped again!\" Jade announced to Suki, who instantly showed an interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, where's the tingle happening?\" Suki answered with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jade's chagrin, it wasn't centered on her crotch, so she knew her vagina was staying put. \"My chest!\" Jade blurted out, looking down, just in time to see the protrusions in her shirt disappearing. \"Well, welcome to the 'flat as a board' club.\" Suki quipped, as she watched Jade's boobs vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to be shitting me!\" Rob's voice suddenly shouted out, as he walked into view. \"Whose tits are these?\" he called out, angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're mine!

To her surprise it was Head Office, who normally didnt phone at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short and blunt message from one of the higher ups, just as Elizabeth would expect. Basically she was told that a member of the public (anonymously) had made a complaint about one of Elizabeth's staff members. But that the person did not want to take matters further because she had taken her own 'specialist' course of action. Basically, Head Office was checking that everything was okay at the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... everything's fine Mr. Henton,\" Elizabeth lied to her superior over the phone. \"But if anything happens, I'll let you know, I promise. Yes sir.\" Elizabeth added, even as she felt another tingle, this time centered on her chest. As Elizabeth put the phone down, she felt her breasts swell an extra cup size... putting increased pressure on her bra..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversely, Carly stopped waxing her legs for a moment to grab her shrinking tits. She seemed relieved when they didn't disappear completely, but now her bra was too big for her. Luckily she had a red lace one that was a B-cup amongst the collection she had brought in for the Wilko staff. But first, she'd have to finish up waxing her new male legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not bad.\" Elizabeth smirked, peering down her blouse at her new breasts, and noticing the rose tattoo on the left one. When Carly saw the store manager inspecting her own chest, she knew who had her boobs. \"Take care of those for me.\" Carly chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do luv, will do.\" Elizabeth nodded with a smile. But then she started to think about the phone call again. She now knew that one of her employees had angered a member of the public somehow. She could do with finding out which employee it was, and whether this was the cause of all the trait swapping. However, with the shift ending soon, Elizabeth figured it could wait until tomorrow night, when everyone was back to normal and probably ready to start the swapping again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, she decided to call Liz to the help desk and inform her of what had transpired.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked at Kiran and noticed that she was looking away, refusing to make eye contact.  \"What's wrong, Kiran?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you promise not to tell Charlotte where you got the information?\"  She asked with what looked like tears starting to well up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, now how about you tell me what happened.\"  Elizabeth promised as she moved closer to her so that she could hear what Kiran had to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, from what Charlotte told me, an old lady came in the store and wanted her to help her find something.  Charlotte was talking to another employee and kept on telling the lady that she would be done in a minute.\"  Kiran started to explain.  She then told the rest of the story to Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, from what we gather when the sun sets, which is roughly 6pm and it stopped at about 9pm last night, that's when the doors unsealed themselves.\"  Elizabeth started to do the math in her head.  \"And when the sun rises the next day, we swap back to normal.  Did she say what this lady looked like?\" She then looked back to Kiran, who had a sense of relief about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think you're better asking Charlotte about that.\"  Kiran replied back to her.  \"Remember that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth then interrupted her. \"I didn't hear it from you.

She therefore knew the doors should be opening soon, if what Kiran had told her about their curse had been accurate. The more muscular manager adjusted her larger boobs in her bra and then set off to find Liz again. She was at least pleased that the swaps seemed to have stopped for the night. And as usual, some people had gotten away without being swapped. Natalie and Jessica definitely seemed to be leading charmed lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth found Liz chatting to Waggy about her swaps, and once more Elizabeth shook her head.

Or just let things continue and hopefully the curse will remove itself after a while?\" Elizabeth mumbled, valuing Liz's opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz knew how Charlotte would react if they suddenly started cornering her like caged animal. \"Personally, I think we should just let things continue as they are. These swaps aren't that life altering, since they're only temporary.

Josh was still wearing Carly's skirt and had a perky pair of breasts, courtesy to Suki, under his shirt.  Steven had Liz's face and voice along with Rebekah's arms.  Everyone was surprised to see Liam most of all, they'd all heard about him, but had yet to really see his changes.  He had Liz's breasts and Nichola's well used vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you doing okay, Liam.\"  Jade wondered as she scratched her flat chest that she gained from Rob.  Liam instantly shied away from her, afraid of another swap would occur.  Jade was perplexed at this.  \"What was that for?\"  She wondered mostly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now that I have you all here, we want to talk about what's happening.\"  Liz said as everyone gave her their attention.  She explained what they 'thought' was happening, the times and everything.  They all seemed pleased that somebody had some sort of clue on what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that makes sense.\"  Carly said to her, still with Josh's pants on, well they were Suki's originally, but fit Josh now.  \"And it looks like we only swap one thing per person too.  But that might change, I don't know.  That swaps occur so randomly we really don't know.\"  Everyone agreed with this observation then Liz broke up their discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, This shift has ended, so let's all go home for the night and get some sleep so we can be back to normal tomorrow.\"  Liz said as she clapped her hands for emphasis.  With that everyone got out of the store and got ready to make their way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carly.\"  Josh called out as he made his way over to her and Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, luv.  What can I do for you?\"  She wondered as she looked over from her conversation to meet Josh's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if I can have those pants back.  They are kind of the only pair I really have and I don't want to wear this to work tomorrow.\"  Josh replied back as he gestured to his new skirt, on loan from Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let's go over to the salon, I have some clothes there that might fit my new legs for the night.\"  Carly said as she motioned Josh and Zoe to follow her.  Soon they arrived and Josh followed the 2 ladies inside.  \"Now let's see here, have a seat over there and I will head to the back, I have some clothes back there that might fit us.\"  Josh made his way to the group of chairs near the entrance and waited for Carly to come back.  After several minutes, Carly returned wearing a pair of jeans and she handed Josh something to wear for his ride home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\"  Josh wondered as he held up a pair of what appeared to be really thin pants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are Yoga pants.  You can keep them, I already have 3 other pairs at home, I've worn those too much and was about to throw them out anyhow.\"  Carly said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will they fit?\"  Josh wondered as he held them up to his legs as if he was sizing them up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you have my legs and hips, so they should fit just fine.  You can go change in the room over there?\"  Carly said as she pointed over to one of the waxing rooms.  Soon Josh was changed into his new pants and was fidgeting with his crotch.  \"What are you doing that for?\"  Carly asked him with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They may fit your legs and hips, but I still have my male appendage.\"  Josh said as he gathered up his belongings and handed Carly back her skirt.  \"Thanks for letting me borrow that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.  Maybe we will see you in here some more?\"  Carly said with a smile as Josh left out the door to go home for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So were you able to get it done?\"  Zoe asked as she made her way over to see Carly's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was able to finish them while we were stuck inside the store.\"  Carly then raised up her pant leg to show Zoe her handiwork.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was from Liz (who had all of her employees' phone numbers in her phone). <i>Dont 4get to bring my bra back tomorrow, thanx</i> the message read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be my pleasure.\" Liam grumbled.

He was back to normal again, and it was such a relief not to have to carry Liz's large breasts around anymore. Then there was the pleasing fact that his penis had returned to it's rightful place. But he couldn't help but wonder whether Nicola had been playing with it last night. <i>Probably</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only had the courage to look at Nicola's vagina once while it was between his legs, and he didn't like how it looked. Middle-aged, with stretch marks, the results of eight child births. He felt a shiver run down his spine every time he recalled seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he knew that if he went into work tonight, there'd be a chance he'd end up with someone else's breasts or vagina, or another feminine body part. He just didn't seem to swap with any of the other guys, and he was puzzled as to why. He didn't think it could have simply been because the women outnumbered the men at Wilko. Not all the swaps had been between male and females, just most of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis urge to hand in his notice and quit his job was tempered by the fact that he had no money coming in from anywhere else. He needed his job to pay the bills, and that was that. \"Fuck my life!\" Liam grumbled, before shoving a spoonfull of crunchy nut cornflakes into his mouth. He knew he'd be going into work as normal that night. He'd just have to hope the swaps gave him a miss this time, or at least swapped him with another male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing his cereal, Liam dumped the bowl into the sink, adding to the collection of unwashed pots. Then he grabbed his Wilko shirt and work trousers and proceeded to get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed Liz's bra off the back of a chair before he left.

Maybe 20 minutes work out of every hour. And I might set you to work with someone else yet, I haven't made up my mind.\" Liz said in a cold tone.

You are working with them, because they really needed your help with the excess stock that we received.  Secondly, I have no idea why you're being singled out with the changes, perhaps it's because you're an American, or maybe it's because you have blue eyes.  I don't really know.\"  She shrugged her shoulders.  \"Perhaps you're just lucky and you know better than anyone that you will return back to normal in the morning.  So I wouldn't get too worked up about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt relief when she said this.  \"I guess you're right.  I'm getting worked up about nothing.  Thank you for the talk, I appreciate it.\"  Josh answered back to her as he made his way back over to Suki and Jade.  'She must be right, I'm just 'lucky' that I get chosen for all these changes.

It was then that Mona stopped in her tracks when she felt a tingle run through her scalp. Without turning to look at Carly, she could pretty much guess what was happening. She should have known she wouldn't get through the night without at least one swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, the tingling subsided, and Mona turned around to see Carly... now sporting her shoulder-length black hair. \"My hair suits you luv.\" Carly commented, seeing the now blonde, cropped hairstyle Mona possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, um... thanks, I guess.\" Mona forced out a smile as she ran her fingers through her new hair. She knew it could have been worse, she could have swapped something else, and with a guy no less.

Kiran, you look older.\" she said to her petite friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jessica was right, Elizabeth and Kiran had swapped ages.

And to her surprise, she got more than just a simple answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saw her a while ago, but she vanished when our genitals got swapped.\" Steven answered in Elizabeth's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has your penis??\" Elizabeth asked, surprised. <i>That might explain why she's upstairs.</i> she then thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it's gone.\" Steven nodded, patting his flat crotch for his boss's benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, it's just for one night remember. You'll have your 'fella' back tomorrow.\" Elizabeth smirked at Steven. Then she left his company and decided to head upstairs to locate her missing staff supervisor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That way, he reasoned, he might not have anything else swapped. But he also didn't want to break a nail (and risk Carly's wrath) so to open the boxes on his section he would be needing one of the safety knives the store provided to the employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" Luke grumbled, as he realized whoever was in the next aisle would probably have one he could borrow for  a few minutes. He braced himself and then nipped over to the next aisle - and saw Melissa working there. Luke didn't really know Melissa, since she was a recent transfer from another store, but he really did need to borrow her knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, can I borrow your knife for a minute please?\" Luke asked, as he tried to keep his hands hidden from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shrugged. \"Yeah, sure, but bring it back.\" And with that she tossed the knife in Luke's direction.. making him catch it. And in so doing - he revealed his feminine hands to Melissa, and a wry smile appeared on her face. \"Cute nails.\" she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're Carly's, okay!\" Luke grumbled, turning red a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa chuckled. \"I've got a feeling your own nails will be painted too, come morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke sighed and turned to vacate the aisle before anything happened. But he hung around just a few seconds too long. He suddenly felt the tingling sensation, and it was running through his entire lower body it seemed like. \"Oh no, no, no... please no.\" he muttered, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, incoming swap.\" Melissa said, as she felt the tingling too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was helpless as he shrank several inches in height, his backside filled out a bit and he felt his feet shrinking in his shoes. Even more shocking to him... he felt his cock rapidly retract up into his body... along with his balls. \"My dick!\" he almost cried out... patting his crotch as his trousers pooled at his ankles. Melissa meanwhile had experienced the opposite changes. She gained a few inches in height as her legs extended and became quite hairy, her ass lost it's feminine shape, her feet expanded against the insides of her flats... causing her to kick them off, and a slight bulge formed in her now ill-fitting trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" Melissa said, as she rubbed the erection that soon appeared in her knickers. \"We swapped our entire lower halves?\" she asked, as if needing Luke to confirm that he now had a vagina between his legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate this place.\" Luke grumbled, as his shoulders slumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should trade what clothes we need to, then report this to Elizabeth or Liz.\" Melissa suggested, gesturing towards the Goods In area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose...\" Luke reluctantly agreed, following Melissa.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It slowly started to inflate until it reached a solid B-cup.  He looked over to Becca and soon realized that her chest had deflated until it was as flat as a board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca then looked over to her section-mate and chuckled at his predicament.  \"Hey, at least they're not as big as Waggy's or Liz's.\"  Rob nodded as he got ready to bring his cage to the back to dispose of his used boxes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She went to answer it, but then remembered that she had Steven's voice. \"Crap.\" she thought. \"What if it's head office.\" Elizabeth immediately put an announcement out over the tannoy. \"Steven come to the help desk ASAP please.\" she bellowed in her now deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone else, it sounded like Steven was summoning himself to the front of the store, which was weird indeed.

I'll be here listening in and will tell you what to say, so don't worry.\" Elizabeth said, as she brought up the Word processor on the computer so she could type helpful hints and instructions to Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven let his shoulders slump, then sighed deeply, before walking behind the help desk and picking up the phone. \"Hello, Wilko, Rotherham, Elizabeth speaking how may I help?\" he said professionally. He then instantly covered up the reciever and whispered to Elizabeth. \"Shit, it's Mark Henton, regional manager.\" he told her straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, stay calm, and stop swearing!\" Elizabeth frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Steven said, rolling his eyes. And as he continued chatting to the big wig on the other end of the phone, Waggy and Suki were stood nearby listening in. Steven saw them both, and got distracted by Waggy's flat chest... not to mention the noticeable bulges in the pants of both women. Elizabeth saw them too and quickly shooed them off, so as not to make Steven's task anymore difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is bizarre.</i> Elizabeth thought, as she continued eavesdropping on Steven's phone conversation. <i>Shit!</i> Elizabeth then thought, when she heard that Mark Henton would be making a visit to the store tomorrow evening. That's all she needed. He'd be arriving just as this weird swapping routine starts. But she couldn't very well tell Steven to tell him not to come, after all... Mark Henton was her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll make sure everything is in order, Sir.\" Steven ended the phone call, saying goodbye to the guy.

The light finally changed color and he continued his way home, within 10 minutes he was pulling in his driveway.  He turned off the vehicle and sat in there and thought about his ride home.  As soon as he got in he noticed that his feet wouldn't reach the pedals and he had to scoot his seat up.  Most of all he felt weird with his bum inflated and lack of muscle to turn the wheel too.  \"Well, I guess I need to get this over with.\"  He said with a sigh.

It was then that he was able to see what he looked like.  He stripped down and looked at the full size mirror that was in their room and noticed that his hips and bum was a lighter color than the rest of his body and his groin was a darker color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you got rid of your penis too?\"  He heard from behind him and turned around and found that he was eye to eye with his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel uncomfortable.\"  Josh said as he tried to find some clothes to put on and realized that all his clothes would be too big for him.  \"Now nothing will fit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's the rush?\"  Marcie said from the room.  \"Let me show you what it's like to be a woman and then I will give you something to wear after we are done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... okay.\"  Josh said as he made his way back to the room and noticed that his wife was already to go on the bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And just knowing that it was his supervisor's pussy he now had was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving discarded his coat, he inspected his arms for a moment, running his fingers across them. Natalie's arm hairs were thinner than his had been, and the volume of hair was less, and of course the rest of his body except his pubic area and head was hair free. He had to admit, Natalie certainly took care of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter raiding the fridge for a bite to eat, Steven made his way to his bedroom and switched on his computer as he normally did. One of the advertisements on his favorite site had a flashing picture of a busty woman on it. Steven studied the picture for a moment, licking his lips, but... something felt different. The busty female form didn't look quite as sexy as it normally did to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture of the topless man above though....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Steven grumbled, as he switched to the youtube website. He didn't even want to contemplate the fact that the vagina he'd have for at least a few hours longer was making him fancy men. He decided watching a video game walkthrough by <i>TheRadBrad</i> would lighten his spirits. As the video played in the background, Steven began stripping out of his work clothes. When it came to taking off his boxer shorts, he let out a feminine gasp. He stared down in disbelief down at the moist folds of Liz's vagina, nestled between his smooth legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowsers!\" Steven whispered. \"Liz's pussy!\" He then smirked a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was definitely going to be a long and 'interesting' night for Steven...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I swear, he looked like a stick before, but now he has some curves.\"  Jade said to herself as she began to get ready for work.  She was actually ready for tonight and was wanting to see what else she could get.</span></div></div>",

Both her hands shot down to her groin and started feeling it up. There was no doubt that she now had a set of male genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You swapped with me!\" Suki suddenly spoke up, scratching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suki... this is your penis?\" Jade asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, afraid so.\" Suki sighed, clearly disappointed with the swap. Josh meanwhile just glanced over to Suki, not saying anything. They were the only two who knew that the cock Jade now had actually belonged to Josh and not Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, cool!\" Jade chuckled, as she started getting an erection. Focusing on work would be difficult now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki, now with a vagina again, did not share Jade's enthusiasm about the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

True, she'd seen some bad hair in her time as a hairdresser in the past, but she'd always taken care of her own hair and had never had it not attached to her head.  She'd had to grab a towel from the home goods section on her way to the bathroom and promised Liz that she would pay for it before she left for the night.  Soon she found her way back to the front Help Desk to drop off the items that she used to clean her new greasy hair.  Zoe was still there organizing all the items they brought with them.  She looked up to notice Carly coming back.  \"Hey, luv, how did it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked at her with a grimace on her face. \"I had to wash it twice and I still feel nasty.\"  She shuddered, thinking about it.   Her new hair was still damp and it went down past her shoulders.  \"I have to admit, it is quite long.  Liam must have been really lazy to not get it cut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Zoe had a brilliant idea.  \"How about we give him a haircut.\"  Zoe said to her boss and friend.  \"I mean it is YOUR hair now and we will do it like we did with Josh.\"  Carly looked over to her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I think that will be fun.\"  Carly said as she brought her new hair in front of her eyes to get another look at it.  \"I am sure he will need to make a visit to the barber after we are done with it, but let's have some fun tonight.\"  Both girls giggled at what Liam would think when he woke up the next day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come on!\" Rob said, inviting the ribbing from his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I know they won't exactly fit right in terms of length, but I think we need to switch trousers.\" Becca suggested, holding her pants up as they both became aware that along their their bums... their hips had been swapped out too, to accomodate.

You remember that right?\" she muttered. She couldn't believe he was trying to chat her up and ask her out on a date. Just then there was a moment of perfect timing. Just as Rebekah was wondering if Luke could ever 'keep it in his pants', she started feeling the familiar tingling - centered on her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!! Oh... no, no. no...\" Luke grumbled, stumbling backwards as he also felt the tingling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later Rebekah gasped as she watched a slight bulge form in her trousers. Her stomach did somersaults as Luke's genitals formed between her legs. As she gave her new 'member' a quick poke to check that it was real... it started stiffening and growing into a full-blown erection. <i>Hmm, I guess I can keep his dick in my pants instead</i>. Rebekah smirked, amused by the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Liz appeared on the aisle, after she heard Luke's yelling. Liz realized she definitely moved a lot faster without her large breasts weighing her down and bouncing all over when she jogged. \"What's happened??\" Liz asked, glancing between her two employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-we swapped... ugh...\" Luke was hardly able to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily he didn't have to, as Liz saw Rebekah stroking the firm bulge in her pants and trying not to laugh. \"Oh...\" Liz sighed, now knowing why Luke was flipping out. <i>Damn it, at this rate I'll never get a penis</i>. Liz thought dejectedly. Still, she didn't want to give up yet, there were still some male staff who still had their junk (Aaron, Steven, Mark, Rob and Liam). \"Luke... just keep working please, it's not the end of the world just because you have a vagina. It's only for one night.\" Liz said to Luke, before quickly walking fof the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah and Luke then glanced at each other, and Rebekah gave him a little wave and a smile, almost as if to tease him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'Peculiar' though didn't mean she was in a foul mood, or an irritated mood either. Kiran was feeling somewhat giddy, and couldn't stop twiddling the pendant she had hung around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful looking stone that was engraved in the gold chain, with the appearance of an amethyst. But this 'stone' had a power like no other, the ability to exchange body parts between people without them being aware. She'd already tried it on a couple of oblivious bus passengers on the way to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening luv.\" Liz greeted the teenager with her usual smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Liz.\" Kiran responded pensively as she snapped herself out of her trance and looked up at her supervisor. \"How are you?\" she inquired, returning Liz's politeness as she always tended to do. In the background, restling with some empty cages was Aaron, making it difficult for them to have a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz winced as Aaron clattered about in the background, then gestured to Kiran to follow her onto the shop floor where it was quieter. What she had to say though wasn't really that important. \"You'll be working with Luke tonight okay luv, on the Seasonal department. But don't try lifting any bags of compost of anything, leave that to Luke.\" Liz said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran had to admit, she was disappointed not to be working on toiletries like she usually did. But Liz did like moving the staff around. She put on a brave face, then smiled at Liz. \"Okay, no worries. I'm sure I'll enjoy myself on there.\" she smirked, having another rub of the magic stone around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's a beautiful necklace, be sure you don't lose it okay.\" Liz complimented Kiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran shook her head. \"Oh I won't, it's securely fastened.\" she said, tugging at her chain. What she didn't tell Liz was that it wasn't just the clasp that was keeping the pendant in place, it was a field of invisible magical energy bound to her. \"And thank you, it was a present from my boyfriend.\" Kiran lied to Liz. She had actually broken up with her boyfriend a couple of weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's gorgeous, you're very lucky.\" Liz smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I know.\" Kiran replied with a giggle, hunching her shoulders slightly. \"See you in a bit Liz.\" she then said, before disappearing upstairs and into the tea room, where the rest of the staff were assembled before starting work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She really didn't mind working with him, he was nice, tall, and certainly built for this type of work.  While she had a great work ethic and everybody loved to work with her, Kiran certainly felt that if she were taller and stronger, that she would be able to get alot of work done in a timely manner.  It was then that she decided to see if the stone on her necklace could help her.  While she didn't want to take anything from her work partner for the evening she looked around to see if there was anybody willing to let her try some of their assets for the night.  Just then Josh was walking by bringing some more boxes for their section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, some more boxes that Liz asked me to bring you two.\"  Josh said as he turned to Luke to make some small talk that Kiran didn't really want to hear.  Instead she focused all her will on something she wanted to do.  As if on queue, the crystal on her pendant started to vibrate ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I would like to be taller' Kiran thought to herself as she imagined Josh's body shrinking down to her height and her's growing.  Sure, he wasn't one of the tallest people in the store, but he would do fine since he was certainly taller than she was.  As she was doing this, she felt herself growing and as soon as it started it stopped.  She opened her eyes once more to see that everything seemed different, almost smaller in size than she was used to.  Most of her life she was smaller than her peers and it certainly felt refreshing to be able to see on the top shelf without the need of a step ladder.  She looked down at herself and noticed that her clothes certainly didn't fit her anymore either.  \"That makes sense.\" She said to herself as she remembered back to the bus ride to work.  \"When I did the swaps earlier, I noticed that the clothing they were wearing didn't match their new forms either.\"  Kiran then looked over at her donor and noticed that he was swimming in his outfit now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, why didn't you get clothes that fit?\"  Luke said with a laugh as he eyed his co-worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all my clothes are in the wash and I had to put something on in a hurry and this was really the only thing I could find.\"  Josh replied back as he turned slightly to give a better insight at his clothing problem.  \"Besides, look at Kiran.\"  They both looked at her and he saw that her's were close to ripping and helped to emphasize her bust and figure perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she always wears stuff like that.\"  Luke said nonchalantly.  Kiran was confused, did she always wear something like this?  Well one thing was for sure, it certainly didn't feel very comfortable.  She then closed her eyes once more and thought about Josh's clothes coming to her so that she wouldn't feel as if her clothing wasn't like a tourniquet and cut off the blood supply to her extremities.  Almost instantly the discomfort disappeared and she felt the blood rushing back.  Just then she heard Josh saying something about his new attire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my wife got this for me at one of the shops here in town.  I think it looks a little girly, but it will do the job.\"  Josh said with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it looks good on you.\"  Kiran said complimenting her co-worker's new attire.  \"I really like the high waist black trousers that you have on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, well, I better head out before Liz catches me talking.\"  Josh said as he made his way back to his section, leaving Kiran taller than before.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luke saw nothing wrong with the fact that Kiran was now dressed in Josh's clothes, or... that she was now a little over 10 full inches taller than she used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to look good, okay.\" Kiran responded to Luke's comment as she watched him humping heavy bags of compost around. While still reveling in her newly-acquired height and change of clothes, Kiran grasped her pendant between her right hand fingers and rubbed it. \"I want to be stronger.\" she whispered, focusing solely on Luke as he worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly she felt a slight tingling sensation again and she looked down as she felt her biceps start to swell, along with the rest of her muscles. True, Luke wasn't as well built as Aaron was, but he was fit and quite strong. At least... he was until now. Kiran chuckled to herself as Luke began struggling with the bags of compost all of a sudden. It got to the point where he couldn't lift one at all, once all his muscles had been transferred to Kiran and vice-versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you gonna stand there laughing at me all night or are you gonna help?\" Luke scowled at his co-worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Not manly enough to move a few bags of compost?\" Kiran joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke rolled his eyes and turned his back for a moment, giving Kiran the opportunity to raise her right arm and flex her bicep. Feeling it with her other hand, she was more than impressed with the increase. \"Awesome!\" she grinned. She then moved forward to try out her new strength, pushing Luke aside. \"Here, let me show you how it should be done.\" Kiran smirked, lifting one of the heavy bags with ease and putting it on the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" Luke grumbled, suddenly feeling a little embarrassed having to ask for a girl's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't be like that luv, there's no shame.\" Kiran laughed, thoroughly enjoying herself with her taller, stronger body. The ball had started rolling, and now it was going to be difficult to stop. Not that Kiran had any thought of stopping herself at that point.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jade's chest conversely shrank a little, becoming Kiran's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, this is amazing!\" Kiran gasped as she reached up to feel her new 'girls'.

But today proved to be one that was <b><i>very</i></b> different from all the others that he has had. Although Steven actually preferred morning shifts, he still thought it was a pain every once in a while getting to the store so early, a quarter to five to be precision. It was his job along with others to open the store up for the day, turn the lights on, stock the shelves, organize the stores' stock etc, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut early on in his shift, things took quite a change for Steven, when he was cleaning out the storage room in one of the corners of the room he discovered a rather strange cardboard box covered in dust, marked with the word PROTOTYPE in big red letters. \"What the hell is this thing?\" said Steven, while blowing off some of the dust on the box. \"This doesn't have any listing number on it\" he said while looking for some further inspection on the sides of the box, unlike all the other stuff in storage, the mysterious box had no identification on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzled, Steven decided to open up the box, wondering what was this \"prototype\" was. Inside there were a set of what could be described as helmets, both of which had cables attaching themselves to each other. \"What the hell?\" mumbled Steven, while pick up one of the bizarre helmets. Steven checked the rest of the box and found a small piece of paper that read <i><b>SWAP HELMET ONE THOUSAND.</b></i> \"Swap? what the hell does that mean\" said Steven while scratching his head.

He could see smooth legs and cleavage. He had a woman's body somehow!

Yesterday she planned with her friends that they were going out tonight, no strings attached just partying all night long. They were going to spend the night at one of her friend's house or should she say the morning when they would be coming home. They wouldn't even have to be afraid of their parents calling them. Her friend's older sister worked in a local theater and could easily impersonate their mother when picking up the phone. So everything was set for this evening, that was until Liz called her. Told her that they needed some extra hands. Melissa tried to tell her that she was going out tonight, but Liz promised a little bonus for the inconvenience. And truth be told she could use the money for tonight. So she brought her club clothes with her, put them in the locker and when she was finished she could change immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now Melissa was staring at her phone every minute as she could not believe how slow time went. Only ten minutes until her shift was done. Finally! She could go off and enjoy the night all to her and her friends. But then she came across a strange shaped box, it looked really old. Curious to what it was Melissa grabbed the box and took it down with her. On top of another stacked boxes she opened the mysterious box revealing two strange looking helmets. The helmets were connected by two glass tubes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird. Melissa thought. Who would keep stuff like that here? Melissa removed the helmets from the boxes. The helmets themselves felt strangely light, but the tubes felt pretty heavy. That must be some pretty strong glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa wanted to look at the helmet further, when she heard a voice calling: \"What you got there?

The skirt was also tight on Liz's slightly plumper behind. Luckily, Liz wasn't too tall, or else the length of the skirt would be just as problematic as the length of the top. Finally, her knee high boots finished off the outfit. They pinched a little more than usual, but she presumed her and Liz were close enough in foot size to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in the mirror in the bathroom. She had intended to look a little flirty with the outfit, but with Liz's body, she looked downright slutty! It was odd looking in the mirror and seeing Liz dressed like this; Liz NEVER dressed like this. It was even odder for Melissa to see Liz's body react to the movements she made. She still couldn't believe she and Liz had swapped bodies. She started to wonder what her friends would think, then she realized her friends wouldn't even recognize her!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phoebe trudged into work one Wednesday morning looking more than a little befuddled. After being greeted by her immediate supervisor, Liz, and a couple of other co-workers, including Kiran, she made her way upstairs to the locker room to put her coat and bag away. All the time her mind was racing with what had happened to her on the bus ride into town. A strange conversation with an old man from Romania, at the end of which he touched her on the arm and disappeared into thin air, or more precisely... in a flash of light. From that point on, Phoebe knew she had been gifted with the ability to swap people's heads around. It was a peculiar power indeed, not to mention one that was difficult to believe was real. But after unintentionally swapping the heads of a 30-something dad and his 10-year old son on the bus, Phoebe couldn't really deny that her power was real. And even more amazing, neither the dad or the son noticed anything wrong with themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe had a fled the bus early, deciding to walk the rest of the way to work, and as a result she had left the father and son pair in their swapped state. \"At least that boy's dad will mature again, no big deal right.\" Phoebe muttered to herself, as she put the padlock on her locker. \"Just calm down Phoebs, you're okay with this. People get granted magic swapping powers all the time. No problems here.\" She then sighed, trying to make light of the whole thing. \"I should have had a cigarette before coming into work.\" She added, shaking her head. She didn't smoke all the time, only when she was stressed or confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the locker room, Phoebe happened to see Rob making his way downstairs, and she smiled and waved at him in passing. Okay sure, she had a crush on Rob, and she didn't exactly try to hide it at times. If only he'd return her attention from time to time. That was all she asked. Phoebe knew she had always lacked courage in the relationship department, which was why she had only ever had one boyfriend, Dan, whom she had recently broken it off with. As evidenced by her pink and purple hair, several body piercings, many tattoos and her heavy make-up, Phoebe was certainly... unique, and she knew this. It was also part of the reason, she figured, why she had trouble finding boyfriends. But she had never thought about changing who she was just to suit others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her new power though, she knew she could very much change who she was, at least from the neck down, while still keeping her identity. She began to smirk to herself as she entered the tea room and sat down. Maybe this power was a game-changer after all. She glanced up at the clock on the wall and saw she still had five minutes until her shift started. She straightened her black-rimmed glasses and then glanced around at the five co-workers who were in the tea room with her. Helen, Jade, Luke, Charlotte and Sukhi were sat around the table either drinking coffee, chatting or messing around on their phones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there, Phoebe was largely ignored by her colleagues. But this suited her fine as she twiddled with one of her pigtails and studied her co-workers one by one, a cheeky little smirk still etched on her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, since nobody notices anything wrong.\" Phoebe whispered under her breath, feeling both mischievous and horny all of a sudden. Focusing on Luke, she paired him up with Sukhi and swapped their heads around. Seeing her two co-workers heads spring up on each others' bodies was hilarious. Luke's stubbly, masculine visage now sat on Sukhi's skinny, 5'4\", dark-skinned body, with his pert B-cup boobs slightly distending his work shirt. <i>Hah! That'll teach him.</i> Phoebe stifled a giggle, putting her hand to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked over to Sukhi, whose head, complete with make-up and her full head of black hair, sat on Luke's 6'2\", male body, and she was now sat beside Jade instead of Charlotte. Yet she continued chatting to Charlotte from her new position, frowning momentarily at Luke's phone sat in front of her on the table. She pushed it over to him and he held out Sukhi's diet coke with one of his manicured hands for her to retrieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who's next?</i> Phoebe smirked, her eyes settling on Jade and Helen this time. True they were both female, but there was quite a few years between them, not to mention their body shapes and breast size. Phoebe decided to help Helen out a little, and a moment later her head sank down into her mature body. Seconds later Helen's demure visage popped up on Jade's slimmer, younger body. Jade's head meanwhile, after sinking down into her body, now sat on Helen's middle-aged frame, complete with her D-cup breasts filling her polo shirt. <i>Nice! Helen looks much better now.</i> Phoebe thought to herself with another inward chuckle. <i>And at least Jade has bigger boobs now.</i> She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that just left Charlotte, sat there tapping on her phone. But there was nobody to swap her with. Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe, not having fully mastered control of her power yet, suddenly found her vision darkening as her own head slipped down into her body. <i>Oh shit...</i> she panicked for a moment, as her body's hands tensed up. Then a moment later, her vision returned and she was sat across the table, her head affixed to Charlotte's slimmer, taller and sexier body. <i>Oh wow... this is a rush!</i> Phoebe smiled, holding up her new hands in front of her after setting Charlotte's phone down. She studied her different fingers and the purple polish on her nails, before letting her hands roam underneath the table, feeling her new thighs and groin. Charlotte's body actually felt really nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me my phone!\" Charlotte suddenly snapped, causing Phoebe to look back to her former seat. She had to try not to laugh at the sight of Charlotte's head attached to her tattooed, 5'3\" body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure thing, sorry Charlotte.\" Phoebe smirked, passing her co-worker her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte sighed and went back to texting one of her friends. Meanwhile, Phoebe couldn't help but think that having Charlotte's body may have just improved her chances of getting Rob to date her. Phoebe glanced to her left and smiled at Sukhi, who didn't see anything wrong with the fact that she was now a man from the neck down, and Sukhi returned her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All staff to the shop floor please.\" Liz's voice sounded out over the tannoy, signalling it was time for the rest of the team to start work. Phoebe was the first one to stand up, getting a bit of vertigo for a moment because of her six inch height increase. She ran her hands over her thighs again and peered down at Charlotte's plimsolls on her feet, wiggling her new toes inside them and grinning again. Then she eventually followed her co-workers out of the tea room, with Sukhi, now the tallest amongst them, leading the way. Luke was in front of Phoebe and she couldn't help but admire his skinny, Indian body dressed in Sukhi's former clothes. He did have a cute ass now, albeit not very big. And of course his caucasian head clashed with his new body, but that was the most amusing part to Phoebe. \"Get those little legs moving Luke.\" Phoebe poked him in the side, peering down at her 'male' co-worker, who was now five inches shorter than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, whatever!\" Luke grumbled back, as the group disappeared downstairs and emerged onto the shop floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instead of going to get her assignment from Liz like everyone else, a horny Phoebe set out to find Rob, who of course had already started work with the rest of the staff members earlier. Phoebe's new pussy was already wet from excitement and she was imagining getting fucked hard in Charlotte's body. Being taller than all her other female co-workers had definitely given her a confidence boost, and she was feeling more inclined to trying to score a date with Rob. On the Kitchenware aisle, Phoebe spotted a 30-something mother arguing with her 13-year old daughter about something, and with a simple click of her fingers she swapped their heads onto each other's bodies. \"Try to understand each other a little more.\" Phoebe chuckled, before walking off the aisle. The young girl now stood at 5'7\" and had big D-cup breasts, compared to her mother now standing at her former height of just 4'9\" and having small A-cup boobs that were still developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe next swapped the heads of two young children who were also arguing, as kids did. The 8-year old boy soon had his head perched on his 6-year old sister's body dressed in a pleated pink dress, ankle socks and little ballet flats. That'll teach him to learn respect for girls as he gets older.\" Phoebe commented, a sly little smirk on her face as she continued searching for Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe found her target working alone on the Cleaners aisle, but there were a couple of customers on there too. So when Phoebe approached Rob, she kept her voice down. She also noticed she was the same height as he was, now that she had Charlotte's body from the neck down. \"Hi Rob!\" She smiled warmly, trying to keep her attraction to him not so obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob stood up straight and broke down the empty cardboard box he was holding. \"Oh hey Phoebe. Everything okay?\" He replied, returning her smile briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, things are great, but... they could be better.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob took the bait. \"Oh yeah, how so?\" He responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe took air deep into her new lungs, then went for it. \"Look, Rob, I like you! Would you... er... would you like to go out or a drink after work, or... grab a coffee during break?\" She asked nervously, while first straightening her glasses and then fiddling with her twin pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Rob was speechless, and he appreciated the attention. \"Um... I've never thought of you in that way Phoebe, I'll be honest. But... sure, we can get a coffee during lunch if you want. How about the Bread Basket just up the street?\" He suggested, referring to the caf\u00e9 just down the street from the Beautylicious, the local beauty salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe refrained from squealing, but her joy was evident in her broad smile. \"I'd love that, thank you!\" She gushed, clapping her hands together. She had already decided she was keeping Charlotte's body for now. The girl had never been nice to her since she started working at Wilko, so it seemed fitting that Charlotte's body would be the first \"borrowed\" body that she got laid with. She knew that her sex life was about to improve 100 fold. \"See you later then love.\" Phoebe waved at Rob, before sauntering off, all smiles and feeling giddy as a schoolgirl.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As excited as Phoebe was about her new body and that she might have, possibly, just scored a date with Rob, she knew she still had a job to do, and she didn't want Liz or Elizabeth getting on her back for slacking. The last she needed was to be listed as another Liam. She wandered over to the section she knew she was assigned to, which was the Station aisle. And she'd be working on her own too instead of with another colleague. Seeing Luke again on the way, Phoebe giggled, admiring the short, skinny and feminine body under his head. Looking good Luke. <i>I might keep you like that. I'm sure Sukhi loves having a dick after all.</i> She thought, as she began opening a box with a safety knife she found in Charlotte's former back pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 10 minutes, Phoebe got some work done, but the arrival of two teenage customers on her aisle distracted her. The teens were a 17-year old girl and her 14-year old brother, and they were bickering, which told Phoebe they were siblings instead of lovers. <i>Sorry about this.</i> Phoebe smirked, looking up and clicking her fingers. The teen's heads were instantly swapped, and just like that the younger brother was the owner of his sister's sexy body, including her nice C-cup breasts and her vagina. He was now also wearing her denim skirt, white low-cut top and ballet flats. The sister, with her pretty, ponytailed head atop her brother's body, adjusted her horny teenage dick in her boxers as she continued bickering with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is never going to get old.</i> Phoebe grinned, giving her new pussy a rub through her slacks and knickers. Charlotte's body was certainly horny, and Phoebe couldn't wait to get her pussy filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five more minutes of work, Phoebe started to thinking of Sukhi again, and the fact that she had a boyfriend, Steve. She was amused by the fact that if she didn't give Sukhi her own body back before the end of the shift, there was a good chance anal sex would be happening, with Sukhi and her fiance taking turns fucking each other up the ass. \"That would be hot!\" She chuckled to herself, as she broke down another cardboard box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would be hot?\" A voice behind suddenly startled Phoebe, who spun around to see Laura standing there smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Laura.\" Phoebe muttered, noticing her height advantage over her co-worker now. \"Oh... I was just daydreaming, that's all.\" She laughed, idly gesturing with a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't got much work done it seems. Liz wont be happy. Do you... um... want some help?\" Laura asked \"I've finished my work already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe's eyes widened. \"Wow! That a new record or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura held her arms out by her side momentarily. \"What can I say, I'm awesome!\" She said, looking a bit smug. Then she smirked. \"And it also helps when there's two of us on the section as well. Rebekah has gone to help Nicola now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, well... sure, I'd love a hand, thanks.\" Phoebe nodded, grateful of Laura's arrival. And also turned on by the fact that Laura hadn't noticed Phoebe now had her head on Charlotte's body... complete with Charlotte's name badge attached. That was one thing that hadn't changed after the swap for some reason. Which meant that Jade and Helen and Sukhi and Luke also had on each other's name badges too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls got to work, with Phoebe trying her best to focus on the task at hand. Which was easier no she had Laura to chat to.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He is cute.\" Laura smiled, admitting Rob's good looks. \"And it'll do you good having a boyfriend, you've certainly for a hot body for him to enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe smirked, looking down at her stolen form. \"Heh, thanks.\" She said to Laura. \"But I'm no more sexier than you are in terms of body shape.\" She said to Laura, smiling at her as they worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww thanks.\" Laura responded, glancing to Phoebe before looking back at the shelf she was filling with stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer own comment immediately got Phoebe thinking. She didn't want competition at work, not even Laura. A wicked little grin appeared on her face and she waited for the opportune moment before clicking her fingers. She watched Laura's head sink down into her body, then seconds later Steven's bespectacled visage popped up between her shoulders. He had been walking past the aisle at the time, so Phoebe simply swapped him with Laura. There he now was, the second oldest male employee in the store reduced to a teenage girl from the neck down, dressed in Laura's Wilko shirt, her black slacks, tights, underwear and velcro-strap flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura meanwhile found herself at the end of the aisle, her pretty features now sitting on top of Steven's tall, slender and very male body. She looked puzzled for a moment, but then returned to what she had been doing, walking past the shorter Steven as she did so. \"Is this your knife luv?\" Steven asked, holding out a feminine hand and giving Laura her safety knife back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thanks. I must have left it laid around.\" Laura nodded, smiling as she took it off him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe watched Steven's pert new ass wiggling as he walked off with Laura's body, and then she got back to having her conversation with Laura. She couldn't help but smirk as she watched Laura reaching down to her crotch briefly, adjusting her penis into a more comfortable position inside her male briefs. \"Nice of you to say, but I don't even have curves like yours, I wish I did believe me.\" Laura said enviously, eyeing up Phoebe's 5'9\", stolen body. \"I mean, I don't even have boobs.\" She continued, sighing despondently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever thought of getting implants?\" Phoebe asked her, trying not to laugh at the strange turn their chat had taken. Laura thought she had always had a male body from the neck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but I don't have the money for that. I'll be paying off my college fees for years.\" Laura replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure things will work out.\" Phoebe told her, trying to cheer her up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura forced a smile out. \"Well, I should just be thankful I have a boyfriend who is so accepting of my condition. I mean besides Sukhi, how many other girls you know has a penis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen a few others today who have, all of them customers.\" Phoebe said, smirking knowing that was also her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, we're rare, lets just say that.\" Laura mumbled, breaking down her empty box with her larger hands and stronger muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not by the time I'm done.</i> Phoebe thought with a chuckle.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven thought it actually all started that morning in fact. That fateful morning when he helped that lady up. Or at least he thought it was a lady; Steven noticed when he saw her walking she looked differently. The skin around her neck was different than the skin on her hands and the heels she wore made that she was walking wobbly. It was no surprise that she fell. Steven the gentleman that he was immediately helped her up, but then noticed the lady's face. Or to be precise the man's face. It was a man in his forties, Asian appearance, a very tough face. The man looked at him deeply and Steven knew that there was something special with this man. However no one noticed the man's face, most men tried to look underneath the short skirt the man was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" The man only said as he grabbed Steven's hand and helped himself up. But before Steven could do anything, there came a shock from the man. A shock so powerful that he felt his whole body paralyzed as the shock went through his body. The only thing he remembered is that the man came close to him and said: \"Good luck.\" With a male's voice and shoved a piece of paper into his hand. Before Steven could do or say anything he fell unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up people were surrounding him, wondering whether he was alright. Steven told them he was fine, but he asked if someone knew where the woman went. Sadly no one paid attention to the woman. She just disappeared in thin air apparently. Steven got back on his feet and after assuring he was fine, he made his way to work. After he explained what happened to Liz (she was concerned about him, telling him to leave early if he didn't feel any better) Steven made his way to his locker and put his jacket inside. He then realized that he still held the piece of paper in his hand the man had given him. But before he could read it any further the door opened up and Steven quickly put the note in his locker and closed it. He had the feeling the paper contained something so important, it would have been better to read it after work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven then got to work. It was a typical day in the office as they would say. Charlotte was moody again, Liam was found sleeping while hiding under a pile of toilet paper and Natalie was talking on and on about the wedding she was planning with Mike. It just seemed the day would never end. But at last the day was at an end they could all go home. Liz gave him a pat on the back complimenting him that he stayed. He wanted to say thanks, but the words seemed stuck in his throat. He didn't feel like he deserved the compliment, he didn't feel sick. He felt different, but not in a sick way. As Steven opened his locker he saw the note lying there. Not seeing anyone around anymore ( he was one of the last ones to go) he grabbed the piece of paper and began reading it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he ended up reading was something that shocked him. It was clearly a generic note, not addressed to someone specifically. The note explained how he, Steven, was chosen as one of the bodyhoppers. An organization as old as mankind, dedicated to the preservation of those who had the ability to take over other's bodies. The ability however would not show until another bodyhopper activated it. That happened apparently when the man grabbed his hand that morning. As of now he would be a bodyhopper and it was up to him how he would use the power. The note showed what Steven needed to do, which was obviously easy. At the end the note asked to make sure when Steven would find a potential bodyhopper he would hand him the note. Steven grinned as he didn't know what to make of this. Was this a reality TV-show with hidden cameras? Would they film him when he would try to take over someone's body? Well there was only one way to find out. He had to take over someone's body, but who's?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Steven Melissa entered the locker room. Apparently she was counting stock for Liz; a boring job Steven had to admit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Melissa.\" He said waving his hand as Melissa opened up her locker as she grabbed her jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Steven.\" She said quickly as Melissa was in a hurry to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, there's something behind you.\" He said pointing behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" She asked as she turned around. Before she could register anything Steven pushed himself inside her. Making them both fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven.\" Melissa moaned. However Steven couldn't do anything as his body was turned to liquid and was sucked inside Melissa. Melissa couldn't believe how this felt, it was amazing. Melissa could feel her pussy getting wet and her nipples pointing up. And then it was all over as the last drop that was Steven entered Melissa. Melissa was now all alone in the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Melissa wake up as?</span></div></div>",

She cracked her neck from side to side and pulled her knickers from her ass crack as she wandered upside the delivery truck and into the Goods In area, while Steven and Liz were unloading the caged stock. \"Evening Mona.\" Liz greeted her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona idly glanced at Liz, her eyes eagerly looking her supervisor up and down. And eventually she responded with a simple... \"Hey.\" Mona's eyes seemed to linger on Liz's ample chest more than usual, and she didn't even acknowledge Steven's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright?\" Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona nodded slowly. \"Perfect!\" she smirked, before making her way into the store and upstairs to where the other staff members were waiting to start work. Liz and Steven looked at each other, eyebrows raised. Mona was definitely acting a little 'odd'. But everyone had their weird days, so they thought nothing more of it. On her way upstairs, Mona passed Jessica on the stairs, practically bumping into her. \"Woah, might want to watch where you're going love.\" Mona mumbled, her face maintaining a particularly mischievous grin as she surveyed Jessica's slim body, in it's Wilkos uniform and high heeled pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mona.\" Jessica chuckled, before continuing down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona turned and stared at Jessica's cute ass as she descended the stairs. \"Hmm, not bad.\" she commented quietly, licking her lips. A slight chuckle then escaped Mona's lips as she continued on her way upstairs and entered the toilets. Nicola was just leaving, and Mona barely even acknowledged her presence either. \"Can't all be winners I suppose.\" Mona said, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then strolled over to the mirror and leaned on the sink. Mona's reflection was clear as day, but instead of the girl's feminine features, there was the face of a 30-something Caucasian man with facial stubble and a scar on his cheek. \"Got ourselves a cutie here Lionel.\" Mona then chuckled again, this time in a deep, manly voice as she felt up her perky breasts through her Wilko shirt. \"Maybe I should invite the guys over for a little fun.\" she added, the wicked grin on the man's face in the mirror perfecty matching the one on Mona's face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>''I could get used to this,'' Mona quipped as Lionel enjoyed doing some stretches using his mount's body. The hopper was getting used to his mount's lithe frame. Mona chuckled as she bent down to touch the tip of her feet with both hands. ''It's a good thing I hopped you yesterday,'' Mona said softly to her reflection in the mirror. The male face looked out of place on her body, but Lionel knew that anyone else would just see Mona's Persian features. Except his hopper friends of course. Even if anyone else was to spot something amiss through mirror reflection, they'd probably have a hard time believing their own eyes. There's a drug that could momentarily stop that from happening, but the consumption would induce some hangover headaches. Mona patted her trouser pocket where Lionel had stowed away some drugs he purchased earlier, but Lionel didn't plan to use them, at least not for now while the night was still young. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's where you are love,'' Liz's sudden arrival surprised Lionel. The evening team supervisor didn't walk all the way into the toilet however, opting to stand by the door, ''Everything alright?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh,'' Mona replied quickly, giving the hopper inhabiting her body some seconds to compose his mount. Had Liz walked right inside, she might have seen Lionel's real face reflected on the mirror. ''Everything's just great,'' Mona smirked as her gaze traveled downwards, not looking at Liz's eyes anymore, ''Just great,'' Mona murmured under her breath, admiring Liz's bountiful bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good,'' Liz breathed a sigh of relief. Mona looked a bit distracted when she walked into work and the last thing Liz wanted was to have another staff member down. Aaron phoned in just to tell that he was sick and couldn't come to work. ''You missed the briefing, but you're going to work with Steven in the Health &amp; Beauty section, he'll fill you on the rest.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLionel then realised that Nicola, the woman that he passed on his way to the toilets must have told Liz where to find Mona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Is Elizabeth in today?'' Mona asked her supervisor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, she's supposed to come in later in the evening,'' Liz was surprised that Mona would ask about Elizabeth, but she mumbled out a response for her staff anyway,''Why'd you ask?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nothing,'' Mona smiled to herself. Meanwhile, Lionel couldn't believe his luck. Of course it would be easy to get into Elizabeth from Liz or even from Mona if he wanted to, but this turn of events meant that by hopping Liz, he'd essentially gain control of the entire store, making it easier for him to call his friends over if he wanted to. Mona brought a hand to her forehead, her fingers massaging the area around her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Are you alright love?'', Liz walked inside, just as Lionel had gambled that she would, being the kind supervisor that she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, I'm alright,'' Mona smirked, before she grabbed hold of Liz's wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz didn't have time to react when a surge of conscious liquid started pouring inside her through her facial orifice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Where am I?'' Mona mumbled and her eyes blinked a few seconds to get used to the bright light inside the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You gave me a scare there,'' Liz turned around to face the Wilko staff member who just had come to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Did I-?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes, you passed out when we were having a chat,'' Liz moved closer to the girl, ''Lucky I caught you before you hurt yourself.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong, she didn't have any recollection from yesterday, but she remembered that she had a shift this evening. Her head was heavy as if she caught flu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Are you alright love?'' Liz said the same thing she asked Mona a few minutes ago as she helped the girl to her feet, ''Do you want to go home?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, I'm alright,'' Mona said slowly as her head began to clear, ''I think I'll be anyway,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good,'' Liz took the girl's hand and guided her to the door, ''We've actually already lost one person this evening, but if you have to take the evening off, I'm sure we'll cope.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, it's fine,'' Mona said, her strength returning to her, ''Where am I working?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Steven's already waiting for you by Health &amp; Beauty'', Liz explained to the girl, ''He'll fill you in. If you need me, I'll be in Elizabeth's office. Alright? Go get a drink before you start.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona nodded and she walked out from the toilet with Liz in tow. The supervisor's gaze was divided between watching Mona's ass swaying in tune with her steps and from her own bosoms jiggling with every step that she took. They were only separated when Mona took a turn to the staff room while Liz continued down the corridor to Elizabeth's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz took the sight of the office in. There was a large desk with a laptop and a few documents on top of it. There was also a large TV screen mounted on the wall, showing the CCTV feed of the entire store, but Liz knew that the CCTV was hardly inspected, unless there was theft or incidents in the store. On the other side of the room, there was a three-seater couch, no doubt for more informal occasions. Behind the desk, there were some filing cabinets filled with random documents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz clicked the office's lock into place and pulled the white Venetian blind over a small window on the side of the wall, before carefully making her way behind the desk, avoiding a few chairs around the place. She plopped her ass on Elizabeth's comfortable chair and watched the CCTV feed of Wilko employees doing their jobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supervisor's hands then traveled up her thighs, feeling the fabric of the trousers. A smirk crept on her face just as her hands crept upwards to her 30H cup breasts. She squeezed her jugs appreciatively feeling the tender flesh underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jackpot,'' Liz grinned smugly to herself as she peeked into the inside of her red Wilko polo shirt. The hopper mounting her body was clearly pleased as he took in the sight of Liz's massive cleavage.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come to the back entrance and I'll let you in. What... ? Oh don't worry about that, I hopped the bitch who's in charge until later.\" Liz chuckled, wrapping the phone wire around her finger. \"Alright, see you in a bit mate.\" Liz then hung up on 'Jack'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna be a good night tonight.\" Liz then grinned again, relaxing back in Elizbeth's chair, rubbing her pussy through her trousers. And then inevitably, her hands went back up to her impressive chest, squeezing her 'melons'. \"Might as well have a closer inspection of the goods while I'm waiting.\" she mumbled, quickly whipping off her shirt and throwing it on the floor. \"Now that's a rack!\" she smirked, gazing down at her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Liz's bra was also on the floor, and she was lifting her own breasts one at a time, sucking her nipples. Oh god... her pussy's ready to explode, better reign it in a bit.\" Liz said to herself, letting her tits hang loose again. Glancing at her watch, she realized that Jack and the others would be around soon. She reluctantly put her bra and shirt back on and exited Elizabeth's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the hallway, Liz practically bumped into Liam. \"Oh, er... Liz, I'm j... just going to the toilet.\" he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care alright. Just wank yourself off then get back to work, okay?\" Liz responded harshly, surprising Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz then headed downstairs, but instead of checking on the staff like the normal Liz would, the depraved hopper inside her went straight to the back entrance of the store and opened the shutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just paced back and forth, hands on hips, inspecting her \"love handles\". \"Hmm, could stand to lose a few pounds love.\" she told herself. \"Let's see if I can't burn 'em off for you.\" she smirked. again. Just then Liz looked up when she heard footsteps approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah dude, nice tits!!\" Jack complimented 'Liz'. Of course Jack could see Lionel's scarred face atop Liz's feminine form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They feel better than they look.\" Lionel replied in Liz's voice, manhandling his mount's tits in front of Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was similar in appearance to Lionel, regarding height, age etc. But Jack had a buzzcut and from the staining on his teeth he was an obvious smoker. He'd also served time in prison when he was younger, like Lionel. Jack was also Irish, having been born in Belfast, but having lived in England most of his life, he only had a moderate Irish accent. \"So, why we here?\" he asked his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, where the fuck are the others?\" Liz asked Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're coming.\" Jack answered, glancing behind him as more voices and footsteps were heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree more men walked into view, and like Lionel and Jack, all of them were bodyhoppers eager for some fun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had a considerable amount of facial hair. Then came the two 'foreigners' of the little group of hoppers, both American. Marlon, 24, 6' 2\" tall, was an African-American, pretty athletic from playing sports in school back in the States before he acquired his 'ability'. And then there was Harry, 23, a Chinese-American, whose parents gave him a Western name. He was the shortest of the gang, standing at just 5' 6\", but he was also pretty fit, and he knew some martial arts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHamid had met Marlon and Harry while on 'vacation' in the States, and got them to come back to England with him. In turn he then introduced them both to Lionel and Jack, whom Hamid already knew. They were now quite the little 'hopper gang'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lionel?? Holy shit man, them's some nice titties.\" Marlon laughed as he approached, gesturing with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can see why you picked her.\" Harry smirked, nodding in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLionel arched an eyebrow, letting Liz's arms drop by his side again. \"Actually I hopped her because she's in charge of this fucking place, well... until the manager turns up later anyway. These...\" he said in his mount's voice as he squeezed his huge tits, \"...are just a sweet fucking bonus.\" he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet they are.\" Hamid chipped in, as he paced back and forth, surveying the back of the store. He rarely smiled. Hamid had been born and raised in England, therefore he sounded as English as Lionel did. And because of his hopping ability, he was about as 'un-Islamic' as a Muslim could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I need to get you all into this place unnoticed, any suggestions?\" Liz asked the four men stood in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men looked at each other, and started quietly suggesting ideas to each other. Eventually Hamid came up with an idea. \"Why not just get some girls here one at a time and we can mount them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would take too long, I'm not the patient type.\" Liz responded, digging her knickers out of her ass crack. <i>Fucking underwear.</i> Lionel thought. He'd had the same problem in Mona's body too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the discussion, Jack remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry suddenly stepped forward, rubbing his chin. \"There maybe another way we can do this, but it's not gonna be easy.\" he informed his fellow hoppers, as he sized up the 5' 4\" body Lionel was wearing...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The 'weaker' hopper will be thrown out of the body. I mean, I've tried it with Lionel here,'' Lionel in Liz's body nods his mount's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Then it's a good thing Hamid invited us over,'' Harry smirks, ''There may not be a lot of hoppers back home, but we sure know a trick or two.'' He gives Marlon a glance, before casting his gaze to Hamid, ''We gave him a trial run too,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Really?'' Liz cocked an eyebrow at the British born Pakistani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah,'' Hamid nodded vigorously, ''It was wicked. I didn't think that it was possible.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But first,'' Marlon looked upwards when he saw Steven looking at them and Liz, ''we need to get somewhere more private,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Are you sure this is the way you Yanks do it?'', Liz grumbled as she stretched her palms outwards.''Sounds like a lot of work to me.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wilko supervisor and the four hoppers were now occupying a 'disabled' toilet a few meters down from Wilko. The fact that it is early in the evening means that the toilets ween't yet violated by drunk people coming from the pubs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's because you're not used to it yet,'' Marlon reassured the older hopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Once you know what to do, it's actually rather easy,'' Harry added chirpily. He placed his hands atop Liz's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Do we really have to hold hands?'', Liz muttered, Lionel clearly wasn't impressed and was running out of patience, ''It'd have been much quicker if I just called out the girls.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Not really,'' Harry said, ''but it's better for first timers,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Right,'' Marlon spoke again, ''Now concentrate yourself on the right hand side of your mount,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''How the fuck do I do that?'' Lionel puzzles. In all his years of hopping, this was the first time he heard the crazy idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Visualize,'' Hamid jumped in, adding his experience into the pot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Alright,'' Liz grumbled, as Lionel tried what the younger hopper instructed him to do. ''Now what?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now, Harry will hop in,'' Marlon speaks slowly, ''Don't panic. Don't resist. Don't fight it. But at the same time, try to hold on to her.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts were now swirling in Lionel's head of how absurd the idea was. He had been both the perpetrator and victim of mount hijacking and in both situations, the 'stronger' hopper would almost always win. It would be impossible for two hoppers to coexist in the same mount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Here I go'', with a grin, Harry's body started to liquefy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wa-,'' Liz tried to speak, but the liquid pouring inside her throat would not relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't fight it, accept it. He's not trying to force you out.''

Liz spoke again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm in, don't worry. Now I control her left side and you control her right side,'' Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Okay, now I'm confused,'' Jack took a few steps back as he looked at the Wilko supervisor in bewilderment, ''Who's running her now?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I am,'' Liz spoke, her right and left hand pointing to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Maybe we should stop speaking,'' Liz laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So what happens is that each hopper 'limits' himself to a particular area, controlling only that area,''Marlon explained as if on cue, ''The better each hopper is at this, the more hoppers that you can fit inside a mount. Makes taking over people easier.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Can we all fit in there then?'', Jack looked at Liz up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We infiltrated a mosque once,'' Hamid's eyes lit up, ''There were maybe ten of us inside a body,'' he chuckled, ''Sure makes everything a lot easier.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''They were all used to this though, ''Marlon grinned, ''Once everyone knows and trusts each other, it's just a matter of how much you can fit, before it gets really hard to control your mount. Why don't we give it a try,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Alright Lionel,'' Liz spoke, ''Let's try walking, I'll put her left foot forward, then you put right foot forward,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fucking hell,'' came a voice from Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, as if learning how to walk for the first time, Liz stepped forward, another step soon followed, another and another until she walked around the toilet once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good,''Marlon smiled, ''Now that you all know the basics, Hamid and Jack, your turn now.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm going to jump in, ''Marlon extended a hand to help Liz back to her feet. Her eyes were watery and red. The inclusion of two other hoppers inside her body had not been to kind to her. Especially when Jack had to retry his run as he was ejected twice from her body. ''Now Lionel, as you know the area more, you concentrate on her head. Hamid, left arm. Jack, right arm. I'll take right leg and Harry'll be on the left one. It'll make it easier for us to walk and to not be weird.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike his friends before him, Marlon's body turned into a gelatinous substance and forced itself down Liz's throat. The supervisor shudderd briefly, before she opened her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What are we gonna do with our clothes?'' Liz spoke, ''Just leave them here, we can always get new ones'' Liz scanned the area full of scattered male clothing of various kinds. ''I just bought that Jordan a few weeks ago,'' Liz spoke again, before she rolled her eyes.'' Are we just going to be stay here and argue between ourselves?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminded of their goal, the hoppers exited the toilet in unison inside their shared body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It would've just been faster if we called the girls out,'' Liz muttered, with Lionel intending to get the last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Liz, where did you get off to?'' Charlotte greeted her supervisor as Liz waddled back into the store from the employees' entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I was meeting a few friends,'' Liz tried to brush Charlotte off to get back to Elizabeth's office. Lionel didn't really like her snarky attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Alright then,'' Charlotte raised an eyebrow as Liz walksed past her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a lot of coordination from the five hoppers, but mainly by Marlon, Harry and Hamid who had prior experience sharing a mount. It took a lot more to make their mount ascend the steps back to Elizabeth's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Liz, I'm feeling a lot better now. Thanks.'' Mona suddenly appeared at the top of the stairs, beaming a smile at the evening team supervisor, unaware that Liz's body was currently a mere vehicle for five horny hoppers who perked up at the sight of the nubile young body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dammit</i> thought Lionel as he realised that he was the one in charge of replying. As much as he felt the desire to take Mona's body over, he wanted to dump the other four hoppers out from his current host as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's great love,'' Liz smiled back and staggered up the last step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh, Liz. Do you need anything?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Lionel craned Liz's neck to see that her left hand was grasping Mona's arm. <i>Dammit</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, actually I might need you for a few seconds,'' as Liz said that, Lionel was relieved to see that her hand was slowly letting go of Mona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why didn't you just say so,'' Mona chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''In fact, maybe more than a few seconds,'' Liz said, a smirk on her face shifted to a pleasant smile. Liz thrust herself in front of Mona, the evening supervisor gurgled as something... or rather someone rose from her throat. Her hands grabbed hold of Mona's shoulders to brace her as a liquid substance shot out of Liz's mouth like a pressured jet all over Mona's face. Some shoot straight for Mona's agape mouth, while the drops sticking on her face soon find their way inside Mona through her nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dammit!'' Liz coughed as the ordeal was completed, ''Who was that?!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona's eyes blinked once and twice and a smirk crept across her face, ''Sorry guys, couldn't wait.'' Mona said sweetly,''When I saw her, I knew I just had to hop her.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hamid!'', Liz exclaimed, ''You could've just waited until we reached the damn office,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ssshh, ''Mona glanced to the bottom of the stairs, making sure that no one heard the commotion. ''But now that I'm here, we'll spread out faster. Just like when we infiltrated that mosque back in the States.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona then placed her dainty hands upon Liz's mammaries and squeezed them affectionately, feeling the soft fleshy mounds shift and jiggle underneath her fingers, ''Unless everyone's up for some fun first.''<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once in the office, Liz turned the lock, and Mona sat her teenage ass down in Elizabeth's swivel chair. \"Sweet office.\" the young girl chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you guys, out...

Then she pushed Liz out of the way and climbed on the desk, hungrily eyeing up the sizeable cock between Jack's legs. \"Stretch this Iranian pussy out!\" she said gleefully... spreading her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't need inviting twice. He walked straight up to the hopped 20-year old and inserted his erect penis into her pussy. Mona cried out in ecstasy as she felt herself get 'filled up' with man meat. As Jack began pumping away into Mona, making the desk creak and rock, 'Liz', and the other hoppers all grinned, enjoying the scene unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how we gonna get into the other girls?\" Harry asked Liz, who was busy groping her mammoth tits again while watching Jack and Mona fucking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?

The African American hopper took the evening supervisor doggy style by Elizabeth's desk. Meanwhile, Mona was busy doing all the work of impaling herself atop Jack's erect member repeatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grunts and moans emanating from the room was like music to Becca's ears. She took her time to watch the writhing, twisting and turning bodies around the room. In a swift motion, she took off her top, letting the other four hoppers get a good look at her B-cup breasts. It took more time for her to finally get her trousers off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dayum,'' Marlon exclaimed, ''For a white girl, she got one phat ass,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I know,'' Becca said proudly as she ran her hands over her butt cheeks, ''Shame about the tits,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey poppet,'' Elizabeth greeted Steven cordially as the acting manager made her way across the floor, ''Have you seen Liz?'' the manager inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I think she's upstairs,'' Steven stammered, being suddenly asked. He did hear Liz's voice a few minutes ago blaring through the tannoy system installed in the premises asking for Becca to come meet her in manager's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Thanks,'' Elizabeth nodded and smiled at the bespectacled man. Steven was a good employee, although he never seemed to be socialising that often with the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elizabeth walked through the entire shop floor, she couldn't help but to think that the numbers were quite thin this evening. She probably had to ask Liz for some sort of explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fuuuck,'' Liz moaned as Marlon's thrusts picked up pace. The sight of Becca, Mona and Jack engaged in some sort of threesome just further aroused the hopper inside Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp knock on the door however, made all hoppers pay attention to the silhouette behind the door. All except for Marlon, who was too far down to back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Take over from me,'' Liz grunted as she heard the lock on the door clicked open and the handle rattled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvery liquid began to gush out at an impossibly fast pace from Liz's mouth. Almost simultaneously, with a grunt Marlon shot his load inside Liz. His body then liquified and chased after the cum, burrowing itself deep into Liz's snatch. Liz's hands comically flailed as she fell on the floor, having lost her prop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elizabeth finally got the door to open, she was surprised by the sight of a naked man in his 30s with a scar on his face grinning at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hello love,'' Lionel grabbed hold of Elizabeth's arms and phased straight into her body. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He now had the sensation of Elizabeth's tight knickers against his new pussy, of nylon against his smooth legs, a pair of pert B-cup tits encased in a black lace bra. \"Shit that felt better than usual.\" Lionel smirked, his scarred face having momentarily replaced Elizabeth's feminine features. He steadied himself in the manager's high heels, then took stock of his new mount. \"Hmm, so this is the bitch who rules the roost.\" he said, cupping and squeezing his tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lionel had been disappearing into Elizabeth's body, Marlon had taken his friend's place inside Liz's busty body. \"Oh shit... YEAH!\" Marlon groaned in Liz's voice, as the supervisor's pussy fired off an orgasm (one that he had brought about).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sat up, panting, as her face morphed into Marlon's black, rugged features. \"I got me some big ass titties.\" she then chuckled in a deep voice, as she massaged, groped and squeezed her heavy breasts. As she moaned, her face slowly changed back into her usual image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh FUCK!\" Hamid suddenly cried out in his mount's voice, as Jack's fucking finally brought him to orgasm. Jack had been assisted by Harry (in Becca's body) sucking on and biting Mona's nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shooting a healthy deposit of cum into Mona's snatch, Jack took a look around at all his friends now all inside mounts. \"Can't help but feel a little left out here lads, just saying like.\" he said, getting his breath back. \"Do I get one too?\" he asked Lionel, now inside Elizabeth's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth grinned, her own face having returned. \"Not just yet, you've got the only dick in the room right now.\" she told Jack. \"But I'll get you a mount as soon as you've broken me in.\" she said, roughly lifting her skirt and lowering her tights and knickers. She then bent over the desk that Hamid had just vacated. Jack sighed, then readied himself again, trying to get his semi-flaccid dick hard again. When he had managed it, and while Becca and Mona were busy kissing and groping each other, Jack slid his wet cock into Elizabeth's snatch from behind and began pumping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!\" Elizabeth moaned, tipping her head back as she felt the penis slide into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best fucking show ever!\" Liz chuckled in an uncharacteristic way as she remained sat on the floor, just fingering herself and playing with her huge tits.

Today on the other hand, was a little less fair in the weather department, given the crash of thunder and the downpour of rain that sounded more like bullets raining down on the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day, Steven was in the tea room of the Wilkos department store, trying his best to wring the water out of his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had made a terrible mistake to think the wide-brimmed umbrella was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Rob pulled up a chair right up at Steven's table, setting down a hot cup of coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven returned Rob's gesture with a smile and wave. Despite their age difference, the two found something that they could mutually bond over. Video games. Specifically, at this point, Mass Effect (with a sprinkling of Battlefront here and there).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had almost become a ritual. Both of them usually arrived fairly early to work. As such, they spent the first twenty-thirty or so minutes going over their latest achievements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how is Mass Effect 3 so far?\" Rob asked, leaning closer to Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its great. Right now, I've just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on and on they talked. This was one of the few times that Steven was thankful to live alone. Even if his budget was pretty tight, unlike Rob, he did not have his parents policing his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not to say those two were the only ones who arrived early. In fact, an unexpectedly large number of people got to the store early. Mona and Laura stood next to each other, the former leaning in to see something the latter had on her phone. Charlotte sat off on her own, sipping a cup of coffee and Luke and Aaron shared brief pleasantries before walking their separate ways. Even Liam had arrived early, to many raised eyebrows, soaked from head to toe from his unexpected shower. These were but a scant few of the people who occupied the tea room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the tranquil scene eventually had to come to an end. Liz noted this as she took a few deep breaths outside the door, internally bracing herself to give a rousing speech before stepping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" she shouted in order to get everyone's attention. \"I know that... that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a wave of drowsiness hit Liz. No, exhaustion was a better word. It was the type that not only made her muscles ache, but also clouded her mind. She stumbled about trying to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...What...Is...\" she slurred he words as she lazily glanced around. She was not the only one to suffer from this malady. For Aaron and Luke had already hit the floor with a crash, Steven fought a losing battle with his eyelids, and Charlotte drunkenly spun in a circle, no doubt trying to fight the effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" That was all that came out of Liz's mouth as she succumbed. She unceremoniously crumpled into a heap of limbs onto the floor. Soon, the whole room fell silent save for the quiet breathing associated with sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant no one was awake to see the blue light envelope the vicinity...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then he realized that his hair was down around his shoulders. He had long hair as well...??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was snapped out of his self-exploration when a flashlight or something was shone in his face. \"Ma'am, are you alright?\" A female voice asked Steven. Because of the light, Steven couldn't see who was holding the source. Then it hit him, the woman had just called him - 'ma'am'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er.. I think so, but... who are you?\" Steven asked, surprised to hear a female voice emanate from his lips. A voice with an Australian accent nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Illium security ma'am. Were you assaulted? Or have you just had too much to drink?\" The woman inquired, a sardonic tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know.\" Steven answered, looking down at himself. With the security officer's light shining on him, Steven could now see his body more clearly. He was indeed wearing a white and black skin-tight, low-cut 'cat-suit' of some sort, and high heeled boots. He couldn't help but stare down at his impressive cleavage for a moment. And on his left upper arm was a faded area where it looked like a patch had been torn off and discarded.

Their skin tone wasn't the biggest shock however, their hair was... well... it couldn't be called hair. To Steven it looked like they had some sort of 'tentacles' in place of their hair, but neat tentacles, swept back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was quite sure this situation couldn't get more mindboggling. He was in a woman's body, and now he was looking at two alien beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am?

Somewhere in the back of his mind, he wondered if \"Illium\" was some sort of Amazonian society as, now that he thought about it, despite walking quite a ways to the security office, he hadn't exactly seen any men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had learned that his... his <i>body's</i> name was \"Miranda Lawson\" during an embarrassing moment when it took him a good five minutes just to find \"his\" ID. A bit more back and forth had occurred after that. A couple of choice lines dispelled all doubts that he had ended up in some sort of space opera society and was now in the company of aliens. However, after one too many instances of him looking like some sort of blind, antisocial buffoon, he fled the office in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood in front of a large panorama, overlooking what resembled Coruscant from Star Wars. The sight, the sheer scale of the landscape, just seemed to highlight just how lost he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What do I do?</i> He was in a completely alien world that he knew next to nothing about in a completely familiar body that had zero resemblance to his old self that he had no idea who it was with essentially nothing on him but a touchscreen that he had no idea how to use other than bringing up his personal information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven let out a sigh and then slumped down into one of the benches, burying his face into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What do I do?</i> The question repeated in Steven's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...If all he had was a touchscreen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid it out of his pocket and flipped it on. Once again, what looked to be a driver's license of this \"Miranda Lawson\" came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he could find something if he just fiddled around with it a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Steven been paying attention, he would have noticed three burly men, men who fit the very stereotype of thugs, enter the building.

The large TV screen she saw looked to be actually part of the wall, and had no sign of any buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rebekah's focus was more on the body she now occupied, definitely not her own. Her cropped, brown hair was not even down to her shoulders, in sharp contrast to her own blonde hair. Her breasts seemed bigger... <i>were</i> bigger, and her current outfit was a long dark grey and purple 'gown' that hugged her curves at the waist and had a somewhat ridiculously high collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell am I?\" Rebekah panicked slightly. \"And <i>who</i> am I?\" she whispered, running her hands across her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed in the room she was in for about 20 minutes trying to make some sense of what had transpired. But all in vain. And in the end she decided she'd only find answers to her questions somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rebekah was trying to find the door leading outside the building, she searched her person and produced a touchscreen device similar to the one Steven was currently trying to figure out. Rebekah seemed more adept at the learning experience. She soon brought her ID up on the device, stopping by a mirror on the wall to confirm what she now looked like. \"Oriana Lawson??\" Rebekah frowned, shaking her head. This made no sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she put her nifty gadget away, Rebekah pushed open a door and stepped outside, unaware of the potential danger she (Oriana) was in. \"Holy... WOW!\" Rebekah gasped as she greeted with the Illium skyline. Huge, elegant skyscrapers of various shapes going up hundreds of meters, glittering lights and flying...cars??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she got an even bigger shock when she surveyed the area in front of her... and saw all the 'women' with blue skin and strange 'hair'? Most of them were wearing outfits (dresses) similar to her own. She was slightly reassured by the fact that there were also a few normal people (humans) walking around, conducting business, taking in the sights.

Right when he pressed onto an application labeled as \"codex,\" a window popped up demanding his (Miranda's) password. Finances, contacts, mail, and even the game corner were also locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just how paranoid is this woman!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple more seconds of mindlessly tapping at the rows upon rows of icons and Steven finally found something that he could access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a surprisingly similar layout to the tablets of his time. A big, grey button for pictures and off to the lower left corner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than nothing.\" Steven grumbled as he tapped his way into the photo reel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt instantly became clear that Miranda was not much of a photographer. There were only four pictures in the entire gallery. What looked to be some sort of vehicle... it was probably a spaceship, though the skeptic in Steven made him want to believe it was just an exotic looking plane. It was shaped like an arrow, white and black with a red line along its side, and painted on the side in bold letters was \"Normandy\" and \"SR2.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her ship maybe?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next photo was another shot of the skyline, much different angle but recognizable as the same one he could see out the window. The second was some large satellite thing. A ring with five wings hanging off of it. Nothing spectacular, though the angle unnerved him a bit, as if it was taken out of some window.

Most of the beings in the photo were human, but, among other oddities, he saw a large hulking reptile, a bird-like creature, and some more of those blue-skinned women. He could see Miranda somewhere towards the front, staring forward with a stoic expression on her face. The dress code was all over the place, most of them seemed to wear some sort of armor or military uniform, but there were more than a couple that deviated. Especially the one who wore a gas mask on her(?) head, as well as the scantily clad bald woman who had enough tattoos to make a biker weep in envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, was Miranda part of some irregular military group?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the tablet in his pocket. He still had so little to go on. All he had was an image of a space ship, a satellite and that group of... beings. Maybe if he found some of those people in the photo, he could get some answers? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, where would he even go about finding them in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep breath of air in and Steven stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would get a breath of fresh air and then he would try to decide what happens next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he departed for the stairwell, he once again failed to notice the three men walking after him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As shocked as Steven and Rebekah were with their new bodies (and in the former's case new gender), Liz was coming to terms with the fact that she was now not even human anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no... this c-can't be real, it's a dream, a bloomin' nightmare, and I am going to wake up!\" Liz muttered to herself as she paced the administration office she found herself in. She took another look in a small hand mirror that was on the desk in the room with her, and she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was Liz's familiar reflection, instead she was looking at a blue-skinned woman with what looked like 'tentacles' for hair. There was no mistaking the reflection staring back at Liz was attractive... beautiful even, but she was an alien being. Either that, or this was the biggest practical joke that had ever played on anyone in history and Liz was decked out in some realistic make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ruled out the practical joke thing when she reached up and felt one of her 'tentacles', and she felt is move ever so slightly, react to her touch. Liz quickly brought her hand back down and let out a deep sigh. She had to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the locale in which Liz found herself. A stunning city illuminated by the lights of commerce and trading, and a city that also sated the lusts of beings from countless species, in a number of ways... including sexually. Liz peered out of the large panoramic window in front of her at the trading area below. Aliens and humans were everywhere, interacting as normal business partners and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flying cars was partly what told Liz that she was no longer in her time, she had to be in the future. But where?? It certainly wasn't Earth by the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me Dr. T'Soni, but there's a Volus merchant requesting to speak with you.\" Another blue-skinned woman with a facial tattoo said as she walked into the office, startling Liz out of her trance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...a whosey whatsit?\" Liz replied, shaking her head and frowning.

He could have sworn he passed by the one with the billboard that depicted a sunny meadow about three times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven hated to admit it, but he was hopelessly lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lost on an unknown planet in the middle of the night with next to nothing on me and being a girl on top of that?

Two burly men, both with shaved heads and dressed in identical red suits leered at Steven. The one to the left was swarthy, whilst the one to the right was almost white as a sheet.

She figured that maybe searching whatever this world had in place of the Internet would be a good place to start finding some answers to all the questions she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the computer looked way more advanced than anything she'd ever seen before. It was touchscreen of course, but most of the text seemed to be in a foreign (or rather alien) language. Liz's eyes scanned the screen as one of her hands caressed the swept back tentacles on her head. It was weird not having real hair... human hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she was drawn to a 'button' at the lower right of the screen, and she tapped on it. The alien text on the computer instantly translated itself into English and Liz found herself able to read it. She began her search in earnest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later she had made some progress. She was on a world called <i>Illium</i>, in the Crescent Nebula of the Milky Way galaxy. It was a classic garden world, and one of many colonies founded by the <i>Asari</i>, the Azure-colored, all-female race that Liz apparently was now a member of. Liz had also discovered the name of the body she now inhabited... Doctor Liara T'Soni, an archaeologist. \"She was born in... 2077??\" Liz frowned, checking up on what the current date was, 2185. \"Woah, wait a minute, I'm 108 years old?\" Liz muttered to herself skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut further research revealed to Liz that she was 'young' by Asari standards, a mere Maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Nyxeris.\" Liz said as he assistant brought her in a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Oh... and the Volus merchant refuses to take no for an answer. He's still requesting to meet with you Doctor T'Soni.\" Nyxeris smiled. After quickly researching the 'Volus' species, Liz let out a sigh and sat back in her chair. \"Fine, I'll see what he's got to say. Show him in please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact was, Liz didn't know what else to do, or where to go. She knew nobody around her, everyone was a stranger.

From the increase in security activity around him, he knew the bodies had probably been found by now, and maybe he was now being hunted... by yet more people... or aliens, whatever.

Surprisingly mundane, all things considering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the scene behind the door was by no means mundane.

Sure!\" Rebekah cleared her throat. \"When I woke up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth she and Steven recounted everything they could remember from the past day. It was a breath of fresh air for the two of them. Rather than having to wonder what was going on on their own, they could do it together. Even if their discussion uncovered next to nothing about how they got here. Rebekah hadn't done much but wander around the futuristic town, marveling at... basically everything. Steven admitted he had essentially done the same thing, but there was the encounter with the three thugs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a bounty on you?\" Rebekah bit her lips. <i>Crap.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Steven sucked in a breath of air. \"But, we're going to have to be careful.

What were the chances of the two of them appearing on this corner of the universe.

Thankfully, even in the future, even though there were all kinds of wires and other screens attached to the door, there was still a peep hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah squeaked in surprise at what she saw on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were at least twelve people. All of them were dressed in what looked to be some strange cross between space suits and stormtrooper armor. They crowded around the door, in a semi-circle, yet from the shadows Rebekah saw in the side of her vision, she guessed there were more hidden away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them stepped forward. He was mostly indistinguishable from the others, but Rebekah noticed that his armor seemed a lot bulkier than the others. He spoke in a dull-robotic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father wishes to have a word with you.\"</span></div></div>",

The Asari was dressed in a sort of 'stylish' armor, black and dark red in color. And the 'armor' left a large proportion of her generous breasts exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfit the Asari wore certainly didn't match her sheepish attitude as she walked around. She glanced at people, other Asari and 'alien' alike, and she couldn't help but feel self-conscious with her azure blue tits practically spilling out for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, where to go, who to talk to?\" The Asari - Samara - muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Adari's voluptuous, centuries-old body was none other than Jessica, the ginger-haired co-worker of Steven, Rebekah and Liz. And just like her friends, Jessica was feeling completely lost in this literally 'alien' world, not to mention in the 'freakish' yet sexy body she now occupied. For some reason, Jessica looked up at a large window, and saw another blue skinned. tentacle-haired woman, dressed in a mostly white outfit, pacing in the elevated office that overlooked the area. For some reason she felt drawn to that office, and she didn't know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had to wonder whether her new body was having unknown, peculiar effects on her mind. Jessica didn't yet know the immense biotic ability that resided within her experienced new body. She was now wearing the body of an Asari <i>Justicar</i> after all, though she didn't even know what one of those was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do, Jessica walked up the stairs to the raised office, and saw stopped when she saw a small, 'roundish' alien in body armor leaving. \"Strange woman!\" The Volus shook his head, muttering to himself in between heavy breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Jessica frowned, before approaching the desk where Nyxeris, 'Liara's' assistant was sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings. It is such an honor to have a Justicar visit us.\" Nyxeris bowed slightly at Jessica, who felt vaguely important for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...

Not even her first job interview came close. It was as if the universe gave her a test on everything she had learned climbing up Wilkos' hierarchy. She needed to keep herself composed when the small, round alien stepped into her office then she needed to bullshit how that she was definitely this \"Liara\" and that she was definitely the information broker he was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly enough, finding the information for the Volus wasn't too difficult. This \"Liara\" had prepared everything for the meeting. Just give the merchant a little disk and send him on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiped a bit of sweat off her brow (apparently, whatever type of alien she was still had sweat glands), flinching a little when she brushed past her sensitive \"head tentacles,\" and then got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed a fresh air, badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings.

Hi.\" While it was a voice that sounded like it should be barking commands on a battlefield, this \"justicar\" spoke in a very demure fashion. It sounded very strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one of those blue-skinned women stood at the front desk. While the red and black armor, despite seemingly being crafted to show off the women's ample bosom, did give her a rather intimidating air, the way the woman twiddled her fingers did not. A touch of purple had colored the woman's cheeks and she glanced around before speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I... it's nothing. I was just going.\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did she come to see me... Liara?</i> Liz thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevealing herself would probably lead to yet another stressful meeting, a daunting proposition as she had barely recovered from the first one. Yet... this woman seemed so... well... it just made her feel bad to leave the timid girl alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, she chose to reveal herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honorable justicar, have you come to speak with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz bit her lips. She gathered that the one in the armor, the justicar, was important, but she hoped she had not embellished it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two blue woman turned to look to Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah...\" The Justicar mumbled.</span></div></div>",

They've probably covered all the exits.\" Steven shook his head, speaking in his sexy new voice as he again brushed his long dark hair behind his ears. His new hair was beginning to irritate him to be honest. \"I think... we just have to go with them. That guy did say 'our' father wanted to speak with us. Can't be that bad right?\" he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah frowned. \"What kind of father sends armed men out after his daughters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grimaced a little, reminded once again of his female status. \"Well, I could always try to fight them off?\" he mumbled, know himself that it didn't sound as crazy as it probably did to Rebekah, given his 'hidden powers'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous!\" Rebekah admonished him. \"Open the door, we should go with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven reluctantly agreed.

The \"escort\" that they had been sent had looked quite prepared to use force had they not complied and the two felt much more like prisoners than guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they flew on, a growing pit of dread formed in Rebekah's stomach. Had they done the right thing? Maybe they should've just run while they had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...No. That was impossible. A dozen or so soldiers vs. two defenseless women? They would have been shot down before they could take a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar thoughts ran through Steven's head.

The nightlife on Illium, the aliens walking around... even the weather, which was calm (due to being controlled by atmospheric technology). \"You look... lost?\" 'Liara' suddenly blurted out, drawing 'Samara's' gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Jessica replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, not that I think you... you just look like you don't belong here.\" Liz clarified her statement, decising to pry a little deeper.

You don't sound like a local yourself hon.\" 'Samara' commented to Liara'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz immediately frowned, recognizing a somewhat familiar tone to Samara's speech pattern. Liz was an excellent judge of character, always had been, and she also had a keen eye and ear as well as a good memory. \"You sound like someone I know.\" she chuckled, getting the Justicar's attention again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... really? Who?\" 'Samara' asked, raising an eyebrow as she reached up nervously to caress her sensitive hair tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... her name is Jessica.\" Liz revealed, biting her bottom lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's eyes widened in shock and her jaw fell open as she stared at the equally azure-skinned beauty sat across from her. \"Er... wow, I-I'm Jessica!\" she exclaimed, not knowing quite what 'Liara's' reaction would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Liz jumped up from the desk and ran around it, causing Jessica to leap up, partly out of alarm. \"Oh, sorry Jess, didn't mean to frighten you. It's me... Liz.\" Liara said, putting her hand to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment of silence befell the room, then the two shared a relieved, passionate embrace, glad to know they were safe and had found each other. At that moment, Nyxeris entered the room. \"Oh forgive me Dr T'Soni, I did not mean to interrupt, but you have a message from 'Source 13' on Omega.\" The assistant then left the room, as the console on Liz's desk started flashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Source 13?\" Jessica asked, a tear in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sighed, just smiling at Jessica. \"I have no idea!\" she chuckled, now in somewhat higher spirits.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steven used his biotics to pry the elevator doors open and he peered down the elevator shaft into the dark depths below, so great was the height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now what?\" Rebekah panicked, seeing that the elevator was somewhere above them and clearly not working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me!\" Steven sighed, holding Rebekah close to him, so that their breasts pressed together.

Seemed like the time of day that it should be bustling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven wondered if \"his father\" had something to do with this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and Rebekah immediately darted down another street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let them get away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ran, Steven began to hear the soft panting of Rebekah beside him. She was beginning to lag behind him a bit. Steven inwardly cursed. If they kept this up, then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing a non-computerized-sounding voice, Steven spared a glance ahead of him. A caucasian man with a buzzcut leaned out one of the door, waving the two down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven threw a glance at Rebekah, whose panting had only grown heavier. She would not last much longer. They shared a nod. They veered to the right and disappeared into the building. The man slammed the door shut behind them and locked it with a beeping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior reminded Steven, nostalgically enough, of the lobby back in the apartment he had back in... well, \"his time.\" A little alcove in the wall for a front desk as well as a pair of couches and a desk. It was the first place that Steven had seen that didn't look futuristic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stampede ran past the door, disappearing off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showed up in the nick of time, didn't I?\" Their benefactor smiled. Now that Steven had a better look at him, he noticed that the man was slightly taller than the two of them and wearing one of those military uniforms that was so ubiquitous in the group photo he saw earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... he was Miranda's ally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man held out a hand. \"Thomas Hawthorne.\" He said. \"Former private 1st class in the Systems Alliance. I doubt you remember me from back on the Normandy.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm Oriana.\" She spoke up, thinking it polite to introduce herself to their gracious hosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Liz smiled, nodding slightly. \"And you're Miranda.\" She said, turning to Steven. Liz then had to ask the question on her mind. \"So, who is after you?\" Liz asked the two women sat on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and Rebekah looked at each other, then the former answered Liz. \"Our father, apparently.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sat down behind her desk and brought up the sisters' information again. \"Henry Lawson, your father.

However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we don't have anything else to go on.\" Said Liz with a sigh as she loaded her computer back up. \"I'll start a search.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyxeris and Nathaniel turned to each other. It had been Nathaniel's idea to eavesdrop. While Nyxeris wasn't usually in the habit of spying on her employer, it was quite rare when she allowed large parties into her office and even rarer when she kept them in for long durations of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they had just met, Nathaniel only needed to point this out to convince her to listen in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Responded Nyxeris. Thinking back, Liara was acting pretty unusual. She somehow seemed... less sure of herself than usual. More wooden. Someone taking over Liara's body? It wasn't her first guess, but she supposed it made... actually, it made no sense, but it was at least an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, whoever was in Liara's place didn't seem hostile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathaniel wasn't so sure himself. He supposed he could easily explain away the four's unusual behavior with insanity... but ever since that Collector's base, he had seen enough weird shit to believe that taking over someone's body was quite possible. Just like Nyxeris though, He thought the current inhabitants seemed just as confused as they were...</span></div></div>",

It took quite a bit of convincing, especially in Hawthorne's case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have no knowledge of anything in this world? The Galactic Council? The Collector threat? Nothing?\" Hawthorne frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, we're totally in the dark.

Humorously enough, Miranda and Oriana were also in the \"classified\" section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrex and Grunt were on a world called Tuchunka, which, as Nyxeris pointed out, was one of the worst \"death worlds\" in the galaxy.

But for all we know, there might have been a nuclear war on Earth at some point. What if they had to rebuild?\" He thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would suck!\" Jessica muttered, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think?\" Rebekah spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz stayed positive, as always. \"I'm sure nothing like that has happened, and at least now we're not stumbling about in the dark.

None of them could hide the slight trepidation they all felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jump in 3...2...1...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the ship was off. The view from the windows blurred into a blue mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wheee!\" Jessica threw her arms up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a shadowy figure that \"just so happened\" to pass by their cabin shook his head in befuddlement.

A sudden gasp escaped her lips as she stumbled backwards from the control station she was suddenly stood at. She looked around at her unfamiliar surroundings, seeing several other people, none of whom she recognized. <i>What the hell? Where am I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in what looked to her like some sort of advanced laboratory, and everyone she could see was wearing the same kind of... 'uniform'? Form hugging uniforms from the looks of them. Black, white and grey uniforms with some sort of yellow insignia on the sleeve<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Natalie looked down at herself, and sure enough... she was attired in an identical uniform, her breasts perfectly emphasized by the fabric. <i>Did someone cut my hair??</i> she then scowled, running her fingers through her shorter hair. By this time confusion had really set in, and panic was showing it's head. She took a closer look at her surroundings, in particular the large, glowing, 3D representation of a... something. <i>Wow!</i> Natalie gasped again, walking up the few steps in front of her to inspect it more closely. She stepped back immediately when several pointers on the 'image' were highlighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Natalie, with her limited knowledge of astronomy, eventually realized that was she was looking at was an advanced 3D rendering of a galaxy? \"Seriously what the fuck is going on here?\" she asked herself, her palms getting sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice behind her caused Natalie to spin around. \"Are you okay Kelly?\" a man asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... me? Um... who's Kelly?\" Natalie answered with a puzzled frown. Then she had a more important question. \"Where the hell am I?\" She was that distressed, she didn't notice her voice now had a definite American accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man wasn't sure how to respond to Natalie's odd questions. \"You been hitting the ryncol?\" he eventually asked with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer me!\" Natalie demanded, more out of panic then anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... Kelly, and you know where you are, you're on the Normandy.\" the man said, playing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? Isn't that in France?\" Natalie inquired. She'd been once for a holiday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shook his head. \"Very funny Kelly, you're hilarious, now stop messing around. I doubt Shepard kept you around for your sense of humor.\" he said dryly before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was annoyed that she had got no answers and no help from that guy. When some doors opened behind her, Natalie spun around to see another man dressed in a similar uniform to hers step out of an elevator. Thoroughly lost by this time, and in need of answers, Natalie headed into the elevator and waited for the doors to close. She now had a choice of several 'floors' to choose from, including Commander's Cabin, Crew's Quarters and Engineering. <i>This a ship or something?</i> Natalie scoffed quietly, randomly hitting the 'Crew Quarters' button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speed with which the elevator moved at surprised Natalie, and she felt her stomach churn. \"Oh god!\" she groaned, steadying herself. Luckily the trip didn't last very long, just a few seconds, then the elevator doors shot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Natalie saw when she stepped out of the elevator was some kind of plaque with the names of 20 people on it. A memorial plaque maybe? She shrugged, then resumed her search for the answers she so desperately needed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two were rather vocal about their dissatisfaction over the food. The name \"Mess Sergeant Gardner\" came up a couple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergeant? Was Natalie in some sort of military?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to confirm her thoughts, a rather broad looking man carrying a gun (a futuristic rifle? Natalie wasn't very good with firearms), stepped toward the elevator. Natalie got an odd look from him when she quickly scampered out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely military.\" she whispered. Just as she said it, a wave of panic began to set in. Crap, this was bad. In this messed up... whatever reality she woke up in, she just had to be a member of the military? She barely knew anything about normal guns, let alone any of this futuristic crap. What the hell would the captain... commander... whatever the guy in charge was called do to her if she couldn't do her job?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie took in a deep, calming breath. No, no. Panicking would not do her any favors. She needed to figure out what exactly was up and then come up with a plan to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, judging from everything she had seen, she was probably on some sort of ship. Considering that representation of the galaxy she saw, this was probably one of those \"Star Trek\" ships. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked down the crew quarters, heedless of the red lights toward the end and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat... was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething looked up at her. It was completely clad in metal a blue and black metal suit. Hell, she had seen renditions of knights that wore much less armor. But that... that was not the part that caused her to gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts head... the closest she could get to describing it was some strange cross between a lizard and a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie ducked out of sight, into one of the open doors of the crew quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus bemusedly glanced at her, before rubbing at the scar on the side of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they told me I looked fine.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What a lot of us went through at the hands of the Collectors is bound to leave it's mark on anyone, seeing innocent people liquified like that. Sickening.\" the woman suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Liquified? People?</i> Natalie shook her head. But the idea of a doctor sounded good. At the very least she could give her a sedative and knock her out. Then hopefully she'd wake up from this nightmare. \"Thanks, the doctor sounds like a good idea.\" Natalie forced out a smile, then headed towards the sick bay. The automatic door opened up and she walked inside. There was only one other person in the room, an older woman with grey hair and a slightly different... and more form fitting uniform. And the one thing Natalie immediately noticed, is the woman looked as puzzled as she was. \"Er... Doctor... Chakwas?\" Natalie mumbled, successfully remembering her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, oh... can I - help you?\" The doctor frowned, fidgeting from one foot to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope so.\" Natalie nodded. \"How can I put this? Um... I feel like I don't belong here. In fact... I DON'T belong here.\" she blurted out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Chakwas took a seat, continuing to stare up at the young woman who had entered 'her' sick bay. \"Go on...\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie let out another sigh and then started pacing the room, wondering what to say. And it was then that she caught sight of her reflection in a mirror. It was the reflection of a woman she didn't know. Whose body was she in? How did this happen? The questions raced through Natalie's mind as she reached up to touch her face and then run her hands down her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the odd behavior of the woman in front of her, Doctor Chakwas spoke again. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie drew her gaze from the mirror and looked at the doctor in disbelief. \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be surprised.\" the doctor responded, arching an eyebrow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A short moment of silence filled the room as Natalie internally debated as what to do next. On one hand, she would probably receive that condescending lecture that doctors usually reserve for mad (wo)men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why shouldn't Dr. Chakwas? Looking into the mirror had given her a little bit of sympathy for the few others she had talked to ever since she woke up. If one of her coworkers began asking who she was and mistaking Wilkos for some backwater planet, she would certainly have dismissed them as insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, on the other hand. Natalie was a little tired of panicking and having no idea what was going on. Natalie could get one ally, ONE ally who she could talk normally with, that would be nice. At the very least, this \"Doctor Chakwas\" wasn't squinting at Natalie as if she had lost her marbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of complicated, but...\" Natalie shifted from foot to foot. This was it, the moment of truth. She mentally prepared to receive that squinty eyed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone calls me Kelly, but I... well... my name is Natalie, and I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Live in England and work in a hardware store called Wilkos.\" Dr. Chakwas finished with a slight grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's eyes almost bulged right out of their sockets. \"What? How did you...\" A sudden epiphany hit her right in the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squinted her eyes. \"Don't tell me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Chakwas\" flashed Natalie a warm and genuine smile. \"I'm Nicola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a couple of seconds, all Natalie could do was stare at the old doctor who had identified herself as Natalie's senior in work. But then, a warm feeling of relief arose within her, causing her to break out into a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nicola, thank god!\" Natalie ran up and hugged the older woman. \"I just had no idea what was going on or why I look like this and I was afraid that...that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola just patted Natalie on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, from what I can gather, we are on some ship called 'Normandy.'\" Natalie said, pacing back and forth in front of Nicola. After Natalie had calmed down a little, what was supposed to be a therapy session had become an information exchanging session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We seem to be part of some sort of military group, if the uniforms and guns are to be believed.\" Natalie couldn't help but shudder. Despite her fiance formerly being a part of the military, she had never seen an actual gun in her life, let alone shot one. To think that she might actually have to catch bullets...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there was this weird bug-lizard thing walking around.\" Nicola raised an eyebrow at that. \"A... Turian. At least that's what someone I talked to called it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie decided to leave out the part about \"liquefying people.\" She had no idea what to think of it. Actually, she didn't even want to entertain the very thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola nodded slowly. \"Troubling.\" she muttered in a voice that sounded nothing like Nicola's actual voice. \"I'm sorry to say, but I haven't really left this room since I, well, 'woke up.' I don't really have much to add.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie couldn't really blame her. Had Natalie \"woken up\" in an empty room like this, she would've probably just locked the door and refused to come out until everything had gone back to some semblance of normality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them had brought up how they might have gotten here. They somehow both knew that it would only create more questions than it would answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that she was not alone did a lot to help Natalie's state of mind. However, it didn't really answer the very important questions: how did they get here, how could they return everything to normal, and, perhaps most importantly, what do they do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had found herself stood in front of a console, and there was a constant hum that seemed to be all around her. Added to that, the guy next to her who had a Scottish accent was rattling on about something or other. But that wasn't the biggest shock, when Suki looked down at her arms... she saw she was now white. \"Oh my god!\" she mumbled initially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabby, something wrong?\" the man next to her asked, when he saw his 'ship mate' inspecting her own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly bewildered, Suki was unsure what to do next. Her surroundings seemed vaguely familiar to her for some reason. Ignoring the man asking her questions, Suki left the console she was at and walked a short distance, until the Normandy's Tantalus drive core came into view. Then she realized where she was, having played Mass Effect a few times on and off. She was on board the SSV Normandy SR-2. A Cerberus-built frigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any particular reason why you're not answering me love?\" the man asked again. Suki remembered his name suddenly, Engineer Kenneth Donnelly. And he was calling her \"Gabby\". Which could only mean... no - that was impossible. Right? But apparently not, Suki looked down at herself again, clad in a form-fitting Cerberus uniform. <i>I'm Gabriella Daniels?</i> she gasped silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... sorry. \" Suki finally responded, \"Just not feeling myself.\" she added. That statement was definitely true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to get back to monitoring the core's output just saying.\" Kenneth shrugged, gesturing to the vacated console next to him. \"You know EDI appreciates all the help we can give her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Suki had more important things to worry about. She had a million questions that needed answers. First and foremost... how the hell did she end up in the body of one of the Mass Effect characters?  As minor a characters as \"Gabby\" was, Suki was still onboard - in layman's terms - a spaceship. And that meant, everything in the video game, mass relays, space stations, aliens... were all real now. Suki wondered whether she was tripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Gabby?\" Kenneth's voice again sounded out, causing Suki to snap herself out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold down the fort for me? I gotta pee.\" Suki said, scurrying out of Engineering. She knew enough about the game to navigate her way around the Normandy. Which is a lot more than Natalie and Nicola knew how to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was about to hop in the elevator, Suki suddenly had to ask herself... where was she going? If she was really on the Normandy - alone - then who would she talk to about what she was experiencing. Everyone would think she was mad. It didn't matter, she couldn't stay in Engineering right now, not with Kenneth nattering in her ear all the time. She got in the elevator and hit the button for the Crew's Quarters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped she would find help there.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suki only saw him for a few seconds, but it was utterly surreal. A character from a videogame, one that was only supposed to be a collection of pixels, good scripting, and voice acting appearing, as a living breathing being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki closed her eyes and sucked in a breath of air; a breathing technique she recalled her older sister teaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, she still needed to know what to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki continued forward into the... common room-ish area. At the very least, the area that had a lot of tables and wasn't a medical bay or sleeping quarters. The only occupants in the room were a man and a woman who sat at one of the tables, sitting in silence. Suki recognized them from the Special Ingredients quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki's thoughts went back to the memorial wall. That... disturbed her a little. Not just the thought that all the time she was playing through Mass Effect, she had been watching ACTUAL people dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Suki wandered in the direction of the sick bay. Really, this action came out of nothing more than indecisiveness.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jade had quite a shock when she went from being in the almost quiet environs of the tea room to suddenly being in a nightclub of some sort, loud music reverberating in her head. She was sat alone at a little table with a drink on it. It was in a funky glass, and the people around her... well, they were dressed strangely, in fact... some of them looked weird. <i>Are they wearing costumes?</i> Jade asked herself inwardly. Some of the people she could see resembled overgrown birds in armor, some women appeared to have blue skin and funny looking hair. <i>\"And where the hell am I anyway?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Jade reached for the glass on the table in front of her to have a drink, that she realized something wasn't very wrong about herself. For a start, she had black skin, except for her palms. The strobe effects and dimmed lights didn't help her sight, but she was definitely a darker skin tone now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the biggest shock of all, she felt a certain 'swelling' sensation in her pants, The crotch of the skin-tight military-type uniform she was wearing was bulged out, which confirmed that she now had a... penis?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!!\" Jade tried to squeal, but it came out as more of a yell. She instantly noticed her deeper, masculine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm in a man's body...</i> Jade gasped, patting herself down. <i>A black man's body...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jade saw one of the 'blue' women frowning at her behavior, she decided to sit back down. She would have fallen down anyway eventually since she was suddenly feeling nauseous. How the hell could she be a man?? And just where was she? Closer inspection at some of the people around her revealed that they weren't wearing costumes, or if they were they were incredibly lifelike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all a dream, and I'm gonna wake up any minute.\" Jade repeated to herself, closing her eyes. When she opened them again and saw she was still in the club, she grabbed the drink in front of her and downed it in one shot. She coughed a little, unprepared for it's strength. But if there was ever a time for alcohol, Jade knew that this was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nervously moved one hand under the table and onto her crotch. Yep... she definitely had a dick... and it was hard. <i>This is so messed up, what the fuck is happening to me?</i> she thought, as the alcohol immediately warmed her up inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she caught sight of another individual in the nightclub, sat at a table some distance away. What appeared to be a woman with a dark ponytail, but her hair was completely shaved off at the sides. And she had tattoos all over her head, neck, arms and presumably the rest of her body to. The thing Jade noticed most about the woman, was she seemed to acting as puzzled and 'lost' as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade realized she had nothing to lose, and so she stood up and walked over to the woman's table.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing Charlotte noticed was the music. A loud synthetic pop song blared out, hammering against her head. She let out a groan before lifting her head from the table and opening her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes immediately widened in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashing lights, loud music, people bouncing around in the vague approximation of a dance, and the glass of dark liquid on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in a nightclub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pretty funky nightclub, too. She wasn't sure if it were a trick of the light or not, but some of those costumes were downright <i>weird</i>. Women with funny looking protrusions out of their heads and skinny, anthropomorphic frogs were the least of what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Best nightclub I've seen.</i> She thought dryly. She remembered, in her younger years, she had actually gone to one. It was nothing like they were portrayed in fiction. Loud, stuffy, and crowded; the best description she could come up with for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was more like the nightclubs in fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... she went to work, fell asleep... and woke up at some nightclub?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte frowned as she pondered over these questions. She reached out and pushed her glass away from her. She knew not to fuck with booze. She was a lightweight. She once passed out when drinking something that her friend, Maddy, had derisively called \"water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was up with her arm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was harder to see under the strobes and dim illumination, but her sleeves were made of leather... and her hands were covered in tattoos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the... What the fuck?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed a hand up to her head, feeling her face and working up to the top of her head. She only felt a thin strip of hair that ended in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... not only did she wake up in a nightclub, but someone made her over into some punkish nightmare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she wasn't just redressed. Her whole body felt wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was much more lean and muscular, though her features seemed a lot... sharper. Her breasts were much larger and she was quite sure she had shrunk an inch or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also that disconcerting \"tightness\" in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Charlotte snapped out of her thoughts when she heard the scraping of a chair on the floor. A large, muscular black man sat down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap! Panic arose in Charlotte's chest. Was he going to hit on her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This woman truly looks bizarre.</i> Jade thought as she looked the tattooed punk girl up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, Jade was quite determined to grill the girl for information, maybe even find out if she had a kindred spirit in what was the strangest day of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her mouth suddenly dried up when she got a closer look. This woman, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Jade decided to forego spilling out that her name was Jade and she used to be an English woman before... whatever happened happened. She decided to take a different approach to socializing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hey?\" she said, wincing slightly at the very masculine voice she spoke with. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her surroundings immediately looked familiar, but... she couldn't fathom where she was straight away because of her disorientation. There were people all around her, and... aliens?? <i>\"Oh my god, that's a Turian!\"</i> she gasped, seeing a member of C-Sec armed with a Phaeston pulse rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shock only grew when she saw a Salarian walk past, muttering to himself. \"Holy crap!\" Mona gasped. Then it dawned on her, when she looked up at the vast expanse of the Citadel, that she was somehow in the Mass Effect universe. <i>How could this be?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time on the Citadel ma'am?\" the Turian suddenly addressed Mona, causing her head to jerk around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hi, yeah... could say that.\" Mona answered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona was versed enough in the Mass Effect saga to know the names of the characters, the different species and some planets etc. And seeing an actual Turian in the flesh... or rather scales... was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Turian chuckled. \"Yeah she's a beauty alright. When I was accepted into C-Sec, I felt so damn lucky to be able to work here.\" he said, looking up as the skycars flew past one after another. The gentle hum of their engines echoing slightly. Mixed with the indistinct chatter of the people around her, Mona started feeling 'excited' a well as shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the chat with the C-Sec guard took a different direction. \"Say, you look familiar come to think of it. Haven't I seen you before?\" the suspicious Turian asked as he looked at Mona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona's stomch started doing flips a little. \"Er... no, I don't - think so.\" she mumbled defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe it's just the hood. It's not a good idea to hide yourself under one of those around here, might draw unwanted attention.\" the Turian muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Mona lifted up her hands and felt the material of the hood covering her head. She studied her hands for a moment. They weren't big, but they weren't exactly as small as her hands usually were either. And what about the outfit she was wearing, it looked more than familiar. She ran her hands down over her torso and inhaled a deep breath.before exhaling. \"Good advice.\" she said to the Turian, only then realizing her voice was different also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething clicked inside Mona at that moment. <i>Am I... Kasumi?</i> The uniform matched, as did her voice. Master thief and one-time Normandy crew member Kasumi Goto. The very fact that Mona could actually be that character was... unbelievable. But then... so was being on the Citadel and so was havng a conversation with an 'overgrown bird' clad in armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you take care of yourself ma'am.\" the Turian nodded to Mona, before returning to his post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you too.\" Mona mumbled in a quiet tone, as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making her way down into the main market of the area where she was, Mona suddenly stopped in her tracks and frowned. She felt a sudden and slight 'stirring' in her pants. She frowned and looked down at herself. <i>No fucking way.....</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, more of, as if tiny bits of her consciousness were dispersed along the ocean. Along with it came a smattering of sensations that she... wasn't even sure how to describe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was just the tip of the iceberg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't feel her arms, legs, head or any familiar muscle or limb at all. There wasn't even some phantom stump or anything. Those body parts and the sensations that came with them were outright <i>gone</i>. She didn't even seem to be capable of breathing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes snapped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, rather, she opened all of her \"eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Only to quickly close them back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensory input was... overwhelming. And that was putting it lightly. All at the same time, she had seen at least eight different rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was this... some sort of ship?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of those rooms she had scene looked, to her, directly out of the set of Star Wars; complete with the crew dressed in form fitting military uniforms, a large whirring machine that  she did not know the function of, and the large hologram of the galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura paused, floating... lying? Whatever she was doing in this \"ocean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat... was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quite sure that \"human\" was no longer the answer. But when thinking of something that doesn't breathe and has eyes, well, everywhere, she was at a loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic began creeping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she? What was she!? What was going on!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn impulse, she opened her \"eyes\" again. This time, sound filtered through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least five different conversations filtered in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cerberus? Collectors?

She was some kind of hospital from what she could tell, but it was a very futuristic looking one. Certainly not one she was used to. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/Images/208/544980-1397233896.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nexusmods.com/Images/208/5449...</a> Many people were standing around or seeing to patients, and some of them looked particular strange to Waggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what panicked Waggy the most was <i>how</i> she was seeing all this. Her eye sight wasn't 'normal', she was seeing things differently and it was almost impossible for her to describe. But she could see well enough, her vision was excellent in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thane Krios?\" a voice suddenly got Waggy's attention. She turned to see a funny looking woman standing there in a skin tight white and grey medical outfit. <i>Are those hair tentacles?</i> Waggy gasped. But she couldn't stare too long, it was - rude. Besides, she had other problems. Was this 'woman' calling her a funny name? Eventually she began speaking, only to clam up instantly. She did not recognize the 'alien' voice that left her mouth. Waggy got a bigger shock when she held up her hands, seeing the ring and middle fingers on both of them were fused together. Her panic increased ten-fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" the blue-skinned woman in front of Waggy asked, as Waggy began feeling faint. And it wasn't as a result of the Kepral's Syndrome that she was unfortunately now afflicted with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a weird looking 'frog-like' doctor stepped forward to help the woman calm things, Waggy's mind went into sensory overload and she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>********</i><br>\r\nWhen she came too some time later she was in a bed, hooked up to a machine of some sort, monitoring her vital systems. Waggy gasped and held up her strange looking hands again. What was she? What was this place? And... was this a nightmare? Questions she had no answers to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors off to the right suddenly opened and in walked a woman, also attired in the same medical outift. She had shoulder-length red hair and she smiled at Waggy as she entered. \"I hope you're feeling more comfortable.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" Waggy asked, suddenly feeling fatigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huerta Memorial hospital, on the Citadel. Don't you remember passng out a while ago?\" the woman answered Waggy's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaggy just about to shake her head, but then it all came back to her in fine detail, thanks to the eidetic memory she now possessed. She stared at the ceiling for a moment, then turned back to the woman. \"Have you got a mirror I could borrow?\" She just had to know what she looked like, as much of a shock as she knew it would undoubtedly be. She already knew she was an alien, and obviously a male judging from her anatomy, but she had to know. The woman smiled and handed Waggy a small round mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering into the glass... Waggy's lips parted and a stunned gasp escaped. The reflection of some reptilian-type humanoid greeted her, with large dark eyes with two sets of lids. <i>What the hell am I???</i> That one questions echoed loudly in her stressed mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female doctor managed to catch the mirror as Waggy passed out again from shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate it seemed had been more unfair to Waggy than to most of her co-workers. Such was this new, dangerous universe they now lived in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Citadel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy!\" Suki sighed. \"Our search area just increased - massively.\" she supported her head in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the Citadel?\" Nicola asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a huge space station, in layman's terms, basically the center of civilization in the galaxy.\" Suki answered with a mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Suki heard Joker's voice over the intercom. \"Er... Doctor Chakwas, you might want to head down to the port cargo bay. one of the crew just reported that Grunt is acting weird. Well, you know... weirder than a tank-bred Krogan usually acts. Please tell me they only go through puberty once.\" he said, being his usualy comical self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki jumped to her feet and looked at Nicola. \"That's you... Doctor. And it looks like the cargo bay is our first port of call.\" she said. \"EDI... er.... Laura, meet us down on the Engineering deck will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative.\" Laura mumbled in EDI's voice, before her pixelated blue ball disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that sounded like the orginal EDI.\" Suki said to Natalie and Nicola, before leading them out of the door and to the elevator.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a simple task of just refocusing her consciousness down to the terminal down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grunt\" was hard to miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large lizard thing had his head pressed against the wall right next to her terminal. Apparently, whatever crew member had reported \"Grunt\" had fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.\" He repeated to himself, speaking rapidly in a deep, gravelly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large lizard honestly unnerved Laura a little bit. However, she had been assured that inside that scaly frame was one of her coworkers from back at Wilkos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Krogan made no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't worry, I just want to h-help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no response. The lizard brought a hand up and punched himself in the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, around that time, the elevator doors cracked open and Nicola, Natalie, and Suki stepped out. They didn't have to navigate much before they too could see the Krogan's mental breakdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Natalie's eyes widened. It was her second time seeing an alien. While the first one had sort of resembled a lizard. It was a bit more... bird-like in presentation. A lot more lean as well. This one was built like a tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing \"Grunt\" like that reminded Suki of Shepard recruiting him back in the game. The first thing the Krogan had done was pin Shepard against a wall and threaten him/her (for some reason, she liked playing male) with violence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without hostile intent behind that frame, up close, the Krogan looked big and strong enough to shatter Suki's new bones without trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to proceed with caution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly enough, Nicola took the whole thing in stride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we're here. You're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that Nicola said seemed to strike a cord with Grunt, as he stopped his muttering and the large, reptilian head turned to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola took a step forward. \"You're from Wilkos, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lizard's eyes widened for a second before it nodded its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicola tilted her head up, to meet the Krogan in the eye. \"May I ask your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief pause. A couple of seconds passed before he finally opened his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-... Kiran.\" he stammered out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Very tribal, warlike and very dangerous. The Salarians and Turians didn't inflict the genophage on them for nothing.\" Suki answered, before realizing her friends had no idea what the genophage, or Salarians even were. \"Though Grunt - is a special case, he was tank-bred to be the perfect Krogan. she added. \"Look we need to get off the ship and search the Citadel, since I've a feeling that's where we'll find the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\" Natalie nodded. \"But what about our 'duties' aboard ship?\" she then inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki shrugged. \"Kenneth has things covered down here.\" she said, referring to Gabriella's 'work buddy'. \"Oh yeah, should explain, I'm now Gabriella Daniels, an engineer, Natalie - you're Yeoman Kelly Chambers, kind of the Commander's personal assistant, and Nicola, well... you're the ships's doctor, Karin Chakwas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea how to treat people.

We taking her with us?\" Natalie asked. Her expression said everything. She wasn't keen on the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki thought about it, then decided not to take Kiran with them to the Citadel until she had calmed down. \"No, Laura and Nicola can keep her occupied here.\" she eventually decided, before going back over to explain the plan of action.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The game hadn't really gone into specifics of every single glowing light on the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan was simple. Suki figured she would start at the landmarks she remembered from the game and work her way down from there. Maybe afterwards, she'd probably try the stores, especially those that sold more combative stuff. Even though it seemed a likely spot for quite a few members of the crew, she wanted to look up the bars as only a last resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven she would admit, it was a flimsy plan, but it was the best she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...\" Suki muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki and Natalie had exited the Normandy, woven through security, and exited into the upper wards before she came to a terrible realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Citadel was... way bigger than it ever was in the game. That wasn't even doing it justice. Suki had been to a couple of metropolis' in her life; New Delhi, New York, and London; and this thing was comparable. More of, one \"arm\" of the citadel was comparable<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was also quick to realize that whatever Citadel they ventured through in the game was a very condensed version of the real one. That was not even getting into just how much more crowded it was, as Natalie and Suki had to go stand by a wall not to get carried off by the veritable sea of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Natalie stared up at the \"sky\", absolutely floored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least one of us is enjoying ourselves.</i> Suki rolled her eyes. Had she not been inhabiting a body that was not hers as well as searching for misplaced coworkers, she might have fancied walking into a real version of her video game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki shook her head. God, she really misjudged all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe assumed that timeline-wise, they were either somewhere towards the end of ME2, the in-between point between it and the next game, or in ME3.

More precisely Mona had caught <i>his</i> eye. And it only took a few seconds before the alien walked over to her. \"Well, well, well, Kasumi Goto here on the Citadel. You after pulling off a heist? With all the C-Sec guys around here, that'd be ballsy even for you.\" the Turian chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona winced. An unfortunate choice of words indeed given what Mona had discovered about Kasumi... or rather - herself. \"I'm sorry, do I know you?\" Mona responded with a sigh. She may have been in Kasumi's body, but that didn't mean she was a master thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say I'm hurt. You don't remember me - Lucibius? We did several heists together.\" the Turian 'tried' reminding Kasumi, without knowing of course that a hardware store worker from another reality was now occupying her/his body. Mona wasn't sure which gender she classified as now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona realized she had to improvise. \"Ahh, sorry, my memory sometimes fails me. Getting old I guess. So, how you doing?\" she asked the alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know, getting by. Haven't done a job in ages though. But with you here, I was hoping you had something lined up?\" the Turian mumbled, hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona shook her head. \"Not at the moment, but er... I'll get in touch if I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right then, see you soon I hope.\" came the reply from the Turian, who then walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks!\" Mona grumbled to herself. Here she was in the Mass Effect universe, a master thief who happened to also be a she-male. WTF! She couldn't make head nor tails out of what was happening. But what she had discovered was how to initiate the personal 'cloaking field' she had. And to avoid any more unwanted meetings with shifty characters, she glanced around before activating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, cool!\" she giggled. But then when she felt a certain 'tightness' in her pants again, the amusement wore off. I'm sure she wasn't a tranny in the game.\" Mona mumbled to herself as she set off scouring the area again. A passing Salarian looked around upon hearing a voice out of nowhere, thinking he was going mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona decided to head towards the nearest elevator and maybe go up a level of two, see if she recognized anyone else. But from the sheer size of the Citadel, she could search for months without finding anyone she knew by sight.

Well, normal if one discounted the Salarian manning the cash register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking around, with her being able to observe everyone, but no one able to do the same back to her was sort of exciting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a couple doors down was a jewelry shop.

A billboard flashed overhead. A human and an Asari dancer, both clad in bikinis resembling string, turned and shook their asses. Perhaps she should've expected it, Mass Effect was no stranger to tits and ass. On the other hand, her parents were quite conservative, and that part they instilled in her couldn't help but snarl in disgust. \"Over a hundred years and we still do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sex sells.\" \"Miranda\" said with a shrug. Maybe the billboard was a bit much, but Rob was no stranger to porn, business as usual. Or so he liked to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, maybe we just made a wrong turn, but we just need to-\" Rob trailed off. He could've sworn there was a landmark, a mail box a few meters behind him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spun around. Nope. Nothing. Nothing but a few more sets of billboards with moving images just as racy, four buildings, four avenues, and a crowd of gawking aliens. She spun in a circle until her eyes landed back on a pouting Mona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? How do we get out?\" Mona tapped her foot for emphasis. All she could do to distract herself. She just needed to keep her eyes off the sexy, sexy aliens and on Miranda's face-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona cursed in Farsi and turned her head down.

Truthfully, she remembered how stimulating being invisible was. Her cock and balls ached so much already. If she were to turn it on, she might just cream her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob bit his lips. The man-turned-woman wasn't without problems himself. His lady bits tingled something fierce and he felt a wetness in his panties.

No, thricefold, much much better than before. Jessica could only writhe on the ground and open her mouth and cry out. For a brief moment, she felt like the queen of the world and, at that moment, the pleasure crescendoed, and she felt a \"surging\" in her lower body.

It wasn't too hard for Shepard to get a few lays, such came with being a war hero with a pent up crew, but this particular girl did have her advantages. Maybe it was her massive cock and balls or the fact that she could orgasm nearly four times before she needed to rest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard prepared to straddle- <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Those few would've been just as quick to dismiss it. The Ashley Williams they knew was severe, dutiful. Not high pitched and bubbly like... whoever was hogging the unisex private room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right those few were.

This was... awesome! The only way Maddy could describe it. She took a moment to cup her boobs. Here she was, a smoking hot, busty celebrity in one of her favorite videogames. Another caper and she stopped infront of the toilet. And, what was more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a moment to cup her balls in her left hand. A cock, a pussy pleaser, a conqueror of holes. Something a man usually had but she had always coveted. It was big, it was there and, just seeing the stiff thing flop around, pleased her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her other hand and wrapped it around her cock.

Eventually, they managed to enter the backdoor of a nightclub and take refuge in a rather obscured, empty, and, unfortunately, dusty broom closet that, thankfully, locked from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they're gone.\" Rob whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scampering of feet outside told them that the answer was no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob felt his fists clench. If it had been the real Kazumi and Miranda, those gang of losers would be plastered all over the floor and that stupid frog would be fleeing for his life. Mona wouldn't be smooshed up against her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, something was prodding her right in the rear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that.\" Rob sharply whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cant help it.\" Mona growled back. \"This thing has a mind of its own.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a quieter area of the Citadel, close to some private rooms where 'meetings' sometimes took place. There was nothing special about the place as far as they could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... okay.\" Charlotte nodded at the Quarian. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade remained silent, just taking a seat. And Charlotte soon took her place next to her. Tali picked up a nearby <i>Citadel News</i> magazine to catch up on things while Charlotte and Jade chatted quietly. They looked like two nervous patients waiting to see a dentist or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But her legs bend the wrong way, that's weird.\" Jade whispered in her deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for Quarians, or Turians for that matter, now be quiet. She might hear you.\" Charlotte whispered back, as she felt her 'unique' ponytail. Another embarrassing 'throb' between her legs caused her to pull her legs together as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few seconds until Jade threw out another question. \"And why's she in a suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte sighed. \"Because they were kicked off their planet by robots that they created. Hundreds of years living in space has weakened their immune systems.\" Charlotte answered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, okay, I guess.\" Jade frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then they heard two voices nearby and a door leading from a private room opened up. \"I should have known that slippery bastard would have tried pulling a gun on us. He never was very bright.\" the male voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was ready for him.\" the woman responded. Charlotte immediately recognized both voices. \"No offence Zaeed, but I've learned not to trust <i>most</i> mercenaries.\" the woman then chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaeed and the iconic Commander Shepard walked into view. \"The way you put him down, that was goddamn priceless.\" Zaeed laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Shepard!\" Charlotte told Jade, a hint of excitement in her voice when they saw the attractive woman approaching. She had shoulder-length blonde hair and was dressed in a suit of mostly grey armor with <i>N7</i> emblazoned on the front. The Alliance's special forces' best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, gotcha.\" Jade responded, as Tali stood up to greet the commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Shepard saw 'Jack' and 'Jacob' sitting there, mouths agape, she frowned a little. \"And... where have you two been?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't admit it Shepard, but I think they were lost.\" Tali chimed in, her three-digit hands placed on her feminine hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Shepard chuckled, shaking her head in mock disapproval. \"I'd expect that from raw recruits on their first leave on the Citadel, but not two battle-hardened biotics.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biotics?\" Jade whispered to Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte rolled her eyes again. \"I'll explain later.\" she groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Shepard smiled, \"I've got an important announcement to make to the crew, including you two.\" she gestured. Tali, Zaeed, and then Charlotte and Jade all fell in behind the commander.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And because of her enviroment suit, neither Rob or Mona could tell if Tali was giving them a funny look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona strolled aboard the Normandy, and Rob admired Tali's curves from behind as she walked off before following Mona inside the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was there waiting for them in CIC (Combat Information Center). The commander was now out of her armor and was wearing an Alliance uniform, which was a portent of things to come. \"Not like you to disappear Miranda.\" Shepard commented, as she stepped down from the galaxy map. Rob's excitement could barely be contained as he watched Commander Shepard approach him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard then glanced at Mona, and smiled. \"I would say it's not like you to disappear Kasumi, but we both know that would be a lie.\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Rob to respond, and he only did so when Mona nudged him in the back. \"Er... sorry Shepard, we um... got waylaid.\" he muttered, Miranda's sexy voice again leaving his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you didn't get lost?\" Shepard's eyes narrowed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost?? No way.\" Rob scoffed, trying his best not to look stupid. \"Just sorting out some... stuff, you know... clandestine - stuff.\" he chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha!\" Shepard nodded. It was obvious she wasn't buying it, but she let it drop. \"Anyway, don't go far, I'll have something to say to the crew once Tali has rounded up the others.\" she informed Rob and Mona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Others?\" Mona inquired, her voice slightly groggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard nodded. \"Yeah, for some reason Kelly and Engineer Daniels have both left the ship.

But right now, I have to head down to the port cargo bay, Grunt is acting up again.\" she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Rob muttered, glancing to Mona, again sweeping his long black hair from his face. Sounded like they now had an idea where at least three more of their co-workers might be. \"All right Shepard, we'll be down in the Crew's Quarters.\" Rob said. Then he and Mona got in the elevator with their commander and they got off first, allowing Shepard to continue down to the Engineering Deck.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stay in character, make a callous remark about her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack's\" eyes narrowed. \"You're not Miranda, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob supposed he shouldn't have been surprised.

Jacob was stood with his hands on his hips, in a pose that was slightly more 'feminine' than usual.

For the most part, that plan had worked, although, it was Tali who did most of the searching for them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, right before they had woken up here, there were more people in that tea room. Steven, Luke, Liz, and \"Waggy\" for instance. Their work was not done and each one of them, even the ones who had played the games, had proven they couldn't even traverse the Citadel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, another question hung in the air. After everyone was reunited, what did they do next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, even if they knew their way around the galaxy, they were stuck with Shepard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Commander Shepard speaking.\" A familiar voice blared from the intercom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone tensed up; a few even jumped in surprise. Even Laura felt something akin to an electric shock run down her system. While she was essentially omnipresent as long as everyone was on the ship, she was too focused on the reunion. She hadn't exactly been paying attention to that room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets keep this short. We're breaking away from Cerberus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie turned to Suki, a tinge of worry entering her voice. \"Aren't we part of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine.\" Suki whispered back. \"She's not going to kick us off the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona's eyes widened a tinge. Now she knew without a doubt where in the Mass Effect series they were--right after 2. But, being one of the few who played Mass Effect 3 (the beginning of it at least), she knew that this did not happen exactly like this in the game...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Harbinger is coming and he won't be coming alone. He is a threat to everything--everyone. The Reapers must be stopped for the sake of every species in Citadel space. I promise you all, we will stop them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap!</i> Had Mona zoned out for what was probably an epic speech?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intercom cut off, leaving an awkward silence in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was the first to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...we're supposed to save the galaxy from this Harbinger and his Reapers?\" She asked in an oddly monotone voice. This was all so surreal to her. Just a few hours ago from her perspective, she was walking into Wilkos on a stormy day, ready to arrange boxes or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow... this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki looked back to Natalie. \"There are some... things I should probably tell you about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Suki began to regale Natalie about the Reapers and the various villains of the Mass Effect franchise. Eventually, Jade walked over to listen in and... while it was hard to tell Laura's expressions, since she was a ball of light, she also listened with a rapt attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rob found that he had a certain biological need. A cold pit of dread opened up in his stomach when he thought of it. He had been fearing it all this time, but he knew much better than to put off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a loud sigh and stomped off towards the women's restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte and Mona knew what was happening, but neither of them laughed. They could completely and totally sympathize with Rob's situation and they both privately feared when they would have to take their turn in the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them did, however, seem to notice just how long their eyes lingered on Rob's rear...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Shepard that Rob, Kiran, Mona, Charlotte, Nicola and Jade had met before seemed to be a more lighthearted person who was not afraid to joke around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was not the case this time. She looked a little haggard, but determined. Right now, she was the commander, and she meant business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, we're setting a course for an Alliance outpost on Mars.\" she said. \"Something big was discovered there, something that might help us win the upcoming war...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost everyone winced slightly at the last part. To hear about it was one thing, but to think they might actually need to get involved...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've received no reading for Mars. Expect things to get violent. I expect you all to be geared up and ready by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Shepard turned back towards the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda, if you would come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing that Rob wanted to hear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suppressed a sigh before following Shepard out the door and into towards the elevator. Zaeed muttered something under his breath before he walked back to his quarters, Garrus followed him in the same, vague direction. Tali went back towards the elevator as well, not really in the mood to socialize after having to hunt down three groups of people who had gotten lost. However, she threw a quick glance at Suki and Natalie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki seemed to get the message as she half dragged Natalie to the elevator. As far as their on-ship duties went, they would have to improvise. Still... that was infinitely better than what the others needed to do--catch lasers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're fucked.\" said Charlotte, as loud as she could without Garrus and Zaeed hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't worry.\" Kiran muttered, her deep voice sounding more than a little fearful. \"I'm sure we can pull... through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jade stepped up to Kiran. \"Shepard probably thinks all of us knows how to shoot like the pack of killers... and use 'biotics.' I don't even know what the second one is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that panic was quickly spreading across what would soon be the \"ground team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mission was about to become much more complicated than Shepard ever thought it was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked first at the collection of model ships in the glass cabinets, then at the fish tank, and he smiled at the sight of the ruined helmet that Shepard had worn when she was killed by the Collectors aboard the Normandy SR-1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, take a seat Miranda.\" Shepard mumbled politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, thanks.\" Rob smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard then poured them a drink and sat down on the couch next to him. \"Is... everything all right Miranda? You seem more than a little tense. And you don't exactly seem the type to get lost on the Citadel.\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob had an opportunity now to tell Shepard everything, but would she believe him? He decided against it, if only for the sole reason that Shepard had enough to deal with without learning that half her crew are imposters with no combat experience whatsoever. \"No, no I'm fine Shepard.\" he said, raising his glass and taking a sip of the drink he'd been handed, <i>Asari honey mead</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne swig was enough to make Rob cough violently. \"Wow... that's got a kick.\" Rob winced, his eyes watering. With each cough his large breasts jiggled on his chest, even though they were being 'contained' by his skin-tight uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard smiled broadly. \"Yeah, the Asari definitely know how to mix their drinks. Liara tought me that concoction back on Illium.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Rob forced a smile as he wiped a tear away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard then got back to trying to find out why Miranda was acting 'funny'. \"You heard anything from Oriana lately?\" she asked, referring to Miranda's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob knew this, so it wasn't hard for him to make something up. \"Not for a couple of weeks Shepard, but she's safe. Somewhere my father will never find her.\" he told the commander, as he set the rest of his beverage on the table. \"Look... you don't have to worry about me. We all have our off days. I'll be there for you when you need me Shepard.\" he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was very appreciative. \"Thanks Miranda, that means a lot to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob threw her a genuine smile. Then he put his hands on his knees, glanced down at his shapely form, and stood up, steadying himself in his heels. \"Now I'm going to make sure the rest of the crew is ready for what's coming.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard stood up too, finishing her drink as she did so. \"Okay, sounds good. Joker will alert us when we're approaching Mars.\" she said, then she escorted him out of her cabin. As he descended in the elevator Rob patted himself on the back. He'd handled that well, he thought. Now he just hoped he could be just as positive in his actions as he was with his words. For he knew he and the others would soon be tested in combat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something about how they were going to split into three groups. One lead by HIM of all people. Shepard and her group were going to land, Shepard's group would make a dash for the main cargo elevator, while Rob's group went for one of the side entrances. Garrus' group, meanwhile, would wait a bit before offloading far off on the other side of the outpost, where they would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob hadn't exactly heard that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did, however, hear the breakup of the groups.

Back when he was on earth, walking its surface would've been a dream come true. Not just for him, but also for much of humanity. Given the circumstances, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to suck.\" Rob muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks.\" muttered Luke in a voice that sounded like, disturbingly enough, his own mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he could really hear it over the gunshots, explosions, and the veritable stampede just outside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just stand there! Do something!\" His supervisor shouted at him, as \"she\" struggled under the weight of a large, metal table. Back when they had been workers at Wilkos, Liz never raised her voice. It was also a stern reproach, never a barked order. Her shouting like a drill sergeant showed just how dire their situation was and just how out of their elements they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all locked in what looked, humorously enough, like a classroom. It had a rows upon rows of desks and a television-like screen at the front. Just through the double doors out of the room were hundreds of storm trooper knock-offs, probably banging on the doors, if the sound outside were of any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA desk flew right past Luke's head, causing him to jump in surprise. It fell onto the large pile by the door that was their makeshift barricade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke, help Liz!\" Steven yelled as he lifted another desk with... some power that Luke was going to dub \"the force\" until further notice. \"I've got these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all of them stopped when they heard a rhythmic beeping sound on the other side of the door. A beeping sound that grew faster with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\" They all muttered in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the first time Luke had ever heard Liz swear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thing rolled underneath the legs of the Cerberus troopers... and boom. The blast sent armor-piercing shrapnel through the suits of the enemy, cutting them down, while Steven and Liz both ducked behind cover again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work!\" Steven complimented Luke with a nod, seeing the way was clear for the to make a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Luke replied, his voice also muffled by the helmet he had on, just like Liz. Steven, with a more simple breathing mask on, had a much clearer view of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them rushed to the blown open door and stepped over the blood-soaked Cerberus bodies. When one grabbed Luke's ankle, he instinctively aimed his weapon down and fired a round point blank into the trooper, finishing him off. \"Holy shit!\" Luke gasped, his heart rate jumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, don't stop!\" Steven said to his two co-workers, leading them down several hallways.

It now menacingly towered over the furthest wall on the base<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit.\" Charlotte grumbled. After being around three really hot ladies (and one handsome man), she was feeling really, really pent up, and that completely soured her mood. However, her discomfort was mitigated somewhat now that they had their environmental suits back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group had tried to follow the signs in order to get to the tram and, hopefully, meet up with Shepard. However, one of the hallways was blocked off by a large pile of rubble. No one had any idea of how it could've gotten there, but explosives were the likely culprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, they had to take the alternate route: smash a window and walk along the roof. They all stood on the top of one of the taller buildings, gazing down at the rest of the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the archives, right?\" Liz said as she pointed at a large rectangular building with a glass tube running through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it should be...\" Steven blanched a bit as he followed Liz's arm. He had no idea they were that close...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, we don't even need to go to the tram.\" He pointed at a window of one of the buildings that jutted right out of their building and the archive building. \"All we need to do is jump down the side, and enter through that window over there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven trailed off when he heard the sound of glass shattering below them. A figure leapt up from right below them, and landed in the middle of their group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a couple moments, the group and the dark haired woman stared at each other in a shocked silence. The dark-haired woman probably didn't expect to meet this many people up on the roof. As for everyone else, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman wasn't wearing any kind of protective suit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired woman recovered first. She threw a haymaker right into Liz's stomach, followed by a powerful uppercut to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh...\" Liz crumpled over and began to slide off the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz!\" Steven screamed, calling upon a forcefield of biotics, causing Liz to slowly float upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on instinct, Kiran charged the dark haired woman, head lowered slightly. However, the dark haired woman, just ducked under the blow before fleeing down the side of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! She's fast!\" Rob yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After her!\" Charlotte sprang after the dark-haired woman, followed closely by Luke and Rob. Steven and Kiran, however, stayed behind to pull Liz over the edge...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But return fire soon necessitated a duck for cover. \"Kasumi, see if you can flank them, Garrus, Zaeed - lay down cover fire, and Jacob - on my six, protect me and Tali with a barrier.\" Shepard ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger that Shepard!\" Garrus nodded, as he commenced putting high velocity, armor-piercing rounds through the Cerberus 'fodder'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this.\" Tali said in an enthusiatic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too goddamn right.\" Zaeed yelled, throwing a grenade and firing his assault weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah, o-okay.\" Jade muttered nervously, trying to control her breathing. Mona gave her a pat on the back and smiled, then activated her cloak again and went to flank the enemy once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Can this get anymore intense?</i> Jade asked herself as she managed to put up a sufficient biotic barrier that protected her, Shepard and Tali from enemy gunfire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How?\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....\" Steven sighed. He was really bad at this. But luckily for him, his bashfulness, and his nervousness, only made him look 'cuter' in Shepard's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you loved seeing me in action.\" Shepard smirked, admiring the familiar Asari maiden stood in front of her. \"Or was that just in bed?\" she winked, moving towards Steven, who was frozen to the spot. He backed up against the pillar and his feelings were definitely mixed when Shepard planted a kiss on his lips.

Soon, such emotional support also became a physical support as they leaned on each other, and eventually, they were full on embracing, lips locked in a rather amateurish kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all been through a haze of lust that they had gotten to this point, neither Rob nor Charlotte could really say how they had. However, Rob suspected that it started around the time that Charlotte complimented him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When did I become so sentimental?</i> Rob thought. He blamed his new female hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they broke the kiss and pulled back, stopping inches from each other's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad.\" Charlotte said with a mischievous grin. Even she would admit, she was not the best judge of that, though. Being a virgin, this was really her first time at kissing and, in most circles, that kiss would've been merely known as a \"peck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" Rob grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually broke eye contact and leaned back in their chairs. Charlotte never imagined that her first kiss would be with a woman. This seemed to be more in her friend, Maddy's, field. <i>How was she doing, anyways?</i> Charlotte thought, a little wistfully. Maddy may have been annoying, but she was still Charlotte's friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Charlotte only dwelled on that thought for a moment before she returned to the present. Being so close to Rob and kissing he- <i>him</i> made her erect cock twitch and ache. No, that did not do the sensation justice. It felt like her penis would split in half were she not to do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte was not alone at all when it came to arousal. Rob, for his part, had noticed that the room temperature had seemed to shoot up by a couple degrees and he was breathing much faster than he normally did. Not to mention, the slight dampness in his... underclothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Charlotte?\" Rob asked. \"Have you ever... you know, done 'it' before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Charlotte snorted. Well, she may have shoved something up her vagina (oh, how she missed 'her') on a couple occasions, but since those were either her fingers or inanimate objects, she doubted they counted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes two of us then.\" Rob chuckled, his eyes slowly panning over to the restroom at the tram station.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After kissing Rob again and brushing his long black hair out of his face, she drew back slightly and looked downwards. \"Rob... you know in the game, um... Jack was always so aggressive...\" she started to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... just slightly, yeah.\" Rob chuckled. \"Psychopath more like. You're a vast improvement on the original.\" he complimented her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte paued, then let out a sigh. \"Well there might have been a reason actually.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...?\" Rob's interest was peaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte decided it would be better to be blunt, and hope this didn't put Rob off liking her (in that way). \"Well... I have a penis! And god is it HARD!\" Charlotte emphasized the last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Rob's eyebrows arched in surprise, and he glanced down at Charlotte's crotch. There was no sign of a bulge, but then again there wasn't any sign of one on Mona either. <i>Two trannies??</i> Rob thought. He'd thought there was something a little 'off' about Jack's and Kasumi's characters every time he played the game, but this... Not that it mattered, after all, he had a vagina now. Him and Charlotte were compatible, sexually. And the very fact that his crotch was tingling pleasantly at the thought of being penetrated by a penis... told him that he (Miranda) was definitely bisexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob??\" Charlotte waved her hand in front of his face, snapping him out of his trance. How could he zone out while she was telling him about her 'secret'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry.\" Rob apologized. Then he looked at Charlotte's groin again. \"I can't tell.\" he smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're okay with this?\" Charlotte asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob glanced around a moment, then leaned in to Charlotte. \"Well, Mona has one too, so you're not on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte paused again, feeling her cock throb once more. \"I'm about ready to explode.\" she mumbled. \"I wish we were back on the Normandy already. But instead.... this fucking storm.\" she sighed, glancing at the dust clouds outside. \"That is - if you would want to... you know...\" she added - in hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob smiled at her, holding her hands. \"I think judging from how wet I am down there,\" (Rob's eyes gestured downwards to his own crotch), \"this body would love to be in bed with you.\" he whispered in Miranda's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, that's... such a relief, thank you.\" Charlotte burst out laughing. They then shared another kiss...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One amateurish strip tease later, they stood across from each other, completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the eagerness from before soon gave way to awkwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What now?\" Rob muttered, his hands hovering over his vagina, unconsciously trying to protect his modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... um...\" Charlotte muttered, an luminescent blush across her face. One arm wrapped over her breasts, the other did its best to hide her twitching penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was really starting to have second thoughts about penetration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering she was a girl before now, and fantasized about it one day happening to her... It had never really occurred to her that suddenly, she was essentially the \"man.\" Not to mention... What if she knocked up Rob? God! She would die from humiliation! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, she considered calling it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, another powerful ache ran through her shaft, one that seemed to run through her entire body.

Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Charlotte pantomimed rubbing a tube. \"Maybe we could just hand job each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob frowned slightly. It was more than a little humiliating that he had to handle a cock, despite the fact that he had been proudly male until today. However, this seemed a good compromise.

He rolled his eyes when Charlotte wasn't looking. <i>I can do this.</i> Thankfully, Miranda's hormones were helping him along. He cozied up alongside Charlotte and looked at the intricate tattoos that adorned her tranny body. Her breasts were only small, but then that was understandable. 'Jack' had probably taken female hormones in this reality in order to make himself more feminine. But there was nothing feminine about the erect 'pole' standing proudly from Charlotte's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding thinking about it for too long would be a mistake, Rob reached forward and wrapped his feminine hand around Charlotte's penis. Charlotte gasped loudly and jumped a little at the touch, partly because Rob's hands were cold. But also - because it felt so good. \"Oooh...\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob smirked a little at Charlotte's reaction. And at the same time he ahd to wonder how they could go from having a pitched battle to - <i>this</i> - in such a short time. Not that he was complaining. This was preferable to dodging bullets and laser shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving done it to himself lots of times before, Rob had no trouble giving Charlotte an experienced handjob. And since it was Charlotte's first - it didn't take long for her to blow her load. She let out a bit of a girlish squeal as she and Rob watched the semen erupt from Charlotte's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enjoy that?\" Rob asked with a grin, as he withdrew his hand, shaking some cum off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had calmed down enough, Charlotte looked at Rob in a glaze. \"Doesn't last long, but - wow!! Is it always that intense?\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much.\" Rob nodded, remembering back to when he had a penis, which wasn't that long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her own sexual desire sated, at least for now, Charlotte eagerly eyed up Rob's neatly trimmed pussy, and she grinned at him. \"Now it's time for me to show you just how good a demale orgasm is.\" she winked at him, reaching towards him with one of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh boy!</i> Rob thought, as he braced himself for what was sure to be an experience like no other...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steven was another 'virgin' who now had 'naughty' thoughts constantly on his mind (<i>okay so that wasn't new</i>).

Jade had reacted surprisingly well to Mona's news about her penis. In a way it only turned Jade on more. They had spent a good 10 minutes making out and fondling each other in a secluded area, and Mona had made an amusing use of her cloaking device, much to Jade's mild 'irritation'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Rob and Charlotte are...?\" Jade mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" Charlotte nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, just within ear shot, Kiran was grinning to herself.

A mysterious blast of energy that came out of nowhere and encompassed the entire tea room in the Wilko store one Thursday afternoon. The eight staff in the tea room didn't have time to react... even say anything before everything went black. One of the staff was Liz, the store supervisor, and the others were Steven, Charlotte, Josh, Luke, Laura, Kiran and Jessica. None of them could have know it was coming, or from that moment on... they would be living a wild, dangerous adventure in a video game world - turned harsh reality. And that the fabric of their very being, and their sanity would soon be tested...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's eyes flicked open slowly as a slight gasp escaped his lips as he laid there, regaining his senses. His head was thumping and his entire body felt numb, and as the feeling slowly began returning to his limbs. He wiggled his toes, immediately noticing they didn't have as much room to move as usual. His trousers felt strangely 'snug' against his legs and there was a peculiar... <i>'empty'</i> feeling between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steven began moving his arms, he noticed the bright colors of the odd tunic-like garment he wore. The lower sleeves were a dark red, the upper sleeves and the high collar of the tunic were a turquoise blue, and the main body of the garment was a yellowish-gold on top and white underneath. But it wasn't the tunic that Steven was soon staring at... but rather the two ample breasts contained within. \"Fuck!\" He exclaimed, immediately and clumsily scrambling backwards up against a wall. As he did so he saw the tight grey leggings that encased his legs and the mostly turquoise high heeled ankle boots he had on his feet. And he also felt large earrings gently hitting his cheeks and a necklace shift around his neck as he moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, shit... shit!!\" Steven said... only then realizing his feminine voice, thick with a strong Americanized accent. \"No, no... this is a fucking dream, I know it!\" Steven said, as several strands of red hair fell in front of his eyes. He reached up to touch the hair, and in turn noticed his long fingernails and slender hands. \"I'm a fucking woman!\" Steven whispered, trying his best to calm down as he looked around the room he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat realization then caused Steven to slowly stand up (while still leaning against the wall) and look down at his crotch, which was hidden beneath the hem of the feminine tunic he now wore. He hesitantly moved his right hand to his groin... and then in order to confirm what he already knew... he touched the area where his penis and testicles should have been. They were gone... His hand recoiled immediately in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, yeah, this is... there's a perfectly normal explanation for this, and it's around here somewhere.\" Steven chuckled, clearly in a state of shock and trying to find logic where there was none. As he started pacing the room, taking deep breaths, he felt his new breasts jiggle slightly with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked down at himself again, his hands finding their way around and behind onto his shapely backside, he frowned intently. The clothes he had on... hell even the sexy body he now wore... seemed very familiar. However, in his current state, he was having trouble remembering where he had seen these clothes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned on his heels again and started walking in the opposite direction... he thought he saw someone entering the room with him. His eyes shot in that direction only to see a mirror hung on the wall. And in it... he caught sight of his reflection: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/vL4Mz2h.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/vL4Mz2h.png</a> <i>Ooh fuck!! I'm... Triss Merigold??</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven tried to wrap his head around this whole thing as he continued staring at the mirror. He'd played <i>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i> often enough to recognize the stunning, red haired sorceress and former lover of Geralt of Rivia. \"How the fuck can I be Triss?\" Steven asked out loud, as he reached up to fumble with his annoying earrings, trying to remove them. Eventually he succeeded, and the two pieces of jewelry were tossed onto a nearby dresser. That done, Steven's feminine hands then crept their way up to his torso and came to rest on his new breasts, giving them a gentle squeeze. \"Wow!\" Steven gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced back up in the direction of the mirror and his expression of shock was replaced by wonder... even a little excitement. He didn't know what had happened, or what he was going to do next. But here he was, literally in the shoes of a beautiful woman and former member of the Lodge of Sorceresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy!\" Steven exclaimed, sounding like Dr. Samuel Beckett.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But unlike Steven she felt completely lost, nothing was familiar, especially the body she now inhabited. She had luxurious dark hair cascading around her shoulders, she had a voluptuous body... simply stunning, and her breasts - while smaller - were firmer. <i>What in the world...</i> Liz muttered in what was now a very posh English accent instead of usual Yorkshire slang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was attired in elegant black and white clothes, along with high heeled boots that extended up to her knees, hugging her shapely legs. There was a definite scent of lilac and gooseberries on her person, though she didn't know exactly what perfume she had on. Liz recovered for a moment, then managed to climb to her feet, steadying herself in her unfamiliar heels before peering into a nearby mirror. A stunning, raven-haired woman was staring back at her, looking dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell am I? WHO am I?\" She asked, looking around at the ornate room she was in, obviously a private quarters, but obviously not 21st century. The only light source in the room was candles, and from the look of the decor... she guessed it was the type seen in the Middle Ages or thereabouts, though only in wealthy houses or palaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz held her aching head for a moment, then walked towards the large door at the other side of the room. She pulled the door as hard as she could and it swang on its hinges, creaking as it did so. She saw another large room, filled with tables and book shelves, dimly lit by candles, and nearby... another door. Pushing that door open too, she found herself outside... in some sort of courtyard. There were a number of people around, all of them wearing odd clothing, like they were in some sort of play or pantomine. Liz's confusement increased ten fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head to her left and then right, she noticed the two guards at either side of the door she had exited, fully clad in plate armor and each grasping a halberd firmly in their hands. And the weapons certainly looked real enough to Liz. She began to wonder... what if she wasn't in the present day anymore? <i>No... don't be ridiculous...</i> She thought, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to explore further, not knowing that she was now in the Royal Palace, in the city of Vizima, capital of Nilfgard-occupied Temeria. And not far from where she was... was Emperor Emhyr Var Emries, ruler of the Nilfgardian Empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being a fan of video games, Liz did not know that she now inhabited the body of Yennefer of Vengerberg. a powerful Sorceress and the true love of the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Confusement reigned, as it had with Liz and even more so with Steven. Swinging her legs off the bed she was on, Nataie couldn't help but notice the multi-colored dress she had on, extremely low-cut, it exposed a significent portion of her cleavage. <i>Wow, what's this....</i> Natalie gasped, reaching up to her chest and in so doing also noticed the long crimson red gloves she had on her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde hair hung around her shoulders only perplexed her further, since she was a brunette, with only the tips of her hair highlighted blonde. \"Okay WHAT is going on here?\" She said, standing up, noticing also that she was barefoot. Her voice sounded very different, most notably the accent, upper-class English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked around the small wooden building she was in, which held basic amenities. But in one corner there was a trap door leading to a cellar and elsewhere a skull ornament that had a faint glow.  This in particular caught Natalie's attention, and she walked over to it. Briefly glancing down at herself again, she knew she wasn't in her body, since it was much too... svelte. Her own wasn't chubby or anything, but compared to the one she had now... it was 'average'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pausing for a moment, Natalie placed a hand on the skull on the shelf nearby... and suddenly a blast of wind occurred and her hair was blown back, causing her to turn to the left and see some sort of portal open up. It was a swirling mass of black with a red glowing edge. <i>Holy shit!!</i> Natalie exclaimed in her new voice, stepping back from the sight in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would find out, in time, that she now inhabited the body of Keira Metz, a powerful sorceress and former member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. And she would have to get used to living in an entirely different and dangerous new world.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fiery red hair immediately fell, framing her face and she plucked at several strands wondering who would have bothered dyeing her hair? But that was a trivial matter compared to where Rebekah now appeared to be... in a jail cell of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone room where she was located was dimly lit, adorned with wooden furniture such as chairs and a single table. Several torch sconces were what provided the only light in the room.  In the cell next to Rebekah was another woman, dressed in rags and obviously deceased. The odour that permeated Rebekah's nostrils almost caused her to vomit. She frowned intently and covered her mouth in shock and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she noticed the manacles around her wrists. They weren't connected for some reason, but were reasonably heavy. Rebekah frowned, inspecting them for a few moments, then she switched her attention to the rest of her person. It was instantly obvious to someone as observant as Rebekah when she looked down that it wasn't her body or clothes she now wore, which also explained the hair color. She had cuts, grazes and bruises all over her torso and arms, even her legs and she could feel several sore areas on her face too. \"Where am I? What is this?\" She whimpered, her voice now having a 'posher' accent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgetting who you are now bitch?\" A gruff, Cockney sounding voice suddenly spoke up, startling Rebekah. She watched as a man, a guard she assumed, approached her cell, chuckling menacingly. He was wearing some kind of plate armor, and to call him 'unwashed' would have been an understatement. \"I suppose all that attention the captain has given you has started affecting that memory of yours eh?\" The man grinned, obviously feeling over-confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... tell me what's going on? Why am I here?\" Rebekah said, as she tried to get to her feet, only to find herself sapped of the strength to do so. She collapsed back down when she made the attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're here because you're a sorceress cunt, and Radovid don't like your sort, and neither do I.\" The guard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sorceress??</i> Rebekah thought, wincing as she felt another wave of pain grip her voluptuous (and beaten) new body. <i>What the hell is happening?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guard walked off back to his seat to continue drinking, Rebekah was at a loss over what to do next. She had no idea where she was, or even 'when' it was. There was no sign of the modern civilization she was used to. Had she time traveled? She had so many questions racing through her head, but the pain she was in kept her distracted from asking them all. Not that she had any of the answers anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah was in a bind for sure, now that she occupied the body of Margarita Laux-Antille, a former member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, and the former Headmistress of the magic academy of Aretusa on the isle of Thanedd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would find this out in due course.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He recognized the entire ensemble as something that someone from the 17th century would have been wearing. He felt like... well... a tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was his surroundings, some kind of tabard or tavern, which a couple of 'working girls' flirting with nearby patrons. The whole place definitely had a Middle Ages vibe. Rob of course, after waking up, thought he was in some kind of historical re-inactment. But the more people he talked to, the more real it all seemed. It wasn't until he stepped outside the tavern into the crowded streets of Novigrad that he realized that wherever he was... it was real. He was shocked when he saw a nearby man-at-arms run a beggar-thief through with his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Rob cowered in the tavern (The Rosemary &amp; Thyme) again, before fleeing up the nearby stairs. To say he was panicking would have been an understatement. And he became totally confused when he caught sight of his reflection in a mirror. He'd seen the man reflected back before, somewhere. And he eventually remembered it had been on an advertisement for a video game, an RPG. But it wasn't one that he had played himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was that Rob was now in the body of Dandelion, the Bard and good friend of Geralt of Rivia.

But like Steven, he at least had a notion of where he was. And more importantly... WHO he was. He was dressed neck to toe in some kind of armor, Wolf armor to be precise. It took him a moment to recognize the armor but he eventually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore telling was his now long, white hair tied back and the two swords on his back, one steel to fight humans, and one silver to fight monsters with. \"Holy fuck!\" Luke gasped in Geralt's familiar monotone voice. He reached behind him and unsheathed the silver sword, merveling at the runes etched into the blade, it was really quite beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put the sword away mutant!\" A gruff, cockney sounding voice suddenly said behind him. Luke turned around to see three Redanian soldiers stood there, a corporal and two subordinates. They were staring at him coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, er... force of habit.\" Luke chuckled nervously, not smiling at all as he returned his sword to its sheath (after several attempts).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then watched as the guards strode past him, one of them deliberately nudging him hard in the chest. Luke breathed a sigh of relief, then looked around at the great city of Novigrad. It was clear he was somehow in the world of The Witcher 3, and it was equally clear that he was in Geralt of Rivia's body. He was a 'mutant', a 'freak' as ordinary people liked to call him. A man who had undergone countless mutations in order to turn him into a monster killer. As fearsome as Witchers were though, they were slowly dying out. No more were being put through the inhumane trials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the history of Witchers didn't interest Luke right now. He just wanted to know why he'd been transported here, and why? And if he was here, were any of his friends here too? He had to know, he had to find out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was in the land of Toussaint, a land that was almost straight out of a fairy tale, but without the well-known personalities like Jack, or Snow White etc. This land, althought beautiful, hid many horrors, as Jessica would soon discover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was for the future. Right now, she was too preoccupied with what she was wearing, an elegant short-sleeved gown not unlike those worn by noble women in past centuries. Jessica, being one for fashion and beautiful clothing, liked her new dress. But the question remained in her head... \"Where am I?\" She asked, caressing her tight bodice underneath her gown as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong Your Grace?\" A young woman nearby suddenly asked Jessica, drawing her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA witty one, Jessica saw this as an opportunity to get some answers. \"Humor me, where am I? And who am I?\" She asked straight, eliciting a rather puzzled frown from the young woman in front of her, who was a handmaiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... you are Your Royal Highness the Duchess of Toussaint, and you are in your Kingdom, m'lady.\" The woman replied dutifully, curtseying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, of course I am.\" Jessica frowned herself, looking down at herself again. She was astute enough to know she was no longer in her own body anymore, as she could also tell because of her voice. And she reasoned (correctly) that she must have now been in some world from a TV historical drama or a video game maybe. She wasn't a fan of such games, but she'd seen her male friends playing them a few times, including Steven, from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to be alone.\" Jessica told the young women around her, who all curtsied and left the room slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica then stared in awe at the magnificent decor of the large chamber she was in, obviously part of a much larger grand palace. If she wanted answers, she knew she might have to go far to find them. Which she was prepared to do, but it would be no small undertaking. She suspected (also correctly) that several of her friends might be in this new world too, and if so... she had to find them. She figured they would need each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaintaining her calm demeanor, Jessica sat down and let out a deep breath, still looking around at everything that was now hers. She inspected her hands and then set about inspecting her new body too, which was wonderfully svelte, attractive and very sexy. Shame she was wearing so many layers of clothing really. But to Jessica, being in such a land as Toussaint was like a dream come true. She had always been a romantic type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to figure this out.\" Jessica told herself, steeling her resolve.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With each step he made his chunky heeled ankle boots clonked on the hard cobbles of the city streets. He also winced, continually adjusting his new breasts and grumbling to himself in his sexy Americanized accent. He knew practically everything about the world of the Witcher III, including that the Novigrad city guard would arrest him and torture him if they knew who he was... or rather whose body he was now inhabiting. Sorceresses were at the top of Caleb Menge's list of Wanted 'fugitives'. Menge was the scarred, heartless commander of the Witch Hunters in Novigrad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on here? Why am I in Triss' body?\" Steven asked himself, as he slowly made his way through some back alleys, paying careful attention to everyone he walked past. He paid particular attention to the many limbless army veterans begging for coin, but he stayed away from them all the same. Steven didn't know where to even start getting the answers he needed, as to why he was here, trapped in an unfamiliar body in an unfamiliar city. The whole thing was made more difficult for him because he was now a woman, and a hot woman at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he peered into the main square in the center of Novigrad, he could see two pyres burning, with a scorched body attached to each. He swallowed hard, knowing that would be his fate if he was caught. He immediately started thinking about how he would defend himself in case anyone tried to capture of kill him. He raised one of his mancured hands and studied it for a moment, wondering if he had Triss' magical talent as well as her body. He got his answer after a minute or so staring at his hand when a fireball appeared in his palm. Jumping in surprise, he shook his hand as if to put it out.. and thankfully the fireball dispersed. \"Holy shit!\" He gasped, quickly looking around. Luckily nobody had seen what had just happened. \"Best not do that again unless I have to.\" Steven told himself, before again peering up and past his hood into the main square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was he going to do next? Steven didn't have a clue....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He seemed to be looking in wonder at his surroundings, as though they were new to him. This made Steven think immediately that maybe it was someone else, one of his friends maybe, who was in the same situation as him. Glancing first left then right, Steven walked out into the open and into the square, hoping his somewhat colorful outfit wouldn't attract too much attention, as well as the clonking of his ankle boots on the cobbled ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip past several Witch Hunters proved daunting, and Steven could only hope none of them suspected who he was... or at least recognized the identity of the body he now inhabited. Thankfully, Steven made it to Geralt without incident, tapping on his armor-clad shoulder. \"Geralt!\" He said softly in his feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gravelly-voiced witcher spun around as though in shock, which Steven knew was out of character for him. \"T-Triss...?\" Geralt replied, stepping back and taking a moment to take in Steven's mouth-watering curves under his sorceress garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven cut straight to it. \"Geralt... are you feeling alright?\" He asked, skipping any greeting. And the fact that Geralt didn't act more pleased to see him, made Steven suspect even more that it wasn't actually \"Geralt\" he was talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... w-what do you mean Triss?\" The witcher answered, shrugging his shoulders like a sulky teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven waited until a Redanian guard had walked past, then resumed the conversation in a quieter tone. \"I said are you alright? Are you... YOU?\" He emphasized, pointing at Geralt before putting his manicured hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\" Geralt just murmured, unsure what to say now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven rolled his eyes and took Geralt by the hand, literally dragging him towards a nearby alleyway, next to the Golden Sturgeon Inn. Steven then pushed Geralt up against a wall and repeated his earlier question. \"Are you... really Geralt? Answer me!\" Steven snapped this time, getting impatient. But even as he asked questions of Geralt, Steven had to admit the witcher looked... handsome. The way the armor hugged his masculine form.... wait... <b><i><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif\"><span class=\"chotpink\"><i>\"Stop it!\"</i></span></span></i></b> Steven told himself, shaking his head slightly as he waited for Geralt to answer him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Steven got his reply. \"No I'm not, why?\" \"Geralt\" said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm not Triss either. I'm... um... I'm Steven.\" He revealed to the witcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven?? Holy fuck dude, its me, Luke. You're... wow!! You're Triss Merigold!\" Luke gasped in shock, surveying Steven's new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven didn't appreciate the leering. \"Yes I am, apparently, and unless you want a fireball up your ass, stop looking at me like that.\" He barked, sounding quite intimidating even with Triss' melodic voice. He had to concentrate not to admire Luke's new body himself, cursing the female hormones now controlling him somewhat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, and okay. Now um... what the fuck happened to us? Why are we here? In these bodies?\" Luke asked, gesturing down to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven shrugged, sighing deeply as he folded his arms under his breasts. \"I don't know,\" he said, peering past the end of his hood, \"but we have to find out. And we have to find out if anyone else ended up like us.\" He continued.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And from the documents scattered around her countryside 'hideout', she also found out that she had fled from soldiers under the command of King Radovid, sovereign of a realm called Redania who had decided to slaughter eveyone who dabbled in magic. That in turn made Natalie wonder if she had retained all of Keira's magic abilities when she was transported into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter using the smooth skull on the nearby mantlepiece to open up some kind of portal, Natalie had bucked up the courage to step through it and into a... beautiful little garden of sorts, with flowers, animals and a small structure with a warm pool of water to bathe in. This was undoubtedly Keira's 'safe place'. \"Right, so if I concentrate... \" Natalie mumbled, sitting on the stone steps and holding her hand up in front of her. A quick focus was all that was needed to create a 'ball' of electric (or shock) energy. She then hurled it at a nearby tree and blasted a piece of bark off it. \"Holy shit!\" Natalie gasped, not quite believing that magic was now real or that she could wield it so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if any of her friends had been transported into this strange world too, and if they had, then she had to find them ASAP. \"But where do I start?\" She asked herself in her now refined English accent. Glancing back at the portal gate, she rubbed her chin in wonder. She could probably open up a manual portal perhaps? And use it to take her to those closest to her, meaning her friends? She knew it was a risk, using these magic skills, but Natalie knew also that she had little choice. She had no idea what this land was, but she already knew she was in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that can wait a bit.\" Natalie suddenly said, smirking as she stood up and walked up the steps to the welcoming bath of hot water. \"I could use a bathe I think.\" She told herself, needing little convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started stripping out of her sorceress garb, and while doing so inspected her much more shapelier, sexy body. It was perfect.... and having such a gorgeous body was the one thing in this new world that she was sure she loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie let out a contented moan as she slipped her svelte body under the water, and her worries... at least for now... drifted away to the back of her mind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whoever is Dandelion now, well... basically a ponce am I right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't even know if one of our friends IS Dandelion yet, but we need to check.\" Steven said, ignoring the 'sexy' comment from Luke. \"Follow!\" He then gestured, walking off briskly back into Novigrad's main square, his heels clonking on the cobbled ground. Luke just smirked slightly, admiring Steven's new ass as he passed, then he followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you afraid of being captured and tortured at any minute Steven?\" Luke asked, as he noticed the dirty looks he himself was getting from the Novigrad locals and the Redanian soldiers/Witcher Hunters. He followed Steven into another alleyway on the way to Dandelion's Inn, and was surprised when Steven turned around and struck a feminine pose... briefly conjuring a fireball in his palm. \"Woah... I see you've got a handle on Triss' magic.\" Luke said, wild-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can defend myself,\" Steven said, \"and I'd like to see how you do with those swords actually. See if there's a hint of the real Geralt in there somewhere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do feel... stronger, faster...\" Luke mumbled, cracking his neck and flexing his arm muscles under his armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're the Six Million Dollar Man. Come on lets keep moving.\" Steven joked, smirking as he resumed walking.

She was getting quite adept at casting magic spells and illusions thanks to the many books laid about and of course Keira's inherent magical talents. \"A big strong, dark-haired man.\" Natalie smirked, after chanting the Elven words to a Conjuring spell. It was a simple one, that created a 'golem' of a muscular man in his 20's, Natalie's dream guy. It wasn't a real person since the spell was a simple one, but Natalie was nonetheless impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly occurred to her that she could probably teleport herself to her friends using another portal that she could conjure herself. The alternative was staying in this run-down thatch roof hut doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the golem before her disappeared, Natalie took a deep breath and started reading into a magic book further, in particular the section on portals and how to open them safely. As she thought, portals could be opened and used to teleport the caster where they wanted to go, or near to someone they wanted to see. In Natalie's case it would be the latter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the book down, Natalie decided to try and find her friends, or even to try and send herself back home. She chose the former, since if there was one thing Natalie hated, it was being on her own, especially when lost in a world he didn't know or didn't understand fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me to Liz.\" Natalie called out, outstretching her arms then spreading them apart... creating a portal. Staring into the blackness of the portal with its glowing edge, Natalie closed her eyes, put her hand to her chest and stepped through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEn-route to Novigrad, Liz, in Yennefer's body, was surrounded by her armed guard when she noticed a strange wind suddenly kick up in a field off to her right, immediately followed by the opening of some kind of portal. When a blonde haired, attractive woman in a dress stepped through, the armed Nilgardians drew their swords and started taking up defensive positions. \"Hold!\" Their commander said, before then glancing at 'Yennefer'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie looked shocked to suddenly be facing several heavily armed men in full plate armor on horseback. She gulped hard and stepped back, as the Nilfgardian detachment commander moved his horse forward. \"Hold Sorceress! What is your business?\" He called out, in broken English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I'm trying to find a friend, er... any friend... would be nice.\" Natalie answered back, sweeping her hair behind her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" Liz called out in Yennefer's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie decided to use her actual name instead of Keira's. \"I'm Natalie.\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's beautiful new eyes widened in surprise, then she leapt down off her horse and started walking forward in her high heeled boots. Once she was out of earshot of the Nilfgardians, she spoke up quietly. \"Natalie? Its me... Liz.\" She smiled nervously, glancing back to make sure she had not been heard. Natalie almost burst into tears and the two women embraced each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nilfgardians looked at each other, and a couple of them shared a dirty grin, chuntering in their native tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you're safe Natalie. And if you're here too, then there must be more of us here too. We have to find them.\" Liz mumbled. She then turned to the Nilfgardian commander. \"She's coming with us to Novigrad.\" She said, eliciting a nod from the soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at Liz, Natalie then shared a horse with her former boss and the group continued on it's way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He briefly adjusted his breasts in his tight fitting top and then pushed the door open to the Inn, revealing a barely occupied room. There were a couple of scantily clad women, including an Elf, and a man behind the bar cleaning some glasses with his cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You here for some fun Whitey?\" One of the women immediately started flirting with Luke, referring to Geralt's white hair. \"Your lady friend can be involved too is she likes.\" The woman then giggled, gesturing over to the hooded female figure that was Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven pulled down his hood, revealing his bright red hair which was tied back in two tidy buns. He gave the flirty woman a certain stare, and it was as though she knew who Steven was (a powerful Sorceress). \"We're fine, thank you.

This time a famiilar voice answered. \"Er... who is it?\" Dandelion called through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends.\" Steven said, after he and Luke had shared a hopeful glance.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jessica then got to her feet, pacing in her modest heels, while looking down at her long, flowing, intricate gown. She had no clue what was going off, where she was, and how she got here, but she was here, and she intended to deal with it and find her answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Highness!\" The well armored 'knight' bowed as he presented himself before whom he thought was his Duchess.

Rob!\" The badly dressed minstrel replied, making no attempt to hide his real identity, mainly because he didn't really know much about the world or the body he now inhabited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nice one, someone else we've found.\" Luke breathed a sigh of relief, stepping into the room further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Rob, the sight of a white haired, cat-eyed man in heavy armor and wielding two swords on his back was quite intimidating. But this feeling of fear was somewhat offset by the feeling of attraction he felt whenever he looked at the hot redhead also standing before him. Rob's eyes worked their way over Triss's shapely figure, without knowing it was actually one of his friends inside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyes up here Rob.\" Steven sighed, clicking his fingers and pointing to his beautiful new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Rob just mumbled, drawing his eyes up to the face of the 'woman' talking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Steven you're gawking at.\" Luke said, in Geralt's familiar emotionless tone.

Not that I'm bothered about that last one.\" Rob threw a plethora of questions at Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven rolled his eyes. \"We're as much in the dark as you are. We know nothing. But incase you need help identifying our location, its the world of Witcher 3; The Wild Hunt, a video game. And we're some of the characters.\" Steven explained in length. \"I'm Triss Merigold, Luke is Geralt of Rivia, the main character, and you are... um... Dandelion.\" He continued, pretty much correctly assuming that Rob would hate his new name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm named after a flower?\" Rob grumbled. \"Mind you,\" He then muttered, glancing down at himself, \"dressed like this I'm not surprised to be honest. What the hell am I wearing?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ridiculous outfit.\" Luke answered honestly. \"Love your tights though.\" He smirked, which <b><i>was</i></b> uncharacteristic of Geralt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the time for jokes.\" Rob scolded Luke. \"And what the hell are we going to do now? How we going to get back home?\" He inquired impatiently, pacing the room and rubbing his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven had already formulated a rough plan. \"We find other main characters and find out if any of our other friends are in their bodies. Then once we've gathered everyone we can, we try and find a way back home. I mean, in this world magic is real, so there must be a way.\" Steven said, holding his hand out and conjuring a fireball in it to prove his point.

Liam had a vague idea where he was, at least what world he was in, being a casual gamer. But he was still in unfamiliar surroundings, he had dimeritium shackles on his wrists, several heavily armed and armored soldiers around him, and worst of all... he was trapped in a woman's body. It wasn't until Liam was led into the Emperor's quarters that Liam knew what world he was in. He recognized the Nilfgardian banners hung in the room, and the man before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why you're here Fringilla?\" The emperor spoke up, wasting no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam looked down at his generous cleavage and the revealing dress he had on, and he had to resist the urge to grab his tits and squeeze them. Being in a woman's body was just so damn weird and distracting. At least he now knew who he was too. He was in the world of the Witcher III, and he was somehow inhabiting the body of Fringilla Vigo, one of the former members of the Lodge of Sorceresses. Quite a step up from the slacker he was in Wilkos, back in his own reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving not got a reply, the emperor scowled a little, then dismissed the soldiers. He waited until they were out of the room, then spoke up again, addressing who he thought was Fringilla, one of his Nilfgardian subjects... and currently a prisoner for dissent. \"I would advise you not to ignore me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam looked up, cleared his throat and frowned at the sound of his feminine tone. \"S--sorry, um... no, I have no idea.\" He eventually squeaked in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I believe you do. My daughter, Cirilla has returned, and I want her found. I have hired the Witcher known as White Wolf to find her, but I sense he will need help. You are to find your sisters from the Lodge and assist Geralt however you can.

It's good to see common sense is prevailing for once, given your past outbursts and misdeeds.\" Emyr nodded, remaining emotionally cold as always. \"I dispatched Yennefer to Novigrad some time ago, and my soldiers have sent back word that Keira Metz is now with her too. But there are still sorceresses out there, most notably Philippa Eilhart, Triss Merigold, and Margarita Laux Antille. At least one of them may be a captive of Radovid. Since there are reports that this 'Wild Hunt' is pursuing my daughter, you will need all the assistance you can muster. Now go, my men will remove your shackles.\" Emyr explained, then dismissing Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam let out a deep sigh, and once more looked down in disbelief at his sexy female form, before turning and walking out of the room, where a Nilfgardian blacksmith and several guards were waiting to remove his shackles. <i>What the hell has happened?</i> Liam shook his head in utter bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed answers and fast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had stopped crying at this point, but now she was just sat there, silent, being watched occasionally by the two guards who were in the dimly lit room with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly looked up when the large door to the room creaked open and in walked another two men, including the prison warden. He was a stocky built man in plate armor and a scar on his face. A feeling of dread immediately overcame Rebekah as she sat there, peering up through the bars of her cell. The two new arrivals stopped in front of the door to the cell, and the warden soon spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll ask again bitch. WHERE... is Philippa Eilhart?\" The warden asked in a gruff, cockney voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I d-don't know w-who that is. Please... just... let me out.\" Rebekah pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards burst out laughing, but then the warden stopped laughing just as quickly. \"You telling me you don't know the whore sorceress whose lodge you used to belong to? Do you take me for an idiot? Now tell me where the bitch is, or I'll beat it out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah was silent for a moment, then she shook her head and started crying again. \"I'm telling you, I d-don't know her, I don't even k-know where I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're exactly where we want you, cunt, and you will tell us what we want to know. Just tell the guards when your little bout of convenient amnesia clears up heh?\" The warden chuckled, before he left the room again, leaving Rebekah more despondent than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed a way out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why?\" Liz responded in Yennefer's voice, managing to turn her own horse around as Natalie held onto her waist behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier pointed to the river up the winding road up ahead. \"You should know.

She was going to ask them which way they should go, but decided against it. Liz knew she and Natalie would have to learn to adapt to this new world, since they were stuck in it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After being 'abandoned' by their Nilfgardian escorts, Liz and Natalie now found themselves in a predicament. They apparently needed to get across the Pontar river, which was not that far in front of them, out of direct eyesight, but still close. Considering some of the creatures they had seen along the way as they traveled north, neither of them wanted to swim in the deeper water or even wade through the swampy areas. Not to mention the fact that Liz didn't want to ruin the exquisite outfit she had on. In that respect at least, she and Yenn had a lot in common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what?\" Natalie questioned, hands on hips and sounding very much like the original Keira Metz in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz gave her friend a glare, then with tongue in cheek, shrugged her velvet-draped shoulders. \"I suppose we find a spot where we can cross. There's got to be a bridge somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, with guards apparently. These 'Redanians' that guy was on about.\" Natalie emphasized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz puckered her lips and set off walking, the heels of her boots clicking on the crude path they were on. Natalie followed, barefoot of course, as Keira always was. \"Well we have to get across one way or another.\" Liz mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes walking later, the two women-turned-sorceresses got to within sight of the river, a bridge was off to the right in the distance and they could see torches and a line of peasants/refugees waiting to escape Velen. But their observation was interrupted by the appearance of three men behind them, wielding an assortment of weapons. \"Well, well, what do we 'ave here, two rich bitches ripe for the taking.\" The man in the middle, who looked very scruffy and had a large scar on his face, said to Liz and Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd advise against it.\" Natalie spoke up immediately, startling Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Get 'em boys!\" The man grunted, his lip curling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie stepped forward and raised her hands, as Liz stepped back... in shock. A miniature tornado suddenly appeared out of nowhere, enveloped the three bandits and lifted them clear up off the ground, spinning them around. As they screamed in terror, Liz put her hand to her mouth as she observed Natalie's handiwork. Natalie then abruptly spread her arms apart further and her three 'victims' were flung in random directions at high velocity, one of them hitting a tree and having his back snapped by the impact. The other two were just as dead when they hit the ground, and Natalie just let out a oddly contented sigh as she turned to face Liz with a cheeky smile. \"Even though I don't know this world or who we are, these powers are the most AMAZING thing, don't you agree?\" She chuckled to a speechless Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh... y-you k-killed them...\" Liz eventually muttered, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were going to kill us. We have to defend ourselves, and luckily we have the means to do so.\" Natalie responded, hands on hips again. \"Now I'm sure you have got some incredible powers too, you just have to work up the courage to use them, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded slightly, rubbing her forehead with her gloved hand. \"Well, I'll um... cross that bridge when I come to it.\" She muttered. \"No pun intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Natalie gestured north with her hand, getting her former supervisor to follow her. As she turned away from Liz however, Natalie's confidence disappeared when she realized what she'd just done. Even for her, this 'killing' business would take some getting used to.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With ease, Natalie opened up a portal, and her two friends stepped back in amazement. It was only a short portal, that took her over the other side of the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, easy as that.\" Natalie called out, a smug look on her (formerly Keira's) face. \"I'm pretty sure we're all in the bodies of witches or sorceresses, so you two should have that power too.\" She shouted across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I remember about this game, we are sorceresses, but how the hell do we...\" Liam called back in his female voice, while running his slender fingers through his dark pixie cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Concentrate, and think where you want to end up, it's that easy.\" Natalie answered, hands on hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz glanced back at Liam, then sighed before raising her arms and closing her eyes. With her long, dark tresses blowing in the wind, she then made a swift downward motion with both arms... and as she did so the magical energy left her finger tips and opened up a portal exactly the same to Natalie's moments ago. Natalie's blonde, shoulder length hair whipped around violently as the other side of the portal opened near to her. Then Liz came stepping through, a look of astonishment on her face. Natalie could tell she was also proud of what she had just done. \"Holy shit!\" Liz blurted out, in Yenn's posh English accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you.\" Natalie giggled. \"We have all sorts of power.\" She continued, holding up her hand and conjuring a ball of some sort of shock energy for a second, before allowing it to disperse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should use it wisely, I mean... it's dangerous.\" Liz warned her friend and 'employee'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's okay.\" Natalie nodded, even as Liam managed to open his own portal. Though it did take him a few minutes to achieve this feat. \"Hard to focus?\" Natalie joked, looking over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's all new to me, okay. Give me a fucking break.\" He cussed in Fringilla's sexy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's keep moving, if we're going to find this Cirilla, or whoever it is.\" Liz said. \"And hopefully in Novigrad we'll find some more of our friends. I doubt there's just us trapped in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" Natalie agreed, and Liam just let out a sigh, gazing down again at his female form. True he was hot, but he would much rather have been having sex with a hot woman tham actually be in her body. The three co-workers continued on their way north, towards Novigrad, leaving the river behind them and taking a scenic route to avoid Redanian patrols and encampments.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the monster in front of them growled out loud, pushing it's snout skywards, Luke and Steven both looked at each other for a second, before taking action. Steven started hurling fireballs from his manicured hands... landing successive hits on the beast, setting fire to it's fur and causing it to recoil in initial pain. It then charged at Steven, causing him to open a portal and quickly step through, appearing behind the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the burning beast turned around, Luke lunged forward and delivered a precise blow from his silver sword across the creature's left hind leg, quickly following up with another slash across it's rear before pirouhetting out of the way of a poorly aimed swipe of the Fiend's front right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was ongoing, Rob had taken refuge behind a large, hollowed out tree that had been felled some dozens of years ago, and he watched in a mixture of amazement and shock as his two friends took on this behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fiend charged at Luke again, only to have him hurl a Samum bomb at it, which caused temporary blindness. Running as fast as Geralt's legs would carry him, Luke then slid underneath the Fiend and delivered a powerful slash down it's abdomen... spilling it's guts onto the ground. This happened consecutively with Steven continuously using Triss's offensive magic to wear it down. After hurling several more fireballs, Steven put both his feminine hands together and conjured up an arc of lightning which struck the mortally wounded beast and knocked it down. A dying gasp escaped the creature's bloodied mouth as it's fur continued to smoulder, it's internal organs releasing a slight cloud of steam as they lay on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was bracing!\" Steven muttered, stepping over several broken tree branches in his heeled boots as he approached Luke, who was re-sheathing his sword. Steven exhaled deeply, licking his lips as he pushed a rogue strand of red hair from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defintely. Shame it didn't know how outmatched it was.\" Luke mumbled, speaking in Geralt's usual calm, emotionless tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob suddenly popped his head up again, staring at the fallen beast. \"That was... wow!\" He gulped, removing his bard's hat and slowly walking up to his friends, who stood looking over their dead adversary.\"Um.. good work!\" He complimented them, chuckling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Luke replied, tilting his head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we should keep moving. That little battle might have gotten someone's attention.\" Steven said in Triss's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed!\" Luke nodded, following Steven and taking another admiring look at his voluptuous backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob stared at the Fiend for a moment longer, before rushing to catch up with 'Triss' and 'Geralt'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rob brought up the rear, scrambling to catch up with his apparently more confident and dignified co-workers, his foppish attire doing nothing to help him seem more assured. Luke seemed capable enough, the powerful, assured, and manly gait of Geralt growing on him with every step. He smirked a little as he watched Steven's new, delightfully taught little tush sway back and forth before him. Frustrated but determined, Steven blew a strand of crimson hair out of his eyes as he continued to guide them toward he knew not what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they took care of the Fiend I flushed toward them with no real effort.

Added to her misery was the constant taunting from the two guards in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she was about to close her eyes again and lay on the cold, hard floor with her hands over her ears, a loud noise and a sudden wind picked up in the room... throwing objects all over the place. Rebekah looked up to see some kind of black, gold-rimmed portal open up... and a rather voluptuous looking woman in a low-cut dress and wearing a blind fold stepped through it. \"Been looking for me you miserable wretches?\" The woman asked the guards, who had scrambled to grab their swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of the woman's right hand threw both guards back against the wall, then with her left hand she made a grasping motion... closing both mens' windpipes and suffocating them. As both men fell dead, Rebekah let out a loud gasp, which drew the woman's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rita!!\" The woman exclaimed, walking towards Rebekah, who was shocked at the obvious power this woman had as the portal closed up behind her. The woman's blindfold didn't seem to inhibit her at all. \"Are you all right? As soon as I found out what these bastards had done to you and your girls at the college, I made efforts to track you down.\" The woman said to Rebekah, her tone sounding as cold as the floor Rebekah was laid on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... um... who are you?\" Rebekah asked the obvious question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I?\" The woman scoffed, now sounding insulted. \"Don't tell me you have amnesia!\" She stated, putting her manicured hands firmly on her curvy hips. \"I don't need you being as gormless as Triss's pet witcher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah held her head for a moment, then looked up again. \"I have no idea where I am, who you are and... who's body I'm in right now.\" She told the strange woman in a frantic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blindfolded woman paused for a moment, her mind ticking over. \"Hmm, I've knowledge of body swapping spells, but I haven't used one myself for decades. Are you telling me you're not Rita?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!! Whoever Rita is.\" Rebekah said tearfully. \"Last thing I remember I was with my friends at work, doing my job...\" Rebekah continued, explaining everything to the woman as she used a fire bolt from her finger to melt the lock on the cell. During the conversation, the strange woman also identified herself to Rebekah as Philippa Eilhart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're from another... world? Or rather another reality? One where magic doesn't exist? Sounds positively dull I have to say!\" Philippa sneered, as she removed Rebekah's shackles. She was amazed that inside the body of one of the most powerful, beautiful sorceresses... was a 20-year old girl with no knowledge of the world she now found herself in. \"What about religion? Do you have that in your reality?\" Philippa inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, yes. It causes so much problems.\" Rebekah said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, some things stay in the same in any reality it would seem.\" Philippa nodded, not surprised. \"Anyway, let's get you out of here before more of Radovid's thugs arrive.\" She said. quickly turning and opening another portal behind her. \"We're going back to my hideout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Radovid?\" Rebekah asked, as Philippa helped her up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bastard king who gouged out my eyes!\" Philippa answered. \"I'll tell you everything, don't worry, and you can tell me about these friends of yours.\" She reassured Rebekah, just before taking her through the portal and to the underground cavern where she had her hideout. Philippa's mind was already plotting. She knew there was a possibility that Rebekah's friends were also somewhere around, and maybe in the bodies of the other sorceresses, or other people. And if she could find them... and train/manipulate them, reconvening the Lodge of Sorceresses and gaining new allies could be easier than she ever thought possible.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have no idea if we're heading toward any of the other Wilkos refugees. Hell, we don't even know if any of them have found themselves stranded here as well!\" Now Rob was joining in, all while looking around nervously, terrified that they might run into another monstrosity like the Fiend Steven and Luke had dispatched, but also a little afraid they'd bump into someone who'd openly mock his ridiculously foppish ensemble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven continued on his course, marching with an angry, almost stomping cadence as he scissored his lovely new legs back and forth, the tight, supple feel of his leggings hugging every nook and cranny, reminding him that he was in a smooth, lovely body that wasn't his own. Every motion, every sway, felt totally foreign, but also more than a little pleasurable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConflicted, afraid that admitting he was enjoying some of what he was experiencing would distract him from keeping his friends safe, and getting them all home, frustration and anger bubbled up within him. Having to contend with all of that AND, his two friends questioning what he felt was the only sensible course of action was too much for him to keep bottled up. He finally snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomping both of his chunky heeled ankle boots into the soil beneath him, he balled his fists, furrowed his brow, and closed his eyes before spitting out, \"I've played a LOT more of this game than either of you. I know this world. I know this is the best shot we have.\" he said through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback by Triss/Steven's fiery anger, and remembering his newfound ability to hurl flippin' fireballs, Rob went silent and took a step or two back. \"Look, I-I'm not making any demands or anything...it's just none of this makes sense and I'm hoping that talking about what we're planning or doing will help something...ANYTHING make sense. Let's not argue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke/Geralt held his open hands and spoke to Steven/Triss, who's back was still facing towards him. \"The Dandy's right...\" &lt;Rob managed to let out a pitifully exasperated \"Hey!\" before Luke continued, \"There's no need to get pissed off Steven. We're just discussing things. We're all for following your lead, we're just trying to get a handle on your plan.\" Conciliatory and Geralt's low, masculine voice didn't seem complimentary, but somehow Luke made it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's slender new shoulders, clad in Triss's adventuring togs, slunk a little as he calmed down. \"I know you blokes don't mean anything, but trust me, I KNOW we're on the right path. I'm sorry I snapped. My blood's still up after we sliced and barbecued that Fiend, and you just don't know how every waking moment I'm this...this...woman...feels so...feels so...\" Steven looked down at his delightfully displayed new cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercome with sympathy for his friend who was obviously being pushed to the brink emotionally, and, possibly with a little bit of Geralt's affections and feeling of protectiveness towards the lovely Triss intruding upon his own thought processes, Luke rushed toward the woman in front of him, intending to put a comforting hand on his slender new shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same moment, his anger fading, Steven turned around, eager to give his mates a smile and reassure them that they were right to put their trust in him and that no permanent damage had been done to their fellowship, spun around on his boot heels, stepping toward his friends, his shoulders and head held high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Steven, both now moving much too quickly in the same direction, practically collided. Triss's bouncing, perky tits ran smack dab into Geralt's leather and armor ensconced, chiseled, intimidating chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few seconds were utter turmoil. Luke's Geralt visage looked uncharacteristically shocked, his eyes wide with surprise, his mouth agape. For his part, Steven's delicate, beautiful features looked just as aghast, his new green eyes just as wide, his cheeks flashing a bright crimson that was almost as vibrant as his new crown of gorgeous red hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke held his hands up, trying to protest, sputtering as his mind whirled and he tried to come up with the words to explain that their impact was NOT what he had in mind. Steven was equally panicked, trying to put some distance between him and his now-towering above him friend, only managing to lose his balance between the elevated heels of his new footwear and the strange new center of gravity he had to contend with between his protruding breasts, and equally showy fanny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Steven/Triss was about to tumble onto her backside, Luke Geralt reached out and caught her/him, keeping his smaller companion upright by grabbing his small shoulders with his large, powerful hands and drawing him up and toward him with his exceptionally muscled arms. The unintended consequence of this gallant rescue attempt was the two friends finding themselves in a full-on embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I'm sorry, I didn't...whoa...\" Luke babbled in a manner very much unlike the Witcher, while his gaze was pulled from looking into Steven's lovely new eyes by some unseen, tractor-beam like force downward, until he was taking in a bird's eye view of Triss's bosom, pulled tight against his massive chest. Still steadying Steven, he drew his smaller form closer, as his left hand went behind his body and inadvertently found itself gripping his wide, but pleasantly tight little tush...a tush he'd been admiring during their entire walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's heart skipped a beat. He was still aghast, but he felt something else. He felt so small, so tiny, so fragile in Geralt's embrace. He knew he should be disgusted, but a big part of him felt secure, comfortable, and protected. The musky, leathery smell of Luke's new body was surprisingly pleasant, as was the feel of his massive hands on his soft, quivering body. Luke's protests went quiet, as he continued to pull Steven closer. Steven's tits were squeezed betwixt them even tighter, he could feel his thighs and new womanhood make contact with Geralt's lower body. Steven trembled, and felt a eerie, inner tingling and pleasure as Luke's new manhood pushed against the prison of Geralt's trousers toward Triss's femininity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...I'm pretty sure Wilkos has a rule or 3 against fraternization and displays of affection, doesn't it guys?\" Rob coked his head and looked at the hugging pair in awkward disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to snap the pair out of their pleasure funk. Luke let go of Steven so forcefully he practically pushed him away. For his part, Steven did his best to catch his breath, put some distance between Triss and Geralt's bodies as possible, and regain his composure. \"Ughh...yeah...that was...that was...nothing. Shit...we've wasted too much time with this nonsense! We have to keep moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically sprinting on his heeled boots, Steven continued marching forward, so fast that Rob and Luke had to jog to catch up. Rob came up close to Luke and whispered. \"Well that was weird. For what it's worth, I don't blame you, Steve's fucking gorgeous now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounding more like Geralt, gave Rob/Dandelion a surprisingly potent backhand smack and barked \"Shut up!\" in a husky, muffled tone. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her day had settled into 'routine' actions for a Duchess, including hearing the case of a man accused of causing damage to a vineyard. \"Was anyone hurt?\" Jessica asked in her new, accented voice as she relaxed on her throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your Grace, but the accused did set afire a field, causing significent damage, and distress to the victim of course.\" One of Jessica's guards responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see!\" Jessica mumbled, idly supporting her tilted head with her right hand fingers. She knew that this was a serious offense in this world, whatever world it was, and she also knew that 21st century leniency would no doubt look weak. However, she also didn't want to punish the man too severely. He looked apologetic, and he also looked like he didn't have much to his name. He was disheveled, not very clean. \"Imprison him for five days, then put him under guard and make him work for the victim until he has helped repair the damage he caused. And do NOT mistreat him!\" She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your Grace.\" The soldier bowed, before removing the defendent, who actually looked relieved that he hadn't received a heavier sentence from the Duchess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, Jessica got to her feet, wincing slightly as she placed her hand on her stomach. <i>Damn corset!</i> She thought, stepping forward in her heeled footwear as her long, heavy gown swished around her hidden, shapely legs. Automatically, the three handmaidens Jessica now had around her at all times leapt up and followed their mistress. Each of these young ladies was very pretty in her own right. \"M'lady?\" One of the maidens, Vivienne, called out meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!?\" Jessica answered, turning confidently and acting extremely regal without trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... this way... to your quarters, m'lady.\" Vivienne whispered, so the nearby guards didn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Yes!\" Jessica cleared her throat, slightly embarrassed as she nodded her head. She'd been in her lavish quarters once, but had forgotten the way already. Not surprising given her emotional state. \"Thank you.\" Jessica muttered, before fixating her eyes towards the room exit and walking briskly, her handmaidens following closely, giggling amongst themselves a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the privacy of her quarters, Jessica's handmaidens loosened up a little again. Apparently, the Duchess allowed them some freedom of behavior when not in court. And Jessica was too happy to continue this trend. \"There's been another body found, m'lady.\" The dark haired handmaiden, Lucille, spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another?\" Jessica mumbled, turning to look at her. \"I see!\" She solemnly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you send for the witcher m'lady?\" Vivienne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gave a slight nod. \"Yes. But I fear it will be some time before he arrives.\"  Even as she chatted with her female companions, Jessica's mind was racing with thoughts. She felt lost, yet... she maintained her composure as best she could. She knew she could be in a worst predicament, much worse, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... Beast, it terrifies me.\" The third girl Beatrice, also a blonde with her hair up in a bun, muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica kept up her strong outer facade. \"Everything will be fine my dear.\" She said to Beatrice. \"Now... will one of you please loosen this infernal corset before I pass out.\" She grumbled, holding her stomach again and frowning as she exhaled deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls rushed over to assist their Duchess, without knowing who they were actually conversing with now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebekah stared in disbelief at the image she saw reflected in the mirror before her. Instead of herself, she was looking into the disbelieving eyes of a slightly older, MUCH more beautiful woman. Granted, she looked a bit grimy and disheveled after her brief stay in that horrible, medieval, dungeon-like prison, but even despite all of that it was clear that she was now in the body of a woman who had super-model or movie-star good looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared in utter shock at her new self. She still had blonde hair, but it was far fuller and more luxuriant, though she thought it could use a good combing out. She felt a bit taller, and DEFINITELY had a more impressive figure. While she was sure her original body had it's fans, this one had curves for days. Oddly, the one thing that REALLY drove home that she wasn't herself was when she cracked a grin in order to look at her teeth. Seeing her gap replaced by a row of practically perfect pearly white teeth made any notion that she wasn't in someone else's body flee her thoughts immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, in a torch-lit, stone-tiled and pillared room, surrounded by bookcases filled to the brim with tomes and tables full of strange occult devices and lab equipment Philippa rifled through various scrolls and texts. The odd, but undeniably sexy and self-assured blinded sorceress had rescued Rebekah from that awful, what had she called it? Oxenfurt Prison. She had conjured up a strange black, eerily glowing portal and led Rebekah through it to this very room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a few body-swap spells, incantations, and complicated rituals listed in some of my library, but I can't find any mention of body-swaps conducted between other worlds or planes. It's entirely possible we're dealing with something entirely out of the experience of any prior mages or their lore. It's very exciting!\" Philippa stood up and scratched her chin thoughtfully, smiling as she considered the ramifications of stumbling upon something so powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exciting?!?! Exciting?!?!\" Rebekah was suddenly beside herself. \"Well I'm glad you're so bloody pleased with this...this...utter nonsense! But I didn't ask for any of this and don't find it \"thrilling\" in any way! How are you even reading that stuff with no bloody eyes!?!?\" tears were welling up in her, formerly 'Rita's stunning blue eyes. The shock, bewilderment, and overwhelming disorientation of finding herself A) trapped in a body not her own, B) being transported to a weird, medieval fantasy world, and C) being shackled and abused in a wretched prison over the past few hours combined to bring Rebekah to the breaking point. It was a LOT for the 20 year old from England to grapple with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippa gathered up her dress, adjusting her bodice and shifting her heaving and prominently displayed cleavage as she crossed the room toward the now crying Rebekah. Philippa smiled at Rebekah in a way meant to convey sympathy and reassurance. \"Oh my child, I'm so very sorry! I got caught up in scholarly excitement!\" Beneath her gown, her high heeled shoes clicked on the surface of the chiseled stonework in the cave she'd transported them to. Reaching Rebekah, she took her in her arms and gave her a warm, comforting hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir large breasts pressed against each other, Philippa smiled as she looked into Rebekah's, formerly Margarita's eyes with eyes she no longer had. \"Margarita is a dear, dear friend. And you are an innocent, a victim of circumstances who doesn't deserve any of this. I promise you that I will do everything in my power to return Margarita to her body, and you to your home where you belong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah sniffled as she started to regain her composure. \"Thank you. Thank you for that, and for getting me out of that gross prison place.\" She broke their embrace and looked at her new visage in the mirror once more. \"I wonder if the others are in this place too, and if they're in other people's bodies? I was in the tea-room at work with Liz, Steven, Luke, Natalie, Liam, Kiran, Jessica, and Rob when that creepy light brought me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippa looked to be deep in thought for a moment. \"It's entirely possible. In fact, it's probably likely. My guess is, judging by the fact that your mind and soul were deposited in such a prominent and powerful resident of my own world, that they're in persons of importance as well. Perhaps even our fellow Lodge of Sorceresses very bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lodge of Sorceresses?\" Rebekah asked skeptically, still looking at an image not her own in the mirror, feeling her new, grade-A tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A powerful, benevolent association of good and wise magic-using women like you, or until recently Rita, and myself. Between that, and the fact that you probably share a connection with the people who you journeyed here with we may be able to track them all down.\" Philippa walked over to a table and began looking though another stack of scrolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?! That'd be great! I really hope they're all okay if they're all here too!\" Rebekah was actually beginning to feel a little hopeful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get to work immediately on ascertaining how to track them down my dear.\" Philippa set her scroll down. \"But first, we'd best do something about those rags your in, and your mildly disheveled appearance.\" Philippa walked over to a shelf and picked up a strange, richly carved hand mirror. \"We don't want to invite any of your enemies to guess that you're not actually Rita, and potential easy pickings, AND, I'm sure you'd feel more comfortable in more befitting garb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippa whispered something under her breath whilst causing one of her index fingers to glow a bit. Angling the hand mirror, she caused the reflected glowing light to fall upon a nervous Rebekah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt small, powerful, though surprisingly gentle glowing tornado of air and light erupted around her, startling her. As it gained in intensity, her long blond hair was primped and primed to look it's best, even as any grime, bruises, or filth was removed from her being. In the next instant, her tattered rags turned to ash, flakes like dried fall leaves on the wind being flung from her body and into the whirlwind as it flung them upward into non-existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah reflexively covered her gorgeous, very naked new body with her hands as best she could. \"What in the bloody...\" she managed to screech, even as Philippa smiled with a mischievous, slightly lustful grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah wasn't in the buff for long. First, a pair of elegant, intricately decorated ankle boots sprung into existence, locking onto her feet as their height caused Rebekah to stumble forward a bit. Next, a pair of equally ornate lacy, light green stockings began to knit themselves up her legs wrapping her lovely new calves, cute little knees, and enticing thighs in a tight embrace. She could feel tight, structured undergarments lift, separate, and put her gorgeous new tits and ass on display. Finally, a darker green, flowing, and richly made and structured dress wove over her remarkable new form, it's hem almost reaching the floor, a pair of slits showing off her stocking clad legs, it's cut showing her cleavage off to best effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah turned around and stared in wonder at her reflection in the mirror. She had already known her borrowed body was beautiful before, but fully done up, and dressed in such fine raiment, she looked like a gorgeous goddess! \"Jesus...I could be a pop-star...\" she marveled, running a manicured hand across one of her stocking-clad thighs while cupping one of her delightful new breasts with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic and beauty go hand in hand, little one.\" Philippa licked her lips as she seemingly gazed at Rebekah checking out her borrowed Margarita body. She smiled as she considered the possibilities. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiran let out a prolonged, deep sigh as she sat her unfamiliar, shapely body down in a simple, wooden chair that creaked as she lowered herself down in it. She rested her gloved hands on the equally creaky table in front of her and interlocked her fingers, wondering just what to do next. Her time in the village sauna had definitely helped with some of her aches and pains, but her mental anguish remained. She had no idea where she was... and maybe even 'when' she was. It looked like she had traveled back in time, but she couldn't be sure. The whole thing sounded ludicrous. And yet, here she was. And the villagers all had a deep accent that sounded Irish, so until she found out anything more, she was assuming that's where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, Kiran lowered her head and took in her appearance once more. She'd redressed her oh so sexy form in the same worn clothes she'd been wearing before hopping in the sauna. She wore a cotton cream shirt with several rips in it, a dark brown bodice/corset and belt tight around her lithe waist, even darker brown gloves and tight leather pants, and also a pair of light brown, knee high boots with block heels. Several strands of ashen hair hung down in front of her vision as she then glanced over at the single sword lying nearby, obviously her property, since she'd had it on her back earlier. Who was she now? Why have such a weapon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was beginning to drift on into a daydream, the door of the hut opened and in walked Skjall, the brother of Astrid, who was still in the sauna with her mother. Kiran turned her head quickly and leapt to her feet and initially went for her sword, without really knowing why she would react in such a threatening manner. She stopped herself however... and frowned, as Skjall looked shocked. \"Woah there, it's only me lass, I brought you some food. Don't want you starving now do we, hey?\" He said, lifting his arm in a calming manner while holding a bowl of food in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I j--just... you startled me.\" Kiran apologized, flicking the rogue strands of hair from her face. She then placed both hands on her lower back and had a slight stretch, moving her hands down onto her taut, feminine backside. She observed Skjall placing her food on the table, then smiling at her in a nervous manner, unable to stop his eyes from roaming over the delicious body Kiran now inhabited. Kiran wasn't dense, and she could tell a crush when she saw one. She just gave him a smile back, before sitting back down. She didn't have the heart to tell the man that she had no such sexual feelings for him. In fact, as she briefly thought about her past boyfriends, back home, she felt nothing towards them either anymore. She shrugged, thinking nothing of it, given her current emotional state. Just as she had tried ignoring the fleeting glances she had thrown in Astrid's direction back in the sauna upon seeing the naked young islander. The sauna had felt more steamy than it maybe should have been for Kiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she had little appetite, Kiran thought it best to eat something, to satiate her stomach. And so she set about eating, as Skjall left the hut once more, closing the door behind him. <i>I can't stay here. I need to leave. Maybe the others from work are here somewhere, I have to find them.</i> Kiran told herself in her head, as she ate her simple meal. She knew however, she would have to rest first, she was exhausted, or rather... the body she was in now was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, her meal finished, Kiran sat back in her chair, hearing the occasional gust of wind rattling the door of the hut behind her. She removed the long glove off her left arm and slowly reached up to caress the scar on her left cheek.  A scar that did nothing to subtract from her attractiveness in her new body. And one thing Kiran did like about her new body, was how much taller she was. She estimated about 5'6\", compared to her own, former 5'0\". Her boots gave her an added boost as well. Sighing again, she put her glove back on and the yawned, keenly eyeing the bed in the corner of the small room. She stood up and maneuvered her svelte body over to it, slumping down and lifting her legs up onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared up at the worn, wooden ceiling for some time, before her stunning, emerald-green eyes slowly closed, and she managed to fall asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Granted they only had what Liz had picked up in conversation and what little Liam remembered from the few times he'd played the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz-come Yennefer and Natalie-now-Keira were in the lead. The pair chatted nervously, trying to make small talk in an effort to not think about their shared worries about their friends and themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging a little back from the pair, taking a far more leisurely pace, Liam found himself looking over his traveling companions. He still couldn't believe that the two stunningly beautiful women were his co-workers Liz and Natalie. Their nervous banter certainly sounded like conversations he'd overheard at work (usually while he was laying about doing nothing else), but they were undeniably, physically, completely different people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was a pretty enough bird back home, but her new body was a mouthwateringly gorgeous blonde the likes of which Liam had only seen in pictures. Lifting the hem of her elaborate, multi-colored gown in order to step over some branches and rocks, Liam couldn't help but admire her glorious booty straining against the fabric. As she stepped over, twisting her upper body, Liam couldn't help but smile as he watched her big new boobs bounce within her bodice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hot as Natalie now looked in this Keira's body, Liam thought Liz had REALLY hit the sexiness jackpot with her borrowed body. As she continued walking with Nat-Keira, Liam admired her from afar. Pulling some of her long, dark, lustrous hair back behind an ear, she smiled and chatted away happily with her companion, allowing Liam to admire her flawless profile. Her tailored, elaborate, black and white outfit did a fabulous job of showing off her perfectly proportioned womanly curves, as she strolled along in her ridiculously sexy tall leather high heeled boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam smiled as he cast a lustful gaze on them, but that smile turned to a frown as he regained a bit of his wits. While he was definitely getting turned-on looking at the new Liz and Natalie, his arousal felt very wrong...very alien. He should be getting hard! He should be feeling his dick priming up to take a dive into some prime pussy! Not feeling the strange, tingling, wet, warm excitement of a pussy himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped for a moment and looked down at Fringilla's form. The ridiculously low-cut dress he now found himself sporting made it crystal clear that the young man now had the body of a woman every bit as enticing a piece of eye-candy as his two co-workers now had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all suddenly felt so incredibly unfair. He grimaced as he thought about the injustice of it all. Here he was, trapped by odd circumstances with two of the most gorgeous birds he'd every laid eyes upon and his cock was missing in action! His turn-on melted away as he started to feel frustration and disgust at being forced to look and feel so smooth, dainty, and unquestionably feminine. \"I'm a bloke, damn it!\" He snarled under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Liam was lagging behind, Liz stopped in her tracks. \"Keep up slow-coach! You might get away with loafing about at work on occasion, but we can't afford to lay-about now! We've got to find answers, and possibly the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam gathered up the hem of his long gown and picked up his pace. \"I'm coming, I'm coming, damn it. It's hard to keep up the pace with this moronic outfit, and these..these...things keep jostling about!\" He complained while gesturing to his tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do that no matter what world you're on, luv.\" Liz, who had had to contend with her own titanic rack back home was all too aware of what a challenge a big chest could be. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she took another sip of her wine, she spotted some horses in the Duchy's stables down below, and a smile appeared on Jessica's luscious new lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica remembered going horse riding when she was younger, in her early teens, she'd missed it so much. Whereas she had no idea why she was trapped in this world and in some other woman's body, she saw no reason why she shouldn't take advantage of the fact that she was now a Duchess. \"Vivienne, call my personal guard please. We're going out!\" She stated, clasping her wine glass in both hands, before downing the rest of the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes m'lady.\" Vivienne curtsied, then swiftly left the room to summon Jessica's elite guards, who accompanied the Duchess whenever she ventured out (unless instructed otherwise).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was pouring another glass of the delicious wine (her fourth incidentally) when the captain of her personal guard entered the room and bowed. \"Your Grace!\" He spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain. I want a ride!\" Jessica blurted out, without thinking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille and Beatrice looked at each other, putting their hands to their mouths to stifle their giggles, while Vivienne's eyebrows arched upwards and she looked towards the floor. A couple of seconds later Jessica realized what she'd said, and closed her eyes for a moment, muttering under her breath. <i>Oh god... you silly bitch.</i> She admonished herself, as the poor guard captain just stood there silent... his mouth partly agape. It wasn't fitting for a Duchess to blush, but Jessica was doing just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... by ride, I mean on a horse, naturally. I... (she cleared her throat awkwardly) I wish for me and my handmaidens to go horse riding. P-please make the preparations captain.\" She stuttered, opening her eyes again and attempting to look very serious to counter her embarrassing faux pas. The captain bowed once more and backed out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your Grace!\" The captain said, before closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not one word, girls!\" Jessica addressed her three companions with a sigh before gulping down the entire glass of wine in her dainty hand and frowning at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we to lay out your riding clothes, m'lady?\" Beatrice asked, still smirking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded, giving the younger woman a slightly annoyed stare. \"Yes, please!\" She was then assisted in removing her restrictive dress by Vivienne and Lucille, while Beatrice fetched her riding clothes. Namely a black tunic with red silk detail and with a crimson red bodice underneath, a pair of form-fitting black leggings and a pair of finely detailed, black leather, high heeled boots that reached up to her knees, that seemed to be the fashion across Tossaint and elsewhere. \"Hic... Oh.. excuse me.\" Jessica hiccuped while the dress was being removed, putting her hand to her mouth. Maybe she'd had a tad too much wine, as delicious as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 45 minutes later, Jessica and her ladies in waiting were appropriately attired for horse riding, and the personal guard were waiting outside the royal quarters, ready to accompany them to the stables. \"Lead the way captain.\" Jessica said confidently upon exiting her room. Then she set off walking, followed by Vivienne, Beatrice and Lucille in their riding togs. Four sets of high heeled boots clicking on the marble floor of the Beauclair Palace, accompanied by the clanking of armor and weapons worn and equipped by the 10 knights around the ladies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could definitely get used to this.</i> Jessica mused with a slightly tipsy smile on her pretty face, as the wine she had consumed helped her slip more and more into the persona of Duchess Anna Henrietta. Not just having everyone had at her beck and call, but also being surrounded by so many handsome, muscular men clad in medieval armor. Their lives sworn to her and her alone. Her new pussy was increasingly damp underneath the many layers of clothing she wore, signalling her arousal, which she was able to hide remarkably well. And as she flicked her luxurious locks of 'dirty blonde' hair back a bit, she glanced at the captain in front of her again, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she wouldn't just stop at riding a horse after all...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, they'd managed to conduct much of their journey without running into zealous theocratic soldiers or supernatural monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this feels a LOT bigger than the game world.\" Luke marveled, his tone a little in-congruent with Geralt's deep, raspy voice. \"I mean, the Witcher 3 was big, but this feels fucking enormous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stopped and put his hands on his newly broad hips, arching his back in order to alleviate some slight muscle cramping. Between Triss's modest boot heel height and her damned boobs, he was developing some minor back pain during the course of their hike. \"Ughhhh...yeah. Just like with our bodies, seeing the actual world in the flesh, so to speak, seems to really add breadth and depth to things. It feels like an actual planet, or...errr continent? or land, or nation, or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke smiled, Geralt's smirk doing nothing to disguise the appreciation he had for what Steven's stretching was doing in the way of showing off Triss's fabulous figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob plopped down on a fallen tree trunk, adjusting his ridiculous tights. \"Jesus, these things bunch up in the crotch...\" he mumbled.\" He looked up the low ridge-line they were progressing up and used Dandelion's hand to shield his eyes from the glare of the Sun. \"If it feels like the World is so much bigger, are you sure you know we're heading in the right direction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven, had to stifle a laugh as he turned to look at Rob sitting their in Dandelion's foppish clothes and form, fiddling with his junk and looking absolutely ridiculous. \"Enough of what I'm seeing looks familiar that I know we're on the right track. You've played the game too Ger-, er, I mean Luke, is that how you feel as well?\" Steven bit Triss's tongue at the slip-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke smiled, \"Yeah. I think I even know what \"zone\" or whatever we're in. It's all familiar, just very, very expanded and a whole Hell of a lot more real feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven turned and brushed a red lock of hair out of his pretty borrowed eyes. \"Well. Enough of that. The Sun's getting low. We have to find some sign of civilization or we're going to have to make camp. I don't know if I want to do that in a World crawling with supernatural horrors and the like.\" He started back up the hill, each footfall of his heeled boots taking him further towards the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke reached out and grabbed \"Dandelion's\" hand in order to help him up. \"C'mon man. She's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean HE Luke-ee boy.\" Rob chuckled with Dandelion's voice. \"I think staring at that ass for the past several hours is making you forget that that's Steven in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke laughed nervously, amused but more than a little embarrassed as he knew Rob was probably more than a little on the money. \"In my defense, Steven's new \"real-estate\" is a lot easier on the eye than his actual bod.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked up as Steven-come-Triss continued up the hill, smiling himself as he watched his remarkably appealing new tush sway back and forth with each step. \"Yeah, maybe he can keep it if we manage to get home. I'd rather look at that in a Wilko uniform all day than boring ole Steven!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp the hill, Steven spun around, not hearing the conversation but hearing his two friends laugh and seeing that they weren't following with a great deal of speed. \"C'mon you slugs! These legs aren't as long as yours, I shouldn't be outpacing you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now I'm thinking about his legs.\" Rob muttered, giggling under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke-Geralt laughed out loud and grabbed his friends arm, forcing him to start marching along with him. \"C'mon \"Dandelion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio finally reached the top of the hill, they looked down at the landscape before them. There was a broad valley of farmland dotted with small knots of trees, but, more interestingly, there was a small town of some sort built up around a crossroads created by the intersection of three roads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like a big Renaissance fair.\" Rob squinted as he looked the settlement over. \"Do you recognize it from the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked less than sure of himself as he gazed at it from behind Triss's sparkling eyes. \"N-no...not really. I mean, it looks like a location that COULD be in the game, but the layout isn't familiar to me. Luke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked just as unsure as he shrugged Geralt's shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven threw Triss's hood over his pretty head and started down the other side of the hill and toward the town. \"Let's take a look.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The screech of a crow just before dusk caused Kiran to sit up suddenly in bed, her piercing, emerald green eyes fully open. She looked around her nervously for a moment, then sighed in relief. She was still in the little hut in the village of Lofoten, on Skellige. The nightmare she had just had seemed so real to her. She had dreamt of being caught in some kind of blinding snowstorm, fighting her way forward, while seeing dark, armor-clad figured skulking in the blizzard. Deep, ghostly whispers had been echoing in her head, repeating several words, including the name 'Zireael'. Before she awoke, one of the figures appeared behind her, wearing a dark, skull mask/helmet that matched his armor and he was terrifying, huge and threatening. The squawking of the crow prevented her from seeing anymore, much to her relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are ye decent?\" A young woman's voice was heard, accompanied by a knock on the door of the hut. Kiran recognized the voice as Astrid's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes, come in.\" Kiran called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope ye slept well, given that my brother's been watching over ye the whole time.\" Astrid chuckled, bringing Kiran some supper. \"He'd brain me for telling ye, but he's quite smitten with ye.\" She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran emitted a slight chuckle. \"That's cute. I appreciate his concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid shook her head, smiling the whole time as she set the tray of food and wine down. \"Oh it's a lot more than concern I promise ye. I think he's actually convinced himself that he's got a chance with ye.\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran stretched her still aching body, and as she did so, her perky breasts pressed against her worn shirt. She then got to her feet, ran her gloved hands down her firm arse and onto the backs of her thighs, before walking over to the table. \"Well, I'm actually into women myself, so I...\" Kiran said, before realizing just what she had said. She frowned intently, while glancing at Astrid, who looked a little taken aback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. Well, everyone to their own I guess. I'll let Skjall know.\" Astrid mumbled, as Kiran sat her pert backside in the creaky chair again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why did I say that? I'm not a lesbian... am I? No... I can't be. What is going on?</i> Kiran mused as she started picking at her food. She couldn't help but stare at Astrid's modest breasts, as she leaned forward and poured some wine into a simple cup. Snapping her eyes immediately forward again, Kiran rubbed her leather-clad thighs together under the table. She was definitely aroused for some reason, and she came to the realization it could only have been Astrid's close proximity. She wasn't stunning or anything, and she wore a simple dress, yet there was a cuteness about her that was turning Kiran on. \"Well, I'll leave ye to enjoy your food.\" Astrid smiled, patting Kiran's shoulder before leaving the hut. \"Er... thank you!\" Kiran called out, just before the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get out of here.\" Kiran muttered, as she ate her meal. But where to go? She still had no idea what world she now inhabited, or indeed who's body she was now wearing.

She had to fight the urge to primp and pose in front of the mirror, as part of her was actually glorying in seeing the achingly beautiful woman as her reflection. She closed her eyes and shook her head, \"this isn't me.\" she whispered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room, Philippa smiled. \"Don't feel bad child, it's completely understandable to get a bit caught up in admiring Rita's beauty.\" Philippa's heels clicked on the stone floor as she glided across the room and grabbed Rebekah's new shoulders. \"I'm just glad that I was able to save you from that prison. BOTH of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah smiled weakly. \"I certainly owe you one or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippa smiled like the cat who ate the canary. \"Perhaps. But think nothing of it for now.\" She turned and went back to her equipment and book cases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah took a few steps after her, her stockinged, high heeled legs crossing the distance gracefully. \"So. What next? Can you find my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippa's pretty lips collapsed into a slight frown. \"Normally that would be no problem whatsoever. I'd just sense and transport myself to the rest of the members of the Lodge and see if we can confirm that all of them have been replaced by your friends. But something has begun to affect my ability to do so.\" Philippa rubbed her temples. \"It's like a distortion of some kind...a confusion...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sucks. I hope they're not in this place too, but if they are it would feel better if I was with them. I feel so...alone.\" She lowered her head and her shoulders sunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippa rushed to her side. \"There's no need to feel alone, little one. You're part of a sisterhood now. A powerful sisterhood. I will protect you with my very life.\" Philippa embraced the young woman, pressing her impressive bosom against Margarita's own ample assets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...thanks...\" Rebekah whispered, her 'Rita cheeks blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippa continued to hold her, but leaned back a bit. \"Not to worry. I have an idea. I think I have an idea how to use your connection to one or more of your stranded friends to find them. I caution you however, it will involve ritual, magic, and you and I deepening our own connection. Are you up for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah looked a little leery, but finally managed to say, \"I guess so.\" rather meekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Good.\" Philippa sounded delighted. </span></div></div>",

Striding confidently out of her palace with her three ladies in waiting rushing to catch up, Jessica headed for the stables, riding crop in hand and her luxurious red hair blowing in the breeze. The heels of her black boots clicked rapidly on the expertly laid ground in the courtyard, backed up by the clicking of her companions' heels also. Then there was the clanking of armored guards who were laboring to catch up, sweating under all the polished steel plate. \"Keep up girls!\" Jessica barked at her female entourage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivienne, Lucille and Beatrice were chatting quietly to each other, no doubt puzzled as to their mistress's 'odd' behavior, her mood swings. But they were also somewhat amused by the way the Duchess was now acting. Besides, they loved horse riding as much as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching an immaculate, black mare which was saddled up ready to go, Jessica gasped at it's beauty. She slowed her walk, so as not to alarm the animal, then smiled as she caressed it's neck and face. \"You're beautiful!\" Jessica whispered in awe. For a moment she forgot about her predicament, her stranger's body, and even her sexy, accented voice. Snapping herself out of her trance, Jessica then looked at her female companions. \"Well, saddle up!\" She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes m'lady!\" Vivienne nodded, along with her two friends, before finding their own horses. Vivienne chose a white mare, while Lucille and Beatrice selected a Palomino stallion and a Bay stallion respectively. Quietly addressing the male stable hand who was nearby, Jessica leaned closer. \"Remind me of her name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stable hand, head lowered in respect, stuttered his response nervously. \"Um... i-its Sapphire, y-your Grace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank you,\" Jessica smiled, before instantly frowning as she caught scent of the man. \"Now, go and bathe will you.\" She said rather rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A t-t-thousand p-pardons m'lady!\" The man apologized, backing away while groveling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to her horse, Jessica lifted one of her shapely, fabric-covered legs and placed a foot in the stirrup, before effortlessly lifting herself into the saddle. As she adjusted her position slightly, straddling her mare, she took the reigns and turned the horse in a full circle, surveying the courtyard and it's inhabitants. She first looked over her motionless elite guard and smirked, correctly guessing that they all had throbbing erections straining their undergarments while watching her. Giggling, she then turned her horse again. \"Ready girls?\" She asked her ladies-in-waiting, who had also all mounted their horses. They all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, you and your men remain here, I will be fine.\" Jessica ordered her elite guard commander. <i>And maybe take a cold shower.</i> She thought with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your Grace!\" The captain bowed, obeying without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling gently on the reigns again, Jessica guided her horse down the spiral pathway that led down to an open area that included a medium sized race course. Once she was out of earshot, she addressed her companions again. \"Okay girls, how about a race? And I insist that you do NOT let me win just because I'm the Duchess, am I clear?\" Before Vivienne and the others could answer, Jessica grinned and kicked the sides of her horse gently while snapping the reigns... causing her horse to set off in a gallop down the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly glancing at each other, the three ladies-in-waiting were startled, but quickly regained their composure and set off in pursuit of their mistress. \"Yaah, yaah...\" Jessica called out, to spur her horse onwards, but Sapphire didn't go as fast as she wanted her to, at least not at first. It wasn't long before first Lucille, then Vivienne and lastly Beatrice had caught up and edged past her, glancing right as they did so and smiling. \"Pass the Duchess on the left hand side... really??\" Jessica frowned, before snapping her reigns again and spurring Sapphire to go quicker. Dust was kicked up as the four women thundered down the course on their mounts, garnering the attention of a few of the Duchess's subjects. Jessica's skills at horse riding from her teenage years all came back to her and she was soon able to catch up to and pass each one of her companions in turn. After five minutes, she gave one last slap of her riding crop on Sapphire that carried her over the finishing line, seconds ahead of her ladies-in-waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing her panting horse to a stop, Jessica was all smiles, and she felt her ample (if restricted) bosom heaving as she took in deep breaths of fresh air. \"That was fun girls!\" She said, obviously brimming at her victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations on your victory m'lady.\" Vivienne smiled, nodding from her mounted position while patting her horse's neck to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Vivienne. You all rode well, you make me proud.\" Jessica then said, looking at each girl in turn and making them all smile more than they already were. \"Now, how about another run when we've rested the horses?\" Jessica winked in a manner not completely befitting Royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the most fun she'd had in years, and a part of her already didn't want to go back to her own body and humdrum life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looked at the group of halflings. In seconds, it's silhouette grew shorter and quite different. Moments later, a halfling decked in green and rich blue finery that looked like the spitting image of one of the passing merchants stepped out onto the street and headed toward the tavern after Luke, Steven, and Rob.

He was feeling thoroughly fed up and embarrassed, his ample bosom bouncing healthily with each step he took. As he navigated obstacles on their cross-country path, he had to keep hitching up his dress, revealing his smooth ankles, the high heeled court shoes on his feet hardly the appropriate footwear for such terrain. He lamented the fact that they'd ditched their horses earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop complaining Liam! Bloody hell, I swear this is like being back at work.\" Natalie interjected, as she glanced back and frowned at her now attractive, female-bodied co-worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam snapped back this time. \"Hey!! You've been a woman the whole time, I haven't.

Her new voice was VERY firm and authoritative, and Yenn's scowl was not one to be ignored, regardless of who was in her body at the time. \"Natalie, don't provoke him. And Liam... stop your bitching! We're all stuck in this world, not just you, and yes whereas you have more to deal with than we do due to your sex change, complaining about your new 'assets' won't change the fact that you have them. Suck it up!\" Liz berated them both, especially Liam. \"Now,\" Liz said, in a much calmer tone of voice, \"Liam... do you have any idea where we are?\" She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam rolled his beautiful green eyes and ran his fingers through his short, black cropped hair, before looking at their surroundings. \"No, I don't!\" He grumbled. \"But if we were heading north, then there's a city to the... er... northeast I think, Oxen... something, Oxenfurt, that's it. And I remember from the game that there was a crossroads to the west somewhere, where there's a small village and an Inn.\" He explained. \"Then there's Novigrad, of course, straight north, where we were going anyway.\" But that city is even more dangerous than any other around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm for heading to Oxenfurt, I've had enough of bloody trees, peasants and swamps.\" Natalie sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam shook his head. \"Not a good idea. We might all be captured and killed, since sorceresses are not very popular in most places. And I don't really want to be burned at the stake.\" He mumbled, as he adjusted his dress under his juicy breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fair point!\" Liz nodded, using a gloved hand to brush her long, dark tresses behind her right ear. \"But... our friends could be there, if they're here at all. And they could be in trouble. We could try and remain unseen, and defend ourselves if we're attacked.\" She continued, pacing in her heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we go to the village at the crossroads, but that's just me.\" Liam grumbled, shrugging his slender, partly exposed shoulders. He looked increasingly irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz, who was used to being the one in charge, gently rubbed her chin as she thought it over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The villagers who'd taken her in, cared for her, and filled her belly had been kind enough to fix up some quarters for her in one of their barns. It smelled like animals, was covered in hay and stray, and was about as far from the 21st century conveniences the young woman had always lived with as could possibly be, but with candles and a small brazier burning, it actually felt kind of cozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on a small stool and looked down at herself. She'd stripped out of her leather trousers, and sat there clad only in her crudely patched and repaired billowy white tunic, small undergarments, and her boots that she'd slipped back onto her feel to prevent herself from picking up any filth from the barn's floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the lovely breasts peeking out of her tunic, at the creamy, but taught thighs that now made up her lap. She was still trying to wrap her head around the obvious knowledge that she was in someone else's body. A very fit, very beautiful, someone else. \"At least I'm hot.\" She laughed, only half-serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a door snapping shut caused her to bolt up from the stool! To Kira's shock, she found herself spinning on her boots, retrieving her nearby sword from it's scabbard, and spinning around to face the surprise with absolutely no hesitation. It was like she'd been on auto-pilot or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer visitor gasped. \"I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to startle you Miss!\" Astrid approached her nervously. The young woman's dark brow hair was down, framing her cute face as the firelight danced over her cheeks. She wore loose fitting, rustic bed-clothes. They clung to her body, showing off her lithe, pretty young body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I'm just on edge. I'm sorry I scared you back!\" Kiran put her sword back in it's scabbard. She turned around to face Astrid. She couldn't help but smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;God, she's cute. Farm work or whatever agrees with her, she has a great little bod...Jesus! Why am I thinking this?!?!\" Kiran blushed and cleared her throat. \"Uh...again. Sorry. Is there anything I can do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid bit her lip, wringing her hands as she looked down at the ground between them. \"I-I just wanted to make sure you were comfortable for the night. I know you're leaving tomorrow and I wanted to make sure you remembered our hospitality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to worry about that. I'll always remember you.\" Kiran wrinkled her nose. &lt;Why did I say that?!?! What a shitty come-on?!?!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid blushed a bit. \"That makes me happy. I'll never forget you, either. It's not everyday a beautiful woman washes up on these shores!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I don't have to compete with any other women for space on your mind.\" Kiran answered without even thinking about it. &lt;Oh, for the love of...&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although you're a bit foolish, despite all your beauty.\" Astrid rushed over to a barrel and retrieved a bucket, various pieces of cloth, and soap of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" Kiran tilted her head, brushing a strand of white hair out of her eyes as she looked at her pretty visitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walking around without breeches or a skirt in the barn, you'll bet your legs filthy!\" Astrid marched over and pushed Kiran onto the stool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I put my boots on, it's no big...\" Kiran protested with Ciri's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a dullard. Let me wash them.\" Astrid bent down before her and gave Kiran a strange smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran's heart raised as the young woman slowly pulled her tall boots off. Filling a rag with soapy, clean water, she began to slowly run the sopping mass up and down Kiran's smooth, lovely new legs. It was less scrubbing, and more an exercise in being gently caressed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;What is happening here?!?! I'm getting turned on?!?!\" Kiran moaned a bit as pleasure began to grow in her new nether-regions. \"I-I thought you weren't familiar with women who preferred women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid winked at her, as she seemed to take great pleasure in running her hands up and down Kiran's beautiful legs. \"I'm not. Never considered it. But you gave me a lot to think about this afternoon. In fact, it's all I can think about. I think I'd regret it for the rest of my life if I let you leave tomorrow without at least exploring some...things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran shook her head. She had to stop this! She was NOT a lesbian, damn it! She had a boyfriend back home, for fuck's sake! She reached out and placed her hands on the sides of Astrid's head. She stood up, dragging the young woman with her. \"That's enough of that. We're done.\" she said with great force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun the startled Astrid around, before pushing her down onto the stool herself. \"Now, let's wash your legs.\" Kiran licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid smiled as she pulled her loose fitting bedclothes up, exposing her own soft, thin limbs. Kiran began to run her delicate new hands and fingers up the young woman's thighs. &lt;I-I don't want to do this, but it just feels so damned good.&gt;<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Using her vast knowledge of magic and putting it into practical application should be no trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... come again?\" Rebekah mumbled, frowning at Philippa. Even though she had stopped crying now, Rebekah's beautiful new face still showed signs of the many tears she had shed over the past several hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a midly frustrated sigh, Philippa took hold of Rebekah's right arm and raised it gently. \"Open your hand, palm facing up, we'll start off with a simple offensive spell. Now... look at your palm and concentrate, think... fire.\" Philippa told Rebekah, as she stepped behind her, lowering both her hands onto her svelte waist. Rebekah looked down for a second, feeling slightly uncomfortable, but then she stared at her open hand and focused as hard as she could. \"The application of magic could not be easier, little one, it's all about focus, you can do this.\" Philippa cooed in an oddly reassuring voice, as her hands crept up Rebekah's sides a little further, stopping just short of her perfect breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to focus, Rebekah's eyes suddenly went wide in shock as a condensed ball of fire with a glowing edge appeared in her hand. Afraid of burning her hand, Rebekah threw her hand in a downward motion, back by her side, making the magic disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was all right, but you have to push the fear aside my dear, your own magic cannot hurt you.\" Philippa said. \"Now, why don't we try frost magic, Rita always did have a penchant for that.

She leveled Rebekah's arm with her manicured hand, and smiled when Rebekah was able to conjure a swirling ball of frost magic. \"There you go, you're a natural.\" Philippa said, sounding like a teacher mildly impressed with her student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I... um... thank you.\" Rebekah gasped, smiling to herself.

After switching her engine off she reached over to her purse on the passenger seat and pulled out her new 'toy'. It was a variant of a P.A.I.D (Personal Aspect Interchanging Device). Basically it allowed her two swap people's traits. She could swap people's bodies, individual body parts, clothing, personalities etc., and only she would be aware. Reality would shift so everyone else would think everything was normal. \"Perfect place to give you another try-out.\" Phoebe grinned, running her fingers over the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd already used it on some of her neighbors and some passers-by in the street that morning. Dave, the guy across the street, had looked pretty ridiculous going to work dressed in a schoolgirl's uniform. And her prissy neighbor Adele didn't look as pretty with the bald head and the biker tattoos of some guy who walked past Phoebe's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe kept smiling, even chuckling as she exited her car and headed into Wilkos to start her shift. Liz was just heading upstairs to chat with Elizabeth, and she smiled and greeted Phoebe as she inputted the security code on the door leading upstairs. \"Afternoon Phoebe.\" she chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Liz.\" Phoebe responded happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz frowned as she smiled. \"You seem more cheerful than usual.\" The supervisor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a good day, that's all.\" Phoebe mumbled, without revealing too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two had reached the top of the stairs, Liz turned right and headed down the hallway towards the manager's office, while Phoebe walked straight into the tea room, where several of her co-workers were already sat awaiting the start of their shift.  Phoebe glanced at her watch, they still had 20 minutes to kill. Looking around the room, she identified Nicola, Rebekah, Steven, Waggy and Liam. And then someone else entered the room after her, she turned to see who it was and saw Josh smiling at her. He was the newest employee, recently arrived from the U.S with his wife. \"Hey there.\" he greeted Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe had to admit, she loved Josh's accent. <i>Hmm, I wonder if I should have an accomplice for this.</i> Phoebe wondered with a smirk as she watched Josh grab himself a coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided she wanted a confidante. So she walked over to Josh while he was by the sink and started talking in a loud whisper so the others wouldn't hear her. \"How would you like to have some fun with everyone?\" she asked initially, before showing Josh her P.A.I.D variant. and explaining to him in quick detail just what it was capable of. That took a couple of minutes, and inevitably, Josh was highly sceptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I can see you need proof, which is fine\" Phoebe grinned, as she activated her P.A.I.D.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then pointed it at him and pressed the button.  \"There, I set it for random and the first one should be in roughly 15 minutes or so.\"  She said as she put down her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what can I expect to swap.\"  Josh wondered.  \"You know what kind of swaps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, from what I saw, we can do body parts, which this is mostly set for, life swaps, job stuff, etc.  So mostly body parts will change much like you saw earlier.\"  Phoebe told him as Liz came up to tell them that it's time to start their shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>***  What Josh didn't know was that Phoebe didn't choose who he wanted, he was pointing to Becca, <br>\r\nbut instead chose somebody else.***</b></div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet here he was with knowledge of a boyfriend, named Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is some freaky shit!\" Josh thought. As with Phoebe's swap with Mark earlier, Josh's list of friends and his relationship/marriage had been swapped out with Laura's friends and her boyfriend. Yet a part of Josh thought this was quite normal. It was beyond strange, but he couldn't let it get to him. The last thing he wanted was to freak out and hand victory to Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got back to work, despite the distraction his new mememories and new clothing were providing him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He actually was beginning to feel more 'norma' now, which was funny considering the changes that had overtaken his body. He was looking more and more like Laura. He now had her height, clothes, voice, breasts and vagina, as well as her friends and her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so gonna win this bet, no contest.\" Josh smiled contently as he kept working. Aaron was providing him with all the entertainment he needed to make it until break time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could mostly tell the difference on his legs, where his tights were now rubbing against his waxed legs. Laura always kept her skin in tip top shape. \"I need to start wearing a skirt.\" Josh mused, as he wondered why Laura had taken to wearing tights under her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to head upstairs and take a look at himself in the mirror in the gents toilets. \"Oooh, not bad.\" Josh commented, running his fingers over his shaped eyebrows and across his silky smooth face. And he actually found himself picking which of Laura's parts he'd like next. <i>Hmm, her hair would be nice.</i> Josh said, as he ran his fingers through his short hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout him trying, Josh's mind then drifted back to his (Laura's) boyfriend Thomas. The very thought of him, being with him, Josh felt his vagina moistening as 'naughty' thoughts went through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get laid.\" Josh sighed in his feminine tone, as he took one last look at his mis-matched reflection in the mirror.

Phoebe made her way to the ladies toilet and looked at herself in the mirror.  She no longer had her face, but Mark's rugged face.  She also had no trace of her makeup that she put on this morning.

As soon as Phoebe felt the firm grip on her (Mark's) cock... she let out a gasp of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe's excitement only grew as Josh then started wanking her off. But he was sure not to go too far, since he didn't want her cumming too soon. \"Are you teasing me?\" Phoebe had to ask, as she writhed and grunted in Mark's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just don't want you blowing your load too early.\" Josh winked, pushing his hair out of his face with his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, they were locked in an embrace, kissing and groping each other. Becca and Mark would have never got together had they been themselves, but with Josh and Phoebe inside their bodies, things were different.

By this time the pressure in her balls had built up and she needed release. But Josh continued teasing Phoebe, just as the real Becca would have done with her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Phoebe got what she wanted. Josh slipped a condom over Phoebe's cock and then lowered himself down onto it. \"Oooh fuck!\" he moaned in Becca's cute voice, as he felt Phoebe's manhood slide into his pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment... they both knew the rest of the night was going to be epic...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess I have to anyway for what I have planned.\" she mumbled, as she whipped her PAID out. A few button taps and it was done.

The first to 'score' - wins.\" she smiled. Phoebe then activated the PAID again and swapped herself and Josh back into their own bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was caught off guard by the change, and he looked down in shock at his 'normal' body. So much of Becca's personality had reared it's head in him that it felt weird having his penis back. \"Could have given me some warning.\" Josh grumbled, looking down on Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but needed to get that out of the way.\" Phoebe chuckled. \"Oh... and last night was amazing, thank you.\" she said gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure. We'll have to do it again sometime... in different bodies.\" Josh winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Phoebe nodded, as she locked her belongings in her locker. She however kept the PAID on her.

He was at least thankful that Jade's bra had made the swap too, so that his new 'girls' were at least supported. As if he needed further confirmation, he then checked the name badge on his shirt, and it read '<b>Jade</b>'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It swapped everything from the neck to the groin.\" Phoebe confirmed, \"Even clothing.\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty obvious.\" Josh replied. as she looked at the name badge on Phoebe's new shirt, which read '<b>Luke</b>'. \"At least this makes it easier to identify who swapped with who.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fix this!

Nicola and Kiran had swapped torsos, but since they were roughly the same height, nothing much seemed amiss.

Suki looked quite comical in actual fact, after having her torso swapped with Melissa's.

It wasn't long before another staff member asked for help moving something heavy. Phoebe was just surprised that the staff member in question was Aaron. Of course his reason for asking was clear, his torso was noticeably smaller, more slender, and the name badge on his Wilko shirt read '<b>Mona</b>'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Aaron, you okay?\" Phoebe mumbled, trying not to laugh too much at Aaron's slightly contrasting skin tones. He now had Mona's entire torso, including her perky breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would be if I could lift this fucking box.\" Aaron grumbled back in his usual tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you, keep your shirt on.\" Phoebe chuckled, as she followed Aaron to his aisle. As she walked behind him, Phoebe flexed her own biceps, it felt good to be much stronger than before. True, her muscles weren't as impressive as Mona's were now, but she was fine with that. When she came up on the box in question, a box full of dust sheets, Phoebe smirked at Aaron, before picking the box up almost effortlessly and throwing it on Aaron's overs cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers.\" Aaron mumbled a reluctant thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else your puny muscles can't do, just give me a shout.\" Phoebe quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not totally fucking useless you know, it's just some things are too fucking heavy.\" Aaron responded. He then got back to work, and as with nearly every other employee, he was totally unaware his torso had been swapped out with a co-worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, calm down, just give me a shout if you need me again.\" Phoebe rolled her eyes.

Her skin had a bit of color too it; she was probably mostly white, but with one grandparent who could've either Asian, Hispanic, or black -- he really couldn't tell.

She had a perfectly good reason for being late though..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Phoebe's fleece jacket pocket was her new 'toy'. The 'Genticular Moleculizer' of all things. Yes - it was a real thing, despite it's ridiculous name. A prototype device that could actually exchange people's genitals. And only the person/s wielding it would be aware of anything out of the ordinary. How Phoebe had gotten a hold of this amazing piece of technology was a long story. It involved the father of a friend's friend, who had been fired from a top secret research lab, and who had made off with the device on his way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe still wondered if they had ever caught up with the guy. Whatever the case was, she now possessed the device, and she had already been experimented with it a little bit on a couple of people around her neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping herself from her always frantic thought patterns, Phoebe glanced at her watch and then jumped out of her car, before heading into work. \"Cutting it fine Phoebe.\" Liz said from behind the help desk, tapping her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, sorry.\" Phoebe apologized with a groan. \"Been a bitch of a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your language! The store is still open for another hour.\" Liz admonished her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe couldn't catch a break. \"Sorry - again!\" she rolled her eyes, while pushing her black-rimmed glasses up the bridge of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... and pick a color, hmm?\" Liz sighed, gesturing to Phoebe's multi-colored hair, which was in it's usual 'twin pigtail' style. Phoebe knew not a lot of people liked her unique sense of style. Pink and purple hair, make up a little on the heavy side, a couple of piercings in her face. There was nothing with it, she thought. As long as it was a color associated with the company though, Phoebe could dye her hair whatever color she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victimization much?\" Phoebe grumbled to herself as she went up the two flights of stairs. Her voice echoed considerably in the space. She knew Liz was only being herself, was doing her job, so she didn't hold too much ill-will against her supervisor. Liz was 13 years her senior after all, and more 'serious' than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she emerged into the hallway at the top of the stairs, Phoebe was greeted with a familar face. \"Oh... hey, you lurking there or something?\" Phoebe asked wide-eyed, staring at Rebekah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just finished a phone call, it was too noisy in there.\" Rebekah mumbled, holding her phone up and gesturing into the crowded tea room, where most of the rest of the staff were assembled, chatting amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Admin office is usually empty, why not go there?\" Phoebe suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Elizabeth is in there with the new assistant manager, showing him the ropes.\" Rebekah answered with a mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, is he cute?\" Phoebe asked, grinning a little as she reached into her pocket to check that her device was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah looked indecisive. \"Hmm, not bad, but... I don't think he 'swings' that way, if you get my meaning. His name's Jonathan I think.\" Their little chat was then briefly interrupted when Elizabeth and the new assistant manager appeared from down the hallway. Phoebe got her first glimpse of Jonathan. He was fairly tall (5' 11\"), with short, dusty blonde hair, he was wearing grey trousers, a white shirt and brown loafers. There was nothing special about his appearance, quite average really. And Phoebe could tell almost immediately as Elizabeth introduced him, that Jonathan was gay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you.\" Phoebe smiled, shaking the assistant manager's hand, before he and Elizabeth went down to the shop floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, he does swing that way.\" Phoebe smirked at Rebekah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that there's anything wrong with that, some of my friends in college were gay.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too.\" Rebekah smiled. \"It was nice to have male friends who didn't want to get into my knickers all the time.\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I've got to pee, see you downstairs.\" Phoebe brought their little chat to an abrupt end, before disappearing into the ladies toilets. Phoebe smiled at her reflection for a moment in the mirror, then got her device out of her pocket. \"You and me are going to have some fun.\" she chuckled to herself...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, Jessica was the kind of quiet, polite young woman that was easily shocked by some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?? They hit it off, and left to their own devices, they'd have never made a move. I just... rushed things along a bit.\" Kiran responded with a smirk, as she folded her arms under her small but perky breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really one of a kind, you know that.\" Jessica smirked, shaking her head once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran licked her lips briefly. \"I'll take that as a compliment.\" she giggled. \"Now, um... I'll leave you to your housekeeping duties, this place is a mess.\" she muttered, taking a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks.\" Jessica sighed, hating the fact that Liz has assigned her the task of cleaning up the Goods Inwards area. It was filthy, and Jessica was a girl who liked to keep herself clean and looking good. After Kiran had exited the vicinity and gone back to work, Jessica clicked over to the cleaning trolley in her high heeled ankle boots and grabbed an old pair of gloves. They were men's gloves, and her dainty hands swam in them, much to her chagrin. But it was better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, you and me Mr. Brush, for the win!\" Jessica said, grabbing a nearby large brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\n15 minutes later Jessica had made steady progress, and a large pile of rubbish was in the middle of the floor. Several shelves were also free of stains and dust, and Jessica was now maneuvering herself in between some other shelving to whack a large, vacant cobweb behind. She soon saw the congealed pile of spilled paint on the floor, with a couple of lids solidified in place. \"Eww, gross!\" Jessica grimaced. The paint had obviously been there for a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way I'm getting that off the floor. I'd need an industrial sand blaster or something.\" Jessica mumbled to herself. Just as she was about to wriggle free of the shelving, she saw a glint of metal on the floor nearby to where the paint was. For some reason, her curiosity kicked in, and she got further behind the fixturing... at the expense of her name badge, which got snagged on a shelf and ripped from her Wilko shirt. \"Crap!\" Jessica grunted, as she struggled to reach the metal object she was trying to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she grabbed it, and then she reversed herself out of the tight space, being careful not to stumble in her heels. \"Great!\" Jessica sighed, as she looked down at the dust on her usually spotless trousers. She cleaned off what she could, then turned her attention to the 'thing' she had retrieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt bore a vague resemblence to a remote of some kind, but only had a single button in the middle. Whatever the thing was, it had certainly seen better days, and had obviously been behind the shelving for years. The building was decades old, and Jessica knew this. A lot of the dark surface paint had been scraped off, revealing a titanium material underneath, and it was the titanium that had caught Jessica's attention. And at the top of the device, several letters were ledgible, but noly just. Two words, obviously, the first began with a 'G', and it also had a 'T' in it and it ended with an 'L'. Only a single 'P' and several undistinguishable other letters comprised the second word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just scrap metal.\" Jessica shrugged, throwing it on a nearby shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grabbed her brush again, Jessica suddenly heard a faint beep, and when she looked over to the device, she noticed the small LED light at the top of the device was now glowing red. \"What in the world...\" Jessica frowned, picking up the device again and wiping some of the grime off it. \"What is this thing?\" she asked herself, having no clue. If it was a 'remote', then what was it used on? Televisions, some other contraptions, or... people... as bizarre as it sounded?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica knew the only way to find out, was the push the button and see. She did this... but nothing happened, not surprisingly. \"Maybe if I aim it at something electrical, or maybe some people?\" she thought. She was clutching at straws here, and she was also wasting company time. \"Lets test this so I can get back to work.\" Jessica said, sighing deeply before walking out onto the shop floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was just a certain draw to it. Something she couldn't quite explain. As such, when Jessica walked past the meager electronics aisle, she pointed the mysterious device at a couple of the objects and clicked the \"power button\" a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, nothing happened.

As she did, she noticed Suki wince a little. \"You okay?\" Jessica inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's nothing, I just think I need some bigger trousers.\" Suki dismissed Jessica's concern. \"These ones are a little tight.\" Jessica didn't utter another word, and Suki soon left the goods in area as cheery as when she entered. Jessica let out a dejected sigh, and rubbed her forehead. \"What have I done?\" she grumbled. Jessica was just glad that she hadn't swapped herself as well, otherwise she might not have been able to hold herself together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to get back to work, but was still unable to concentrate on anything else but the device and her two swapped friends.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She waved goodbye to Liz as she drove off in her Peugeot 208, then she dug into her purse and produced the device she had found at the help desk. It really was in a sorry state, and she still didn't know what the thing even did, what it was for. But for some reason, her curiosity wouldn't subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging her shoulders, Elizabeth fastened her seatbelt and slipped the key itno the ignition, starting the engine up. She then eased her high heeled foot on the accelerator and rolled out of her parking space, onto the main road.

In many ways, the weather reflected Jessica's solemn mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Kiran started, \"first thing tomorrow, we ask Liz if we can have the device back, it's that simple.

To make matters worse, despite wanking herself off twice this morning, she was still horny as fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your stop coming up luv.\" The bus driver shouted back to Kiran, as she felt her cock throb in her pants again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, thank you.\" Kiran called back, getting to her feet.

Then on the way upstairs she happened to pass Suki, who waved and greeted her in her usual, cheery manner. Kiran looked down at Suki's groin, expecting it to have returned to normal overnight somehow. But no... she still had the tell-tale bulge in her slacks caused by Luke's junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Suki.\" Kiran drolled in passing, barely managing to wave back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kiran entered the tea room, all the other usual faces were there, and one in particular stood out. She made her way over to Jessica, who looked a little fresher than she did last night. \"Are you okay?\" Jessica asked when she saw the troubled, exhausted expression on her friend's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah, surprisingly good.\" Kiran lied in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've bad news,\" Jessica revealed, \"I asked Liz for the device, but she doesn't have it anymore. And she doesn't remember where she left it. It could be anywhere Kiran.\" she said, her voice beginning to panic a little again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get yourself worked up. We just start work as normal, and we search the store for it when we can.\" Kiran mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasier said that done. At 9:00am promplty, everyone made their way downstairs to start work, and as Natalie passed by Kiran, the latter looked down. <i>Wait... was that what I thought it was?</i> she thought with an intense frown.

The girl mumbled back something that vaguely sounded like \"good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark cloud that hung over her employee's head did not go completely unnoticed by Elizabeth. She didn't question the girl. Her employees' private lives were not exactly her business after all. A couple more passed employees, a couple more friendly greetings. While Liam's was less than enthusiastic, no more people seemed outright panicked or gloomy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store gradually grew noisier as customers filtered in. She did her best to weave around areas that they didn't frequent. She was not in the mood to answer questions. When she had entered the long stretch known as the furniture aisle, she suddenly remembered the protrusion in her pocket. A quick glance around to make sure no one was looking and then she whipped out the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beat up piece of junk, and yet, Elizabeth still could not get her mind off of it for some reason. What did it do and why was it in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost out of habit, Elizabeth pressed the \"power\" button a couple more times. Still no noticeable effect.

He then started walking off as Elizabeth turned down the aisle Rob had just left, happening to press the power button again. Again, Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on the device, and besides she was too far away to notice the slight bulge that appeared in Becca's black jeans some way down the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth did however notice Becca standing on a box to reach the top shelf. \"BECCA!!\" The manager shouted, startling the employee. \"Health and safety remember, if you can't reach the shelf, then get a ladder please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, gotcha!\" Becca nodded, taking a moment to adjust herself. She wished she hadn't put on her tighter pair of jeans that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl!\" Elizabeth sighed, shaking her head in annoyance as Becca momentarily disappeared to borrow a ladder from a co-workers in a nearby aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I research this thing on the Internet?\" Elizabeth mused, holding the device up higher and closing one eye for a more detailed inspection. All that revealed was just how worn the thing appeared to be, at least on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's heels resumed clicking on the floor as she set off walking again.

I have it.\" Mona explained briefly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica puckered her lips and narrowed her eyes, before deciding to tell Mona everything about the device. Of course Mona was shocked, but she didn't blame Jessica, at least not altogether. \"So... you accidentally swapped Suki? And then Kiran volunteered so you swapped her with Aaron?\" Mona mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jessica nodded, \"and now there's you, and... who knows, maybe others too.\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... nobody who works here is this big!!\" Mona frowned, prodding her groin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you probably got swapped with a customer. It could be anyone's.\" Jessica responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great!\" Mona sighed forlornly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuck for a solution, Mona just shrugged her shoulders. She found her eyes wandering down to Jessica's breasts, and she felt another throb in her pants. \"Well, I'll keep an eye out for thi device. From your description it should be easily recognized..\" Mona told Jessica. \"But right now, I think we should get back to work, we don't want Liz on our backs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well... I only came to borrow a safety knife. Tell Rob I'll bring it back, okay.\" Jessica sighed, grabbing Rob's knife from a nearby shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Mona nodded, before watching Jessica click off her section in her high heels.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was terrible, in every sense of the word. Why would Elizabeth ever pair any new transfer with this girl? It had disaster written all over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" Liz straightened up and flashed Naomi what she hoped wasn't too forced of a smile. \"Today, you'll be paired up with Charlotte.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's many things, but I don't think she'll give you too hard of a time.\" Liz chewed her lips. \"Just tell me if she gives you any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short walk later, and the two had made it to the aisle.

Fortunatey, she was good enough (so far) to avoid being caught by Liz. \"It's not here.\" Jessica sighed, remaining on her knees for a moment after rumaging through the shelves under the help desk, \"Damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stood up, and the poitely directed a customer towards the ironing board covers when she approached for assistance. <i>Where can it be?</i> Jessica thought as she rubbed her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica didn't know that the device was currently in the possession of her manager, who didn't have the slightest clue how it worked. And when Jessica happened to see Elizabeth towards the end of one of the aisles, moving in her direction, she decided to postpone her search for a little while. She walked from behind the help desk, her ankle boots clicking on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, with a stubbornness that your normal egotistical man would be proud of, Elizabeth decided to keep investigating the device she had. She produced it from her pocket again and frowned. It didn't make sense, the LED light on the top would activate alright, but... nothing seemed to happen when she pushed the buttons. She tried again, as if to prove it, just as a regular customer who visited a gym a few blocks away, came in through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, who was a ways ahead of the newly arrived customer... suddenly stopped dead in her tracks and became wide-eyed as she felt a weird... slightly painful swelling in her crotch. \"Oh my... GOD... NO!!\" Jessica cried, attracting the attention of several people, including Elizabeth. The ginger-haired employee looked down in shock at the 'large' distortion in her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica?? Are you okay luv?\" Elizabeth asked, pocketing the device again and rushing over to her employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left poor Jessica standing there, staring down at her masculine crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... er... I just... um...\" Jessica was complelely stunned into speechlessness. And she couldn't help but turn a bright red when she felt an unfamiliar twitching 'down there', she already knew what had happened. \"I'm good, I just... er... thought I saw a big spider crawl under the shelf.\" Jessica finally thought something up to explain why she had screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... is that all?\" Elizabeth sighed in relief, as she smiled and nodded at the muscular customer she had just unknowingly involved in the swap with Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-sorry, you must think so stupid.\" Jessica apologized, trying to keep her cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, just, try stepping on the spider next time, okay?\" Elizabeth chuckled, before wandering off down the nearest aisle. It took only a few moments for her to take the device from her jacket pocket again and start blindly poking it again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, Charlotte wasn't that interested in literature, though she had picked up some of the more popular stories such as the Hunger Games or Harry Potter. She was nowhere near Miss \"I-read-the-entire-library-in-two- different-languages\" across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly, stories seemed a much better idea for bonding material than Charlotte admitting that she spent a bulk of her free time looking up porn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you think of the movie adaptions?\" Naomi asked as she went to sort through some more merchandise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were... good?\" Charlotte said uncertainly.

I didn't do anything, I swear.\" A panicked Naomi responded, staring down at herself at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte drew her gaze from her own groin long enough to glance over at Naomi, who's skirt had lifted like a theater curtain. \"Woah!! You too?\" she mumbled, trying to make sense of what had just transpired, while at the same time wincing because of the restriction on her new testicles. It was a whole new sensation, and one that would take some adjusting to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi placed both hands on her face and let out a sigh, pondering her next move. For some reason her mind conjured up images of some of her brother's Anime porn magazines and the dickgirls that starred in some of them. She'd always wondered why he got such a kick from reading those... It was at that time that Naomi also started looking around, expecting the customers and other staff around to start gawking at her, calling her a freak. But none did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening. It just... Can't.\" Charlotte growled, in a state of denial. She closed her eyes a couple of times, thinking that when she opened them the problem would have disappeared. If anything it got slightly worse as she felt her new manhood twitch... and grow larger, further testing the very fabric of her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the two well-built male customers who now had the girls' pussies, continued on through the store, oblivious to the loss of their impressive members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Elizabeth too kept walking too as she kept pushing the buttons on the device. Though she was close to giving up at this point and filing it under 'random junk' (an appropriate description given what was happening).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost frozen with shock, and now with raging boners, Charlotte and Naomi were stood there in the middle of their section doing nothing, when Jessica happened to wander on, still groggy from her own swap.

One more 'tug' of her large penis was enough to bring about her orgasm, and she couldn't help but moan as she felt an intense pleasure shoot through her. Her balls seemed to clench up... then a thick white rope of semen erupted from her cock and spattered on the wall. Seconds later, while Mona was still descending from her high, she heard a familiar voice. It was Kiran's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mona!! Mona?? Are you in there? Are you alright?\" The concerned girl asked, knocking on the stall door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona spoke in between deep breaths. \"Kiran? Yeah... uh... I'm... fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on in there, you sound out of breath?\" Kiran asked, her mind momentarily taken off her own genital issues out of concern for a friend. Kiran was just glad to have gotten away from Phoebe for a time. The stall door as it happened was not completely locked, and when Kiran knocked the second time, the latch came loose and the door flew open... revealing Mona sat there, trousers and knickers down around her ankles, and her hand gripping a now semi-flaccid cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... GOD!\" Kiran exclaimed, not knowing quite what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona at that moment wished that the world would just swallow her up whole. But her embarrassment disappeared slightly when she saw the distinct bulge in Kiran's pants and the look of 'stress' on her face. \"Looks like you've got your own problems.\" Mona muttered to Kiran, who looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... um...\" Kiran sighed, rubbing the hard on in her trousers. She thought she'd got it bad with Aaron's junk, but having seen the size of Mona's dick, Kiran knew she'd probably got off somewhat lightly. And neither of them yet knew about Charlotte and Naomi, or Jessica for that matter. Not to mention everyone else who had been accidentally swapped, including their supervisor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After Mona had cleaned up the mess she had made, she tucked her cock back into her trousers, and she couldn't help but notice it was fully erect again A couple of minutes after that it was as though she hadn't even had an orgasm. She was horny as fuck again. She bit her bottom lip and moaned, as Kiran stood there basically doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica told me about the device...\" Mona revealed to Kiran. \"I can't believe you two were so stupid. And now we don't know who's got it, right?\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran just nodded, then winced as she felt her penis twitch again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great!\" Mona grumbled, shaking her head. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A glance at the impressives bulges in the pants of both Charlotte and Jessica also caused him to wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jessica who saw Steven first, and from the look on his face, she could tell something was 'off'. \"Steven?\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven knew the girls wouldn't have been stood around talking, risking Liz catching them, unless they had a damn good reason.

Again Charlotte pulled Naomi into a close embrace, and she let out an animalistic grunt as she felt her huge package rub up against the slightly smaller one tenting her co-worker's skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, shit... w-we shouldn't be d-doing... ugh..\" Naomi tried to fight it still, to no avail. She could almost feel her big hairy balls churning with warm jizz as Charlotte rubbed herself against her. They soon started kissing each other and slipping their tongues into the other's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, any attempt to understand what was happening to them had been abandoned. Both were caught up in the whirlwind of passion... or rather the onslaught of hormones and testosterone. Before long, Charlotte broke the embrace... only to grab Naomi's hand and pull into further into the depths of the warehouse, way out of sight of anyone who might enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep pants and moans escaping her Japanese co-worker's lips only turned Charlotte on further. Charlotte practically ripped Naomi's shirt off over her head, exposing the girl's perky breasts in their plain white bra. A devilish grin formed on charlotte's face as she then bent forward and reached around to unzip Naomi's skirt. Normally the skirt would have just fallen down, but it got snagged on Naomi's erection and therefore needed a little push from Charlotte to help it on it's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi didn't feel the cold air of the warehouse, due to the fact that she was so incredibly turned on, her body temperature was up. She began feeling a incredibly flustered as Charlotte eyed her up like an hungry dog would a horse carcass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte's eyes moved down Naomi's petite, female body... stopping abruptly at the masculine piece of 'equipment' straining against her knickers. The head of her cock was peeking out of the top of Naomi's underwear. It took only a second for Naomi to discard her knickers and allow her 8-inch member to spring free. Slung underneath were two rather large testicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Charlotte's libido was off the charts even more than Naomi's was. And Charlotte was making no effort to fight the lust coarsing through her. She dropped to her knees and grabbed hold of Naomi's hard phallus... before slipping it into her mouth. Charlotte had never given a blowjob in her life before, but the way she sucked Naomi off, it was as though she'd been doing it for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, as her cock filled Charlotte's mouth to the brim, Naomi just let out a loud... feminine moan....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Charlotte was now the most well-hung of the transformees... and it showed, her pants threatning to split apart because of her rigid, nine-inch 'monster'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing Naomi was sat down, otherwise her legs would have buckled beneath her as Charlotte sucked her off. Moments later...Naomi 'squeaked' and then let out a loud moan as her balls tensed up and her cock shot a thick white rope of semen into Charlotte's eager mouth. Evene Charlotte, in her animalistic state, was surprised by just how much jizz entered her mouth. Yet she swallowed it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god... that was.. AMAZING!\" Naomi panted, out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Charlotte of course was unsatisfied, she had not yet cum. She needed to remedy that, and remedy it now. Charlotte wiped her lips and stood up, hastily pushing down her own trousers, revealing her knickers, which had completely failed to contain the huge cock she had sprouted earlier. Naomi's eyes widenened at the sight of the 'behemoth' between Charlotte's feminine legs, it was even bigger than hers. And Naomi could tell that Charlotte had every intention of using it on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith more strength than it seemed she should have had, Charlotte flipped Naomi's body over and around, exposing her cute little ass. And with her own pants and knickers now around her ankles.. Charlotte moved forward... grabbing Naomi's butt cheeks and parting them for easier access. Charlotte let out a surprisingly deep grunt as she thrust her hard cock into Naomi's tight little sphincter and began pumping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi's eyes rolled up into her head as she felt Charlotte enter her, and the pain caused by the entry of such a large penis was quickly drowned out by an intense feeling of pleasure she she was ass-fucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely four minutes later... Charlotte felt the most intense orgasm of her life building... then she blew her load into Naomi's ass, her balls producing almost as much cum as Naomi's had. Charlotte definitely had the bigger cock, but Naomi's balls were bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA normal penis would have begun to deflate after such a session, but Charlotte remained hard as a steel rod as she pulled out of Naomi, and her sex partner's cock also remained stiff as she felt cum dribbling from her stretched butthole. Naomi just let out a faint whimper as she fell onto the boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustratingly, both of them found that they were still horny, despite having orgasmed...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead he did what anyone would have done, he bolted upstairs and made his way into the gent's toilet, pushing the door shut behind him. Panting for breath, he looked at his reflection in the mirror, straightening his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This isn't happening. It can't be happening</i>. Steven repeated to himself in his head as he closed his eyes. He desperately tried to regain his usual feeling in his pants, to no avail. In the end he opened his eyes and unfastened his belt and trousers, pushing his pants down around his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he hesitated... before lowering his boxer shorts. Holy... SHIT!!\" Steven exclaimed loudly, as he stared down at the 'mons veneris' he now possessed. His penis was indeed gone, as were his balls. He'd never seen a vagina in real life before, but he knew that was what he now had between his legs, and situated above it was a thin strip of dark blonde pubic hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his fingers began caressing the outline of his new 'slit', his breathing got heavier. It didn't make any sense. Men just didn't lose their cocks for no reason. His train of thought was abruptly interrupted when his fingers worked their way under his labia and made contact with his new clit. A surge of intense, pleasurable energy shot through Steven and his legs nearly buckled beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly stopped his initial exploration and pulled his pants back up, not daring to go any further. His focus now was on acting as normal as he could, and not letting anyone else know what had happened to him. He wasn't sure whether he could survive the embarrassment... the shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe splashed his face with some cold water, then stared at his reflection again, before putting his glasses back on and making his way back downstairs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can swap with Suki if you want, it's not like she'll know anything, Or there's Rob, Liam or Steven, and what about Shaun? They say some older men have bigger dicks.\" Kiran chuckled, as she continued feeling all kinds of new sensations from her altered crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Jessica said, taking a deep breath to steady her heart a little. Then she set about deciding who she was going to swap herself with.

He was supposed to have been on the pet food section at that moment, helping Phoebe, but instead he was wandering, as if searching for something in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Josh did have something on his mind, and it had something to do with the device in his possession... and in his trouser pocket. The 'Role Swapper' was a device that could switch the lives of any two people. The 'subjects' would supposedly keep their own bodies, but would gain the clothing, hair and life of whoever they were swapped with. Josh hadn't yet had time to try out the device, but now that he was at work, he had his unsuspecting co-workers to use as 'guinea pigs'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most difficult part of the process to Josh, was deciding who to use the device on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

See?\"  Becca reached into her back pocket to pull out her phone to show Rob the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I just want some peace a quiet for at least 10 minutes.\"  Rob said as he continued to work as he said this to Becca.

His wife was apparently not satisfied with her job at the University and she proceeded to gripe at him for every little thing that was going.  He decided that now was a good enough time as any to test out this new device that he picked up on his way to work.  He got it out of his pocket and noticed that the was only one button on it.  He aimed it a Becca and hit the button and then noticed the screen as it said, <span class=\"cred\">'Select 2nd Target</span>'.  He noticed this and then aimed it at Rob and hit the button again.  There wasn't any fireworks or flashes of light.  As soon as Josh hit the button it seemed that Rob and Becca swapped places, they seemed to be wearing each others clothing and also had each others hairstyles as well.  Rob had her blood red hair and Becca similarly had Rob's closely cropped black hair  Then Josh couldn't help but overhear what was going on now that they had swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, stop playing games and go out to the pub every once in awhile and perhaps you will find somebody nice.\"  Rob said, lecturing Becca.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I just want to get this night over with.\"  Becca replied back as she started to get back to work wanting to get this night over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is definitely going to be an interesting night.\"  Josh said to himself as he put the device back in his pocket as not to get it taken away by Liz and since the store was still open for business for the next couple hours, he didn't want a customer to pick it up and take it with him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a brief blinding light that imobilized Josh, then when he could see again he felt... different. His hair was now long, dark brown and secured in a ponytail, and he had on the woman's clothes. He tottered in her stiletto boots for a moment. \"Woah, shit!\" he mumbled, looking down at himself. The jeans he had on were tight, and they emphasized his 'bulge' maybe a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell can people view me as a woman like this?\" Josh asked himself, as he glanced back at the young woman, now wearing his Wilko uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me luv.\" A middle-aged man suddenly said, brushing past Josh, making sure he brushed against his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... \" Josh scowled for a moment, before smirking. \"Luv?\" he chuckled. \"Guess I am a woman to everyone else.\" Josh was now technically a customer, and could now wander the store at will, making whatever swaps he wanted without fear of being caught by Liz or Elizabeth. \"Nice!\" he grinned, kissing his device before clicking off the aisle in his new boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the young woman, Megan, now living Josh's life, continued his duties like nothing had happened.

Leaving Mona and Mark in their swapped state (as he had Becca and Rob earlier), he backtracked and located the woman now living his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reversed their swap, giving himself his life back. But this made him a store employee again, and susceptible to Liz's authority, if she showed up at that time. He knew he had to find someone else to swap with and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon found another customer. A teenage girl, probably about 18 or 19 with short cropped hair. The girl was quite tall, about 5' 9\" and was wearing a red top, a fur-lined jacket, jeans and a pair of Ugg boots. She was currently browsing the toiletries section.

Two perky breasts were pushing out his Wilkos shirt and when he looked down further, he saw the rest of the girl's former body, which he now possessed. Yet he still had his work uniform on, and his name badge too. The device had swapped their bodies insted of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this thing has two functions?\" Josh mumbled, as he held up the device in one of his feminine hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could prove interesting as well, thought with a grin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then he pressed the same button and aimed it at himself.  Like the other times, there was no fanfare to signify that the swap was successful, but instead Josh had to look down at his body and noticed something wrong.  He had his body, but it seemed that he also still had her perky breasts and also... he stuck his hand down at his crotch to feel something, or rather, lack of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly looked to see if could find the young lady that he had swapped with earlier, but he could not find her.  He made his way to the front to see if he would be able to cut her off at the pass, but alas, she was already gone.  \"Great.\"  Josh said as he took stock of his situation.

As he got back to his aisle, Josh felt a vibration coming from his pocket that held his phone.  He took it out and noticed that he had a missed message from a girl named 'Tamara'.

A boy and a girl, roughly the same age (about ten years old). <i>Why not</i>. Josh shrugged, raising his device. A quick zap later and the little boy was wearing his sister's dress and had her pigtails... not to mention her life. And the girl had her brother's life, haircut and his clothes. Josh had used the device's first function on the two kids. A life swap. <i>Awesome!</i> Josh smirked, as he then began to stare off into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daydreaming again Josh?\" Liz's voice suddenly said, startling him somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Seriously?

Steven now had his head on Rebekah's body and Rebekah had her head on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, Steven.\"  Rebekah replied back to him.  \"You know I don't mind helping you out.\"  Josh made a mental note that the 2nd button does a head swap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will come in handy later on.\"  Josh said to himself as he looked down at his body.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He relieved an itch on one of his breasts, then quickly spotted Liam and Jessica in one of the aisles. They weren't working together, it was just fortunate for Josh the two were in such close proximity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam and Jessica were two opposite ends of the spectrum, the former was messy and idle, the latter was 'prissy' and hard working. Josh didn't know exactly what the last button would do to them, but he wanted to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his device... and fired at the two of them. He was disappointed when nothing seemed to happen. Both 'subjects' looked exactly the same. Moments later, Jessica started exiting the aisle, leaving Josh a little disappointed. \"What the hell...?\" he frowned, staring down at the device in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he heard Jessica gasp, and he looked up to see what was wrong. She had clapped eyes on Rebekah, who was now 6' tall and packing a penis in her pants thanks to her head swap with Steven. \"Rebekah!??\" Jessica stared wide-eyed, pointing at her co-worker. \"What the hell happened to you?\" she asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, she knows what's been done.\" Josh muttered. \"Is this an awareness button?\" he asked, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Jess?\" Rebekah replied, looking down at herself. Her name badge apparently had made the swap over along with her head, which made sense. After all she was still 'Rebekah'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body, its... Steven's!\" Jessica mumbled in absolute disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah burst out laughing. \"Yeah, okay, whatever. Are you feeling alright?\" Rebekah responded, her braces showed when she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the situtation could get out of control, Josh raised the device and zapped Jessica (and Liam) again with the last button. To his relief, Jessica started acting normally, talking to Rebekah normally instead. \"That's interesting, I can make anyone aware.\" Josh grinned to himself, as he felt his pussy lips moistening.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If he did a personal swap with somebody, would he forget what happened?  He would have to be careful in the future.  But first, he had to have some fun with Jessica and Liam.  He brought out the remote once more and quickly took aim at his 2 co-workers and hit the Head Swap function.  It was odd to see Jessica's head on top of Liam's lanky form, but even more odd was Liam's head, with his slightly greasy hair atop of Jessica's curvy body.  \"At least, I get to see Liam's body do some work.\"  Josh said laughing.  As a matter of fact he was laughing so hard that he didn't hear Liz approaching from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you weren't done with your section, I would be really upset right now.\"  Liz said behind Josh surprising him and making him jump slightly, causing his already chafed breasts to bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned around to see Liz with her arms crossed and her head cocked slightly to the left.  \"Sorry, Liz, I was looking where I can go next.\"  Josh lied to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're done, you can go help Jessica and Liam complete their section.  Well, speaking of Liam, I am going to see why he's not working anymore.

Josh nodded as he followed her advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at his section and was amazed to see that is was indeed finished.  The people who he had swapped with must have done a great job at stocking the shelves. \"I really don't want to work with Liam and do all the work.\"  Josh said to himself.  \"But perhaps, I can walk the store again and have somebody else do it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first thing he did was press the awareness button again, and then he scanned for his 'victims'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen and Shaun happened to be working nearby. Both were middle-aged, probably why they got along so well. Josh gave it some thought and decided that they were less likely to freak out too much in case of a swap between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go.\" Josh grinned, as he scratched his feminine crotch. He pushed the 'Random' button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick zap of the device caused instantaneous results yet again. Helen let out a gasp and reached up to her chest as her D-cup breasts started shrinking. After just a few seconds, she possessed a flat, hairy chest. And at the same time, her womanly backside had lost it's proportions, changing into a man's backside. Shaun experienced the opposite changes, his ass expanding and stretching his trousers... and his Wilko shirt ballooning out with Helen's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... shit!\" Josh heard Shaun grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, w-w-what happened t-to us, Shaun?\" Helen asked in a frightened tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun had no answers. \"No idea luv.\" he mumbled, groping the twin mounds under his shirt, which were unsupported. But he did notice that apart a few disgusted stares from customers (as a result of Shaun and Helen feeling themselves up), nobody around them seemed to notice too much. \"We just need to stay calm, okay,\" Shaun told Helen, who took a deep breath to try and calm herself, \"now go upstairs, and I'll be up there soon, we can discuss what's happened.\" he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, I'll go now.\" Helen nodded, still panicking. As she left the section, she walked straight past Josh, not paying him any notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was fun.

But after about 20 or so minutes, Josh grew bored once more and he imagined the remote in his pocket calling his name.  He ignored it for the time being and looked around the store to see if it would be beneficial to use it.  He noticed a tall man about the age of 20 looking at some gardening equipment.  He seemed to he about 6' 2\" tall with short black hair and had the musculature of a Rugby player.  Josh scratched an itch that emanated from his feminine crotch and had an idea.  He thought about using the device to switch his genitals with the guy and be a man again.  He got out the device and scanned himself and took aim at the man and fired.  But his amazement soon turned to horror as he noticed that his muscles were now gone, instead of growing.  He noticed blonde hair showing in front of his eyes.  He took his hand and felt his head to notice that his hair was also longer and seemed to go down to the middle of his back. He felt his hair go all the way down and kept going down to his bum to notice that it seemed bigger, fuller, and more feminine.  He looked up to see what may had caused this to occur and noticed a young girl perhaps around the age of 14 or 15 talking to the young man.  \"Daniel,  why are you looking at this stuff?  You know Mum and Dad won't let you plant a garden until May.\"  She said to her brother, but she now had Josh's normally short brown hair and his muscles too.  Josh could theorize that she also had his bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just keep your mouth shut, you little brat.\"  Daniel said to his little sister almost with a tone like he was talking to somebody lower than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at him and seemed to sulk for a minute.  \"I may be little, but I'm not a brat.\"  She replied back to him.  \"I can keep my own on the rugby pitch.  Remember last week when I was able to score those goals, while you didn't?\"  She seemed to be proud of this fact.  Josh didn't know if that was usually the case, or now that she had his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew he had to get his muscles back and thought that if he just shot her again with the random button like last time, he would have a good chance at getting it back. He decided to try and do it.  He took the device and scanned himself and then aimed the device, making sure to take more care in aiming, and scanned her too.  The changes seemed to be more pronounced than before, he shrunk down to her former height, and that seemed to be it.  He looked up to see that she and her brother were now out of sight.  \"Not again.\"  Josh said to himself as he looked all around to see if he could find them, but his smaller stature proved to be too much for him and noticed that they were no where to be found.  He stood there with his hands on his hips acting like he didn't get his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Josh didn't know was that he got her girly mannerisms and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh brushed his long blonde hair from his face. \"This is like... so lame!\" he then sighed, as he looked down at his shorter, more feminine frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny thing was, Josh now had traits a lot of girls would kill for, but along with the teenage girl's hair, musculature and height, he also had her attitude. The attitude of a 14-year old girl who felt the purpose of the world was to gang up on her. As with most teenagers, she'd had trouble in school with her teachers, which led to her being suspended for a time. Now all that bottled up frustration and aggression belonged to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should so throw this fucking thing in the trash!\" Josh grumbled, glaring at his remote for a minute. Even his mannerisms were now those of a teenage girl, but with his assortment of feminine traits, he didn't look too bizarre in the way he acted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, what's that thing in your hand?\" A familiar voice suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh just fucking great!</i> Josh rolled his eyes, keeping his back turned to Liz for a moment before facing her. \"It's just a TV remote I had to buy for home, that's all. It's not my phone or anything.\" he responded to Liz's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should still be upstairs in your locker, and NOT on your person.\" Liz admonished him, while being totally oblivious to his drasticaly feminized appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I get it. It won't happen again okay. Just... get off my back?\" Josh said, trying to stay calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz scolded him further, folding her arms as she stood there. \"I'm on your back for a reason, you're not getting your work done. Now if I catch you slacking again I'll be reporting you to Elizabeth, am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" Josh sighed, again rolling his eyes as he slipped his remote into his pocket just so Liz would leave him be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lecture finished, Liz gave Josh one last stare before walking off to check on some of her other staff.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh couldn't help but feel for the boy and wished somebody would talk that way to him.  Unbeknownst to Josh, the female personality was fighting his male one in his mind and it would be only a matter of time before it completely took over.  Josh shook his head as he tried to get some reasoning back in his head and heard Julia answer him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, I don't know if I'm ready.\"  Julia said with a conflicting look on her face.  Josh didn't know if Julia had feelings for Eric or if she was trying to let him on.  \"I mean, it's been a month since Barry and I broke up and he cheated on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I think you should go with me.  I will make it better for you and your future.\"  Eric said with a slightly more assertive tone.  \"I just think you're too crazy in love with Barry still that you just don't want to go with me.\"  Josh was flabbergasted at what he just saw, what seemed to be a sweet guy trying to ask a friend out turned into an uglier person in a matter of minutes.  Josh knew he had to fix it.  He got out the remote and hit the awareness button, to ensure that the would know what was going on and scanned both of them.  After the scanning was complete, he hit the Life Swap button and soon Eric had Julia's shoulder length red hair, her blue dress, and her knee high boots.  \"What just happened, Julia?\"  He yelled at Julia who was now had Eric's former shaggy black hair, Iron Man t-shirt, jeans, and his converse sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Eric.\"  She replied back to him.  \"Why are you wearing my clothes and have my hair?\"  Julia didn't know what was going on and decided to run out of the store before anything else happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia wait!\"  Eric cried out as he tried to run after her, but seemed to stumble slightly with his new boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That went well.\"  Josh said with a smirk.  \"I bet he will treat ladies with much more respect now.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He took his time thinking instead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a slut!\" Josh grumbled under his breath, as he watched the girl parade around in her short, floral-print skirt, showing off her tanned legs. Josh was thinking just how a normal teenage girl would think right now. Every sexy girl he saw he would have a hint of jealousy for. This blonde girl with the long, shapely legs (her name was Kylie) was no exception. \"Time for things to turn hairy.\" Josh chuckled, fiddling with his remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he toggled the Awareness function on again, he hit the swap button. The blonde girl's legs were suddenly swapped with those of a middle-aged man nearby.

The bus had broken down halfway to town and so she had had to make the rest of the journey on foot, and quick enough to avoid being late. But despite her damp, wind swept hair, she was in a contented mood. She always wore her hair like it was styled for Halloween anyway, so if anything the wind had added to that effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting her way into the toilets, Jade passed Nicola on her way out. The two shared a smile and a brief greeting, then Jade walked over to the mirror, staring at her reflection. It was her usual reflection, intentionally unkempt hair, several piercings in her face and a heavy coat of make-up, particularly mascara. She chewed on her lower lip for a while, then dug into her bag and produced a little doll. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/mUiwTGT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/mUiwTGT.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a 'Yarn Doll', left to her by her late grandmother, along with a hand written letter that explained how 'special' the doll was. Whoever held the doll had the ability to exchange people's bodies or individual body parts. Only the people who had touched the doll would notice the swaps, everyone else would have their perception of reality altered. At least... that was what her grandmother had told her in the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade held the doll in one of her hands, adorned with black nail polish, and she rubbed it's face with her thumb. She knew she could have tested the doll out on the way to work, but with the bus breaking down, she hadn't really had time to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now she was at work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer concentration was broken when the door to the toilets opened. Jade shoved the doll back into her bag and turned to see who ths 'intruder' was. She was relieved to see that it was Suki, the other new girl besides herself. \"Heya!\" Suki smiled, waving at Jade in her usual chirpy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Jade muttered, in a monotone voice. Jade had to admit, she and Suki were at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of personality and appearance. But they were both new to Wilkos, so they had quickly become friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Suki asked, her smile diminishing slightly, but not significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade shook her head. \"No, everything's fine. apart from me being soaked.\" she said, removing her damp jacket. She then made a few minor alterations to her wet hair, but decided to let it dry on it's own rather than use the hand dryer. As Suki disappeared into a cubicle to relieve herself, Jade glanced at her bag again, carefully pondering her next move. Should she try the doll out on her own? Or bring Suki in on this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck it!</i> Jade eventually thought, waiting for Suki to come out of the cubicle. Then she practically shoved the Yarn Doll into Suki's face. \"Look at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki frowned, stepping back a little so she could get a clearer look. \"Very pretty. Did you make it?\" she inquired of Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. My grandmother left it to me.\" she said, pulling her arm back in and studying the doll again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that's sweet.\" Suki murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not all...\" Jade continued, before describing the supposed powers of the doll, and the fact that only the people actually touching the doll at the time would notice the changes. Of course Suki was highly skeptical. \"There's only one way to find out.\" Jade smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was to test it out on one or more of their co-workers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am working!\" Liam countered with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working just half a cage of stock in 40 minutes is NOT working.\" Jade barked. She was right, Liam was a waste of space. As Jade shook her head and opened another box she suddenly saw Nicola dropping a box off on another aisle. Another smirk formed on her face. She could at least make it so that Liam took up less space. She took her yarn doll out again and focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam suddenly dropped down a full eight inches in height, and his trousers bunched up around his ankles. Conversely, Nicola received a height boost as she grew to Liam's former height. Luckily she had worn a skirt and tights to work that day, so it was only the hem of her skirt that shifted further up her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you smiling at?\" Jessica suddenly chuckled, when she saw Jade's expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade shrugged her shoulders. \"Hmm, nothing important.\" Jade did notice though that with each swap she made, the more excicted she grew. Her cock throbbed repeatedly until she had a full blown erection again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be something on your mind.\" Jessica pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, nothing really.\" Jade repeated. Then she went to put some stock on a shelf. \"Move it shortass!\" she said to Liam firmly, looking down on him. Feeling somewhat intimidated by the two taller women working with him, Liam moved aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, Jade was loving this...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Out of nowhere a box came flying in Jade's direction, bouncing off the floor and hitting her in the shin. \"Ouch!\" Jade yelled, before looking at the guilty party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Aaron of all people. \"That's on your section.\" he grunted at Jade. For a moment she thought he might have been getting back at her for 'stealing' his penis, but then... he wasn't aware, so that couldn't be it. No, he was just being his normal careless self. Throwing boxes of stock around was dangerous. She decided he needed a lesson too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to fix it so that he wouldn't be able to throw boxes of stock around anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasily done. And luckily Nicola was once again on hand, passing by Jade's aisle to deposit another box on a different aisle. \"Sorry Nikki, but this is a necessity...\" Jade mumbled, grasping her yarn doll again. A second or two later she had swapped Nicola's and Aaron's heads onto each other's bodies. \"There we go.\" Jade grinned, as she watched Nicola return to her aisle. Nicola now had Aaron's body from the neck down, except for Jade's vagina. And Aaron, well... he had Nicola's modified, 5' 8\" tall, 44-year old body, with much less muscle than he was used to. <i>The skirt suits him.</i> Jade laughed. <i>And the boobs...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she'd thank me if she knew.\" Jade then smirked, referring to Nicola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Jade was planning on reversing all these swaps, even her own once she had reveled in the powers of her doll for a while. But there was no rush. She was further tickled at the sight of Steven rushing past her again, his shirt distended by Liz's huge tits. He looked somewhat uncomfortable, probably because of the lack of a bra to support his new 'weights'. <i>Serves him right, running into me...</i> Jade thought, as she returned to work again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped nobody else would annoy her that night.

She let out a squeal after a few minutes of tugging on her cock, and she felt an outflow of pent up pressure... in the form of a sticky white rope of cum which was squirted into the toilet. Her aim was better than Jade's had been, and only a bit of it ended up on the floor. <i>Oh shit...</i> Suki gasped, out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd never ever experienced anything like that, obviously. The grin, mixed with droplets of sweat on her forehead, confirmed she had enjoyed it. She looked down as the last drops of cum oozed out of her penis, then she relaxed her bladder and started urinating... for the first time while stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done cleaning up her little mess, Suki glared down again at the now semi-erect, white penis she currently possessed. She smiled and then tucked it back into her trousers. Good thing Mark wasn't missing it. She washed her hands at the sink, dried them, and then exited the restroom and jogged downstairs, more full of energy than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised to see Jade waiting at the end of one of the aisle when she took a slight detour. \"Hey.\" Suki muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade had a 'I know what you did' look on her face. \"Feels good doesn't it?\" she said to Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" Suki nodded, now grinning broadly. \"Can I keep it for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was accepting of that idea. \"Sure, I can swap us back tomorrow, along with a few others I've had some fun with.\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, who?\" Suki pried, eager to know what other changes her friend had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade bit her lip briefly. \"I swapped Nicola's and Liam's heights, then Nicola's and Aaron's heads, oh.. and Steven ran into me and knocked me over, so I gave him Liz's boobs to carry around.\" she revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was amused. \"Steven has Liz's breasts?\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, look.\" Jade replied, pointing Steven out. Suki looked at her male co-worker, specifically at the massive, unrestrained breasts pushing his shirt out, and the nipples trying their best to poke through the fabric. \"I think Liz should give him her bra at least.\" Suki laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he'll have back ache for sure by the end of today.\" Jade chuckled. Then she produced the yarn doll from her pocket and gave it a moment's thought. \"Here, you can have this for a night if you want. If my day continues like it has been I'll have swapped the whole shop before the end of the shift.\" she said. Jade wanted to remove the temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Suki asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely, have some fun.\" Jade nodded. \"Just... no swapping me without my knowing.\" she winked, rubbing the bulge in her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Liz appeared in view again, Suki slipped the yarn doll into her pocket and started heading back to her section. \"Just went to the bathroom Liz.\" she muttered in passing, taking a moment to study her supervisor's flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis!\" a familiar voice suddenly shouted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki spun around in shock. \"Salim?\" It was her older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalim threw the bar of soap he was holding up in the air and caught it again as he approached his little sister. He cut straight to the chase. \"That woman who just helped me, your supervisor right? Didn't she have a big pair of tits the last time I saw her?\" he asked inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Suki completely off guard. How could her brother notice such a thing if he didn't have a doll? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things got more complicated when Salim happened to look down at his sister's groin... seeing a definite bulge. His eyebrow arched in curiosity, and a smirk even appeared on his face. \"Alright sis, what the hell is going on in this place?\" he asked, as he watched one of Suki's male co-workers (Aaron) walk past, his head firmly affixed to an older woman's (Nicola's) body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...\" Suki mumbled, totally unsure how to react.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suki's flat-chested supervisor, the guy with a female body from the neck down, and more importantly... the bulges in the pants of their younger sibling and her redheaded co-worker. The cause of all those things... something called a 'yarn doll'. Of course Maya wasn't impressed with the 'fairy tale' at first, but the more Salim told her, she could sense his excitement.

Suki liked Nicola, she was helpful, polite, very much a mother-figure. And de<i></i>spite the fact that being taller and having stronger muscles could be classed as 'positive' changes, she returned Nicola to normal. However she decided to leave Steven and Liz as they were, since Jade had seemed particularly proud of that swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now that Suki had some practise using the doll, she felt more confident with it. Abandoning her work station again, she began to wander to the next couple of aisles, contemplating making a few 'minor' swaps to her co-workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now though, she should have known that Liz was never far away, and was always on the ball. \"Suki, how many times do I have to send you back to your own section?\" the supervisor said in a firm... but fairly polite manner. \"Stop wandering!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry Liz.\" came the inevitable apology from Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki trudged back to her aisle, and Liz followed her, only to head in another direction and onto the toiletries aisle. She checked up on another couple of staff and then started to count some stock on the shelves nearby. Suki just studied her supervisor for a time. Liz looked even more flat from a side profile without her large breasts. Suki felt her cock hardening again, straining against the fabric of her knickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why does she always catch me?</i> Suki thought, sulking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Suki was feeling bitterness and she wanted to make further swaps to Liz. She knew she could always reverse them before she went home anyway. And she knew it would no doubt make her feel better. A part of Suki knew that Liz was only doing her job, as irritating as that job was. But... it wasn't as though she'd be aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki's internal <i>t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate</i> went on for a few moments, before she finally made her decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her usual response to crimes against her being was to keep walking. Forgive and forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, just a little couldn't hurt... Besides, Liz wouldn't be aware, so it shouldn't hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then came the hard part: what to swap? She didn't want to change her physique too much, that might rip poor Liz's clothes. Nor did she want to do anything to Liz's beautiful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was all she could really think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Suki tightly shut her eyes and focused on the doll. She imagined Aaron with Liz's blondish ponytail, and Liz with Aaron's short hairstyle. She felt a slight tingle run down her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid it work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited one... two... three... seconds before opening her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...huh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it was just as she had pictured it. Neither party seemed to care as Liz continued her one-sided conversation with a still-working Aaron. Suki can only catch snippets, including the words \"boxes,\" \"nails,\" and \"crosses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swap wasn't as satisfying as she expected it to be, but, at least she wasn't upset anymore.

Her male co-worker was working away on his section, emptying cages, filling shelves, all the while unaware of his rather drastic change. The unsupported, 30H-cup breasts hung from his chest were hanging pretty low, and his nipples were evident. Each move he made was accompanied by a lot of 'sway' and jiggling. Jade felt her cock throb in her pants as she saw Steven's shirt struggling to contain his mammaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Steven.\" Jade greeted him, trying not to smile too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked up as he broke an empty box down. \"Oh, hi Jade. S-sorry for earlier, didn't mean to knock you down.\" he apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's alright, at least I had a soft landing.\" Jade dismissed it. \"I just had to ask, why don't you wear a bra? I mean... as <i>big</i> as you are, it must be uncomfortable having your boobs bouncing all over the place right? And also... everyone can basically see your nipples.\" she whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked down at his large bust, then scratched his head. \"Um... I have thought about it, but... I'm not a cross-dresser. Bras are for women.\" he grumbled as he lifted his heavy breasts in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade smirked. \"I'm sure people would understand.\" she said. \"Think of your back too. It must be bad enough having to lug those things around all day without having them swinging loose under your shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it.\" Steven sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ask Liz if you can borrow her bra?\" Jade suggested cheekily. \"I mean it's not as though she needs it right? God knows why she wears one.\" she chuckled, eliciting a raised eyebrow from Steven. Realizing she'd gone about as far as she could 'poking' Steven, Jade waved at him and wandered off his section. \"See ya later.\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back to her own section Jade saw Aaron walking by. His head was back on his own body (with Jade's vagina), but now he had blondish-brown hair done up in a ponytail. Jade recognized the hair as Liz's. <i>Looks like Suki has been having some fun...</i> Jade grinned to herself. She was thinking about quickly paying a visit to Suki's aisle when Liz's voice sounded over the tannoy. \"Break time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect timing.\" Jade smiled, hurrying off upstairs with everyone else. Steven was the last one up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice swap!\" Jade complimented Suki, gesturing to Liz and Aaron. Both girls had to admit, Liz looked downright weird with short, dark hair and a flat chest. \"Why don't we keep swapping her?\" Jade chuckled quietly, as she sat next to Suki in the tea room and took a drink of her soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki rubbed her hard on through her trousers and just glanced at her friend, smirking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wielding such power over their friends and co-workers, Liz's odd appearance, Aaron's increasingly feminized state, it was no wonder Jade and Suki both had steely erections straining their knickers. And when Steven sat down nearby, allowing his heavy breasts to rest on the table, Jade groaned slightly and excused herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing where Jade was off to, Suki had a last amused chuckle at Liz before following her friend to the restroom. \"God I'm already hard again!\" Jade said as Suki walked in the door. \"Please tell me it's having the same effect on... oh - I see that it is.\" she mumbled, staring at the obvious tent in Suki's trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course it is silly.\" Suki smirked. \"I'm hard as a rock.\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure men aren't like this all the time, are they? Though that would explain some things.\" Jade reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki loked down at herself for a moment, then returned her gaze to Jade. \"So... we swapping back with the guys tonight or tomorrow?\" she asked her, secretly hoping it would be the latter. Suki liked having Mark's sizeable penis in her pants. She correctly assumed that she had the biggest dick in the store now, and she wanted to have some fun with it when she got home.

Suki meanwhile put more time and feeling into her little 'session', enjoying every second. Jade came first, and Suki a couple of minutes later. \"Oh god, that will never get old.\" Jade moaned out loud, realizing she'd missed the toilet bowl again. <i>Damn.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was then an announcement made on the tannoy system. \"Are we ready people? Break's over.\" The voice was definitely Aaron's, but it was obvious that it was Liz making the announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, back to the grind.\" Suki sighed as she flushed the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the yarn doll from her pocket, Suki grinned to herself, running her thumb over it's head.

She was Maya's girlfriend and Salim admired the view, so Suki found herself outvoted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was things like this that Suki disliked about Rachel. Even if Rachel seemed to be trying to get along with Suki, she just couldn't keep these types of habits in the bedroom... or closet... or wherever. Ah well, at least this whole ordeal proved that even with her massive libido, Suki was still straighter than an arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki proceeded to her room, slammed the door shut, and locked it with a click. She needed to be safe. Whatever Salim and Maya were planning could range from pranking her in the bed to... shudder... stealing the doll from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh well, the locked door was almost always enough to keep them out. Still, Suki was careful to hide the doll before she stretched herself out and laid down on the bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So to kill some time they decided to let Rachel in on their little scheme. Skeptical at first, as Maya had been, Rachel soon found herself willing to believe. But that still left the problem of the locked door between them and the item they sought to steal from Suki. \"So, anyone got the ability to phase shift through doors?\" Rachel joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya instinctively looked at her brother, since he normally had a solution to problems that cropped up. And tonight's problem was no different. \"You don't seriously think I'd let Suki have 100% privacy do you?\" he smirked, produding a key from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a copy made of her key?\" Maya inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I knocked it up myself in my little key shop in the basement.\" Salim responded sarcastically. He then sat back in his chair and suggested that they give it a while longer before heading upstairs. Suki was normally in bed by 11:00pm on any normal night. They gave her while 12:00am tonight. As Salim switched the TV on and kept the volume down, Maya and Rachel began to discuss the 'wonderful' thought of the former having a real penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\nAt 11:55pm, the three of them crept silently upstairs, Salim in front, then Rachel and finally Maya bringing up the rear. \"Not a sound.\" Salim whispered, putting a forefinger to his lips. He then edged closer to his little sister's room. Rachel and Maya decided to stay put. Rachel was prone to uncontrolled giggles when excited which would definitely give them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Salim did was poke a straw into the keyhole and gently nudge Suki's key out, onto the carpeted floor. Then he slid his key in and ever so gently turned it until he heard the click. He paused, listening for any noise from inside the bedroom. He smiled when he heard a little snore. He proceeded to creep into the bedroom and saw Suki sound alseep under the bed sheets. As tempted as he was to peek under the sheets to check out Suki's new manhood, he refrained, and instead began to methodically, and silently search her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going through Suki's drawers, her jewelry box on her dresser, then her bag, Salim was about to give up, when suddenly he remembered Suki kept a little flowered box under her bed, where she kept odd trinkets and such. He quietly retrieved the box and opened it... but no luck. <i>Damn.</i> As he gave the room another once over, he noticed a small vent in the corner of the room. One of the screws hadn't been put back in properly. Salim produced a small multi-tool from his back pocket and undid the other screws, quietly removing the vent. <i>Bingo!</i> There was the yarn doll, just sat there, almost smiling at him. He pocketed the doll, then glanced back to check that Suki was still sleeping before putting the vent back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis, love you.\" Salim whispered, saluting his sleeping sister before exiting her bedroom and locking her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Maya and Rachel asked in unison, their eyes full of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalim looked dejected at first, then he took the doll from his pocket and showed it to them. \"This is where the fun begins.\" he grinned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was 12:15am and it was a cool night, all the better. He pocketed the doll and took in a breath of air. Then he peered into his pants and stuck a hand down in front. Sure enough his equipment was gone, replaced by a feminine slit - his sister's vagina. It was quite a change, and one he was taking all in his stride. He had fantastized about this sort of thing for years after all. He felt a whole new sensation as he ran his fingers over the outline of his new pussy, he was getting 'wet'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis concentration was suddenly broken when he heard a couple of voices in the street. They got louder, one male voice, one female. Salim waited to see who it was, given the late hour he correctly assumed it was a couple heading home from a night out. \"Ahh, Cindy.\" Salim smirked, recognizing one of his neighbors from down the street. She was a 23-year old blonde, about 5' 7\", and she was with another new boyfriend. Salim didn't recognize him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalim stayed out of sight and got the doll from his pocket, getting more aroused as he did so. <i>Could do with a bit more practise I suppose.</i> He was about to swap the couple's genitals as he had done with him and Maya, but then decided to move higher up their bodies. <i>She always did love showing off her tits.</i> Salim thought, looking at Cindy's ample C-cups in her low-cut party top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick second later and Cindy's cleavage was gone, her top hanging limp against her flat, hairy chest. Her boyfriend on the other hand now had two noticeable mounds pushing out his t-shirt. There we go. I'm already an expert at this.\" Salim complimeted himself on another swap well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nobody else in the street, Salim soon retreated back into the house. He wasn't ready for the sight that greeted him. Rachel was already sucking Maya off, giving her girlfriend her first ever blowjob. And Maya was lost in ecstasy, her head tipped back on the couch... moaning. \"Aww come on you two, there's a bedroom upstairs you know.\" Salim grumbled. Still.. the scene did turn him on a bit, knowing that it was technically 'his' dick that Rachel was sucking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, mm,\" Rachel moaned, unable to say anything as her head bobbed up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalim just shook his head, then decided to show his authoritative side. \"Right, bugger off upstairs and do that, the couch is mine tonight.\" he said. Rachel scowled at him, then reluctantly stopped sucking Maya's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Rachel groaned, getting to her feet. Maya seemed unsteady on her feet when she first got up, and she left her penis hanging out as Rachel pulled her upstairs to her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And keep the noise down, don't want to wake Suki up.\" Salim advised as he slumped down on the couch. Once he was on his own, he inserted a hand into his pants again and this time slid two fingers into his snatch. \"Ooooh shit... that feels good!\" he gasped, breaking into a wicked little chuckle. \"Thanks sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt proved to be a very satisfying night all the trio...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Understandable, Maya was still in college. On days when she had classes, she usually stayed in Rachel's apartment.

Also, while upstairs, He also noticed that the wash was already on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot going to touch that one with a ten-foot pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in the middle of fixing himself some breakfast when he heard the floorboards creak up above.

Her eyes didn't match. Still, she sat down at the table and shared the breakfast with him. Salim could guess what gnawed at her, and she was pretty quick to bring it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" She said between mouthfuls of eggs. \"Have you seen a doll? One that is made of yarn? I thought I placed it in my room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't seen it.\" Thankfully, deception was always one of Salim's strong suits, and considering his sister was stupidly naive and trusting, it made for a great combination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see...\" She bowed her head.</span></div></div>",

Jade naturally just frowned, then shrugged as she turned to face her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jade answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber folded her arms, not impressed with her big sister playing ignorant. \"I saw you nipping to the bathroom earlier, through the crack in my door. And either you've taken to shoving a pair of rolled up socks down your knickers, or... you've got something you shouldn't have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was partly confused, partly aghast at what Amber had to say. For a moment she was rendered speechless. \"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Amber snapped impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you notice?\" Jade asked her. \"That's not how it works, you shouldn't be able to notice that I've got... er... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber cut her off. \"A dick?\" she said, arching an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade sighed, biting her bottom lip. Knowing that playing ignorant was not going to work with her sister anymore, she told her everything about the doll, and about the reality altering effects that apparently didn't work on everyone after all. And she also explained how she'd swapped her vagina with one of her male co-workers' genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Amber smirked, glancing down at her sister's crotch after she'd pushed her jeans down to her knees for a moment. \"So... where is this doll?\" she asked Jade, who just let out another, more despondent sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave it to Suki to look after last night, and she just sent me a text. She's lost it apparently.\" Jade revealed to Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the award for dumbest move ever goes to...\" Amber rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what? You're stuck with that thing?\" Amber pointed to the bulge in her sister's knickers, shortly before Jade pulled her jeans back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until we find the doll again, yeah. And we WILL find it!\" Jade replied in a determined tone. \"Besides, Suki's in the same boat as me remember, and her dick is bigger than mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A stick thin girl like that packing a big dick, I've got to see that.\" Amber chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, I'm meeting up with her at work. You can come too if you want, the store doesn't close while 5:30pm, I start at 4:00pm.\" Jade suggested. She knew her sister wouldn't refuse now that she knew about the doll and what it could do. The two sisters then spent the rest of Jade's free time together before her shift, and they caught the bus together.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She paced back in forth while chewing her bottom lip, in order to deal with her growing panic. The moment Jade walked into view, she was showered with apologies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade had many flaws, one of them being impulsiveness, but thankfully for Suki, holding grudges wasn't one of them. She was of a more practical mind, and grudges did not exactly solve any problems. It took a while to get the conversation back in a more productive direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hid it in your vent?\" Jade asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Suki muttered. \"I don't know what happened. It was there last night and then, it vanished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade had to admit, it wasn't a terrible hiding spot. At the very least, there were very little ways for it to get lost. Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you say that your brother knew about the swaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki nodded. \"Yeah, but he didn't know about the doll. Besides, he said he didn't know where it was this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Jade rolled her eyes. Suki was way too trusting. \"Didn't your sister and her girlfriend also leave this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the only explanation that Jade could come up with. Someone stole the doll right out of the vent. She highly doubted that Suki, say, hid the doll and pretended she lost in to Jade, so that just left one of the siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Suki muttered. \"I never asked her.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The list of suspects was pretty short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do!\" Suki nodded, brushing her hair out of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade glanced at her watch. \"Come on, we'd better get in there, Liz will kill us if we're late.\" she groaned, before leading Suki in the store, upstairs and into the locker room to secure their belongings.

Suki had neglected to inform Jade and her sister that her brother Salim was also in Wilko, doing some 'shopping'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\nMeanwhile, Salim was calmly strolling down the aisles, somehow managing to restrain himself for now. He had the doll in his possession, and that was what mattered to him. But the mere thought of toying with those around him was making him wet. He still hadn't got used to having his sister's pussy between his legs. But it was a very pleasant experience to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have we here?\" Salim mumbled to himself as he saw one of the store's male employees - 'Steven' - working nearby. A large pair of breasts stretching his company shirt to it's limits. <i>Suki's handiwork?</i> Salim smirked, studying Steven's appearance. Salim rememberd seeing Suki's supervisor yesterday, completely flat-chested. These were obviously her boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just then, Salim clapped eyes on the store supervisor Liz as she rounded a corner. \"Let's put those back shall we.\" he mumbled to himself. \"Nice to start off with a relatively clean slate.\" he added. Though he knew that there were probably two other male employees in the store somewhere who were missing their dicks, courtesy of Jade and Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a simple thought, Steven massive mammaries melted away, and Liz's shirt filled out again as her breasts returned. She'd fortunately also worn a bra that morning despite being flat-chested, so her breasts at least had the necessary support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so easy.\" Salim chuckled in a devilish manner as he continued looking around.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was utterly ecstatic and it showed in the light spring to his step. He would not look out of place if someone played a country song to his walk. He got a couple of odd looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, time to get to business.\" He straightened up a bit, adopting a very business-like posture. \"First things first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned into the toiletries section... and immediately grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo guys and two girls.

Um... no... n-n-never mind, sorry.\" Amber stuttered. She then staggered backwards a little before turning, her eyes frantically scouring the immediate vicinity for any signs of her sister Jade. \"God... it hurts.\" Amber winced again, staring down at her groin. The bulge was huge... and the constriction was overwhelming. <i>How can I just grow a fucking dick??</i> she asked, panting a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's her deal?\" Luke asked Mona, oblivious of the 'emptiness' in his own pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows.

So... what's the cause of this joy?\" David asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalim wasted no time in producing the yarn doll from his pocket and passed it to David. \"This is.\" Salim mumbled. David handled the doll for a moment, and clearly he was unimpressed. \"Er... okay then.\" he said, handing it back to Salim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalim had always had a habit of confiding in David in the past, and now was no different. The idea of him having a 'sidekick' for his little swapping adventure appealed to him. \"I can swap people's body parts with this.\" Salim informed David, only to be greeted with the expected scepticism. \"And before you accuse me or talking shit, just watch.\" Salim smirked. \"You still have your breast fetish I'm guessing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded, then glanced around. \"Hey, keep it down, and yes I do, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalim pointed out a woman down the aisle they were on browsing the car care products. She was in her late twenties, had cropped brown hair and was wearing a sky-blue blouse, black trouser suit and 2-inch heeled court shoes. She wasn't particularly stunning, but she did have nice tits, maybe a D-cup. \"Alright, pick out a random guy.\" Salim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid, frowning, selected a man stood just behind the woman, in his early 40s maybe, shopping for light bulbs. \"Him, he's closest.\" David muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalim nodded, then looked towards the two unsuspecting customers. David's jaw fell open in shock as he saw the woman's blouse seemingly 'collapse' against her deflating chest. Conversely... the striped shirt of the man behind her ballooned out, a button popping off it as he grew the woman's ample breasts. \"Holy shit!\" David exclaimed out loud, looking at Salim. \"It's really true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course it is.\" Salim responded proudly. Then he proceeded to tell David everything he knew about the doll, where he had got it from, what his sister Suki and her friend had already done with it, and also... that Salim now had his sister Maya's pussy between his legs. Needless to say, David was astonished. \"So, you want to join me for a little fun?\" Salim offered David with a cheeky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid only had one answer on his mind. \"Definitely!\" he nodded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange thing to build a friendship on, but back in their school days, that was literally how they had met. They were a pair of open pervert outcasts who turned to each other for protection. Sure they found other interests in common later, such as video games and soccer, but this was what sparked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't to say they shared every fetish in common. While David shared an interest in transexuals with Salim, it was something of a distant second to his main fetish, breasted men and flat-chested women. That was the point of contention with Salim. In Salim's opinion, the more things jiggling on women, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was Salim who had the doll, David was fine with taking a backseat to his friend's ambitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around this time when a particularly lovely sample darted in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check her out.\" David whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Suki had not started work here since fairly recently, Salim wasn't particularly familiar with the staff, only knowing a handful of names and faces, Jade being one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he would never miss the sexy perfection that was the supervisor Liz... that is, if he hadn't seen her about five minutes ago. He was rather shocked he didn't swap her back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, if luck would have it, she was being followed by a leather-clad, tattoo-covered biker-looking person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalim quickly threw a disapproving glare to David. \"She keeps the breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" After looking through so many pornographic websites, David had grown quite skilled, almost uncannily so, at measuring the size of women's breasts on glance, and he knew Liz to be a genuine 30H cup.

She lifted the hem of her Wilko shirt and gasped at the sight of an unfamiliar... and sizeable bulge in her trousers. As she watched... it swelled even larger as her new member started becoming aroused. <i>What's happened to me...?</i> Liz panicked, letting her shirt drop back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took a brief look at her reflection in the mirror before entering a stall and closing the door. She already suspected what it was now stretching her knickers, but she wanted visible proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnzipping her trousers, Liz reached inside and tugged her knickers down... and her eyes grew wide in shock as a fully erect penis sprang into view. She estimated it's length at about six, maybe even seven inches, certainly bigger than her husband Eric's was. But the answer to the question at the forefront of her mind evaded her. Why did she have it? And more importantly... where was her vagina?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the door open, Liz quickly snapped herself out of her crotch stare and pushed her cock back into her restrictive knickers. The pressure on her new balls was terribly uncomfortable. She composed herself as best she could, then stepped out of the stall. Luckily, her Wilko shirt was long enough to cover most of the obvious bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya Liz.\" Waggy greeted her supervisor when she saw her. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz didn't know how to respond at first. \"Um... fine.\" she lied.

There was no smooth blending of skin where the rest of her body and it connected, just a line of a nearly-black chocolate color and white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think she had once been looking forward to this...

Thinking more clearly, she invited Brian in and he removed his jacket. With that off, Amber was able to better size up his new bosom. He had to have been a large B-cup, maybe a small C-cup. She had to wonder at that instance whether any other part of Brian's body had been swapped out. She looked down to his crotch, but because of the quite baggy trousers he wore, she was unable to tell whether he still had his manhood or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking hot!\" Brian complimented Amber, who instantly began blushing. She looked down at herself, knowing that her big black balls had to be close to hanging below the hem of her mini skirt... which she knew would raise like a theater curtain every time she got an erection.

The inevitable cruscendo followed the intercourse and Maya squealed like a schoolgirl as she blew her load into Rachel's welcoming pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, they collapsed onto their backs, side by side. They watched Maya's penis slowly go flaccid as cum leaked from the tip. \"Oh my fucking god, that felt... amazing!\" Maya gasped for breath, wiping sweat from her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel agreed, though it wasn't the first time she'd been impaled by a penis. There was that life changing moment when she was 18 when she found out she was actually into girls and not boys. Her first and last boyfriend had been so lame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame I have to wait a while before I'm ready again.\" Maya then grumbled, propping herself up on her elbows and gazing down at her now limp member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comes with the package... literally.\" Rachel chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya shared her girlfriend's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So guess it's a no brainer that you're keeping that thing?\" Rachel gestured down to Maya's dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Maya grinned, now breathing more easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't mind trying one myself.\" Rachel mumbled, before exhaling deeply. She was jealous of Maya's new equipment. Obvious case of penis envy. Though probably the first ever case between a lesbian couple. Or maybe not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can ask Salim to get you one.\" Maya suggested with a slight shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun. Will he be at home?\" Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sent me a text, he took Suki to work. And knowing him, he'll probably be scoping the place out.\" Maya answered. A smirk appeared on her face. \"It's not far, my sister works at Wilkos, you know the store near the bus station?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I know it.\" Rachel nodded. \"I can drive us there if you want.\" she added, a mischievous smile also playing around Rachel's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah maybe, but... when we're done here.\" Maya cooed, moving in to cuddle and kiss Rachel...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one around to disturb Salim from his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, he needed to scope out his options.

Helen wasn't in her prime anymore, but she still had a vagina, and for some reason that seemed 'wrong' to Salim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick focus was all that was needed and Helen's crotch swelled outwards as she gained the man's genitals. Given the age of her new equipment, Salim figured she wouldn't be getting aroused too much, but still, she looked more 'normal' to him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it continued. Seeing another woman in her forties accompanied by her son (late teens), Salim performed another switcheroo. The young man remained oblivious as his penis and balls disappeared, being replaced by his mother's vagina.

Both parties remained oblivious of the swap as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid then managed to draw his attention away from the flat-chested babe, and looked at Salim.

You know that these are female skin tight leather trousers?\"  David practically yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David knew this, because when he had first seen her, a couple of seconds ago, she had been wearing skin tight black leather trousers.  And now that SHE/HE was wearing his original slacks, he assumed that he/she was wearing the leather trousers and boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Duh!  Of course\"  Salim exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"And trying to fit my old male equipment into them, while I'm wearing them, is a very tight fit.  So tight that I think I'll sound like a eunuch forever... and, thankfully, it'd only been a couple of moments with my old package!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'My old package!'  David thought.  'My old package is walking off between the legs of some woman that also has the rest of my body... and I miss it so much. (his package, not necessarily his body!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'What are you going to do about it?'  he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Nothing!'  He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David could still remember the excruciating pain, of having his balls squeezed into a pair of tight leather trousers, that simply weren't designed to hold them.  It was either to go back to the excruciating pain or watch some ex-woman walk away with them.  It wasn't quite penis envy, but it was close enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Well, there was always tomorrow.  Maybe he could wear a pair of his old jeans, meet up with Salim here, find the ex-woman and retrieve his package from her, and live happily ever after... as a real she-male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You don't sound like a eunuch, you sound like a pretty young woman.  That is your normal voice now... now that you are speaking, with her vocal chords!\"  Salim offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So, I don't sound broken to you, now?  I'm actually speaking with her normal female voice?  I think, that I probably sound like... a cartoon chip monk!\"  David explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I don't know!

I think you sound like a phone sex worker!\"  Salim thought, that what he'd said... was the safe option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well... you'd know!\"  David bitchily replied... which caused Salim to giggle like a school boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David knew that it was imposable for one of them, to say something to the other, that would cause the other to be offended.  After all, you don't get to be known as The School Perverts, without each developing a thick skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Including her head?\"  David asked; as he caught a last look at her retreating body, that had his original male head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Apparently so!  I just thought to swap everything that made her... her, for everything that made you... you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"THIS I have GOT to see!\"  David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"There are some toilets over there... it would probably be best to use the ladies room... being as you are a very sexy lady now.\"  Salim advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Would that make me the winner?\"  David cockily asked; referring to their long standing bet as to which of them would see the insides of any ladies room first and escape undetected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Sigh... I suppose so!\"  Salim answered.  There was no loss to the loser, other than pride, so he would have to 'bite the bullet' on that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"well... the ladies room it IS then!\"  David happily replied, as he turned on his high heeled boots and headed for the aforementioned room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Just before David entered the ladies room he turned and asked...  \"Oh could you lean against the door, and knock on it, if you see anybody heading for the ladies room.  I'm going to be nervous as fuck in there, so some advance notice of potential entrants would be of benefit, as some intimate examinations will be taking place in there.  Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David just turned around again and nervously pushed open the door.

Don't you mean she-male?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No!  That is a she-male!\"  David said; while pointing out a woman who was one of Salim's earlier experiments, who was actually a woman with a penis.  Salim was actually the worlds first real he-fem... someone who looked like a guy but with female genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Only if you are sure.  But you don't know what you are missing.  Having a female vagina is the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, I don't... yet; but I will do soon, promise me that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"OK, do you want them... right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes, please!  She may leave the shop if you wait too long, so the sooner the better!  Those breasts are perfect for me.\"  David said, as he braced himself for the acquisition of the girls breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David watched in awe as the girls little boobies shrank away to nothing... without feeling a corresponding growth in his own chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Huh?  Where did they go?\"  David asked, without looking down at his own chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Right there silly, you have them... NOW, tit boy!\"  Salim exclaimed, pointing at the ridge that was forming on David's T-shirt; between the larger nipples that were now on his slightly inflated chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Fuck!\"  David exclaimed, as he looked down at his new breasts.  \"And... enough with the name calling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Watching it happen to somebody else is NOT the same thing as having it happen  to yourself!\"  David said, Blushing in embarrassment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes... I was almost SURE that it didn't happen, when I acquired my vagina, that I had to grope my new self, to be sure that it actually DID happen!\"  Salim answered honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Grope yourself?

It wouldn't be proper, to be seen groping yourself, in here.\"  Salim advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"OK, NOW would be a good time... quickly, somebody could enter this aisle at any moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Was Salim telling the truth?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With his nipples between his index and middle fingers he gently rubbed around his nipples and his breathing became harsher and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, wow!  These are fantastic.\"  he breathlessly told Salim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Do they turn you on?\"  Salim pointlessly asked David.  there was no point, because he could tell David was turned on by his erect female nipples and his original male penis, which was also erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It is like there is a direct connection between my new nipples and my male genitals.  It is SUCH a turn on.  You've got to try some for yourself.  It is just like having two male penises on your chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim looked around to make sure that the aisle was still unoccupied by others, before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, you look really turned on, what with your erect penis and nipples.  If I were a woman I would be slightly concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You ARE a woman... where it counts.\"  David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  This brought Salim up to thinking... Yes, this morning I even had to sit, just to pee, and then wipe after wards, just like a girlie.  What more evidence do we need...?  I AM a woman now.  well, sod it!  If that causes other people to treat me differently, then that is their problem, not mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim was just about to indicate to David that a young breasty brown haired woman had entered their aisle when he suddenly needed the toilet... really badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Erm, I have to go and drain the trouser snake!\"  Salim said, forgetting that THAT was no longer an appropriate analogy for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"... Or the female equivalent!\"  David said, reminding Salim of what was between his own legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well... the FEMALE toilet awaits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You're a lucky dog.  Having the appropriate equipment to gain entry into the holiest of holies - the female toilets.  I'm so jealous of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Don't be!  ALL it would take is for you to have a female vagina between your legs and you could come inside too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David really considered Salim's offer, but in the end having a penis, that he could just unzip and whip out was so handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Maybe tomorrow, same time and place, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"OK, yes!  But I don't understand... why not right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I have some exploring to do... with these!  David said, indicating his new little breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Have fun...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Salim spent the whole of the walk to the Ladies room alternating thinking 'yes I will go in' or 'no, I won't go in' with each step.  The 'yes' step was the right foot and the 'no' step was the left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Luckily, or unluckily, the yes step was the last step spoken, so that meant there was no getting out of it.  He had to put his right hand on the door and push, and enter the Ladies room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Excuse me SIR, this is the LADIES ROOM, and you sir, are a bit too masculine to be going in here!\"  He heard; as soon as he entered, the pink room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Don't be so superficial... I have just as much right to be in here as you do!\"  Salim was just about to unzip his trousers and show her his vagina, when he noticed the bulkiness in the front of her pants.  Oh it was... erm what was her name... Helen, one of the women that Salim had given that penis to, just moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Wait a moment, YOU'RE the one who has no right to be in here, and anyway, what are YOU doing in here?\"  Salim went over onto the attack, now that he knew that SHE was intruding on HIS space.  After all, this was the ladies room, a room for people with lady parts... like Salim, not dicks like Helen had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well these toilets are so much more convenient for when I need to go while I am on the shop floor!\"  Helen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Aren't the Guys toilets, just as convenient?\"  Salim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes... but why would I want to go in there?\"  Helen also asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well I can tell by the bulge in your trousers, that you are not built the same, as I am!\"  Salim stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Good point... I'm not!  I don't know why that didn't occur to me before now!\"  Helen exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey, they have urinals in there, apparently.  Apparently you just stand in front of one, unzip, whip it out, and go.  It sounds a lot easier than undressing and sitting down every single time.\"  Salim stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Even when saying this, Salim did not really believe it.  In fact, even having memories of doing just that, didn't change things for him.  HE had a vagina, now, therefore he... was a female... now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey, I can pee standing up!  Cool!\"  Helen exclaimed, as if this was a new thing for her.  It was... but she didn't need to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So everything is OK now... we all know where we need to go from now on!\"  Salim exclaimed impatiently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Without waiting for the woman's answer Salim said... \"Good, because if I don't go soon I think I will burst!\"  As he said the word 'burst', he pushed his knees together, while leaving his feet in their original locations... in a classic parody of a woman who really, really, needs to go to the toilet.  Although for Salim, right now, it wasn't a parody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When a woman closes her legs, it squeezes her vaginal lips together, forming a tight seal... the female equivalent of a guy putting his hand down his trousers and firmly holding his penis.  A final act, to buy himself more time to get to the toilet, before he peed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey, I'm sorry I was intruding on your space, you need this room, more than I do!  Don't worry I'll be going next door from now on!\"  She exclaimed while walking to the door, and then leaving Salim alone in the ladies room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh... finally. I'd better go now, before anybody else, interrupts me.\"  He said as he pushed open a stall door, entered and latched the pink door, turned around, and undid his trousers and pulled his pants down.  And not a moment too soon.  As soon as his ass hit the seat, his vagina was squirting pee... into the pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Thank god, that was close!\"  Salim said; as he looked around, for the toilet roll.  Still having a male sized bladder, with lady bits, was an unusual situation... one that the human race 'designer' hadn't thought of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Finding the toilet roll, he grabbed half a dozen sheets, tore them off; and then dabbed at his wet crotch.  While doing that he was looking at the vagina that he'd had for less than a day.  It still looked surprisingly empty.  Most of what was visible was the outer lips; the inner lips were inside them, and the vulva was inside them.  It was a surprisingly compact design compared with the male equivalent, which was bulky and usually very floppy... and painful if you caught it in a zip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  No, Salim was grateful for the opportunity to swap it with his sisters vagina... there was nothing down there, now, that could ever get caught in a zip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim thought it was really neat having this compact and neat little vagina between his own legs.  The fact that it was a unbroken female vagina, that was compatible with a guys penis, was  irrelevant to Salim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Because if Maya didn't want to give it up for a guy, then there was no way in hell, that he would want to.  He wasn't gay... he was just in love, with his own vagina.  It WASN'T Maya's vagina anymore... it was Salim's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Having made peace with his own crotch, Salim scrunched up the used toilet roll and dropped it between his legs, there was plenty of room, then turned and flushed the toilet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Or does he just get dressed and then go about his business?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Looking down between his legs again, Salim was just about to pull his boxers up, when he realized that he couldn't actually see most of his vagina.  He had just accepted it's position, without giving it another thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But now he was sitting in a cubicle, inside the ladies room, he had time to think.  He realised that even when frigging himself off last night, he had been rubbing that area, just in front of his ass hole, where his new lips were.  A woman's parts were slightly behind where a mans parts were, and on a different elevation to a mans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A mans penis was on the front elevation, while a woman's vagina was on the bottom elevation, just in front of her asshole; just behind where a guys balls would have been, if she had had a pair.  THAT was why his pubic mound seemed a bit longer and why he had been reaching further between his legs when frigging himself off.  It wasn't just that he had a male length body and male length arms, that caused him to feel like he was overreaching; while fingering himself to multiple female orgasms, last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  True a woman's orgasm wasn't as powerful as a mans but that was made up for by the fact that she was ready for another so soon after the last.  Which was why he was able to reach orgasm so frequently, without getting so out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When he had last jerked himself off with a male penis, the day before yesterday; he had felt like he had just run up ten flights of stairs immediately after wards.  Whereas yesterday, even though it was a longer session, encompassing several multiple orgasms; he had only felt like he had run up a single flight of stairs after wards.  He wasn't even breathless; admittedly he wasn't even sleepy either, so he had just lay there savouring the afterglow, while he watched the sun set before going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It was also why his right shoulder and right wrist had been so sore, this morning.  Because his vagina was slightly back, compared with when he had a penis, and he had had to reach further back between his legs, and lock his hand at an awkward angle; in order to reach all of his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A penis was so conveniently placed for jerking off, right at the front of his pubic mound, whereas a vagina was further back between his legs, approximately where the stem of his penis was; right in front of his ass hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  All things being equal, he definitely preferred the female orgasm.  Maybe if he had a bit more of a females body, he could experience a 'full body orgasm', he had once overheard a fellow student, who happened to be female, say to another female student.  A full body orgasm sounded wonderful; only having a vagina now, his new female orgasms only encompassed his vagina, and little else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Damn, he could do with another go, between his legs.  He felt the area above his legs; where his pubis was, and it was beginning to give off heat and he was aware of his heart beating, down there, too.  But there was no way he could finger himself in the Ladies room, that would be worse than beating his meat in the gent's, when he had a penis.  Not that he had ever done either of those, he had too much self respect, to be caught molesting himself, anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  One of the things about Maya having his penis, was that she was using it, on Rachel.  He had always wanted to fuck Rachel, and when he found out that she was a lesbian, and his own sisters lesbian lover no less... then his lust, had became a crush.  At least now his penis was getting to fuck Rachel, even if HE wasn't controlling it, at the time... cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim finally pulled his boxers up when he noticed that the front seam, joined his leg seams, at approximately where most of his lips were now.  and now the female wetness had dried into an uncomfortable knot. Well there was nothing he could do about that now. anyway boxers were the only type of underwear that he owned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Pulling his jeans up, just uncomfortably pushed it further, into his snatch.  It was his vagina, and he would call it, whatever he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He then unlatched the cubical door and walked into the ladies room with his bunched up boxers still uncomfortably performing cunnilingus on his vagina.  Think of it as a woman, trying to walk around, with a finger in her vagina... well, that is what it was like, for Salim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Talking of Cunnilingus, any future girlfriend of Salim's would no longer be able to perform fellatio on him because Maya had his penis.  Then he wondered if Rachel had performed fellatio on Maya yet.  then he also wondered, if he could find a girl, who was into girls and wouldn't mind performing cunnilingus on his vagina; even though he looked like a man... mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A drop of vaginal fluid was secreted and was now running down his 'lower' lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Although the fact that he looked like a man may be of some benefit in some circles.  All he had to do was find a lesbian, who wasn't able to show the world that she was a lesbian and needed to get married, for parental reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Yeah, the world must be full of (lesbian) women, just like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Another drop of fluid seeped along the tracks of the first, soon to join with the first at the base of his vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Now ALL he had to do was find one; but he wouldn't even know where to start looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  On the other hand, why even bother looking... he already knew where there were a couple of lesbians, they occasionally spent time at his house.  One of them was the Goddess Rachel and the other was his sister, Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maybe he could use the yarn doll to acquire Maya's body and then steal her life and also her job and girlfriend.  Salim neither had a job, nor a girlfriend, and the bitch Maya had both... it wasn't fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim was the man of the house, since his father had died, and it was his task to look after all of the others in his household. IE to ensure that everybody had everything they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Could he steal his sisters body, life and girl friend; the beautiful Rachel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Could he give up his position, as man of the house, to Maya?  Well he certainly didn't want it!  But karma would have it's revenge, if he did that!  and he would then be little Maya with the boobies and big hips when that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  There was something about being a short man with big wide child bearing hips and breast pads that no real man should ever have to go through.  The way she had complained previously, sometimes, he would be putting himself at the bottom of the food chain, a juicy piece of meat for any predator to take a bite out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This place wasn't so bad they really did treat everybody the same, regardless of sex, but many other places, weren't the same.  The way they treated women was practically criminal... a woman's place was barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen... was what they probably thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Could he put himself in the position of potentially being taken advantage of like that... well, no, he would still have his penis, if he were the new Maya.  Not that that would make a difference to some people, they would be able to look down on him if were a shorter 'male' with wide hips and beautiful breasts.  Still, he would then be dating Rachel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But, damn it, Rachel was a lesbian!  She only went out with other girls, guys didn't hold any interest for her.  How long would the 'improved' Maya hold her interest, once the novelty of her having a penis, had worn off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  And anyway he still didn't know what it was like to be the possessor of a pair of breasts. He had only fallen into having a vagina because there was one going spare, when his sister decided to 'upgrade' herself with a penis; and if she didn't have his, she would ask him to give her another one and as the man of the house, Salim would have to give it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  With the yarn doll, he could do that for her; so there was no reason, not to.  So it may as well be his penis, that she had, between her legs.  Well, that was one way of looking at it... the one way, that conveniently forgot, his own part in her acquisition of his penis; his offer to trade it for her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Well that wasn't his problem yet.  Salim pulled open the entrance door to the Ladies Room and re-entered Wilko's store, to the sound of an excited sounding male voice shouting... \"Slim!  Slim!  Oh, THERE you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Who was it?</span></div></div>",

Well, she was dressed like an American aerobics instructor, but she had the most amazing breasts, that you will ever see; outside of a porn magazine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You know how the wind, will sometimes blow into a shop, through an opened door?  Well it blew in through my left T-shirt sleeve, across my nipples, and out of my right sleeve.  That was fucking awesome, my nipples are still erect, even now!\"  David exclaimed... rather loudly; Salim thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So, you ran all the way back to here, just to tell me?  I'm flattered!\"  Salim  sarcastically  answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, you don't understand!  She was heading this way, when I left the news agent's, after buying my porno magazines!  In fact I passed her as she was looking desperately at the chocolate cakes in the bakers window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  So her breasts were NOT that impressive, that you couldn't just leave the magazines, on the shelf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No!  You still don't understand... I don't just want you to SEE them, I want you to... 'GIVE THEM TO ME!'  I just had the thought that if little breasts felt like THAT, then what would big breasts feel like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"But you've only had those for a couple of minutes.  In fact the girl I got them from, is still in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Who cares about her?  I just want the blonde's breast's.  Oh, and if you could give me some female hands, for later, I would really appreciate it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"How about I just swap everything above her waist and then swap your head back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Fine!  Be quick or you will miss her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Better give me the magazines!  Who knows what she will do with them, if she suddenly finds herself, holding them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"If you suddenly find yourself outside on her hips; just give the secret signal with your right hand, and I will swap your head back!  I'm just going to swap your chest back with the original owner first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Whatever!\"  David said as his nipples became unerectable; and then he was outside, with nothing between his legs, except a mini skirt.  He was just about to give the pre-arranged signal, after feeling his crotch; when suddenly he was back inside again, wearing a tight wide necked something with a scooped front... along with a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  His hands immediately went to his big breasty chest and his eyes went wide, when he saw that he was just wearing the woman's tight PINK exercize top, that mostly contained her bra and big (female) breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh wow!  You even remembered the bra this time!\"  David said when he saw that the original school girl was still wearing the training bra on her little, mostly erectly, nippled chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim wondered what David was talking about, as he had never included the bras; feeling that David would refuse to wear, such feminine finery.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Oh, now, he understood, what had happened!  The woman's bra, WAS above her waist, and so was automatically included in the swap.  Well David did not need to know, that he hadn't had anything, to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David's eyes went even wider, when he saw the impressive cleavage that was displayed in the scoop of his top.  Although he was slightly disappointed that he could see (and feel) the bra-straps as they went over his shoulders outside the area covered by the pink top; which meant inside the scoop, which was pulled very wide, over his new little creamy shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David was distracted from that, when he saw the red, his fingernails were now painted in... in fact that wasn't even his own hand, and as for the slender arms; well, only now did he really understand, what 'everything above the waist' actually encompassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David wanted to pull his top, over his bra-straps, as he really didn't have the confidence that she must have had; being as this was the first time he had ever worn a bra and he didn't want people to know that, THAT was what he was wearing under his top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Salim, I'm just going into the gents, to adjust my upper clothing.  You'll still be here when I get back?  David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Of course, David, there are plenty of new customers, to mess with!  Oh, and don't forget, I still have your dirty magazines!  You wouldn't want to forget them as maybe I will leave them in here!\"  Salim exclaimed with a big grin on his face and a wink in his right eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"OK, then give them... back to me!\"  David said, NOT having noticed Salim's wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When Salim wouldn't let go, a minor scuffle ensued.  It was only a minor scuffle, because David was rapidly noticing the lack of upper body strength he now had in his thin feminine arms and shoulders.  Jesus, as an aerobics instructor, even though the woman he had gotten them off of was a healthy specimen, she was still a woman; and so there was no way, that David could win in a fair fight with an average male, IE Salim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  This was a new feeling for David as they had always had equal strength and so no fights actually became physical, recently.  But now Salim had the upper hand and David didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It was unlikely that Salim would ever give David his own arms back, so how could David even be an equal... ever again?  Well maybe David couldn't bring himself up to be Salim's equal again, but maybe he could bring Salim down to David's new feminine strength levels and things would be equal that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Yeah, that sounds like a plan!'  David thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Right, I'm just going into the gents to adjust my upper clothing and you'd better be out here with MY magazines, when I come back, or you will owe me for the cost of them.\"   David said with a huff as he turned and entered the gent's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Huh?  What was, THAT all about?\"  Salim said after David left.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  As soon as the door had closed behind him, David forgot all that, because he was faced with a mirror reflection of his new spandex covered breasts, under his existing male face.  They looked smaller in the mirror than they actually felt in reality<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Oh wow, they really were, fantastic.  But, still, each of them, was more than a handful, and each of them shared the same bountiful, deep, cleavage.  He decided after running his fingertips lightly over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Grabbing a handful of the shiny spandex that covered his left titty, he breathed in deeply, which helped pull the shiny material back under his bra covered breast... well it pushed his big boobie over the spandex of his exersize top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Slipping two fingers of his right hand, under his left bra cup, by his cleavage; David was disappointed, because there wasn't much difference to the feeling of his normal chest... except for the soft fleshiness of his larger new breasts, and the lack of hair that was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It was only when he reached the bigger nipple, that his opinion was changed by the electric shock; of his longer female finger nails, as they scraped across his new areola and then hit his already larger nipples themselves.  Giving him the same sensations, as when he had the little barely there breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"fucking hell!\"  They weren't just fantastic, they were truly awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David then spent a couple of minutes massaging his left nipple and areola with the fingers and fingernails of his right hand, before he thought that he shouldn't be doing that in the gents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Any other 'normal' guy, would not understand why he had asked Salim for them in the first place, or why he was massaging them in here now; or even why he wanted to keep them... forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David looked down at his masculinity in the mirror.  It didn't look anymore erect than it had 5 minutes ago in the news agents.  He had to use the mirror to see it, because he could barely see anything, over his breasts; they were THAT big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Moving his right hand around he fumbled with the zip fastener before finally grabbing it with his index finger bent over so that his nail was running down his trouser front and his thumb nail was running parallel to his zip.  He was still grabbing the zip fastener, with index finger and thumb; it was just a different grip, due to his longer finger nails, on his smaller hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Slipping his hand between his opened flies, he remembered that he would have to be gentle, due to the dagger like fingernails, he now possessed.  So opening his hand wider than he he thought it needed to be, he was still surprised when his penis was stabbed by his new, sharper, nails.  Opening his hand a little wider, he was very surprized, by how big it seemed; his penis now appeared to be massive, while held in his hand... his little feminine hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Damn it, what was it, about being in the gents, that made him want to pee so badly.  He walked over to the urinals feeling the gentle swaying and bouncing of his breasts inside the bra; and stood in front of one and gently whipped it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Even visually his penis looked massive when compared with his (smaller feminine) hand.  Even though that was the effect he was looking for, when he had asked Salim for them, in the first place; he was still impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Giving his meat a couple of rubs, was all he had time for, before the urine started to flow; hitting the urinal near the top due to the semi-erect status of his penis.  Giving his penis the usual couple of shakes, he was surprised when his penis slipped out of his looser grip; he was holding it loosely because he was afraid of damaging it, with his sharper, longer nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  They looked almost animal like in their ferocity, so even though he had full control of the hand, that they were attached to; he was still afraid of them being so close to his delicate private parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David flicked his equipment back into his pants and then zipped himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Looking down at his chest,  particularly his left breast; that was still inside his bra, and that was all that it was inside of.  His bra encased left breast was still sticking out of his shiny pink exercize top.  Wasn't that what he'd come in here to fix, originally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Walking back to the mirror, David was surprized by a male voice suddenly saying...  \"Well, hello there, darling!  Need me to give you a hand, with putting your breast back inside your top?  Feel free to pop inside the gents anytime the mood takes you, to disrupt your clothing; I'll even help with that, if you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Fuck off!\"  David replied; without thinking about how little strength he actually had in his weak little feminine arms.  Thank god he still had his male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh shit, you are not a dame, you're a guy!  Is it student rag week already, or are you one of those freaks... with boobies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David took the student option when he answered... \"Yes, I'm a drama student, and isn't it amazing what you can do with a couple of pots of nearly flesh coloured paints, and some rolled up socks... they look real don't they!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes... Well, you certainly had ME, completely fooled!\"  The guy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David still couldn't look him in the eye, because the '... freaks with boobies' comment, had hit too close to home.  David WAS a freak and now he had really large, really feminine breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David was so fuming, that he had forgotten, what he was doing in here.  still the bloke who was standing right behind him, holding his hands where they would be, if he'd had breasts and was laughing, was an easy reminder....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh right, I was fitting MY breasts, inside MY top!  Fuck him, if he can't take a joke!\"  David vented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Except it wasn't a joke, was it?  No, it definitely wasn't!'  He decided as he was packing his breasts away inside the shiny spandex, elastic like material, of his top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Breasts were wonderful and not just to look at!'  He thought, as he lifted his left arm and grabbed the left side of the wide necked scoop with his right hand, and lifted it into place so that it covered his bra and then lifted his right arm and did the same thing with the other side of the wide neck with his left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Each time, he had known just how high to lift his elbows, to clear his breasts and nipples.  The 'space' below and behind his elbows, while he was doing it, was now completely filled with his breasts.  Still, he felt more comfortable, now that his bra was completely hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Never mind the breasts, a bra was just something that no guy, should ever be seen wearing.  Thank god that his bra was completely hidden.  No one would even know that it was there... except a woman; they had to be supported by something, as his breasts were now just too perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David took a last adoring look at his breasts before he grabbed the door handle of the heavy door and exited the male toilets, where he saw Salim leaning against the wall, playing on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  And luckily For Salim; Davids magazines, were still between his legs.  Or should that be... luckily for David his magazines were still between Salim's legs.  At least now, he wouldn't have to start anything, that he didn't have the muscles, to finish.</span></div></div>",

If anybody deserved Salim's attention, it was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Particularly for his... \"... or are you one of those freaks... with boobies?\" comment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  NOT for what he'd said, but for being right...  About David, at least.  If any one of the guys who had boobies, in the store right now; could be seen to be a freak, it was David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But David hadn't intended to give himself boobies.  No, David's 'fetish' was... OTHER guys with boobies, not himself.  When Salim had misunderstood and offered him a pair of his own, he was SO insistent that David would like them, that David had picked the smallest most non-noticeable pair in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  What if Salim had swapped his chest, for a pair larger than he had now; while he wasn't there to hold the doll himself?  would he then think that having them for himself... was normal from now on?  Would Salim do that to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  And if the wind hadn't blown so strongly into the news agents, he was sure that he would have asked Salim to give them back to the school girl; tomorrow, with no harm done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But once he'd felt the breeze on his little erect-able nipples he just had to try out a fully grown pair of breasts for himself.  Oh yes, he was going to have some fun, tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David was interrupted from those thoughts, by the sound of the inner gents door being opened, closely followed by the outer door; and then there was the dickhead in all of his unmodified glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That reminds me, there is someone else, I think you should experiment on!  That bloke, just exiting the gents, behind me.\"  David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Him?\"   Salim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yeah that's him!\"  David answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Your fetish or mine?\" Salim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Both?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yeah... both.  He was being a cunt, about my breasts.  So I think you should give him both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Okay, we just need, a donor... oh, well volunteered, that woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'That woman' was a hooded shell suit wearing specimen of roughness, just like her friend... the bloke from the toilets; who was also wearing a hooded shell suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She approached him really closely and leaned in and gave him a big kiss on the lips.  They, more than, knew each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hold on to the doll tightly, otherwise you might think, that what they become... is normal.\"  Salim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When they separated... her breasts were on him, without a bra, and his manhood was on her; and her womanhood was between his own legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"THIS is more like it!\"  David said with glee, as he felt his penis and nipples, both become more erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey, what about her?  Her breasts are nearly as big as... yours!  Erm, I mean, not quite, nearly as big... that is!\"  Salim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Without a doubt, you have got her beat, in every department; size and shape, and everything.  In fact you have the best breasts in the store.\"  Salim muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Please... you don't have to do that with me, I am not an insecure woman, I'm David.  Admittedly, David... with breasts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"David with very nice breasts!  They look like, more than a handful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"They are... certainly more, than THESE hands, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Can I touch them?\"  Salim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"W.H.A.T?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Only in the most non-homosexual way, of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, you can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why not?  We always shared everything, when we were in college?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Because IF, and that is a pretty big if... but if you had a girlfriend; would you share her breasts with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Not if they were on her, but if they were on me, I would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'll think about it... it's all too new to me!  Don't forget, less than ten minutes ago, I was as flat, up top, as you still are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That is not the only place I'm flat.  How about if I said, I'll show you my vagina, if you'll show me, your breasts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"This is still new to me.  You've had that for nearly a whole day, whereas I've only had both of mine, for only a couple of minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I understand.  Last night, if some stranger had come up to me and asked to see it, I don't know what I would have done....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"But you are not some stranger,  you are Salim Kaur, co-founding member of The Freaks Club....  And anyway, WHERE, would we do it?  The inside of a Wilkos store is hardly an appropriate place, for me to bare my chest; and you to pull your trousers down?  That sounds, so gay, when I say it, like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Like I said, I understand!  It was wrong of me to ask.  Will you forgive me, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It goes without saying, that of course, I will forgive you.  Maybe you could take her breasts for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Her white breasts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What's wrong with that?  nobody's going to see them on you, and know what colour they are!  They will just be breast shaped lumps of flesh on your chest; under your T-shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, it is just that I always thought, that when I touched my first pair of breasts, they wouldn't be on me, and I wouldn't feel my own hands; with said breasts.  Anyway, I have my eye on a pair, that will match the skin tones; exactly with the vagina; that I already have.\"  Salim rambled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Your sister's vagina?  What if she won't let you have them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Then I'll just take them.  It's not as if she will actually miss them.  As far as she will be aware; I will be the only one with a vagina and boobies in the family... except for Suki of course.  I will probably become closer to her, what with us sharing the same equipment, and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Forward thinking!  I like that!  Maybe I will let you have a feel tomorrow, once I've had a chance to sleep on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I doubt, you'll get much sleep, if you try to sleep on them.  Apparently, you should try to sleep on your back, for comfort; not your front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Thanks for the heads up; but you know what I meant... once they are not so new to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I knew that, but I thought that now, would be a good time, to mention that... pertinent little fact.  Besides it may save you a couple of hours of tossing and turning and I want you to be bright eyed and bushy tailed in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"The morning?  Why?  Whats happening in the morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Clarke's are having a shoe sale?  Patience, you will find out then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That is a mighty noticeable camel toe you have there, Salim!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Think about it, you have a female vagina, squashed into a male crotch, between male legs.  I mean look at that brunette woman, in leather trousers, over there...  she doesn't have a camel toe, yet she has the same thing between her legs as you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Didn't you notice, the way your legs massage your lady bits at the top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes?  What is your point?\"  Salim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"All the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes!  But I thought that was normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Maybe, if she were dancing energetically, at a night club on a Friday night; but not all the time!  You really need to swap out your hips for a spacious pair of female hips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"They go with the territory.  I mean, well look again at the brunette, before she turns the corner and goes into another aisle.  Notice not just the wideness of the outside of her hips; but also how far apart, her legs are, at the top too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"But won't that give me a female walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Probably, but it is better than the alternative!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Which is?\" Salim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I don't know, do I?  I've heard talk of everything from yeast infections to crabs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"A yeast infection?  That doesn't sound so bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"And itchy crabs were everywhere, at college!  I even knew some guys, that had them, for a while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You know that, THAT vagina is a fully equipped baby factory!  There is one in there now that just needs a guy to impregnate you and nine months later you will have to push it out of yourself - woman style.\"  David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Look, if you are trying to scare me, it won't work!  This is my vagina now, and no guy with a penis is coming anywhere near to it, while I have it... even you!\"  Salim responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Who takes the doll home with them tonight?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  \"Here, you mustn't forget, your dirty magazines!\"  Salim said, as he threw the magazines, at David; as he normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Owe... bitch!  That really hurts!\"  David said, as one of the corners of the magazines, hit him right on, his right nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What did you do that for?\"  David asked as his own right nipple became really prominent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why didn't you catch it?\"  Salim counter asked him as he watched David's right nipple become femininely prominent on his large right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You usually catch things I throw at you!  why did you miss that time?  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I don't know! I was looking down at my cleavage, when I became aware, of you having said something.  I looked up at you only to see the moving magazines were close to my right breast.  By then it was too late to catch them, it was even too late to move out of the way, and all I could do was watch them as they hit my suddenly large right breast.  That really stung!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Look at me, my nipple is really standing out.  I can feel it bodging against my exersize top... trying to burst through my bra.\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"How can I go anywhere with this thing trying to rip through my bra?\"  David asked, as he was pointing to his very prominent right nipple; with the index fingers, of both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Don't worry I'm sure it will go down eventually.  How about if I was to offer you a lift home?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm sure that, that is the very least, you could do!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, pick up your dirty mags, and let's go!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Way ahead of you!\"  David said, as he held them in his folded up arms, left side held in his right hand, and right side in his left hand; and held them in front of his right nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Like a schoolgirl, holding her homework!'  Salim thought, as they exited, the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It was only a short walk to where Salim had parked his car.  But to David it seemed like they had walked half way across town, he was SO aware of the looks people were giving his breasts.  Mostly envy from the females, and want from the males... even males who had breasts of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David tried not to show any emotion to the guys with breasts, although he had admired a couple of pairs.  but they were nothing to write home about; not when compared, to his own C or D cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim thought that David, made as much noise, as he usually did, when slamming the car door shut.  But Salim forgave him, as a none driver; he really had no idea, how little effort it took, to close a car door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David took extra care when fitting the seat belt over his boobies; finally letting go of the strap so it didn't hit his boobies with too much force; as it hit evenly in the small cleavage gap between both breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  About ten minutes into their journey, through rush hour traffic; immediately after Salim had deliberately aimed for a pothole, that caused David's breasts to jiggle on his chest enticingly.  David said \"I'm just going to undo my bra, as it doesn't seem as comfortable, as when I first found myself... wearing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Don't mind me!\"  Salim answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Why would I mind you?  I'm the only one in this car who has a penis.\"  David said as he leaned forwards and slipped his fingers under the exersize top at the rear and easily unclipped his bra with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Have you ever done that before?'  Salim thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Fuck it!  I may as well remove the whole thing!\"  David said, as he pushed his right hand up into his left sleeve, grabbed his left shoulder strap, and pulled it over his left elbow and hand and then tucked it back into his left sleeve.  He did the same thing with his left hand in his right sleeve, and then he reached under his top at the front, with his right hand, and pulled his bra out from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"A 34D, right?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Shit, no... a 32E!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"How the hell, can I wear a size 32 bra, and an E cup at that.\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well your boobies are quite big!\"  Salim said.  As Salim was saying this, he was pumping his knees together, as his vagina had suddenly started weeping again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You're missing the point.  Don't think about the E cup size, think about the 32 that preceded it. The last time I checked I was a small 38 or a large 36 chest measurement.\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"We are all different shapes and sizes!  Anyway that was a different chest!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well I'd appreciate it if you would stop concentrating on the shape and would start concentrating on the size.\"  David said, as he started folding his bra, before putting it in the same bag, as the magazines were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim thought that David was hung up, on the 32 part of the bra size and didn't need to know that that number was an arbitrary made up number and his chest measurement, was actually 4 or 5 inches SMALLER than that; due to how bra sizes, were actually worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"This is it, for you, isn't it?\"  Salim said as he pulled out of the traffic in front of a largish house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes, where I've always lived, with my parents!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Lucky you... both of my parents are dead!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes, I knew that, and I'm still sorry for your loss!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Thank you, believe it, or not, it does get easier to deal with. Although some times, I will enter the house and wonder, for a moment, where they are?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I've still got that to look forwards to....\"  David said mournfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Say hi to your mom for me, and I will meet you at Wilkos, at the same time tomorrow.  Maybe I will phone you later tonight, and don't worry, if having those breasts isn't as much fun as you thought they would be; well, we'll just give them to somebody else, maybe even back to their original owner!\"  Salim said, thinking about karma and what it would do to him, if he allowed things, to get too messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David thought that the original owner was lucky as she wouldn't have to deal with their loss.  Unlike David, who now had to deal, with their acquisition.  He would have to enter his house and share them with both of his parents... like he'd always had them.  He wondered if they would turn his dad on.  Still, at least mom, would be as understanding, as she always was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Who do we follow now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Do we follow Salim?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Or do we follow David?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Do we follow Salim?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Finally Salim pulled up outside his own house.  He was pissed off because he had just driven across town three times, in rush hour traffic.  From the center to Davids house and back to the center and then out here to his own house.  All of the time, he felt like he had an itch that he couldn't scratch, because he was driving; it was so deep, inside his own vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  And he'd done all that because David couldn't catch his own porno magazines.  No, that was unfair to David; because there was no way that he could expect David, to remember that his new female nipple, was about four inches in front of his old male nipple.  He had only had them, for about ten minutes, at that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Mind you, he was beginning to think that David was right, about the spacing of his own legs.  He'd had to drive most of the way, with his knees opened wide, so he could give his lips a rub; when things got too much for him.  Wider female hips, would have meant he could fit his whole male hand, down between his closed legs; without opening his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But, wouldn't a female hand, fit even easier than that.  He would have to ask Maya, about that, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"hi Maya, no Rachel!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, she is visiting Warwick Castle, as part of her history syllabus.\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Warwick... isn't that quite a long journey?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes, they are traveling there and staying at some student digs tonight; visiting the castle tomorrow morning, and then traveling back tomorrow afternoon and early evening.  Depending on the travel times she may not have time to visit here tomorrow night either.  I'm missing her... already.\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, poor you.  Is there anything, that I can do, to make the time pass more quickly?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes, have you been taking your pill?\"  Maya said as she was horny.  You may think she was being incestuous but she was really very horny. An erect penis has no conscience and this was the first time she had had to deal with one without Rachel being there to ease her suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What pill?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'll take that as a no!\"  Maya said sounding disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hang on a second... what pill?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"The pill... my birth control pill.\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"But you are a lesbian, why would you need to take that?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"In case I get a visit from a bastard producing uninvited guest.\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You mean a rapist?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes, even a rapist doesn't care if I am a lesbian.  Anyway, since you are not taking the pill, that is that idea 'out of the window'.  Maybe... no, forget I mentioned anything, it was only for two days; until Rachel gets back, anyway.\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Maybe... what?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You wouldn't go for it anyway.  Especially given what we were just talking about!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"WHAT?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I was wondering... well, could I try out your whole male body, not just your penis?\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I mean...  I am very grateful for the trial of your penis but it just makes me want to try even more of your body.\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You mean everything below my neck?  I presume you will want to keep your own head... your own identity?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes, everything below your neck... although being you completely, might be quite a fun change.\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  What does she go for eventually?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Your whole body including your head and identity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim wondered if his awareness of his immunity to the yarn doll's changes would transfer across under these circumstances or whether the new Salim would be the one who was immune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He really hoped that it would transfer across otherwise he would be fucked.... He would be stuck living Maya's life without knowing or caring about anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But was it such a bad life?  He would have her vagina and her girlfriend and her body and identity.  Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.  But it didn't have to be that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  No, he would definitely phone David and get him to do it.  Better safe, than sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But where to do it?  Here?  They risked Suki coming home and finding them part way through... anyway that meant another two journeys as he'd just done, just to collect David and another two journeys, to deliver David back home and get himself back here after wards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Or he could do it at David's house.  Although, that meant, taking Maya with him....  Maya; who... didn't... travel... well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Still he would only have to listen to her bitching, one way; and then he would be her on the return journey, and it would be his choice, as to whether to bitch, or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  With that thought on his mind Salim dialed David's home phone number, which was answered after a couple of rings, by an older sounding woman's voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hello Mrs. Webb, this is Salim... Salim Kaur, I went to school with your son... is he about?  As I would like to speak with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh he's upstairs re-trying on some of the bras, I bought him last week; as, if they don't fit... he will have to take them back tomorrow and exchange them.  Hold on while I go upstairs and get him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  That 'conversation' was followed by a couple of seconds silence, the receding sound of a woman ascending the stairs and a couple of seconds later a sharp knocking on a door; followed by the same woman's voice asking;  \"David, are you decent?  oh well, I'm coming in, anyway... baby!  Why is the door locked?  Well you haven't got anything 'up there' that I haven't.  Listen, your school friend Saleem is on the phone.  yes, Saleem Core... he's already been on the phone for a couple of minutes.  No, I won't tell him you will ring him back in five minutes.  No, he hasn't got time for you to put on another one... just go down as you are.  He will never know that you are topless.  No, he won't even know that you have everything on display.  Oh... finally!  come on, he's still waiting, I think!\"  she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  That was followed, after a couple of seconds, by the sound of a woman lightly descending the stairs and a couple of seconds later, by a confident sounding male taking one single step down the stairs; halting for a few seconds and then hesitantly, slowly, continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hello?  Saleem?  Just another minute and he will be with you, you know how he likes to piss about, like every descent is the first time he has ever descended a set of stairs since puberty.  Honestly if I can get used to him having them,  then why can't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Here, it's Saleem, he hasn't given up, yet.  I do like that boy he hasn't let his problems beat him, he is still masculine shaped, unlike you!  Even I have a bigger ribcage than you.  Oh yeah, that is like a knot in a piece of cotton, I don't care if you have been working out recently. If you want a real workout, you should try lugging a baby about for a few years; like I did with you!  Although never again, once was enough... it nearly killed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hello?  Salim!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"'E' cupped and topless; now there is an interesting thought for later!\"  Salim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim thought that that was a funny way of greeting David, given his circumstances; but apparently he was wrong!  As he heard the phone being dropped and David's mom say \"well, that is the one thing about him, that I really don't like; his overcompensating for his lacking!  Tell him that he sounds like a real male truck driver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I think, he heard you, anyway, mom!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Mom... tell Dad about the fucking button!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Language, David, and I will do, dear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  There was the sound of the handset being untangled and then David said \"OK, she's gone now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I thought you were going to phone me 'later'?\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes and I intend to, but something has come up?  Can I come around to yours with my sister?  As she has agreed to me having the rest of her body, and I need you to give it me!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Me?  But I have only held the doll, while you controlled it, previously.\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Don't worry, I will tell you exactly what to say... it's really easy!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Then what do you need me for?\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Trust me it is essential that you do it!  I wouldn't ask but I don't trust myself to do it right.  And we will only get one shot at it and I don't want to screw it up.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I don't want to screw it up either.\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Don't worry so much, I just need a third person to control the exchange.  I will be thinking, of the exact wording to use, during the drive over there... please say 'yes'?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, all right!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Maya, David says yes, you can have my body, as agreed!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Great meet me outside your house in 20 minutes!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh how many bras did your mom buy you?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Nearly half a dozen, mostly sports bras.  Strangely, the one I was wearing today, was one of them!  And that was last week that she said she bought them.  How did she know, last week, that I would be wearing one of them today, after you gave me these breasts?\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I don't know, but isn't it plausible, that your mom would buy them for you last week, after all, doesn't she now think that you have had them... since puberty.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hmm. I suppose so!  Right, I will be looking out of my window, in about twenty minutes, and I will come out front when I see you pull up...  later!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yeah, about twenty minutes... later!  Bye!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Bye!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Well, fuck it, that was almost too easy!'  Salim thought.  He got the feeling that he was being railroaded.  But Maya was jumping up and down excitedly, so there was no way out of it.  The feeling that something WOULD go wrong, was so palpable, he could almost taste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ready?\"  Salim asked Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Just let me get my handbag!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Your handbag?  What do you need that for?  We're not stopping at any shops; either on the way there, or on the way back!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You'll find out!\" She cryptically said.  Which just made the feeling of dread,  even worse, for Salim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Right, we're leaving, now.  Come quickly if you want my body!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Jeeze, what's the rush?  You are acting like, you don't even want to be me!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, it's not that.  It is just that you don't know how far it is to David's house, and we only have twenty minutes, to get there!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, I'm ready!  Or are we... just waiting for 'Salim the dawdler' again?\"  She said; giving such a wide grin, that Salim found it hard, to hate her, for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Laugh all you want, as in twenty minutes, YOU will be 'Salim the dawdler' anyway!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As Salim was locking the front door Maya turned around and said \"Oh hi Sis....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What?  Who?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh... nothing.  I thought I saw the reflection of Suki in the living room window, but when I turned around, there was nobody there.  Just those two white girls in the same location.  Do you know?.?.\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes, they are the Jewel twins from Suki's work,  Amber and Jade, I think.  They are sisters, but only one of them, actually, works there.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Do you think?.?.\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes, as the original owners of the Yarn Doll, i think they are here to retrieve their own possession.  Suki must be there too to let them in to search the house.  Ignore them, they won't find it, as it is in my left trouser pocket.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"But what if they are still here when we get back?\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"We will ask them to leave!  Don't worry, I am going to leave the doll with David, for when it is time to swap back.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As soon as Salim had mentioned the name of David, Maya had the thought of big breasted David sucking on her own breasts, while she sucked on his, before they....  No that can't be right.  David was a guy, while she was a lesbian... and anyway she loved Rachel; big flat chested Rachel with the long tongue, and the long rubber dildo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maya fanned her face with her right hand, if she kept thinking about David she would start to 'glow'.  Maya thought it was funny, how The British romantically referred to a woman who was about to break into sweat, as glowing.  As far as she was concerned, she would start to sweat, if she didn't start to cool down, soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Can we go to Mckey D's and get me my treat?\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Good plan.  We are not going to David's to swap bodies!  We are just going to Mckey D's, to get you your large chocolate milk shake.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Fucking ace.  Do you want a banana shake too?\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"If you insist, a small banana shake wouldn't go amiss.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Can we go to the one near Parkgate as the one near Bridgegate is not as smooth!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Sure that is on the way!  But it is a drive through so you will have to give me the money before hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Cool!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Come on, time is a ticking!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Does Salim remember to stop of at Mckey D's, on the way there?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Yes, and Maya really enjoys her shake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Before they had even driven off of the street, that they lived on, Maya had already asked \"are we there yet!\"... twice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, David lives on the other side of town!\"  Salim answered the second time she'd asked.  \"Remember, past the Mckey D's at Parkgate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim thought that it was the mention of Mckey D's that had put that glazed look in her eye, which on any other day it would have.  No Salim wasn't to know, that it was the mention of David; that caused her to start drooling, with a faraway look in her eyes, as she imagined what she could do with his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She may have been a lesbian, but there was something about David's breasts that nearly straightened her out. They were big and nicely rounded... strangely that really turned her on.  The thought that he wouldn't be able to fight her off much, what with his slim but not too slender arms.  Soon he wouldn't be able to fight her off at all, when she had Salim's big and muscular arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But Salim was a male just like David and she was sure that he would not want to bed her once she was Salim, a guy like David... although not quite like him.  He had those chest bulges that looked so soft, and a real penis... ewe.  Now she remembered why she was a lesbian, although it wasn't as if she was given a choice about that.  Maybe things would be different when she was a male like Salim.  On the other hand... maybe it wasn't too late to back out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim was wondering what it would be like to be a lesbian, like his sister Maya. Although he wouldn't be a lesbian LIKE Maya he would actually BE Maya... the lesbian.  That thought got his motor running and caused his vagina to start getting wet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey, Maya, quickly reach into my left trouser pocket and grasp the yarn doll, and then give me my penis back as David will have enough to do without worrying about our bits too!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maya leaned over and reached into his pocket and it wasn't the return of his penis that caused him to nearly crash.  Instead it was the growth of 'B' cup breasts; Maya's 'B' cup breasts... that nearly caused him to crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  What did you do that for?  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maya suddenly remembered that Salim was immune to the non-awareness of the yarn dolls changes and quickly pulled her hand out of his pocket.  The doll stayed firmly in his pocket, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  I'm sorry I thought you would appreciate a quick go with my breasts.  I'm sorry, do you want me to take them back now, and give you your penis back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Don't bother, we are here now, at Mckey D's.  I will find somewhere to park up and do it myself later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Well, maybe it could still work.  He would get a feeling of what it is like to have your breasts ogled, by some guy tacking advantage of his height advantage, in the drive through booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Unfortunately, judging by the sound of her voice, it was a female that served him the shakes.  Unknown to Maya, it was a female WITHOUT breasts; because she had been in Wilkos, at the same time as Salim and David, were there... earlier.  She was much more discrete, than your average male oik, but she still copped an eyeful of Salim's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maya thought that Salim was very restrained, as he didn't cop a feel of his own breasts once.  She wasn't to know that he hadn't copped a feel, because he didn't want to be the owner of the breasts, that he was copping a feel of... for the first time of his entire life.  He wanted to concentrate on the feel of the breasts themselves, not the feel of his hands on the breasts from inside the breasts; or the feeling of his breasts as they reacted to his hands.  That was for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maya's breasts were returned along with her vagina, in the car park just the other side, of he drive through.  She wanted them gone for a while longer, but if  everything went according to plan, in a couple of minutes Salim would have them anyway, and she would be Salim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  There would be no more asking somebody else (Salim) to open the jars, whenever Rachel wanted a pickled gherkin.  No, she would be big strong Salim, free to open all of the jars that she wanted to, and to fully close them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim thought that it was an unpleasant experience to suddenly have his balls returned right in the wet patch of his underwear; that his vagina had made. The erection was strangely bulky and unwanted, now that he had become used to her vagina; her neat and tidy, compact, little vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Right, that was a dangerous, dirty trick, you just pulled there; and I think there should be consequences...  I get to be you for the next week not just the two days we had agreed upon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What, Rachel comes back tomorrow, or the next day, and I don't want to miss that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"YOU won't miss that, I will make sure of that, and Rachel won't be able to tell the difference between us; because I will BE YOU... and YOU will BE ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maya had the fleeting thought of Rachel and the cuddles that would ensue when she returned.  NOW Salim would be the one being cuddled, and she would be on the side lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  There was also where those cuddles would lead to... with Rachel and the double ended dildo.  But she wouldn't need a dildo, as soon she would be Salim with the real thing, just no-one to use it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, what's your answer?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm still thinking!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"well, I will require an answer before we get to David's.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Strangely the mention of David didn't produce the same reaction in Maya as it did last time.  Which was just as well, as Maya thought she had enough to think about, as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"In about five minutes we will be there and nothing will happen without an answer from you.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I understand... fully!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The car was silent as both of them thought their own thoughts and drank their milkshakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maya was thinking about being big and powerful and what she could do with his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim was thinking about her vagina and breasts and what they would feel like to have both of them again.  But he was also thinking about how he could be stuck with them as Maya forever, not knowing that there was anything wrong with that.  He was also thinking about, how everything they had talked about in the car was a lie... he DID want to be her, but NOT if it meant the end of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  How everything he'd said was designed to convince Maya that SHE didn't want this; not that HE didn't, because HE did... desperately!  There was just the thought that something could, and would, go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As the man of the household, it was Salim's idea to convince Maya, that it was HER choice to do something, or not; not his own.  Maybe karma would overlook his part in the slight bending of the truth, after all, he had good reasons to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He imagined Maya, using her whole arms to clap and letting out a constant stream of fake farting noises, as she breathed out (think Steve Martin as Prince Rupret in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), and drooling constantly; pretty much like she had, when he'd mentioned Mckey D's, just after they had entered the car....  Except THAT wouldn't be Maya, that would be Salim, who just thought he WAS her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maya shunted her butt forwards and then leaned back just like David had earlier when he was removing his bra; except her milkshake was balanced on her breasts and she didn't stop sucking on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What are you doing?\"  Salim asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Removing my bra!\"  Maya answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What, you don't think, I will be capable of removing it myself, when I am you?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Oh shit!  She felt the same way as he did, but she didn't feel capable of telling him that!  Salim thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, you shouldn't, have to... if you were to attempt to remove my bra immediately after becoming me, everybody would know, why you were doing it; whereas, now, it is my choice.  Now, when you become me, without a bra, you should just feel free to feel yourself up; discretely of course!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Right, David lives just up there, we are going to be there in less than a minute, and I'll need your answer by the time we get there!  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maya said  \"Okay, I've already decided!  I want...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To be you from the neck down only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim pulled over, just down the street from Davids house, and asked Maya if she was sure that, that, was what she really wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, but messing with our own identities is too risky, especially being as inexperienced David, is going to be handling it!  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"But I will be controlling David!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Not enough... for my liking!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  To have come so far and not get everything he wanted was just typical.  But could he live with what she offered?  He would be her from the neck down, but not her fully.  He would have to live with it... for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"OK well, if that is what you want, then that is what you will get!  Lean over and grasp the doll.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'd rather not!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It's not going to bite!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"The way that you explained it to me, was if i was touching the doll then I would know everything about it; but if I wasn't it would be as if I had been born with that body, and you had been born with mine.  Wouldn't that be easier for both of us if that were to happen?  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hmmm, what about Rachel?  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What about her?  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, she is a lesbian!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, duh!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well you wouldn't qualify as girlfriend material with my body... but I would with yours!\"  Salim would have kept that to himself If the idea hadn't just occurred to him as he was speaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Good point!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'God damn it!  Was nothing going to go right?'  Salim thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"OK hand me a part of the doll and let us get it over with!  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Here.  Have fun with my body!\"  Salim said, and with that he watched as her head suddenly shoot up several inches; and his own head shot down several inches also.  He didn't need to see his own crotch to know that his vagina was back there... he could feel it.  Although it was between roomier legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He looked between Maya's legs where his penis didn't look out of place between her male thighs.  For final proof he looked at Maya's flat manly chest, which meant that her breasts were now on his own chest.  He did, but also he didn't, want to see them there, right now.  So instead he just reached up and started the car and finished driving over to David's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The first turn as he pulled into where the traffic should have been, but wasn't, was the worst; when he'd had to cross his arms on the steering wheel and that caused his breasts to be squashed between his slender arms. That was an interesting feeling, to be savoured, at another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim pulled in front of David's house, where he noticed David in his room, happily putting on a skimpy bra; a push up bra, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He would have to warn David about that, the fact that people could see into his window, while he was dressing, just not yet!  Finally after Salim had stored a memory load of memories; he tooted the horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  That horn toot still had the desired effect; it caused David to stop molesting his own chest, put both hands over his cleavage, and glared down at the car.  then indignantly he reach for the curtains; and when he finally noticed, who the driver of the car was, he pointed to his breasts and gave the thumbs up with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then he gave the two fingered signal that meant he would be down in approximately two minutes.  He reached onto the bed and selected a very feminine top and preceded to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  now Salim could look down at his own body and see the results of his last swap; on his own body.  He couldn't see his own feet, because of the pink and white trainers, that Maya had been wearing, originally.  He then looked at his slender legs inside the feminine jeans that he was now wearing, and his calves didn't look so bulky and muscular, just slim, sleek, and feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  His knees were the same, and it was only when he reached his thighs that they became femininely wide.  His hips were still slimmer than his thighs although they looked bigger and wider than they used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  In fact, his vagina looked 'at home' in those hips and thighs.  He hadn't realized until now, how squashed and unhappy it had been between his male hips and thighs.  Now he could give it a real workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  His new breasts were not so big that he couldn't see his own waist if he craned his head forwards enough.  it was femininely slender which only made his hips seem even bigger and it appeared to have slopes leading from his hips to his little waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Wow!'  This required further investigation, so grabbing the waistline of his camisole top, he pulled it out so it didn't interfere with his view of that area, and saw that there was bare skin between his wide hips and his very slender waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Double wow!'  His new feminine waist was so tiny it looked like he hadn't eaten in a month and his fat nippled breasts looked so big and touch-ably... touchable that he wanted to hug them to himself with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Go for it!\" He heard Maya saying  \"They are your breasts now, so grope them all you want!  I won't mind... but I would wait till we get home before you explore below the waist of your jeans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"After all, who will everybody see when they look at you... girlie Salim pulling his own panties down.   Not Maya, but Salim...  the same as it has always been!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Who was Maya hoping would benefit from what she was saying?  Salim?  No, Maya!  Because in spite of having his penis between her own legs for most of the preceding 24 hours, she hadn't really realized that him having her body would result in her having his body.  Despite the fact that that was the whole point of the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  So her saying that, was more for her own benefit, than his.  She was telling herself that those weren't her breasts anymore, in spite of putting on that camisole top and jeans earlier.  They were now Salim's breasts even though she remembered removing the bra, the bra that was now in her... no his, right, rear, jeans pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maya was interrupted from those thoughts by somebody tapping on the drivers side window.  They had already straightened up by the time Salim looked across so all he saw was a big pair of breasts... well they were bigger than Salim's breasts were any way. They must be Davids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim rolled the window down and the big breasted somebody stuck his head inside the car and then crossed his feminine arms on the glass of the window and then rested his upper body on the glass of the door.   It WAS David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Listen Salim, I just want to thank you for drawing my attention to the pleasures of having breasts.  Well, if you cant trust the opinion of somebody that has had a pair since puberty... who can you trust?   These breasts are actually very awesome... truly awesome.  I'm actually rubbing both of my nipples right now and it is fantastic... look!\"  With that David raised himself on his arms and showed Salim the effect of his rubbing.  Both nipples were proudly erect; like he had a pair of pencil erasers down his top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Uh, uh!\"  Maya said as a warning to Salim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"what?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Speaking as a lesbian!  I know what it is like to see a beautiful pair of breasts with erect nipples and naturally react to them!  That kind of behavior, should only be between close friends; and then only behind closed doors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"We ARE close friends!  Aren't we, David?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Was quickly, and quietly, followed by \"Can I honk your hooters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes, and have been since... Eek!\"  David said as Salim squeezed his right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Right, I'll show you why we have rules, and if you want to break them....\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David casually reached down with his left arm and cupped Salim's right breast and gave it a very gentle massage... with the nipple being rolled between thumb and index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim's breathing became harsher and deeper and he flopped deeper into the drivers seat.  David continued playing with Salim's right breast and nipple even after his knees began to flap about uselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"God!  I wish I'd had friends like you at school, during my formative years... it might have made the years of ostracizement more bearable!\"  Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You were ostracized, too?  So was... little Salim, here.  Those Indian schools are a bastard to survive!\"  David said as he was remembering something that Salim had told him how the real girls had ganged up on him and said he had to wear trousers as punishment, because they saw him as being a wolf in sheep's clothing, when he wore the prescribed skirt, as part of his school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  If he had asked Maya, she would have told a similar story, that differed only in the details, such as how the other girls had ganged up on her, when they had found out, that she was a lesbian.  She still bore the scars from when she had tried to jump that ravine to escape them.  God, she had never felt so much pain, as she did, in the weeks that followed.  Luckily the trousers covered the physical injuries but the emotional scars did take a while longer to heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Wait a minute, she didn't bare the scars of that incident... Salim did, now! That was what his right jeans leg was hiding, her 'war' wound.  How could she have been so casual as to give away her 'war' wound; that was such a big part of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But she wasn't thinking about these things, because David had never asked her about it...  why would he?  Salim was the one with the Dicky knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  What happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Do we continue with this scene here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Do you surrender yet?\"  David asked Salim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  This was now a routine part of his existence and had been since Salim's swap with his sister.  That was less than 5 minutes ago, as far as Maya and Salim were concerned; but had NEVER happened as far as David and the rest of the world, were concerned.  To them, Salim had always had the body of the short Indian girl; and Maya had the strapping maleness of a young mans body.  Well, that was the way it was now, and would be forever; unless something happened, to change that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                       *****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim stabbed at the seat-belt release mechanism with the long femininely painted finger nails that his new hands were now fitted with.  It was the dark green colour that was Mayas favourite, as it reminded her of the last few months in India, which were the happiest time of her life until now... when she was the center of everybody's world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Fuck it.... Maya can you let me out of here?  I don't know why you grow your fingernails this long, as I can't do anything with them!\"  What Salim had said made perfect sense to himself and Maya, but made absolutely no sense to David.  Because he hadn't been holding the doll, during the swap that had given Salim them, so as far as he was concerned, Salim had always had them.  Although David wasn't so sure about the colour.  Still, David now had a full set, recently varnished in pink, so what did it matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Yes, pink!  Well Davids mom had 'helped' him, by doing all of the hard work; which just left David to blow on his nails, to assist them in drying, at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It was a very productive half hour, and at the end of it he felt closer to his mom than he'd ever been.  He really liked his mom, she was a crazy older woman, but she was fun to be with.  He wondered if there was anyway of using the Yarn Doll to bring himself closer to his mom, or his mom closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Fuck it!  There was no point in making future plans for the Yarn Doll.  Salim would never let it out of his sight; not even if it was with David, the other co-founding member of The Freaks Club.  Salim was the original tom boy, who had never grown up to like skirts and dresses and other girlie stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So, is this Maya, the sister you want me to swap you with?  She is quite a masculine hunk, isn't she?  I can see why you would want to swap with her!  That would bring you up to my height, and give you a dick, like I have!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, no, that is; I mean, yes, yes.  David this is Maya, and Maya this is David.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Hello's were exchanged between the aforementioned persons before Salim continued....  \"But I don't want you to swap us... we already swapped on the way over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  David looked at Salim with a serious look on his face before he burst out laughing... \"Get out of town.  Are you seriously telling me that that fine male body that your sister has... was originally yours, and that feeble female body that you have... was originally your sisters?  And you originally came over here to get me to swap you INTO it.  But, but... you, HATE, that, body!  You have always said that growing breasts was the bane of your life.  That it was easier to pass as a male before they grew on you.  No, you are having a laugh.  I don't believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim face-palmed and then said...  \"How about if we were to drive around the block and approach this from another, fresh direction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You can approach this from whatever direction you want to...  but you will always be Salim; my short, busty, Indian friend!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Right I'm going to stand over there in the direct sun light and in about five minutes, I'm going out back, to top up my beautiful tan.  I'll see you before then, then!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                       *****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim drove them half way around the block, before he swapped them back and then drove them the rest of the way back there as a male.  He found the effects of testosterone the be extremely agitating having been without for so long... due to him only having an estrogen producing vagina since yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Wow, do you ever get the feeling of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\"  Was the first thing said by David as they (Salim and Maya) exited the car, in their own bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes!  All the time!  But this time I really do want you to swap our bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why couldn't I have done that, the last time you were here?  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Because last time I was here, I already had her body, and you didn't believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, you didn't!  Last time you had the same male body as you've always had.  In fact, even in Wilco's, earlier this afternoon, when you had that same male body... I didn't believe you, about the power of the yarn doll; until you swapped the chests, of that mother and son.  THAT... convinced me.  By the time you gave me the barely there boobies... you were already preaching to the converted!  So, I'll never know, why you are pulling this stunt now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It's NOT a stunt....  Oh, you weren't there to hold the yarn doll, when we swapped, so as far as you were concerned; it had never happened; I had always had Maya's female body and she had always had my male body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"When did you swap into Maya's body and why wasn't I there?\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Look I'm already suffering a testosterone overdose.  So don't give me any more shit, or I will have to arm wrestle you into submission.  And we both know how embarrassing that will be... for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey, chill out, bro!  What's with all the agitation?\"  Maya to Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Look, I don't need the agitation either, I just need the calming influence of your estrogen!\"  Salim angrily said to Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Sheesh.  I would hit you too, if I didn't already know, that it wasn't... your fault!\"  A still angry Salim said to David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Right any more silly objections, or can we just get David to give me my vagina back, along with the rest of your female body?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"OK we all know that we all have to be holding the yarn doll otherwise the person who is not holding it, will be the only one who thinks that the result of the swap is the way things have always been, right! and we all know how irritating THAT can be?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"yes, you have told me that, before!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I don't need, to be holding the doll, as I am immune, anyway!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maya wasn't paying attention, she was thinking about the maleness of Salim's body and what it would be like to have everybody thinking it had always been hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Maya!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes!  What?\"  Maya said as her head snapped around to face Salim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Remember?  Rachel is a lesbian, that means not into guys, like the future you!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes... I know!\"  Maya said wishing things could be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Right, David I want you to say, 'I want you to swap everything below my neck, for everything below Maya's neck. although obviously replace 'my neck' with 'Salim's neck' when you say it, okay?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"yes, OK!\" David replied to Salim after thinking briefly about what it would be like to have Maya's crotch, and to Maya he said... \"you may want to come over here and grab hold of the yarn doll... better safe, than sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"right, I want you to swap the head that is on Salim's body, with the head that is on Maya's body; except for the hair on their heads... for at least a week!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"WHAT?  Eek!  Shit....  What's wrong with my voice!?!?\"  Salim said from right next to David because his head had ended up on Maya's body, which was standing within arms reach of David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Salim, there is nothing wrong with your voice!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Then why do I sound like I am on helium?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You don't sound like you are on helium, you sound like a normal young woman... Maya in fact!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why do I sound like Maya?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Because you don't have a male voice box, anymore, you now have the vocal chords of somebody whose voice didn't break at puberty; but went the other way into a higher register, just like the rest of your body!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Feel for yourself if you don't believe me!\"  David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim did as David suggested!  but even when he felt the feminine hands running up and down the front of his own throat, he didn't really believe him.  It was only when he looked up at Maya and saw the missing Adams apple at the front of his own throat, beneath her own head... that he started to really believe.  But she even had his own haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Maya, quickly, say something!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Something!  Holy shit!  I am speaking with your voice... Cool!\"  Maya  \"But why do you have my hairstyle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It is not just your hairstyle, it is your actual hair... look!\"  Salim pushed his fingers under his hair and pushed them out so his new hair eventually fell off his fingers and went back to hanging down at the side of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  What happens next?</span></div></div>",

Stripping himself down to panties and bra; and then slowly stripping himself out of them as well.  He had even snuck into Suki's room and borrowed some stockings and suspenders, and a blouse and skirt, and then stripped himself out of them, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When he suddenly heard somebody frantically knocking on the front door.  Grabbing the first thing he could find to cover his breasts and stuff he was surprized to find that it was a silk bathrobe.  Oh well, that would provide coverage and he wouldn't even need panties because it was a knee length robe. Tying the tie around his waist he was surprized by how prominent it made his hips and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After receiving the deep answer \"Rachel!\" to his light and melodious question of \"Who's there?\"  Salim opened the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Maya not back yet?\"  Rachel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"No, you know she will be there for at least another hour or so?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Good!  Because it is actually YOU I've come here to see tonight!\"  Rachel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"ME?\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes... YOU! the bigger Rachel said as she put her strong masculine arms around his little feminine shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Surprizingly, Salim didn't find this to be intimidating, as it was actually very comforting and he snuggled back into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Rachel had put all of her hopes into tonight and she thought that things were going according to plan.  Finally girlie Salim would maybe fall back onto the sofa with his knees apart and beg her to perform cunnilingus on what he had hidden beneath his panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, there is no point trying to hide behind your masculinity, because unlike most lesbians I am interested in both kinds of women; the kind with male bodies and the kind with female bodies!\"  Rachel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm also into guys with female bodies... like yours.  You smell really interesting to me!  You are really hot, to me.  Please say you will think about it, as I am really hot for you.\"  Rachel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, I'm only interested in people with vagina's, mostly females, although I have never met another guy with a vagina.\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, isn't it lucky for you that I AM a girl, and I have a vagina, that is very interested in you, and your vagina. But what about your friend with the big titties... David, I think his name is?\"  Rachel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That's all he has that is feminine.  Well, apart from his voice; and his arms and hands, that is!\"  Salim said; as she didn't need to know about HER rib cage and shoulders that David also had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Rachel moved her hands down from Salim's thin feminine shoulders, to his slender waist and then over his wide feminine hips, where she discovered that he wasn't wearing any panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Holy shit!  It was a dream come true.  Now if only he wouldn't close his legs at the last possible moment.  Slowly she moved her hands down his gently curving stomach and into the place where his vagina was.  It was now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  In fact he didn't snap his legs closed but he opened them even wider.  He wanted this as much as she did.  Finally the ice queen Salim was starting to warm to her charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Having received his assent, by his not dissenting; she tentatively moved her right hand to the place where his lips were.  Holy shit he was already wet down there... cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I want to bed you... right now!  Where is your bedroom?\"  Rachel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Up and on the left!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Finally she grabbed him around his knees and around his back and carried him upstairs.  This was something that Maya usually did to her, but now she was the conquering king, carrying her conquered queen, into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  This analogy made sense to Rachel because she had the wide male chest on her wide female hips and Salim  had a small feminine chest on his wide female hips.  This was a relatively new experience for Rachel, bedding someone who was more female than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Now she felt like a beginner again, she had spent so long with the masculine Maya, that bedding the feminine Salim was almost new to her.  Almost, but not quite, she remembered the not so innocent nights in the early days of university, exploring her lesbianism, as well as Amanda tapping's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Amanda... now there was a blast from the past.  Rachel wondered how Amanda was getting on with Rick... whatever his name was.  God... he was such a guy, which pretty much guaranteed that her relationship with Amanda, was over, before it had even gotten off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim was very happy because he was finally going to have sex with a girl, Rachel.  Unfortunately, it was... AS a girl, because he currently had his sister Maya's body.  Still, at least, now, he would find out about why girls wanted foreplay; and how much of it they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim adjusted himself on the bed as Rachel shut the bedroom door.  He was nervous as hell, because he had absolutely no idea what was involved; and he was scared stiff because he had Maya's vaginal opening between his legs... well her legs.  He'd also heard talk of a hard fake penis that Rachel COULD use on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Shall I start, being as you are still a virgin?\"  Rachel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Please... I wouldn't even know where to begin.  I've never had consentual sex with a girl before. I think I'd better point out now, that I have never had any kind of sex with a girl!  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That's right, your only sexual experience was that one time, when you were thirteen, when that guy got you drunk and then raped you.  Don't worry, Maya told me everything a while ago, so we will take it one step at a time and if I do anything you don't like... just tell me, and I will stop doing it!\"  Rachel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim was aware of the time, when Maya came home drunk that one time, when she was younger; but not the rape.  THAT explained so much about her previously, and why she preferred the company of women, and why she almost hated herself.  Why she hated her own sexuality and why she avoided pubs generally and alcohol specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It also explained where some of the money came from that allowed his parents to 'up sticks' and move half way around the world into Britain.  It wasn't the alcohol dependency counselling that was better; it was the rape counselling service, that was better<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It also explained why she was so eager to swap bodies with Salim, why she actively wanted to become big strong Salim.  It was a chance to escape being the poor little victim... Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That didn't happen to me, that happened to somebody else!\"  Salim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Rachel was aware of the displacement that some victims felt as a coping mechanism, due to her extra credit psychology course.  She was unaware that that didn't apply to Salim because it had actually happened to the little girl Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Salim was unaware that the little girlie Maya that that had happened to... didn't exist anymore.  The damaged vagina, that it had happened to, was now between his own feminine legs... so it must have happened to him!  Salim was unaware of that fact too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Do you want to get yourself out of that robe, or do you want me to take it off you later?\"  Rachel didn't know which she would prefer... which ever one Salim was the most comfortable with, as she still wanted to get into his panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Oops, he wasn't wearing any panties.  That made the robe the pantie equivalent, so she really hoped that he would want to remove it himself.  If not she would have to make it a game for him to allow her to remove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Still it did make his breasts and nipples more prominent, as it was a silk bathrobe, so it was no great loss if he kept it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Rachel leaned over the tense Salim and gave him a big kiss on his thin masculine lips. Then she tounged his ear and said...  \"Don't worry about me, I can take care of myself, later, this time is all about you; so lie back, and get ready, for the best time... of your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  What happens next?</span></div></div>",

She shook her head and mumbled incoherently to herself as she prodded her swollen groin, and she gasped when her new appendage reacted. The large cock she now possessed throbbed as it hardened into a full-blown erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, this isn't happening!

The head of her penis was poking from the top of her underwear, almost staring at her mockingly.

But no, that hardly seemed like an intelligent thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she listened to Jessica humming a tune in her sing song voice, Kiran just wrapped one of her small, manicured hands around her hard shaft and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran had to admit it felt good as she began to caress the length of her <i>rod</i>. Shock began to slowly be replaced by curiosity and excitement as she gave herself a gentle handjob.

Interestingly, the two 'women' headed off in the direction of the toilets rather than the exit. Salim had smirked to himself as he watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a new problem had crept up some time later. An expected problem, but a problem nonetheless. After swapping around a few more people, including the token Iranian girl, the blonde girl known as Laura, a couple of the older women, and many of the male employees that he took little interest in other than for being donors; he found a certain lack of women without penises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, by Salim's book, this would be a great thing. However, it also meant that he would soon have to look for other venues if he wanted to use the doll in anymore ways he deemed meaningful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo search for other venues, he'd have to wait for David to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Salim leaned back against a wall and waited. By habit, he whipped out his smartphone. He had already inputted the password before he even realized it was in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, the camera app came on, bringing up his last shot image. It was of a girl who was once an old flame from back in highschool, one who didn't mind his perverted tendencies in the slightest. Sadly, their relationship wasn't meant to last, and they decided just to stay \"friends.\" Still, she did have the decency to lewdly pose for him last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Still, this gave him an idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into the web browser, scrolled around a bit before finally settling on an image with a man and a woman holding hands and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, this is a test. Salim took a deep breath in, and then willed the two to swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's chest was instantaneously replaced with a bulged out chest that strained his shirt, while the woman gained a completely flat torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalim smiled. Well, this solved the boredom issue...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was upbeat and cheerful despite the fact she and her boyfriend had broken up. This at least put her 'on the market' again, free to date whoever she wanted.

Steven might be just the person she was looking for, if she could get him to forget his silly 'obsession' with Liz, who was married.

Or.. the cleaning cupboard upstairs...\" Steven suggested a couple of ideas where he and Carly might go together. Despite Carly not being an employee, Steven was prepared to take her into a 'staff only' area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The machinery room sounds perfect, since we'll be doing our own kind of 'operating' down there.\" Carly winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven took a deep breath, his large breasts heaving on his chest as he did so. <i>Oh boy...</i> \"All right, we need to move now, while Liz is gone.\" he mumbled, taking hold of Carly's manicured hand and leading her through the code-locked door and down into the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, smells fusty down here.\" Carly grimaced, as they entered the bottom warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven nodded. \"Yeah, smell didn't go away after the floods a few years back.\" he explained to her. He then grabbed the key to the machinery room off a hook on the wall and opened the door. The engine that powered the stock elevator was humming away, and there was enough space for two people to 'mess around'. Carly noted that it wasn't exactly clean in the room. Not that it really mattered, since she was thinking of being quite 'dirty' anyway. \"This'll work, definitely private.\" she approved, as Steven closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Steven realized that he would not be making the first move. \"Yeah, so... er... now what?\" he chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" Carly grinned mischievously, \"... I show you what you've been missing out on\" she mumbled, her high heels clicking on the hard floor as she stepped closer to Steven's 'jutting' breasts. Her swollen cock felt ready to burst through her pants as she placed her hands on Steven's boobs...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maya put her finger to her lips to shush Rachel, since they didn't want to let any information slip. That however was a little late, since Amber had heard them mention Salim and his 'antics', and also someone called 'David', Salim's friend. There was also mention of a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber remained silent througout the two women's stay in the toilets, hand firmly grasping her hard cock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had planned on fucking Maya up the ass with her newly acquired penis, but now that would have to wait until they got back to her apartment. Her erection would have to remain until they got home, as would Maya's. There now wasn't a vagina present in their 'lesbian' relationship. So anal and/or oral sex would be the name of the game until they got Salim to swap them back, or give them new pussies (if they ever wanted one again that is).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Rachel and Maya had left the toilets, a suspicious Amber started thinking about David again. But she found it hard to concentrate, for obvious reasons. First things first, she continued jerking herself off until she reached an unbelievable climax...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghhh!\" she grunted as she felt her balls tense up, then a 'torrent' of semen shot out of her cock, creaming the door of the stall. For her first time orgasming as a man, it felt amazing. <i>God, that was like a fire hose...</i> she thought, a silly grin forming on her face as she descended from her high. Seeing a trickle of cum on her fingers, she brought them to her mouth and licked it off. It didn't cross her mind that she didn't even know whose genitals she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had tidied herself up, Amber then thought back to what she had overheard the two women discussing. This 'Salim' was the one with the doll? She knew that must have been Suki's brother, but she wasn't sure what relations the two women were to Suki, if any. And what of David? Was it the man she had been chatting to? Because if so... he'd been lying to her, leading her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber took a last look down at her cock, then tucked it away and zipped herself up before exiting the toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to find out what was going on, and she knew David would probably still be in the gents toilets fingering himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A tinge of anger on his face, Liam thought hard about how Rebekah might have a different point of view if she weren't so thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with just a thought, he watched as Rebekah started to gain a little weight.  It was nothing tremendous, but it was apparent that her thin frame was getting larger.  She sat there, completely unaware, as her calves tightened against her jeans, while her thighs rounded out by several inches.  The changes spread upwards, as her bottom plumped, making it very easy to see two distinct cheeks through her pants.  A slight gut hung over the waist of her pants, not a complete belly, but just a little podge.  The changes moved up through her chest as her small B-cups expanded into moderately flabby D-cups.  Her arms went from athletically toned to obviously neglected, with a little wobble under each of her triceps.  Her shoulders broadened the tiniest of bits, while her neck looked like it had loosened by just a hair.  Finally, her well-defined cheek bones seemed to disappear as her face felt the effects of the weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversely, Helen, who was sitting across the table, was getting thinner by the second.  At first it was hardly noticeable, but then Liam noted how he could tell Helen's face was thinner, as her chin and jawline seemed to be a little more apparent.  As her shoulders slimmed down, Helen's arms began to tone up.  Liam was actually a little amazed when Helen's breasts didn't shrink in size, but rather became perkier versions.  Her paunch quickly dissipated as her ass, thighs, hips, and calves all slimmed down.  Helen looked... amazing to be quite frank.  A few pounds really took years off her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, Rebekah was struggling to get out of her chair.  A smirk formed on Liam's face as he considered his next move.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She rubbed her headful of beautiful black hair as she nursed a small headache and brushed the sleep from her eyes.  Night had descended on her small farmhouse on the outskirts of town, and so the room was filled with darkness.  She glanced over at her husband Walter, his ample beer belly rising and falling rhythmically as he snored.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen shook her head again.  She had not slept well, not for a number of nights now, really.  Recurring dreams seemed to mock her attempts at slumber.  The dreams were strange too.  Each time, Helen found herself standing in an maternity aisle at work.  She was going about her daily routine--making her way slowly and methodically down the aisle as she made sure that all the week's sale tags had been properly placed and the old ones properly removed.  Such work was mundane but quite important, as an improper tag would give customers the impression that the item they had bought was once price, when it was, in fact, another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's dream had her going normally and predictably about her work, clad in her ordinary work attire.  As she trudged through the job, she would come to some item.  It was different items different times--sometimes it was a box of diapers, other times a set of pajama pants adjusted in the front for a big, pregnant belly, and still other times it would be  extra stretchy yoga clothes as expectant mothers might wear when trying to keep their bulging bodies in shape.  Anyway, Helen would then be grabbed on the arm by a woman who seemed at once nervous and very excited.  Helen could never remember this woman's face for some strange reason, but (presumably for an equally strange reason), her eyes glowed a bright and vibrant red every time.  But like clockwork, she would run up and grab Helen by the arm, and Helen would look up with a start.  \"You're the one!\" the woman would exclaim happily.  Helen always reacted with surprise.  \"What?\" she would ask.  \"It's you!  You will prepare the way for me,\" the woman insisted, \"I'll send one into you first,\" she would say, as if revealing some great and exciting truth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen would step back a bit in the dream, startled a bit by the woman's strange behavior.  She would look the woman up and down a couple times, expecting to find her attired in a white straightjacket like an escapee from the nuthouse.  But that's never what happened.  The woman was actually quite beautiful and well-dressed.  Helen could never see the face, but the rest of her body was the sort of thing that many a man would love to stare at.  The woman was attired usually in a red dress.  Judging from this woman's body in general, she seemed to be anywhere from 35 to 45 years old.  She was--how to put this--voluptuous.  That was probably the best word.  The woman was not young and toned and perfect with flat-as-a-board abs; instead, she had curves, beautiful ones.  Her legs were long and beefy, shown off by a form-fitting dress that began a chunk of the way up her beautiful thighs.  From there, she wore a set of wide, child-bearing hips and probably an ass that would make any man stare.  The dress hugged her every luscious curve as it wound its way up her sexy body.  The woman seemed to have put on just a few spare pounds over the years, but just enough to make her jiggle in all the right places, for the most part.  The most notable thing Helen always remembered of the woman was her belly--it seemed to have a basketball inside it, which is to say the woman was anywhere from seven to eight months pregnant.  Farther up, a beautiful set of boobs peeked out the top of the red dress from a perch shoved up just under the woman's chin.  But this beautiful body was attached to a face Helen could never remember, no matter how many times she tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You--starts with you,\" the woman would say, \"they'll send one of them into you,\" she would say.  And just like that, Helen's eyes would shoot open as the strange visions of her dream continued to dance about in her mind.  That same dream had haunted Helen for the last several nights.  She was not sure what it meant.  Dreams were supposed to mean something, or so she had read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen glanced over at the clock.  It read 11:02 PM in big red numbers.  See, Helen worked the night shift at a store called Wilkos, a store that sold a lot of hardware but, like many stores in small English towns, sold a bit of everything despite its specialty  Specializing too much was the kiss of death in a small place with a limited pool of customers to be had.  Thus, Helen awoke late at night to prepare herself for a shift that began at midnight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timing left a bit to be desired, but Helen liked her work in general.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood and made her way groggily into the bathroom, closing the door and flipping on a small light.  Helen shielded her eyes from the brightness for a few seconds as her eyes adjusted.  Then she looked herself over.  Helen was a woman of 45 years with long black hair cascading down from her head.  Standing at about five feet seven inches, she was a bit tall for a woman.  She had a nice smile and pleasant voice, both of which remained despite her smoking habit, which she had been trying to kick.  Helen had put on a bit of weight as the years progressed, but she was not fat by any means.  She was just--well, curvy.  She had curves and was damn proud of them.  Helen's breasts were wondrous, D-cup, jello-like mounds that shook and jiggled with her every sexy step.  Farther down, Helen's belly was full, as she carried a wee bit of extra weight around her middle--just enough to be cute.  A set of wide, child-bearing hips swayed back and forth as she walked, and her legs were long and sexy, but there was a blessed absence of any thigh gap.  Helen smiled at her curvy, sexy figure just a little bit in the mirror, proud of having maintained it into her mid-40s.  Her wonderful tits strained against a lacy black bra straining to contain them.  Her panties hugged her hips tightly.  Atop this, Helen wore a white silky nightgown that hung open in the front and went down only to her mid-thigh.  Her husband Walter had stopped giving a damn about his bloated body years ago, but Helen would make no such concession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Helen looked herself over, she heard a loud whirling sound from outside as a great gust of wind blew about the outside of her small home.  Lightening cracked the sky, and the loud clap of thunder shook the house.  Helen jumped, while her overweight slob of a husband slumbered away blissfully.  The sexy woman stood and listened as the howl of the wind became more constant.  The persistent, rhythmic hum of big drops of rain welled up as the sudden downpour struck the roof of the small house.  The lightbulb in the bathroom dimmed for a few seconds.  Helen tilted her head as she looked around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen liked storms.  She found them to be strange, dangerous, and powerful things of raw beauty.  Helen walked out into the blackness of the night as the storm came up.  She opened the door of the house and stepped out into the late night.  The trees blew like rag dolls in the howling wind.  The rain began to come down harder, caressing Helen's curvy body with tiny droplets of water that reflected the wee bit of light the curtain of night permitted.  She smiled.  After a few minutes of enjoying the rainstorm, Hellen knew work would come soon, and she turned around to head back into the house.  As she neared the door, she stopped, startled because it looked as though something had darted in front of her.  Whatever it was moved very quickly and came very close.  It seemed black and near Helen's eye level.  She suddenly stopped and looked about, her pulse quickened by fear at whatever it was that had come so close.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha--\" she began, \"who's there!?\" she called out, \"Walter, stop fucking around!  I'm in no mood for it right now,\" she said sternly.  She took a couple more steps only to see the wispy black thing dart before her yet again.  And again she stopped.  \"Dammit!  I said leave me be!\" she called out, scared now, really scared.  Suddenly, a giant expanse of lightening ripped across the sky just as Helen looked up.  She saw what had scared her, but it defied her every notion of what was possible.  It wasn't an animal at all, and it sure as hell wasn't anything Walter could have managed.  It was a writhing, swirling mass of black smoke and dust floating a few feet above Helen's head.  A deep, sinister laugh seemed to come from the thing, whatever it was.  The rain was pouring down now, and Helen opened her mouth to scream at the top of her lungs.  All that did was give the creature the opening it needed.  Suddenly, the mass of smoke darted down toward Helen, forcing its wispy, swirling essence into Helen's opened mouth and down her throat--into her body.  Water poured down upon her as she gagged and gargled and choked, trying to keep the thing out but having no chance.  The rain poured on as Helen's boobs jiggled about as she tried to resist, but the black mist filled every crevice and every curve of her body as her own soul lost control.  Her body spasmed and jerked about as the last gasps and screams of the desperate woman ended in mere whimpers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all that stopped.  Helen's body stood still in the darkness and the pouring rain.  She was dripping wet as she slowly looked up, her eyes an ink-like black as a sick smile spread across her face.  Helen's mouth hung open as her hands came up and caressed her jello-like boobs and felt about her curvy exterior.  Still and in the rain she stood for a few more minutes.  Her black hair was drenched and sticking to her head.  Her silky nightgown clung to her skin.  Helen, or the thing now in control of her body, began the slow walk back into the house as the rain poured down upon her.  \"Haven't had a body in centuries . . . \" Helen said as she reached for the door.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Helen's possessed body walked back into the house without a word.  Her drenched nightgown clung to her curvy body, and her hair was drenched as she stepped into the darkened kitchen.  The demon stood there, soaking in the sighs and sounds of the night and the sexy feel of its new body--its first in a long time.  The dark and silence were interrupted as a small light flicked on the kitchen.  In the light there stood Walter--Helen's slob of a husband--with an empty cereal bowl.  \"Just coming in for a late-night snack honey,\" he said with a slight smile as his belly growled with ravenous hunger.  \"You want something too?\" he asked as he held out a bowl for her to take.  She did nothing but turn and awkwardly tilt her head at him as the water dropped from her now-possessed body.  Walter regarded her oddly.  \"Honey--you--you're all wet . . . you okay babe?\" he asked, clueless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's body had begun to show a bit of age, yes, she weighed a few more pounds than a beautiful 20-something with a perfect body, and she had made peace with that--even found ways to made it undeniably sexy.  A couple small lines around the eyes were her mark of pride; women are sexy, but little girls with boob jobs are passing fad, she'd decided.  Still, Walter had taken embracing the coming years to an absurd level.  He stood about four or five inches taller than his sexy wife, but he had given up on looking even moderately tolerable years before.  At 49 years old, gray stubbled betrayed a nascent, unkempt beard slowly sprouting from his face.  His chest and giant belly protruded out before him, both distended by years of scarfing down beer and junk food.  A thin t-shirt tried without success to hide the man's girth.  Every step and every laugh brought a shake of his jello-like belly.  Boxer shorts adorned his unfit legs as he stood like a dumb bastard there in the kitchen with a cereal bowl for yet another snack.  \"Honey?  You--you, uh, you okay baby?\" he asked.  Helen could do so much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing half a heartbeat, the possessed Helen grabbed a large knife from the wrack that sat on the island in the kitchen, closing the distance between herself and the aforementioned slob and cutting a wide, deep gash across his throat.  She smiled as he bled out, his eyes widened by unimaginable terror at the actions of his own wife and the pain that ripped through his body as the proverbial lights began to go out.  The man fell roughly to his knees, eliciting a mighty shake from the small kitchen and from the big man's own sloppy body.  Helen grabbed the cereal bowl and let the blood from him pour into it, a smile crossing her face.  She needed to use the phone after all.  The man breathed his last gasps in a terrified, paralyzing end.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen stood and set the blood-filled bowl upon the table.  She closed her eyes and concentrated over the bowl for a moment or two.  The blood began to bubble, and sounds of moaning and torture could be heard, as if in the distance, but coming closer.  \"I will find bodies for all of you . . . soon,\" Helen said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, the possessed figure of the woman strolled sexily from the house to the car, still covered in the curtain of night.  She got into the car and headed for her night shift job at the store, a sick smile crossing her face.  \"He's coming--I will prepare the way,\" she said as her car zipped through the night.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the rain poured down and the crack of lightening and clap of thunder filled the night sky, Helen's car cruised comfortably through the downpour, its lights reminiscent of a lightening bug zipping about in a great storm.  The demon inside Helen took great pleasure in his new body.  The demon's name was Otch--that's what the entities in Hell called him.  He had sold his soul to the devil for the heart of a woman during the 1200s, and of course upon death he gained a new name and a new, dark master.  It had been centuries since he had been out of the pit, much less inside a curvy, voluptuous body like Helen's.  He was quite pleased to be given this assignment, savoring every sexy jiggle of his new body as the car struck potholes in the road as it darted about through the night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of driving, the creature reached the Wilkos store.  Helen's body smiled as she beheld the store--this is where it would begin.  So small and unassuming, it remained the birthplace of great things to come.  Helen got out of the car and began her walk to the store.  The storm raged on, and rain poured down as Helen walked, hips swaying sexily about, toward the store.  The drops came down in buckets, and the middle-aged woman was soon drenched yet again, the rain drops little prisms of light that brought a beautiful shine to the woman's skin.  By the time she reached the door, the red blouse of her store uniform clung to her jiggling chest.  The tops of her boobs poked out of the top because she had left the first couple buttons undone.  Otch gazed down at his cleavage--it had been a long time since he had been a woman, and he intended to enjoy this body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen reached the door to the store and drew a set of keys from her pocket.  Her supervisor had given them to her a few nights before since she was to have the dubious honor of opening the store today.  She opened the sliding glass doors and walked in, flipping a switch to turn on the motion sensor on the way by.  Helen flipped another series of switches, each one turning on a bank of fluorescent lights.  Within a few seconds, the lights hummed quietly above the white tile floor as Helen beheld the nearly empty place.  It had been a Sunday, and the store in this small, provincial town was closed, but it opened when the clock struck midnight Monday morning.  The night crew would arrive soon to tidy up and perhaps to bring about certain fuck-ups for which the day crew would be blamed.  Helen's shift had been midnight to 8 AM, but the creature inside her cared little for the rules.  He had a job to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen walked from the front of the store to the back, her shoes squeaking and boobs jiggling about with her every step.  Water dripped from her sexy curves on to the shiny floor.  Helen reached the back of the store--a great, cavernous room filled with pallets, a machine to crush boxes, and all manner of merchandise waiting to go to the sales floor.  Helen walked into one of the back areas in the back room.  She walked through an old wooden door that creaked as she opened it and then closed it behind her.  There had been an old lock on the door, but rust and the years had done it in, and it now rested on the floor.  Helen closed the door and stepped into a musty old room, smiling in the darkened room as a slight breeze from outside blew through the room.  It was probably the first time in a long time that anybody had been in here.  Helen inhaled mightily, drawing the stale, old air into her lungs and expanding the mighty mounds that beautifully adorned her chest.  She smiled again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store wasn't always a Wilkos outlet.  Decades before, the whole town had been a mining center--a company town, in fact.  It had teemed with miners and the coal dust welling up from the depths of the earth itself and spewing out from the great, jagged mouths of the mines.  Such was not the case any more, or at least not much.  Other industries had developed, and there were relatively few miners left, but the present Wilkos store was located on land that had housed a store all those decades ago.  The possessed cougar woman Helen now stood in a room that had been part of that original store--hence the dust and the old and dank feeling that pervaded the place.  As she glanced about, an old sledgehammer rested over by one of the walls.  Like most of the rest of the contents of the room, it was covered with some cobwebs and dust, but it was precisely what the demon needed.  Helen walked over and picked up the big hammer, struggling a bit to lift it.  She lifted the hammer above her head and brought it down as hard as she could upon the dusty old concrete floor.  A loud crash accompanied the strike, but the ground was unscathed, save for a small chip in the concrete.  Helen draw the hammer up again, slamming it into the ground as hard as she could.  Three or four more repetitions of this were necessary before she began to make headway.  Helen's heart beat quickly as sweat began to pour out of her already-drenched body.  The curvy woman had not been built for hard labor like this.  Her body just wasn't designed for it, but it would do the job well enough.  A few more whacks of the hammer enlarged the small crack into a hole between six and eight inches across.  Helen was breathing heavily, and every slam of the hammer had brought a beautiful jiggle from her bountiful cleavage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the floor with a smile.  \"That'll do, my brothers,\" she said, \"your time comes soon.\"  With that, she simply dropped the hammer, letting it clank loudly to the ground, and walked back toward the sales floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Helen opened the door, she threw it open and stepped out on to the shining tile of the main area of the store.  \"Helen?\" came another female voice.  Helen suddenly turned.  Before her stood the figure of Jessica Kershaw, a 23-year-old red-head wearing the compulsory store uniform and sexy black boots.  Jessica's fiery red hair cascaded neatly down from her head and was tied in a pony tail in the back, with the hair resting on her right shoulder.  Jessica's boobs rested noticeably upon her chest.  They weren't as impressive as Helen's, but then again the two women were built quite differently.  Helen was middle-aged and curvy--cougar-like, while Jessica was young and toned.  Her boobs fit her body quite well.  \"Hello,\" Helen said somewhat awkwardly as Jessica approached her, \" . . . um, Jessica,\" she said.  Otch had been forced to search about inside his host for the name of this red-haired vixen, but at least he found it.  Jessica beheld the possessed Helen somewhat strangely.  Helen turned to face Jessica, exposing her mighty boobs and dripping body.  \"Helen!,\" Jessica said, \"you're drenched!  Why didn't you wear a coat?  You'll make yourself sick,\" the young woman said in a worried tone.  Jessica had obviously worn a coat; only her red hair and face were wet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen just stood there as she looked lustfully over the body of her new companion.  \"I guess I should have worn a coat . . . what with the storm and all,\" Helen admitted, \"but--well, I guess . . . . I guess you could say something strange must have gotten into me,\" Helen concluded with a knowing smile, damn sure of exactly what sort of thing had forced its way inside her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked Helen over again.  \"Holy shit, Helen,\" Jessica said as she stepped closer.  \"What?\" Helen said.  Jessica pointed at Helen's shiny, drenched chest, exposed by her work blouse because the top few buttons had been left undone.  \"Your tits, dearie!\" she exclaimed, \"they're about to plop out of your bloody shirt.  It's not that you shouldn't be proud of a rack like that, but you've got to keep the girls under control. I can see your bra peeking out of the top of your bloody shirt, to say nothing of the actual tits,\" she said as she walked up and grasped Helen by the shoulders and began to turn her around to rush her into the back room.  \"I think we've got a towel or two back there darling, we've gotta get you dried off before you down yourself with a cold,\" she insisted, like a dutiful and worried parent.  Helen smiled as the two walked back in the direction of the depths of the backroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen kept walking back beyond where Jessica had meant, back to the old dusty room with the hammer.  \"Helen, love, where you going?\" Jessica said, \"and by the way, when I came in, I heard several loud bangs--made an awful bloody racket.  What the hell was that?\" she called out as she ran to catch up with Helen and neared the beat-up old door and the room Helen had come from.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women reached the door.  \"I think there's a towel in there,\" Helen said, motioning to the door.  Jessica was perplexed.  \"Love, there hasn't been anything in there but spiders and old shit for decades . . . we never use this room.  Are you going mad?\" she asked with a strange smile.  \"Pretty sure there is a towel in there . . . better wipe off the girls,\" Helen said as she motioned to her on-display tits just below her chin.  Jessica gave her a very weird look.  \"I'll humor you, and we'll have a look.  Jessica turned the old door knob and headed into the dark room, and Helen followed, smiling.  She closed the door behind them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's kind of... quaint. I love old buildings.\" Helen smiled in a calm manner, taking in another deep breath. The bountiful orbs on her chest rose and dropped as she inhaled - then exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quaint??\" a puzzled Jessica muttered. \"It's bloody filthy in here. Reminds me of my brother's room.\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica was looking at Helen, an old lantern fell off a top shelf and smashed, making Jessica squeal and jump. \"God!!! That scared me so much!\" she gasped, putting a hand atop her breasts as her heart re-settled. Jessica hadn't noticed the slight tremor that had displaced the lantern from the same spot it had occupied for decades. \"Didn't that frighten you?\" Jessica turned to Helen, her fiery red ponytail whipping around as she turned her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in the least. I um... I saw it fall. Sorry for not warning you.\" Helen answered, chuckling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen then glanced past Jessica for a moment, just for a second, as a swirl of black smoke rose up through the crack Helen had opened in the floor with the sledgehammer. It rose up towards the ceiling, and there it remained, unseen by Jessica. It was as though this second entity was waiting for permission before making it's move. And from the expression on Helen's face, that time was not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica glanced behind her, curious as to what Helen had been looking at. \"What? There isn't rats in here is there?\" she asked, starting to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweetheart, no rats.\" Helen mumbled, as she started walking towards Jessica. Any rats that were in the vicinity promptly fled into their holes when they sensed 'Helen' entering the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled at Helen, then frowned as she started circling her. \"Didn't you tell me you don't have a boyfriend at the moment Jessica? I find that hard to believe, I'm sure the men must be falling at your feet. You're a shapely young thing.\" Helen told the young redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... thank you, I normally don't hear that from other women.\" Jessica responded gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen smiled as her eyes worked their way up Jessica's form, up her trouser-clad legs, past her curvy hips... and to the healthy young breasts that distended her Wilko shirt. \"Praise where it's due my dear.\" Helen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was starting to feel a little nervous at this time, and she glanced around as though a towel would jump into her arms. \"We still need to find a towel and get you dried off love.\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen waved her hand in gesture. \"Oh I'm fine, I'm already drying off. Must be the air in here.\" the possessed older woman reassured Jessica. Then she changed the subject back to Jessica's appearance. Otch may have had a mission to accomplish, but he knew that didn't mean he couldn't have some fun with these \"meat suits\" along the way. \"So, I have to know, have any girls ever shown an interest in you?\" Otch asked in Helen's demure voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica took a breath, fidgeting slightly, her high heeled ankle boots crushed several tiny pieces of concrete underfoot. \"Well, there was a girl in school who liked me - in that way. And there was a girl in college who might have been a lesbian ,I never asked. Um.. why are we discussing this?\" Jessica answered, shaking her head and frowning intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's shoulders shrugged, and as they dropped again - her ample tits jiggled in her bra once more. \"Curiosity.\" she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then. Well, your curiosity is going to get you a cold unless we finish getting you dried.\" Jessica said, making a motion towards the door. She was startled when Helen suddenly grabbed her wrist - holding her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on Jessica, don't leave just yet.\" Helen smirked, as she kept a vice-like grip on Jessica's slender wrist.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why can't we just finish this conversation somewhere else?\" Jessica asked with a confused expression on her face as she gently tried to pull away from her possessed coworker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen just smiled knowingly, her eyes not on the sexy redhead in her grasp, but on the swirling mass of black smoke behind her that was still waiting patiently for its time to strike. <i>Always liked a performance, didn't you?</i> She thought to herself, locking her lips. Otch went back a very long time with this particular demon, and it would be a lot of fun to observe how he treated his soon to be acquired meat suit. \"So you've never taken up any of the women who have shown interest in you?\" Helen asked, continuing her questioning, which Jessica was getting rather annoyed and worried with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course I haven't! Please let's just leave Helen! More workers will be here soon!\" At this point Jessica was begging. She still couldn't break free from Helen's vice like grip. The 23 year old looked to be on the verge of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think that's a mistake, dear. A girl with a body like yours can have lots of fun. I think you're missing out by not exploring more options\" Helen said with an evil smirk. The older woman kept her grip on Jessica but moved closer to the girl so that her still soaking chest was against Jessica's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen please stop! I don't know what's gotten into you, but you've never acted this way before! You're scaring me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dear...soon you'll know exactly what's gotten into me. And trust me, you'll love it\" she said as her eyes shifted to jet black. Jessica screamed as the swirling black mass behind her, wrapped itself around her toned body and then forced it's way into her mouth. Jessica gagged and shook as the demon worked it's way deeper into her body. For Jessica, everything faded to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So that's what that looks like\" Helen said to herself as Jessica's body went limp, falling on top of the older woman. Hellen released Jessica's hand from her grip as the redhead regained consciousness. Jessica took a few steps back and breathed in deeply. The younger woman opened her eyes, revealing a glowing crimson to match her hair for several seconds. Slowly the red faded back into Jessica's normal eye color, but the insidious grin on her face certainly did not belong to Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now possessed Jessica took her crimson hair out of its pony tail, letting it fall naturally down her back. Then she reached up to her uniform blouse and unbuttoned it so that it was even lower and showing off more than Helen's was. \"You know....I think I'm into women after all\" she said with a chuckle, giving the other demon a knowing grin as she placed her hand on her well toned hip. \"Young but not too young. Low enough on position to never be suspected of anything. I think that Jessica and I will have quite a bit of fun together. Many thanks for opening the gate on schedule, Otch. You continue to prove yourself to me and our dark leader. I knew you would be an asset to us when you were just a young one. And look at you now.\" Jessica said, her tone of voice carrying more authority than the former Jessica ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Hand\" Helen said, swelling with pride from the compliments that she had just been given. The demon in front of her was centuries older and wiser than Otch was. While Otch, and most demons, we're simply servants to their master, the demon that was currently inhabiting the younger girl was one of the Alphas. As his name connotated, he was one of the right hand men of the Master himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you know the plan, child?\" Jessica asked, ironically referring to the woman nearly twice her age as a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen nodded. \"Of course I do! Thanks to the gate which I opened up, more of our kind will be coming through. We are to make this place into our earthly base of operations. From this unsuspecting store, we shall be free to act in the world and to get all of the pleasures we desire. What is the next step?\" She asked, expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sly grin never left Jessica's face as the girl looked down at the hole in the concrete. It was amazing how something so small and unassuming could lead to so many lives becoming changed forever. Jessica kneeled down and whispered into the hole in a language that was not english, or even human. The ground shook ever so slightly in response as Jessica stood up. \"Due to the nature of the rift which you have opened, only one or two of our kind will be able to come through at a time. It is our job to make sure that they have proper meat to take. Until this entire store is under our control, it is important not to arouse too much suspiscion. That doesn't mean were not allowed a little fun though\" Jessica said, grabbing Helen's ass and pulling the older woman but younger demon I'm for a deep kiss. \"Let's enjoy these bodies and make the best of this world. Soon enough, even the Master himself will have a place here. He has already selected his future meatsuit.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact... they relished in it. From the get-go it was obvious that 'Jessica' was the dominant one now. Her dainty hands, with their yellow, manicured fingernails reached around and squeezed Helen's mature backside as the two possessed women locked lips... their breasts pressing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's hand soon slipped into Jessica's half-unfastened blouse and popped one of her perky tits out of her bra, tweaking the nipple and roughly groping the tissue, eliciting a 'giggle' from Jessica. <i>Hand</i> could feel his meat suit's pussy getting wet, as could <i>Otch</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for several minutes, kissing, fondling, and very little discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until the door to the old room opened up and in came one of the other store employees, arrived for their late-night shift. Shaun was an eager worker, and very seldom surprised by anything. But seeing Jessica and Helen in a state of undress and locked in an embrace, this made Shaun's eyes grow wide. \"We don't like interruptions.\" Jessica scowled at Shaun, raising her hand slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun was suddenly flung through the air and smashed into one of the walls, the impact knocked dust from the shelves and walls and gave the employee a severe concussion. Shaun groaned and tried getting to his feet, but when he looked up at his two female co-workers again, Jessica was gesturing with her hand again, this time slowly clenching her fist. Shaun felt his windpipe close shut and he gasped for breath... which he failed to get. \"You pathetic mortals, your bodies so fragile, your lives so easily extinguished.\" Jessica chuckled as she paced around in front of a dying Shaun. \"But... at least some of you have your uses.\" Jessica then grinned, as she began playing with her exposed breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Shaun fell forward into his face... stone dead. Jessica looked back towards Helen and idly gestured.\" Re-attire yourself, we'll have time for amusement later, when this store is under our control.\" she sighed in annoyance as she plopped her tit back in her bra and did up a button of her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once!\" Helen mumbled, bowing slightly, her eyes still a jet black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, dispose of that.\" Jessica ordered, gesturing to Shaun's body. \"We'll need to keep the others alive if we're to swell our ranks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tend to it, Hand.\" Helen again obediently nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jessica clicked out of the old dusty room in her high heeled boots, her breasts jiggling with each step. The demon inside her had to make preparations for the arrival of the others.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica walked sexily out to the front of the store, with the demon inside her enjoying every luscious jiggle of her body.  The possessed woman walked with a new purpose, a new determination, as her fiery red hair flowed gracefully down from her head and blew about slightly as she walked steadily toward the front of the store.  As Hand made his journey, he spied another employee from the fleshy, jiggly confines of his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employee in question was Aaron.  He stood approximately five feet ten inches tall with jet black hair slicked back over his head.  The man had just walked in from the pouring rain outside, so his hair and face were all wet, and his traditional Wilkos-ware clung to his body quite tightly.  Come to think of it, that was often true of Aaron.  See, Aaron took physical fitness quite seriously.  He went to the gym for an hour or two every day, where he lifted weights of various kinds and even participated in the occasional boxing match.  He had muscular arms that strained against the tight-fitting short sleeves of his company shirt, and the contour of his shirt revealed obvious muscles also in his chest.  He walked with a quiet determination and a face of stone.  Aaron was not a mean guy, but he could be pushed to anger, sometimes by the littlest of things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That rain is fucking cold!\" he exclaimed, \"I don't think it was in the forecast . . . think the world's going to hell in a handbasket!  The bloody road's washed out, so I had to take the long way,\" he said was he wiped the dripping water from his face.  Aaron walked back to the time clock, his muscular arms swinging gently with his steps.  A few seconds later, he returned from the small hall where the time clock was located and headed for the store's lawn and garden section.  \"New fertilizer shipment came in,\" he said, \"better go get that.\"  And with that, the man was off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand stood there inside Jessica's body, his mind racing with the various things they would have to do to prepare the way for the master.  Such pondering continued for a couple more minutes until Jessica was joined by the curvy, middle-aged Helen, who stood next to her, panting.  \"Did you dispose of the body?\" Jessica asked.  Helen nodded.  \"I did,\" she said, winded, \"and speaking of bodies, I don't think this one is best suited for physical labor,\" Helen announced, \"I don't know if it is the fact that this woman is in her forties or the fact that she enjoys too much candy and sweets, but I struggled to get the dead man into the dumpster outside . . . had to drag him some distance then stop a couple times,\" Helen said.  Jessica nodded.  \"I understand.  I fear something similar about this body,\" Jessica said as she examined her slender frame, \"the bodies that turn men's heads are not the ones that are best for heavy lifting,\" Jessica said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of the work we do may have to be rather physical,\" Jessica said.  Helen turned to face her with a quizzical look on her face.  \"Well we can't be using our powers all the time . . . someone may notice.  We'll have to lift things and perhaps force some people into the back room where our brothers can enter their bodies, and those fleshy mounds on your chest will help only so much with that,\" Jessica said.  Helen looked down at the globes perched visibly on her chest and smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a plan . . . follow me,\" Jessica commanded as she set off with the older woman in pursuit.  \"Go to the room in the back, and summon the next of us,\" Jessica told Helen, \"and take your shirt off . . . I intend to use those boobs of yours,\" she said.  Helen nodded and headed in the direction of the back room as Jessica continued in the direction of the lawn and garden section.  The possessed Jessica made her way to the aisle where Aaron was working and walked, her hips swaying sexily about, toward the diligent worker.  \"Aaron?\" she called out as she approached the man.  He hoisted three 40-pound bags of mulch into the proper place in the aisle, his muscles flexing as he did so.  He breathed heavily and wiped his sweaty brow as he turned around and beheld the red-head behind him.  \"Yeah?\" he said as he glanced over the woman's beautiful body.  \"Say, I've got something I need help with in the back, and I think you're just the big strong man who can get the job done.  May I borrow you for a couple minutes?\" she said, smiling innocently and sexily at the same time and batting her eyes at Aaron.  \"Sure,\" he said, relishing the opportunity to gain the favor of a beautiful young woman.  Jessica motioned for him to follow and walked back toward the back room.  She made sure to put some extra sway in her hips just so that Aaron would have something impressive to look at as he walked behind her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two neared the end of the aisle, Jessica bent down and grabbed a ceramic pot--a fairly heavy orange one that might be used to hold a big household plant.  \"We'll have some cleaning up to do back here . . . don't suppose Liz would mind if we used this,\" Jessica declared.  Aaron said not a word, as he was more fixated upon Jessica's swaying ass than anything else.  The two walked back to the back room, replete with pallets and merchandise that could not be put out yet.  Jessica smiled as the two approached the tiny room in which Hand himself had first climbed out of the pit and into his current host.  \"It's in here,\" Jessica said as she opened the door and motioned for Aaron to enter.  Aaron stepped past her and into the tiny room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" came Aaron's response as he stepped in and beheld the scene before him.  Jessica smiled and looked in, closing the door behind her.  The scene before her would have stopped any man in his tracks.  On the other side of the room was the beautiful, curvy cougar Helen, clad only in her pants and a lacey black bra.  The woman's black hair cascaded down from her head and framed a face that wore a beautiful smile as she used her hands to cup her wondrous boobs.  A slight moan escaped her lips as she put on this display for the unsuspecting Aaron.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had to put some special effort not to be too distracted herself.  \"What the fuck Helen?\" Aaron said, blushing with as much intensity as was possible.  Jessica brought the ceramic pot over her head as high as she could and, with as much strength as she could muster, brought it crashing down on the back of Aaron's head.  \"Aaaaaarrrrrghhhh!\" the man exclaimed as pain suddenly seized him and his muscular body crumpled to the ground like a sack of potatoes.  He fell first to his knees as they struck the concrete hard, only to fall on to his belly with a loud thud.  Jessica and the sexy Helen stood over Aaron as he lay there out cold.  Jessica looked up at Helen.  \"Well done,\" she said.  Helen looked down at her boobs.  \"These things aren't just fun,\" she said, cupping them, \"they're damn useful.\"  \"Let's turn him over,\" Jessica ordered as the two women bent down and, grunting and struggling, turned the stocky Aaron over on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stood and her eyes suddenly took on the inky black color common to all demons.  She seemed to be focusing quite intently and mumbling in another language known only by those in the underworld.  After a couple minutes of this, a swirling black mist emerged from the hole in the corner of the room.  Jessica's eyes returned to normal as both she and Helen gazed with smiles upon the new demon.  \"Now is your time,\" Jessica said to the swirling mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the smoke darted from its position near the ceiling down into Aaron's mouth and nose.  His body shook and convulsed.  By reflex, he gagged and choked as the shock forced him awake only long enough to learn that his toned body upon which he spent so much time would soon no longer be his.  The demon forced its way down his throat and up his nose, expanding once inside him to fill every nook and cranny of his body.  Within a couple seconds, the jerks and spasms stopped, and Aaron opened his eyes to reveal an inky black.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome sister,\" Jessica said as she bent down and helped the now-possessed Aaron to his feet.  The demon inside him was called Lena--a woman from the 1500s in the Scottish highlands who was strung up by the neck for having the temerity to think that her husband should not sleep with the tavern wenches, an opinion not received well from any woman at the time.  Her death had been the result of an out-of-control patriarchy, and her current presence inside the body of a man was more than a little ironic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron ran his hands up and down his new body.  Lena paid particular attention to his strong, muscular arms and his toned abs and chest.  Her hands traveled downward as she reached his dick.  The excitement of the experience produced a visible erection that brought a smile to Lena's face as she stroked her new member.  \"Can I play with it?\" the possessed man asked.  Jessica smiled.  \"You can, but do not forget your duties.  I have placed you in that body to be our enforcer.  A man once controlled you, and now you control a man.  You are to wait in this room for when we send new vessels down to be filled with our brothers.  When the humans come, restrain them in any way you must so that our brethren may enter them.\"  Aaron's eyes turned black as he nodded and stood attention there in the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked approvingly upon her new follower.  \"And the plan rolls on, my darlings,\" she said with a sexy smile.                </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica and Helen walked out of the dank, dark basement while the possessed shell formerly known as Aaron remained, running his hands over his body and enjoying the new-found strength its new occupant had never known in her prior body.  Jessica sauntered about with a sexy smile on a face framed by fiery red hair.  Helen walked and jiggled her way toward the front of the store as she reluctantly buttoned up her top and struggled not to poke at and cup her bouncing boobs.  She wore a gluttonous, devious smile on her face, like that of a child who has beheld a blessed bounty of candy and needs to be restrained from just gobbling up the whole lot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two emerged on to the sales floor and headed for the front of the store.  The rain poured down in a steady, rhythmic hum upon the roof, and the lightening and thunder had picked up.  \"Helen, could you come to the office upstairs?  Helen, upstairs please,\" came a call over the intercom.  It was from a voice that seemed familiar, but only vaguely so.  Helen and Jessica looked at each other, expressions of worry across their faces.  \"We don't have the strength yet to arouse serious suspicion.  You did put the dead man in the dumpster, right?\" Jessica asked pensively.  \"Yes,\" Helen replied, worrying too.  Jessica paused and thought about things for a minute.  \"Hopefully, this will be a trifling matter that we can dispose of quickly.  That body of yours will be less useful if people become suspicious.  Go, and report back to me as soon as you can,\" Jessica instructed.  Helen nodded and walked as calmly as she could in the direction of the office.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ascended the stairs, her chest jiggling as she stepped.  Reaching the top of the stairs, Helen headed past the break room and the couple of vending machines and microwaves it contained.  The smell of microwaveable pizza and stale potato chips filled her nostrils.  She entered another hall and began to walk down it, heading toward the only door behind which there was a light on.  She came to a stop at the door and took a deep breath, drawing fresh air into her lungs and expanding her generous chest mightily.  With that, she knocked lightly on the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" came a female voice.  Helen opened the door, which made a slight clicking sound, and she stepped into the small office.  The office itself was nothing to write home about; it was no bigger than three or four phone booths stuck together and filled with papers--sales reports, employee evaluations, and the next week's schedule for management's approval.  Sitting at a small, cluttered desk in the small, cluttered office was none other than Liz the night manager.  Liz had long blonde-brown hair cascading down from her head and tied back in a ponytail.  Liz's face was not that of a classic beauty.  She wore dark-rimmed glasses, and the ponytail was about practicality more than anything else--the plain ponytail was a hell of a lot easier than worrying about what to do with your hair every day.  She wore sensible and austere black shoes and the traditional red company shirt.  The most notable thing about her, though, was the contents of the shirt.  Liz had a very large and bouncy set of boobs adorning her chest.  They jiggled about and strained at the limits of the shirt.  It was this sort of cleavage that could make men drool, and the bouncy tits made up for her otherwise somewhat plain and tomboyish appearance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat,\" Liz said as she removed her raincoat that dripped with the watery residue of the outside, hanging it on a coat wrack.  Helen nervously sat down on  beat-up metal chair across from Liz's desk.  Liz plopped herself down too, her chest jiggling noticeably as she removed her glasses and wiped them off on her shirt.  She then looked up at Helen with a smile.  \"Coming down in buckets, isn't it?\" she asked.  Helen smiled, nodding a bit.  \"Yes,\" she said.  Liz folded her hands on the desk.  \"Helen, could you do me a favor?\" she asked.  Helen nodded.  \"There should be a shipment of pop coming, but it will be a bit late because the rain slows the truck driver down.  He just phoned and explained it.  Anyway, because he'll be late, we'll have less time to get it off the truck and out to the shelf than we might like, so I'd be ever so grateful if you could pitch in and help the guys working in the back to make it through a bit quicker,\" she said sweetly.  Helen looked back with a smile, \"Sure thing, Liz,\" she said.  Liz smiled back.  \"Splendid,\" she exclaimed.  Helen stood up to leave the office.  Then she stopped by the door.  She glanced back over her shoulder and smiled at Liz, who had taken to scribbling something on an inventory sheet.  \"Say, Liz?\" Helen said with a smile.  Liz looked up.  \"Could you do me a favor too and come with me to the back for a minute. I think Liam made a bloody mess back there, and I'd like you to see it so that, if we kill him, you at least understand why,\" Helen explained with a chuckle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shook her head as she pushed her chair away from her desk and began to stand.  \"That boy . . . \" she said in a disappointed tone, \"I may have Aaron beat him to a pulp later if he makes another bloody mess.\"  Helen smiled deviously as the night manager walked behind her.  The two walked down through the store toward the back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stood off to the side and eyed them closely.  Helen smiled reassuringly as she walked by with the buxom Liz behind her.  A look of relief crossed her face as she figured out the Helen was all right and, in fact, that she seemed to have a plan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two reached the back room and to the dark reaches of the back room where Aaron sat in wait among the dust bunnies and spider webs.  The two reached the rickety old wooden door, and Helen came to a stop.  \"I have to warn you, it's kind of ugly,\" she said, \"Liam really did a number back here.\"  Liz frowned slightly.  \"I don't think anybody's been in this room in ages,\" she said as Helen threw open the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed Liz in and beheld Aaron illuminated by only a single light.  He stood there in silence with a strange smile across his face.  There seemed to be a stain on his pants right where his dick was; apparently Lena had been using Aaron's body to pass the time in substantial physical pleasure.  \"Aaron?\" came Liz's confused call right before Aaron, with only a small grunt, stepped forward and, with a clenched fist, bopped Liz squarely on the forehead.  She staggered back and fell to the ground, out like a light.  She struck the concrete with a dull thud, her chest jiggling a bit from the impact.  Helen looked down in pleasure at the unconscious Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good move,\" Jessica said with a smile of approval.  She had apparently followed Helen and Liz at some distance when she saw the two of them walking toward the back.  \"I figured you would like it . . . would like her,\" Helen said.  Helen's eyes then turned an inky black as she began to concentrate.  Within a couple minutes, a misty dark cloud of swirling dust and bone and magic rose from the depths and seeped through the crack in the floor.  The mystical cloud hovered midway between the floor and ceiling as Helen smiled, her eyes still black, at the demon just out of the pit.  \"Your new body, Shax,\" Helen said as she motioned to the unconscious Liz.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the demon dove with the speed of an attack jet down into Liz's mouth and into her body.  The smoky essence of the demon forced its way down her throat and into her belly, causing jiggles and gags and choking as the woman somehow realized her body would soon no longer be hers.  After a few seconds of spasms and jiggles, Liz became still.  Jessica stood there for a minute or so.  \"Time to wake our brother up,\" she said as she walked over and began to straddle Liz, putting one leg on each side of her body.  She then sat her own slender frame upon the buxom form of the busty woman.  She smiled still as she reached her hands down and felt the woman's luscious melons like a boy discovering candy for the first time.  Still no reaction came.  Jessica drummed a little beat on the jiggly chest of Liz.  Still nothing.  Suddenly, she grabbed Liz by the collar and pulled her upward, pulling the unconscious woman into a passionate kiss and inhaling deeply as their tits rubbed together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in the middle of the embrace, Liz's eyes shot open to reveal the same inky black that all demons shared.  The new Liz didn't break the embrace, but seemed to revel in it.  After a few seconds, the two separated, with each still breathing heavily from the rush of the kiss.  Jessica smiled.  \"Your new body runs this place at night; use it to send more humans to this room, where we can make them ours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, the new Liz nodded.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that so many of them had gotten through, more would be coming even quicker. Of course, now that Liz was one of them, it would be much easier to get employees down into this room. The ground rumbled just a little as two clouds of black smoke arose and seemed to look around the room. Jessica smiled at them, her eyes becoming pitch black. The other demons did the same, showing their newly arrived brother and sister that their vessels were already under their management. Jessica placed one of her hands on each of the shadowy masses, feeling their presence so she would know which demons these were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have no fear, you two will have bodies soon enough\" Jessica said with an evil grin as she turned to Liz. \"Draken, do me a favor and bring down two lovely specimens for these two. Otch and Lena, you two may go upstairs and resume your hosts' positions. there are more employees here now and we do not want to arouse their suspicions until it is too late for them. As you can all see, our crack in this world is getting bigger. Soon it will be time to summon our dark master.  I need to leave to make the final preparations. I trust you all not to let things get too out of hand without me being here. I want every employee in this store to be one of us by the time that I get back. All but the one that we shall save for the Master. Understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three other demons nodded simultaneously. \"Understood\" they said in unison as their eyes returned to their hosts' normal colors. 'Jessica' laughed as all four of them headed up the stairs and back into the main part of the store. Jessica slipped out a back exit while Helen and Aaron resumed their usual work positions, trying their best to blend in to the environment for the time being, always ready to assist if Liz needed them. Meanwhile, back in the cellar, the two demons were beginning to get restless, wanting to be in physical forms. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jessica's curvy body strutted sexily into the rain as her fiery red hair clung to her body, as did her tight-fitting clothes, which the male demon took great joy in.  A smile crossed Jessica's face the demon inside her contemplated what approached.  Hand made his way some distance from the store, his host forging through the torrential rain with a devious smile on her face.  The demons seemed not to care about the buckets of rain that fell upon his vessel.  He had one thought--doing that he needed to do to bring forth the master.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Hand trudged through the storm.  He must have walked a few miles.  His vessel grew tired, but Hand cared not at all about that.  After a substantial walk through the cold rain, Hand came to a small house in a suburban neighborhood.  The possessed body of Jessica smiled devilishly as her evil puppeteer knew what was inside\u2014an evil for the ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand walked his soaked vessel through the cold of the darkness and the early morning storm, right up to the front door of the house he had found, and he rang the door bell and knocked loudly three times on the door.  The sounds reverberated through the house.  Hand waited.  He knocked loudly again, and again he waited.  Jessica\u2019s stolen breasts rose and fell as rain drops dripped from her curvy body.  Hand listened and heard rummaging about from within the house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA porch light hummed quietly to life as someone fiddled with the lock on the other side of the door.  Suddenly, the door opened, and Hand beheld one of the inhabitants of the house.  This woman appeared to be about 40 years old, and long blonde hair hung haphazardly down from her head.  She wiped sleep from her eyes in the darkness of the morning.  \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she demanded, irritated at having been awakened so early.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here to talk to you about you daughter,\u201d Hand declared, his host\u2019s face contorting into a feigned smile.  He just needed to get past this human to find the one he\u2019d come here for.  The woman\u2019s face suddenly changed, going from one of annoyance to one of terror.  \u201cNo . . . no,\u201d she began, shocked into a fully waking state by the unusual request of her visitor.  \u201cOh, well why ever not?\u201d Hand asked, stepping into the house past the woman who had crawled out of bed only minutes before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand stepped into the darkened home and began to step through the quiet foyer.  Pictures of this woman and two other people adorned the walls.  They looked like family pictures\u2014a mother, father, and little girl.  \u201cYou don\u2019t understand!,\u201d the woman exclaimed in a kind of desperate, terrified whisper as she grasped Hand\u2019s sexy host by the shoulders and stood before her.  Fear filled her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman guided hand into the kitchen very quickly and quietly, her eyes darting about as if she wished someone not to hear her.  She pulled 2 chairs out from the table and sat down in one of them, motioning the demon across from her to do the same.  \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are or why you\u2019re here, but you have to get out of here now before she sees you!\u201d  \u201cShe?\u201d Hand said, playing along.  \u201cMy daughter!\u201d the woman said, \u201cAnnie . . . she\u2019s . . . she\u2019s dangerous,\u201d the woman insisted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Hand asked.                    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A pained look appeared on the woman's face. She fell to the floor, holding her head as tears started to pour down her face. \"A..Annie...pl....please stop....y..you're hurting me...\" she said, continuing to hold her head. Hand placed his hands on his stolen body's hips as he watched the woman on the floor. Suddenly, the woman stopped struggling and stood back up. As Hand looked into her eyes, the demon noticed that the woman now had a blank, zombie like expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take you to my daughter\" she said in a monotone voice. \"Please follow me\" the woman said, turning around and walking out of the kitchen, heading towards a staircase going upstairs. Hand simply grinned and followed the apparently entranced woman up the stairs. The woman lead the demon to a room with a pink door and the name Annie written in calligraphy on it. Without a word, the woman opened the door and motioned for the read head to step into the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand quickly walked into the room, the smile on the possessed Jessica's face growing as his anticipation also grew stronger. The coming of the dark master was so close. \"Hello Annie\" Hand said as the older woman closed the door, leaving the two younger girls in the room together. Once the door closed, Hand walked farther into the room. The light's were off, and Jessica's human eyes could only pick up a faint figure in the bed. Suddenly, the lights in the room turned on, revealing a young girl who looked like she was only 15 or 16 years of age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Annie asked in a melodic voice. She was sitting up in her bed now, and grabbed glasses from her night table, putting them on so that she could now see. She looked at the read head in her room curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you reach into my mind and tell me?\" Hand asked, unable to contain the smile on his stolen face as he looked over the girl in the bed. Annie Williams had shoulder length blonde hair and sky blue eyes. Her body was surprisingly well developed for her young age, and she was wearing a pink nightgown. Everything about her gave off a vibe of pure innocence. She was absolutely perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie frowned. \"I can't. I noticed that the moment you walked into my house. Why is that?\" she asked, clearly confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand laughed. \"Oh Annie, you still have so much to learn\" the demon said as Jessica's eyes glowed bright red. Annie jumped back in her bed and squealed a little in fear. Hand just smiled more. This girl was absolutely adorable. \"I know all about you, Annie. I know that you have very strong psychic abilities. From the age that you first learned how to talk, everyone knew that you were incredibly empathetic and kind. You could relate to everyone. When you were seven, you realized that you could listen to the thoughts of anyone that you wanted to as long as you were close enough to them. When you were ten, you developed a longer range and found that you were able to sense thoughts from as far as a mile away. When you were thirteen, you realized that you could not only hear other thoughts, but you could also control and manipulate them. Last year, your powers got strong enough that you could completely nullify people's free will, making them into your complete slaves if you chose to. Last week, you did that to your abusive father. He hit your mother and you lost your temper. You took away his will and told him to kill himself. Since then, your mother has lived in horror of you. And you've been scared of yourself as well. You haven't left your room since your father died. You've been controlling your mother to run errands for you if you really needed something done. You are scared of yourself. And you are also scared that you can feel yourself wanting to use your powers to do more than just this. You're starting to realize that you have a greater purpose than just being a normal high school student. Is that all correct, Annie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl nodded. \"Y...yes, that's true. But, who are you? Why can't I see your thoughts or control you like I can everyone else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand knelt down on the ground, smiling at the 16 year old. \"I am called Hand, child. The reason that your powers have no effect on me is because your powers can only work on humans. Although I am in the body of a human, my essence is that of a demon. I am over 5 thousand human years old and I exist to serve you. My mistress, I ask that you allow your mother to drive us to my base of operations. Once there, I will reveal to you your true purpose in life. What do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie looked like she was in deep thought. She couldn't read the thoughts of this...demon, but she strangely felt like she could trust the read headed young woman in front of her. As she thought things over, Hand continued to smile. There was quite a lot that the demon neglected to mention to the young girl. Hand knew that Annie was created to serve as the human shell of the lord of demons himself. In fact, it was the dark one who had blessed Annie with her psychic abilities, knowing that he would one day use it to enslave the human race. However, there were a few conditions to all of this. Annie's body was saved for the master, which meant that no other demon could take her over. She would have to come to the summoning zone of her own volition. Secondly, the lord would not be able to be released without a sacrifice to him. Someone had to die so that the dark master could rise. That death could be anyone, but Hand would preffer it to be someone that would be of no use to anyone in the immediate future. The best option for this looked like Annie's mother, which is why Hand requested that the mother come with the two back to Wilko's. Of course, all of this was dependent on the answer given by Annie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, mistress? Are you ready to embrace your destiny?\" Hand asked, as Annie appeared to come to a decision. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It reminded her of her life long ago in the Highlands. A life of servitude and abuse, and finally... murder. But she had a place, and she knew she had to maintain it, without question. She looked over at the smashed ceramic pot on the floor, then arched an eyebrow as she glanced down at the 'swelling' in her trousers. \"Let's see how big this boy is.\" Lena chuckled. She reached down and unzipped Aaron's fly... before reaching inside to pull out her throbbing cock. \"Oh my...!! A fair size it is too.\" she muttered approvingly. She saw no reason why she shouldn't take <i>Hand's</i> advice literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to breath heavy as she ran her hand along the length of her rigid member, back and forth until she had settled into a steady rhythm.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Helen walked back into the dark of the house, the creature inside her enjoying every wondrous jiggle of her sexy body and taking in the sights that the dark of night would permit her to see.  Rain dropped from the possessed woman's body as she stood in her kitchen, or rather as the thing inside her did so.  All the world seemed new again as Otch, the demon who had crawled out of the pit and into Helen, glanced about inside the modest home.  Suddenly, a noise startled the demon.  Helen's body looked up and beheld a lumbering figure in the doorway of the kitchen.  A small light was turned on, illuminating the figure.  It was a man of about 50 years old, fairly short for a man--probably about five feet seven inches tall, like Helen herself.  This man had only a few wisps of hair left atop his mostly bald head, and he was quite overweight.  His face was round with a rather pronounced double chin, and his torso with a sloppy jiggling mass, complete with man boobs and a sizeable beer gut acquired over years of unhealthy eating and a lack of exercise.  He now stood before his possessed wife clad in a stretched-out t-shirt and ill-fitting boxer shorts that revealed his every sloppy, fat-filled bulge.  It was Helen's slob of a husband--Walter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, you want some?\" he said as he held out a cereal bowl he had yet to fill.  Helen looked back at him.  \"Why--um, why are you all wet baby?\" he asked with a confused look on his face, \"you been outside?\"  Helen turned to face him, the water still dripping from her curvaceous body and her nightgown and lacey black bra struggling to contain the mounds that adorned her chest.  \"Wow momma!\" Walter said as he beheld his beautiful wife; that body oozed sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtch smiled with Helen's face.  He knew the power a form like this could wield over men.  \"I must confess, I've been a naughty boy,\" Walter said, a lustful smile crossing his face.  \"Have you?\" Helen said playfully, \"do you know what I do to naughty boys?\" she asked.  Walter began to take a couple steps toward Helen.  She looked over a knife wrack on the island in her kitchen.  The shiny blades of stainless steel were concealed inside the wooden wrack, but the handles stuck out above it.  An idea crossed Helen's mind, and she stuck out her hand, ready to give the knives a try.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a buzzing sound was heard in the kitchen.  It was not loud, but it was loud enough, and it was persistent.  There would be a buzz for maybe three to five seconds, then a break, then yet another buzz of the same length.  Walter looked crestfallen.  \"That's you, hon,\" he said as he waived to the table.  Helen looked over and saw a cell phone moving slowly across the table as it vibrated.  She picked it up and hit the appropriate button.  \"Hello?\" she said.  \"Hey girl!\" came an excited tone on the other end of the phone.  The demon recognized it as the voice of Waggy--a co-worker of Helen's a few years her junior.  Waggy was a character and a nice woman, and the relative similarity of age (as compared to Helen and most of her much younger compatriots) probably played a part in the fact that the two had struck up a friendship.  \"Waggy . . . \" Helen said, the demon having searched his host's mind for the name.  \"Damn right it's Waggy honey!,\" the woman said, \"hey listen babe, I'm headed your way on the trudge to work, and this storm's brutal.  I know we work the same hours, and I thought I might save you the drive.  Want me to pick you up?\"  Helen thought for a minute.  \"Sure,\" she said, \"I'd love a ride.\"  \"Groovy,\" Waggy said, \"oh and by the way how's my buddy Walt?\"  Helen smiled as she looked over at her horny husband.  \"Walter is well . . . in fact he and I were just about to jump into something,\" she began.  Walter's face lit up as lustful thoughts of fucking his wife right there in the kitchen filled his mind.  \"Oh I'm sorry if I interrupted you,\" Waggy started.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Walter, what Helen had in mind to do was quite different from what he had assumed, but Helen had in mind to finish what she had planned to start.  She waived her hand while she held the cell phone in the other.  Suddenly, two of the five knives in the wrack on the counter flew out of their resting places and sliced through Walter's bulging belly.  His eyes widened as the knives flew toward him, and he tensed up as they entered his gut.  His body jerked and convulsed as he tried to yell, his eyes filled with terror.  His attempts at a scream came out only as gargled, choked-off squeals.  Helen smiled at the sight.  \"Still upright, are we?  Well done . . . \" she complimented him as fear gripped the little fat man.  \"Let's see what we can do about that,\" Helen said as she waived her hand again.  With that, the other three knives, one of them about eighteen inches long, flew from the knife wrack and plunged into his gut, joining the two that were already there.  With that, Walter fell back on to the ground with a loud, destabilizing thud that shook the glassware in the cupboards.  His legs came up as the rest of him went down, then the legs plopped back down too as the fat man lay dead in the doorway of his own kitchen.  The bowl he had been holding skidded away a few feet as the five knives stuck out of his distended belly and blood gushed from the wound.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Waggy asked.  \"Must have been the wind,\" Helen said, \"and I just checked on Walter . . . he's down for the night, and maybe for longer,\" she said with a smile.  \"That's a shame . . . wanted to say hello,\" Waggy said, \"anyway, I'll be there in about ten minutes, so get ready hon,\" she said.  \"Will do,\" Helen replied, and she hung up the phone.  She smiled as she looked down at the now-expired Walter.  \"Not bad for my first kill out of the pit,\" she said as she stepped over him and headed into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen walked into her bedroom and threw off her robe, leaving herself covered only by her lacey black bra and panties.  Both hugged the appropriate curves, and Helen's boobs threatened to break free from their lacey prison if too much jiggling took place.  Helen pulled the red Wilkos blouse from the closet and put it on.  She buttoned up the silky thing, save for the last two or three buttons at the top.  Those boobs were a sight to behold, and she damn well wanted them visible.  She pulled out a set of tight-fitting black pants and shoved her full and meaty thighs into them.  The pants caressed the beautiful curve of her ample ass as she pulled them up, having to inhale just a little bit to get the cute little pouch of her belly to fit in.  Helen buttoned the pants and exhaled, and just a wee bit of her gut stuck out over the tight-fitting trousers.  She threw on a set of shoes over in the corner of the bedroom.  Otch looked at his new vessel in the mirror.  \"It's an honor to be inside you, my dear,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen heard the sound of a car pulling up outside and some lights from the same car passing over the area.  \"Waggy . . . \" Helen said as she made her way back to the kitchen, stepping over the dead Walter on the way.  Helen smiled as the gears turned in the possessed woman's head.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple of loud beeps of Waggy's car horn wrent the air as Helen stepped into the kitchen. A large pool of blood had formed beneath Walter's dead body, and Helen looked down at the corpse with a sick sense of admiration. She blinked - and her eyes turned an inky black again for a moment - then with another blink they were back to normal. \"I'll leave you to keep the vermin fed Walt.\" Helen chuckled, knowing that somewhere outside would be mice and rats eager for a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Otch was then ready, he steered his host's full-figured form out of the door and back out into the pouring rain. Waggy wound her window down and gestured for Helen to hurry. But Helen, or rather the demon inhabiting her form, was in no hurry. She took a slow walk down the path after closing the front door of the house and turning the key in the lock. \"Hurry up girl!\" Waggy called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No rush honey.\" Helen replied in a calm tone as she opened the door and manuevered into the passenger seat of Waggy's silver 4x4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This storm is horrible!\" Waggy sighed, looking through the rain-soaked windshield as the wipers struggled to clear the deluge. The second she finished saying that, a streak of lightning illuminated the night sky - followed moments later by a loud crack of thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen peered out of the window, then a smile crept upon her face. \"Hmm, I actually like it. It's raw power.\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaggy frowned, then shrugged as she looked at Helen. \"That's one way of looking at it I suppose. Come on, belt up, if I lose control of the car in this downpour you'll go flying through the windshield.\" she prompted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course, how silly of me.\" Helen said, looking down at herself. She pulled the seatbelt over her shoulder and clicked it into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtch looked down again at the seatbelt that now intersected the wonderous globes of flesh on his chest. It certainly emphasized them nicely. A wicked smirk again appeared on Helen's pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate working this late shift.\" Waggy grumbled as she set off driving. \"Be glad when it's over. I think I might ask Liz if I can switch shifts with someone else next week.\" she added. \"I don't like relying on a babysitter to watch the kids every night while Dave is working away.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen just sat and listened for a while as Waggy talked... and talked, then as soon as she shut up for a minute Helen turned to her. \"Oh I don't know, the most intriguing things seem to happen at night.\" she smiled devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Waggy scoffed. No sooner had she said that, the engine cut out and the car began slowly rolling to a stop. They were on a side road surrounded by houses, and when another streak of lightning lit up the sky... all the street lights flickered and threatened to go out. \"Oh come on baby,\" Waggy said, talking to her car like a child, \"don't fail on me now.\" she pleaded, making several unsuccessfuly attempts to restart the engine. \"Shit! We might not get to work at this rate love.\" Waggy grumbled, looking at Helen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get there, I'm not worried.\" Helen chuckled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And he followed Liz towards the Help Desk, where Liz picked up the phone and put a call through to Elizabeth in the manager's office upstairs. She just said that she needed her down on the shop floor to deal with 'a matter'. By the time Elizabeth had come downstairs, there was quite the gathering around the help desk. Liz, Mona, Luke, Rob, Rebekah, Liam and Steven were all there, curious as to what a man with a long white beard and a grey robe was doing in the store. And more staff were either peeking from their aisles or approaching to 'rubber-neck'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Elizabeth's arrival on the shop floor was heralded by the clicking of her high heels on the floor. \"What is it love?\" the manager asked. She stopped dead in her tracks when she saw the old man in the robe standing by the help desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Liz sighed. \"I found this gentleman wandering the store. He won't tell me how he got in. And he just said he dropped in for a visit.\" she explained to her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Elizabeth stepped forward, trying to look her professional best. \"So, can I ask who you are?\" she asked the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course, since you're treating me with such politeness.\" the old man laughed. \"Eorlund's the name, and trickery and mischief are my game.\" he stated, as he glanced over at Rebekah and arched an eyebrow while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, Mr... Eorlund, may I ask how you got into the shop?\" Elizabeth next inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why I materialized of course.\" he answered. \"Teleportation spells can be tricky things I know, somethimes you don't know where you'll end up. But they work most of the time.\" he chortled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The staff exchanged worried glances. They were now sure they were dealing with a nutjob. \"Um... spells?\" Elizabeth muttered, clearing her throat as she spoke. She couldn't hide her scepticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eorlund nodded. \"Yes my dear, spells. You know... arcane magic, witchcraft etc.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now it was Liz's turn to sound sceptical. \"Magic?\" she scoffed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your ignorance is really not a surprise I must say. But just because you do not believe in magic - doesn't mean it does not exist.\" Eorlund calmly responded to the store employees stood around him. A grin then appeared on Eorlund's face. \"Allow me to give a demonstration of my power.\" he mumbled, holding up his hand and giving a quick flick of his wrist. A swirl of glowing energy enveloped his hand, and as he then rotated his hand - the energy spiraled outwards and separated into a load of mini, magical tornadoes... enveloping each of the Wilkos employees in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The multiplied, swirling, twisters of magical energy...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Elizabeth noticed nothing except a small tingle in her chest as she received Becca's boobs, she remained a B-cup. For the rest of the staff though, the changes were apparent, some definitely more than others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck...\" The usually mild-mannered supervisor Liz blurted out as she reached up to her chest... only to feel her massive breasts shrinking. They kept dwindling, first to a G-cup, then F - E - D - and all the way to a small B-cup. Liz now had Kiran's small but perky teenage boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaggy barely noticed her change as her breasts morphed into Nicola's slightly bigger, older ones The extra stretch marks on them were the only things that told Waggy whose boobs she now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte, Helen, Becca, Laura, Mona and the two Parkgate girls Jessica and Kiran all gasped in shock as their breasts deflated altogether. They now had Liam's, Mark's, Steven's, Shaun's, Aaron's, Luke's and Rob's chests respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEorlund watched in amusement as the seven female employees became flat-chested. And his grin grew even broader when he watched Luke's discomfort as Liz's huge breasts erupted from his chest... stretching his shirt. \"Holy shit!!!\" Luke grumbled as the extra weight  caused him to shift forward. Luke's hands shot up to the 'melons' on his chest and he tried to stop them from moving under his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Luke wasn't on his own in gaining a pair of tits, but none could compare to the size of Luke's of course. Shaun found himself with Mona's perky boobs, Rob now had Waggy's breasts on his chest, Steven's shirt became distended with Natalie's tits, Mark had Charlotte's boobs, and Liam found himself fondling Rebekah's breasts, which he was now the not-so-proud owner of. Then there was Aaron, Helen recognized the D-cup breasts that pushed out his shirt as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!!\" Nicola muttered as she peeped down her shirt at her new breasts, that used to belong to her manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I swap too?\" Rebekah mumbled to herself, as she felt her boobs. They did seem a tad larger, and with good reason, since she now had Jessica's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie meanwhile had been downsized in the boob department, since she got Laura's B-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do??\" Liz snapped at Eorlund after she had finished feeling up her small breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Livened things up a little my dear.\" Eorlund responded rambunctiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked around at her staff and quickly located the person who now had her breasts. \"LUKE!!\" she shouted. \"Stop that!\" she demanded, when she saw the lanky employee feeling up his new mammaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this is happening!\" Elizabeth shook her head, even as she inspected her own breasts down her top. She assumed she had been swapped too, but couldn't really tell. \"Why did you swap us?\" she then asked Eorlund. \"Surely you could have cast a simpler spell to convince us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEorlund clucked his tongue. \"That won't do my dear. Why settle for a paltry spell when you have some really fun ones in your repertoir.\" he chuckled, as he enjoyed the reactions of the store employees. Some obviously liked their swaps, like Rebekah and Nicola, and others were seething, such as Aaron (his masculine pride severely dented by his new tits) and nearly all the women who had lost their boobs entirely (Becca being the exception, she found it 'weirdly arousing').<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope you can swap us back.\" Liz growled at the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can, yes. If I so wish.\" Eorlund smirked wickedly as he arched an eyebrow in the supervisor's direction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first wave of the multicolored tornadoes descended upon the stunned manager, supervisor and crowd. Only Liz had time to let out a strangled gasp before she was completely engulfed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man's lips creased into a small smile, almost content. He stood in stark contrast to the growing windstorm. With another wave of his hand, another spiral of energy emanated outward. It once again split into many smaller tornadoes that gusted through the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerchandise of all kinds; tools, paint cans, pharmaceuticals, and even a couple loose shelves scattered in the wind, clattering against the floors and walls and, in the case of one pair of scissors, embedding itself in the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore screams of surprise could be heard as the rest of the employees were summarily engulfed. Windows shattered as what seemed to be thousands of these tiny tornadoes flew outdoors to seek other prey. The wind grew more and more rapid when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, just at it quickly began, the windstorm stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz suddenly became quite aware of the cool ceramic tiles on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wha- What happened?</i> Was the first thought that went through her mind. It was closing time, an old man \"teleported\" into the store, there was a multicolored wind, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew one thing for sure. She felt an incredible sense of vertigo. And something was not quite right with her pants. They felt strangely awkward. With a sharp intake of air, she got to her hands and knees-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the old man, towering over her and looking down on her prone figure. However, she looked at him with a new light. The grey robes no longer made him look like some nutjob he believed himself in the wrong century. An aura of imperiousness seemed to hang over him, like the one she had seen in those painting of Odin or Zeus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what have you done?\" She heard her manager ask, in a much less professional voice than she had ever heard her use. She was vaguely aware of the crumpled over forms of the others around her, who were struggling to their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mischievous One\" gave a warm smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well... now we see what happens when I blur the lines a little.\" Eorlund chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-t-that was magic?\" Rebekah asked as she sat up.

She too could feel something 'strange' about her pants, as though they were suddenly a lot tighter... incredibly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEorlund looked down on Rebekah's seated form and smirked. \"Just a little demonstration my dear, nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck have you done??\" Aaron's familiar voice suddenly barked out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All will be clear in a short time, I'm sure.\" Eorlund replied to Aaron, his frown indicating his displeasure with Aaron's language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elizabeth tried to get to her feet, the heels of her pumps scraped on the floor, and she ended up slumping back down on her backside for a moment while her dizziness went off. Only then did she look around at the mess Eorlund had made. Shelves and stock were scattered all over the place, it really looked like there had been an earthquake of something. \"Look what you've done.\" Elizabeth sighed, delivering a scowl to the robed old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should prioritize a little my dear. This mess will clear up easily enough, I'm afraid powerful magic always disturbs the surrounding area in some way, it's quite unavoidable I assure you.\" Eorlund explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel right!\" Mona suddenly groaned, holding a hand to her head. Her black jeans also seemed a little 'taut' in a certain area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz remained on her hands and knees, she looked up and saw a couple of the other lads, Rob and Liam, both frantically patting their crotches, as though trying to locate something that wasn't there. They were both grumbling and swearing under their breaths. And as more and more staff members became aware of what had happened, their reactions became more lively as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you all get paid for laying around?\" Eorlund began talking again. He clapped his hands as he looked at the stunned people in front of him. \"Come on, on your feet, let's start tidying up shall we?\" he smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can't you use another spell to... tidy up?\" Jessica dared to ask, from her position on the floor a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica!!\" Liz quietly admonished the ginger employee. \"No more magic!\" Liz then said to Eorlund as she slowly began to stand up. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eorlund's lips pursed slightly in response, but he made no response. Like any dapper gentleman, he apparently had little tolerance for (non-magical) curses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that Liz had felt? It reminded her of the time when she had been kicked straight in the groin. Just recalling the incident made her wince. Let it never be said that women were impervious to groin shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the odd part.

This was not unoticed by Eorlund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a fucking pussy!!\" Aaron grunted at the old man, after peeking down his pants to see the vagina he now owned (complete with a thin strip of pubic hair).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now is there any need to resort to that kind of language young man?\" Eorlund sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what??

Nearly all the women now had obvious hard ons, as if their hormones had kicked into overdrive because of their suddenly change of gender. She knew it was probably only temporary, but it was still embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Liz couldn't forget about the men of course, and when she glanced over at Steven, she saw him blushing as much as Elizabeth.

Aaron's trousers and boxer shorts were vaporized... leaving him standing there in just his shirt, socks and sneakers... with his vagina on display for all his co-workers to gawk at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more interruptions please.\" Eorlund then announced calmly, as Aaron bolted away from the help desk to grab something to cover himself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you've proved to us magic is real, now swap us back please.\" Liz courteously said to Eorlund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why so soon?

Nicola and Jessica nodded in agreement, as the latter also tried to adjust her cock into a more comfortable position inside her sexy lace knickers.

The first... if Kay weren't mistaken, she looked sort of Indian, as in, she came from the subcontinent known as India.

When the beautician began standing up straight, she became aware of a 'tightness' in her pants. She couldn't explain it, and thought it would go off.

No puffs of smoke, glowing light, or winds. Just one moment, he was there, and the next moment he was gone. No trace of the old man remained. For a few moments, the Wilko staff just stared at where the old man had been, completely aghast at everything that had transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz turned to her manager. \"What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth blinked. Right, she was supposed to be the manager. She was supposed to assign jobs and order everyone around. Yet, for the first time in a long while, she felt completely powerless. This old coot had walked in, disfigured them all, wrecked the store, and just waltzed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's eyes drifted from the tent in her skirt to the utterly ruined store. She really was not up for cleaning any of it up and she was quite sure that neither was anyone else. Some of those damages looked quite beyond repair. But if it didn't get cleaned up, the store would be unable to open tomorrow and she would never hear the end from the higher ups...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of the clients, Maya, was actually the older sister of Wilko employee Suki, and she had popped in for her nails done. She certainly didn't expect to sprout a penis while in Beautylicious. And neither did the other woman, Lucy, whose family was from Taiwan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you going?\" Zoe asked Kay when she saw her turning the door knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay glanced over her shoulder. \"I have to get home, I'm sorry. And... I wouldn't know what to do to help you anyway. We don't even know what's happened to everyone.\" she told Zoe. And this was the case, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why weren't you affected?\" Zoe then asked Kay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I managed to dive under the reception desk when that glowing tornado thingie blew in. It didn't get me.\" Kay answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's envy was apparent. \"Lucky you.\" she grumbled at Kay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kay had said her goodbyes, Zoe, Maya and Lucy all turned to Carly, expecting her to somehow get them out of this mess. This was her salon after all, or... what was left of it. \"That looks painful!\" Zoe commented, gesturing down to Carly's boot-cut trousers. Her new genitals certainly looked ridiculously constricted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not comfortable, put it that way.\" Carly sighed, gazing down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya happened to be wearing hip-hugger jeans and she was now constantly adjusting her 'package' too. When she reached into her knickers and touched her cock for the first time... she squealed and jumped slightly. \"It's white!\" Maya mumbled, having peeked into her knickers at her penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think we... swapped with someone?\" Lucky spoke up timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is disgusting!\" Zoe grimaced, gesturing wildly with her hands as she started down at her tented skirt. All she could think about was her homelife, her husband Chris and their 4-year old daughter Arissia. How would she react when she found out her mummy had a 'willy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone calm down,\" Carly eventually spoke up, \"I'll pop down to Wilko and see if they know what happened.\"  With that she grabbed her coat and clicked outside in her heels. The scene in the street was equally chaotic, debris everywhere, and a few people, most of them men, were curiously or frantically inspecting their crotches, obviously having lost or gained something anatomically important. \"Wow, it's obviously not just us.\" Carly mumbled, before she made her way to down to the store where her mum used to work. She tried to hide the fact that she had something 'foreign' in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly knocked on the door, seeing the staff all gathered around the help desk in an apparent 'crisis meeting'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was that!?\" A wild-eyed Liam asked, pressing his back up against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I cant just go home like this!\" One voice shouted which was followed by a chorus of agreements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did he have to leave such a mess?\" Kiran lamented as she gestured toward the ruins that were once tidily ordered aisles of merchandise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was immediately set upon by Charlotte and Mona. \"Not important right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! If I ever see that asshole again...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on and on they went, often repeating themselves, and even more often, wishing harm upon the \"Mischievous One.\" Even the more level-headed ones, such as Helen; Mark and Waggy, named their own grievances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Liz was the only one who heard the loud \"rap\" on the door. She sucked in a breath and walked over. Who could it be at this hour? Did Eorlund return with more tortures in mind for them? Or was it another omnipotent trickster? She shivered slightly at what else such beings could do to them. Swap chests? Swap heads? Swap minds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one look at the door put those thoughts to rest. But another wave of dread swept through Liz's mind. She couldn't allow Carly to see her in such a state-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she glimpsed the bulge on the girl's groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Could Eorlund's mischief been more widespread than she thought?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz opened the door for Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for barging in.\" Carly said. \"Something came up and we wanted to see if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's eyes widened slightly when she took in the sorry state of the store.

Even though it hadn't exactly been his fault that the house was in the mess that it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric moved to start tidying things up however, he felt a little 'weird', and he slumped back down on his ass when he became aware of a peculiar lack of sensation in his groin. It was as though something was missing... something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief pat of his crotch caused his pants to push in more than they should have been able to. Eric's eyebrow arched as panic started to set in. And he grew more frantic as he reached into his pants, trying to locate his cock. After 10 seconds of fruitless rumaging around in his boxer shorts, a horrified Eric came to the terrifying realization that his penis - and his testicles - were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This can't be real, no way!</i> Eric repeated in his head as he managed to get to his feet and fumbled with the button fastening his pants. Once that was undone he pulled his zipper down and pushed his pants to his ankles, followed by his boxer shorts. As he then lifted up the bottom of his t-shirt... a loud, deep gasp escaped his lips. Nestled between his legs was a young woman's vagina, with a thin strip of ginger pubic hair situated above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... the... FUCK??\" Eric bellowed out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Eric didn't really care what kind of state the house was in. Because he was in a worse one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know how he was going to explain this one to Liz.

A few of the younger employees, namely Rebekah, Mona, Laura, Charlotte, and Rob had relocated to aisle 1, one of the places that had been less damaged by the miniature tornadoes, and squatted in a circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do next?\" Laura picked up a roll of toilet paper and set it on the shelf. \"I mean, after we clean this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that obvious.\" Charlotte spat. \"We find that asshole and make him pay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we even find him?\" Rob threw up his arms. \"We saw him, he can just... disappear whenever he wants to.

Waggy's bulge in particular seemed to be quite big, and she was wearing her usual tight trousers for added discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, pretty shitty night huh?\" Steven sighed, looking at his co-workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Jessica nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie glanced across the street to an alley and grimaced when she saw a middle-aged man, obviously drunk, collapsed against a wall with his hand down his pants. From his hand movements and from the moans he was making... she could guess that the guy now had a vagina. But masturbating in the street... ? Ugh... None of of them could have known that it was Nicola's vagina that the drunk was now frigging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's uncalled for.\" Jessica frowned when she saw the drunk too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaggy was too preoccupied with her own problem to worry about anybody else's. And when Liz finally emerged from the store again, Waggy headed straight to her car and psyched herself up to go home. She couldn't believe she now had a bigger cock than her husband Dave. And she was also worried about the reactions of her young son, Jack, 6, and daughter Eden, 5 if they ever found out about \"mummy's penis\". Waggy silently cursed Eorlund as she drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie also went to her car, while Steven walked Jessica to the bus station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, here I go.\" Liz sighed to herself, as she slipped behind the wheel of her car. She put her seatbelt on, then reached down to have another grope of the firm bulge in her trousers before starting up the engine. She was dreading Eric's reaction to her 'change'. Maybe she could hide it from him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah right...</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was closely followed by a bundle of pink, who flailed madly at her brother. Once again, Jack was trying to get a rise out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack snorted, using his not-insignificant height advantage to hold his younger sister at bay. \"Boy's are better at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden let out a loud \"Hmph,\" \"You're just jealous because I'm bigger than you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaggy's world seemed to turn black and white as she slumped to her knees.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The erection in her knickers actually subsided for a while on the way over to her house, probably because she was focused on not crashing the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by the time she reached the front door of her house... her raging boner had returned. What pissed Zoe off the most was how little control she had over the thing, it had a mind of it's own.

She exhaled deeply then took another deep breath and bolted up stairs as fast as her restrictive skirt would allow. When she burst into Arissia's room she saw Chris standing there looking somewhat pale. And Chris' expression grew even more 'stressed' when he glanced down at his wife's groin. \"You too??\" He mumbled despondently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MUMMY!!! I have a willy!\" Arissia's voice screeched out, from only three feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's jaw fell open in shock when she saw her cute little daughter, dressed in the same sky blue dress she had dressed her in that morning, only now there was a rather large protrusion in the front. <i>Oh god...</i> Zoe actually felt a little sick to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mummy, you have one too!\" Rissi then pointed to the tent in her mother's skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably for the first time in her life, an embarrassed, distraught Zoe was utterly speechless...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had politely but firmly sent a grumbling Jack, who apparently was untouched by the tornado, back up to his room. From there, Waggy got the rest of the families' side of the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them had been in the living room watching tv when the tornado struck. Neither Eden nor Waggy's husband saw them coming, one moment they were on the couch, the next moment, they were lying on the floor in a heap of rubbish.

Taking deep breaths didn't really help either. Maybe because it was the fact her family were Muslims from Iran, Mona was scared how her parents, particularly her father, would react if they found out their only daughter had a penis between her legs because of some cooky wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No good stalling it.</i> Mona thought with a shake of her head as she went into the house. Her mother was there to greet her immediately. Thankfully, the hallway was dimmed because of the type of lampshade the family used to cover the light blubs. But Mona could see what state the house was in, trashed just like Wilko had been earlier. This was a bad omen indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mona...\" Her mother spoke up, her voice groggy slightly as she approached. \"Something terrible has happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona raised both eyebrows in a gesture of slight irritation. \"I can see that mum. What's wrong?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father....\" Mona's mother mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona's eyes narrowed. \"What about him? Is he okay?\" She was growing concerned now, and for a moment, she forgot about the 'extra baggage' she was carrying between her own legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me his penis... um... was gone.\" Mona's mother announced, frowning as she said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT???\" Mona cried out. <i>It had happened at her house too?</i>. \"Where is he?\" Mona asked in a frantic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother put her hand on her daughter's shoulder. \"He wanted to left alone. You can imagine his mood right now.\" she muttered in a quiet voice. And Mona could imagine, all too clearly what effect this would be having on her father. He was a proud Muslim man, and to lose his penis and gain a vagina... must have been almost shameful to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go upstairs.\" Mona told her mother, before scurrying off. She didn't think it the right time yet to inform her mother that she had a raging hard on between her legs. After all, girls had their pride too. Once in her room, Mona slammed the door shut and barricaded it for a time, then she hesitated before removing her work clothes. As she pulled down her knickers... her hard cock sprang into view, her two balls slung underneath. What Mona immediately noticed... was that skin tone of her new genitals matched the rest of her body. Also, a few of her pubic hairs were greying, indicating her new equipment was middle-aged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frightening, sickening thought suddenly entered Mona's head. <i>Is this my dad's penis??</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona just closed her eyes and wished it was all a nightmare...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tightness of the dress left very little to the imagination, especially now in her crotch area.

But there was a few people in the street, despite the lateness of the hour, and then there was a drunk passed out in an alley, having 'frigged' himself to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, you ready?\" Debbie asked Dale, as she neatened her hair a little. \"And keep the camera stable. I don't want it drifting down to my groin while I'm wearing this dress.\" she scowled at him, giving him advanced warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Dale gave the thumbs up, as he prepared to start filming.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Had it been just anyone, he would've assumed it was just some tranny trying to get some attention. However, he knew Amber. She was a regular patient and those times when he had seen her naked, she definitely had a vagina. The fact that the penis dangling between her legs was of a tan color in contrast to her pale tone further validated the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to sound crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber took a deep breath and then recounted how a glowing, multicolored tornado flew right into her house, wrecking the place and knocking her out. When she woke up, her vagina was gone and she had a penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds crazy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I believe you.\" Gilbert lied through his teeth. Gilbert hadn't learnt anything about weather patterns since those mandatory classes in college, but he could safely assume that what Amber described was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of them could talk anymore, the door burst open and one of the nurses poked her head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, we have another one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now?\" Gilbert rubbed his chin. Indeed, people like Amber, who claimed to have had their genitals swapped to that of the opposite gender's had been trickling in since a few hours ago.

As she talked, she nonchalantly caressed her penis through the fabric of her work trousers. Now the initial shock had worn off, it was hardly more than a 'discomfort'. She certainly hadn't adjusted to having it between her legs though.

Namely... a pair of her loose-fitting jogging bottoms and a low-cut t-shirt. It was an odd feeling when Liz glanced down at her own cleavage... and immediately got another hard on. \"Seriously?? My own boobs can give me a stiffy?\" she groaned in annoyance. <i>Great.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving slipped her feet into a pair of her sneakers, Liz then went down to start supper. \"I'll give you a shout when I need you babes.\" she told Eric in passing, as he turned the TV on to help take his mind off their situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had Liz got in the kitchen - Eric called her back into the living room. \"Er... honey, you're gonna want to see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What now?</i> Liz sighed, putting down the carving knife and wandering back into the other room. \"What?\" she said to Eric, before automatically directing her eyes to the TV screen, where a female reporter was stood outside a deserted Wilkos, telling an all too familiar story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Crap...\"</i> Liz gulped, before glancing back over to Eric.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not even the local law enforcement were completely safe from the phenomenon, as Christopher and Dominika could safely attest. Thankfully, the woman's uniform was much more baggier than usual, so unless if someone really looked for the bulge, it was rather hard to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were quickly met by another policeman, a large bear of a man complete with a scraggy beard and bushy eyebrows.

Just some drunk passed out in the alleyway.\" Mason wrinkled his nose as he remembered that event. It quickly became obvious that the man had been swapped. What's more, the entire area smelled well... foul. Mason was quite sure not all of that smell came from the puddle of puke a couple of meters away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seen anything?\" Mason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just a couple of women.\" Christopher shrugged. \"They seemed to have had sobered up by the time we got to them, so I sent them in Debbie's direction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the front of Wilkos had grown crowded with both the media as well as victims of this phenomena.

Indeed, even with these baggier clothes, she hadn't had the time to change her knickers, and her balls were screaming for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true.\" Christopher sighed. It had been unclear whether they had been sent to investigate or keep the peace (Christopher was not good at listening), but their presence felt a tad unnecessary either way. While their was plenty of anger and grief running around, it didn't seem like it had hit a fever pitch yet. As for investigation, all they had really gotten was \"colorful tornadoes,\" which the entire police station already knew, for many of the other people on the force were still trying to fix the place back up.</span></div></div>",

It didn't exactly have a front yard, but a couple of flower pots sat outside holding nothing but dirt and a couple of courageous weeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Dominika did not pay any of this much heed as she marched straight up to the front door and banged the knocker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe banged at it again. \"This is the police, open up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing. A stab of annoyance shot through Dominika's chest and she kicked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple more tries, all were met with no response from the house. Now that Dominika scanned the house, she noticed that none of the lights were on. It was as if no one lived there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Abigail. \"This is your house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nod, Dominika could see tears welling up in the little girl's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be alright.\" She placed a hand on the girl's head, but it was quickly swatted aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No its not!\" Abigail cried. \"Daddy and Mummy hates me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they don't I'm sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They hate me! I stole their willy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Abigail dissolved into a blubbering fit with Dominika doing her best to speak in a low, soothing tone as possible, all the while, Dominika tried to hide her growing antipathy towards the girl's family.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she tested the temperature of the water by holding her hand under it, she couldn't help but peer down past her large breasts at the hard-on she still sported, rigid at a 130 degree angle. <i>Least I've got something to hang the towel on</i>. she sighed. Part of her wondered whether a cold shower would be better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't stand cold water on her body, so she stuck to the original plan. She hopped in, and tried to keep her mind on other things, to distract herself. Easier said than done however, for all she could think about was her own, aching boner and the ginger pussy that her husband was now the owner of. Come to think of it, the color of Eric's thin strip of pubic hair matched Jessica's hair at work. Liz had to wonder....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz imagined sliding her cock into Eric's new womanhood, she began to breath heavier. And as the water poured down over her body, her huge boobs in particular, Liz wrapped one of her hands around her hard penis and began to slowly, methodically... wank herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz partly hated herself at that moment, her hormones and it seemed her preferences too, were all over the place. The only thing she found attractive about her husband anymore was the vagina between his legs. Did this mean she was a lesbian? Or a bisexual shemale? She just didn't know. But she wasn't on her own in any case, her husband Eric now had a craving for cock that he daren't admit to, not even to his wife. As Liz was in the shower... Eric was carefully beginning to probe the confines of his young pussy with his coarse fingers. And as he did so... he pictured the throbbing member between his wife's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was certainly an interesting night for everyone involved in this whole thing, Liz and Eric included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\n20 minutes after Liz hopped in the shower, she emerged into the bedroom, fully clothed again. Having masturbated in the shower and having had her first ever male orgasm, she seemed a little more relaxed. Eric noticed this, however he was still feeling the sexual energy rushing through his altered body, thanks to the build up of estrogen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, the couple were usually ready for bed, but neither was tired. \"Want to watch a film?\" Liz asked her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Eric grumbled, as he slumped back against the pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz reached down to the few DVDs that were at her bedside, and randomly selected one. <i>Basic Instinct.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Charlotte spun around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah was sprawled out against the wall, head cocked to the side and cock pointing upwards. Rob was curled up on the ground in the fetal position.

It had also made her wonder why she had even bothered having a shower before hand. Putting the film Basic Instinct on was probably, in hindsight, not a clever move if they had wanted to avoid any - hijinks. But the moment Liz watched Sharon Stone crossing and uncrossing her legs... she knew she had to shove her rigid cock into the nearest pussy, which happened to be Eric's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd had sex three times during the night, and any brief thought Liz might have had of not 'abusing' someone else's genitals while she had them, disappeared the second Liz thrust her meaty shaft into Eric's welcoming vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the aftermath was for Liz - an aching penis and bed sheets spattered with her cum, and Eric was still sleeping soundly... snoring in fact, having been worn down by his horny wife. Liz knew she should have felt some modicum of shame, but the truth was, she just couldn't. And she couldn't help but grin when she peeked under the jizz-stained covers and saw she was sporting another hard on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric.\" Liz nudged her husband awake. \"You'll be late for work.\" she muttered, as she threw the sheets back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric yawned, then looked down at his wife's 'morning wood' with a look of bewilderment on his face. \"You ready to go again?\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll have to wait for tonight babes, we've both got work to go to.\" Liz answered. Though she knew that with the crowd outside of Wilkos, which now included reporters from across the country, and even a few from mainland Europe and the U.S, she knew that her day was going to be anything but routine. First thing on Liz's 'to do' list, was to have another wank in the bathroom and get rid of her erection, at least for a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Liz left the bedroom, she looked back to see the silly smirk on her husband's face as he peeked under the sheets at his ginger snatch, which was caked in Liz's jizz. She knew all too well the pleasurable sensations a well-fucked pussy could give the morning after sex, but that was Eric's to enjoy now, since he was now the proud owner of a young woman's (Jessica's) vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My old vibrator is in the bottom drawer if you want to use it before you leave.\" Liz chuckled, winking at Eric before disappearing into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea.\" Eric mumbled, as he reached over and rumaged through the drawer. He then had the pleasure of inserting Liz's vibrator into his still moist pussy, while listening to the feminine grunts coming from the bathroom as his wife 'rubbed one out'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Much to her consternation, she had learned last night that the damages were not restricted solely to the hallways, but had managed to seep into the bedrooms as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at the still-sleeping form of her husband. An ache ran through her penis. Much to her shame, she found herself yearning to feel his cock planted between her butt cheeks. She winced, she had never entertained such disgusting thoughts in her life. In fact, the relationship with her first boyfriend fell apart when he insisted on trying anal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, her concerns about her future sex life immediately ebbed away when another thought hit her like a freight train.

The off-duty officer desperately tried to make out some features under the blue hood, to no avail. \"You humans, so ignorant of the other realms that exist beyond your own pitiful plain of existence. You have no idea of the power we can wield. What Eorlund did was a mere foretaste.\" The figure said, waving it's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominika immediately felt her boobs wobble on her chest... then inflate by three full cup sizes... stretching her bra. Then just as quickly... her breasts shrank to nothing, disappearing completely. \"My breasts!!\" Dominika cried, reachng up to pat her now flat chest. She seemed somewhat relieved when her boobs reappeared moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, any assistance would be useful to my search.\" Hermolas sighed almost, indicating it's impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... we think this 'swapping' thing started at a shop, er... Wilkos, in town. Near where I live.\" Dominika mumbled, now clearly frightened at what this mysterious intruder could do to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Hermolas said quietly. And with that, Dominika and Hermolas appeared back in her home... just in time for them to hear little Abigail moan upstairs as she ejaculated for the first time.

It wasn't the content of the words, but how they were spoken. It was a bland monotone, but there was a lot of force behind them. Ever since this \"Hermolas\" (what kind of name was that, anyways?) came into her abode, Dominika felt as if she were a prisoner in her own house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail seemed to feel similarly as whenever the hooded face turned to her and attempted to hide herself under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two did their best to eat their breakfast in peace.

She let out a sigh as she felt her penis twitch in her knickers again. At least she had chosen to wear a trouser suit today instead of a skirt suit, so her 'boner' would be less noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already 10 minutes late in opening the shop, but a part of her didn't want to brave the inquisitive, angry crowd. She had lost count of the number of times she had cursed Eorlund overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock on her car window, and Elizabeth was startled. Looking to her right, she saw a middle-aged traffic warden standing there. \"You can't stay here luv, it's not a parking space.\" The male warden mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course, sorry.\" Elizabeth sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the crowd huh?\" The warden then gestured up the street. \"I sure hope they find out what's happened, I hate having my wife's muff.\" he grumbled. Elizabeth happened to glance down to the warden's crotch, eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of talking with the warden further, Elizabeth started her car up and decided to 'brave the storm'. She drove up outside of work, slowing to make her way through the vast array of cameras and reporters (as well as swapped onlookers). When she parked on the loading bay, the press began to gather like vultures around a Wildebeest carcass on the Serengetti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know anything really, please... j-just let me get p-passed.\" Elizabeth stuttered, fighting her way through the crowd. As she did so she was bombarded with an array of questions;- <i>What happened in your store? Were you responsible for this? Do you know what's happening? Do you have a penis?</i> Elizabeth ignored them all, sliding her key into the lock that lifted the shutter on the front entrance. Then when that was up, she unlocked the doors, disappeared inside the store and locked the doors again. After flicking the lights on in the store and catching a glimpse of the displaced items that still needed tidying up, Elizabeth sighed and made her way upstairs to her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you just fucking go down already!\" she growled at the erection in her pants. \"I have enough problems.\" she thought, rubbing her forehead.

All the other news stations seemed to have caught up to Debbie and were trying to cash in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was definitely going to be on international news...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it?\" The cloak shuffled as Hermolas started towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Yeah.\" Dominika said. \"It's that red building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermolas scoffed. \"About time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stepped past Dominika towards the store. A couple of people towards the edge of the crowd pointed and whispered questions to each other. Dominika couldn't blame them. Hermolas, well... it went without saying that it looked odd.

Visions of the 'steamy' night she had spent with Eric were still fresh in her head. A small part of her was ashamed, the larger part of her wasn't. She knew they wouldn't have been the only couple to have 'experimented' last night with their new 'plumbing'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sighed as she got nearer to the town center, seeing the number of people in the streets getting larger as she got closer to Wilkos. She had to break suddenly and pap her horn when a woman just managed to stop her young son from running out into the road.

When the positive reply came back, Liz drove slowly up to where the loading bay was, and pulled onto it, parking next to her manager's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took just seconds for the reporters to take note of Liz exiting her car. The 'Wilko' on her fleece jacket drew them like moths around a flame. Liz lowered her head and forced her way through the crowd, fumbling in her pocket to get her store key out. She ignored all the questions she was bombarded with, but was startled when a woman in her thirties suddenly lunged forward and grabbed her. \"WHY DID YOU DO THIS??\" The woman screamed, tugging on Liz's jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was on impulse, Liz lifted her knee and it made contact with the male genitalia between her assailant's legs.

At the very least, as normal as a guy with a vagina could feel.

Clearly, they were all beginning to enjoy what was happening. Even Mona and Charlotte, who had been the most distraught with their swaps, were now talking to each other and comparing dicks. \"Put those away girls, no point in teasing the boys.\" Elizabeth giggled to the two employees. <i>At least too much.</i> She then thought, looking across to see the 'men' all squirming a little, adjusting not only to their new anatomy, but also the snug, girly underwear they were now wearing under their pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this thing feels amazing.\" Elizabeth almost squealed to herself, caressing Liam's young cock under her own skirt. She had never been so turned on before, she was as hard as the other seven women around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that old bastard anyway?\" Aaron suddenly chimed up, growling as he stepped forward somewhat apprehensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea Aaron, and do stop swearing!\" Elizabeth berated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why would he do this?\" Steven asked, scratching at Charlotte's teenage cooch between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz answered Steven's question the only way she could. \"You know as much as we do Steven. We have no idea.\" The supervisor grinned, walking with a slightly more masculine gait. \"The only thing that's clear here, is we girls all have your dicks,\" she said, cupping her package, \"and you 'boys' have our pussies.\" Liz then told him. Steven could sense the 'pride' that dripped from Liz's words as she smirked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll punch that old git's lights out if he comes back.\" Liam grumbled, gyrating his hips a little. Having his boss's pussy was bad enough, but having to wear her feminine underwear was worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz did then happen to glance over at Shaun and Josh, two of the older guys, quietly talking about their new underwear, trying to discuss whose looked better. Josh won, on account that he now wore Kiran's sexy, white lace knickers with a red ribbon on the waistband. Liz felt her cock throb and her large nipples harden as she watched the guys conversing and writhing in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed she didn't know why Eorlund had done this, neither did anyone else around her.

Aaron, give me your jeans and trainers.\" She almost demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off, no way!\" Aaron snapped back while glaring at Natalie, who was now taller than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they don't fit you anymore.\" Natalie pointed out, pointing at Aaron's black jeans, which were being held up only by his wider, girly hips that had accompanied his soft new ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not wearing a fucking skirt!\" Aaron swore. \"And what about shoes? Yours are ruined because of that old turd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth quickly stepped in. \"Aaron, give Natalie your jeans, socks and shoes please. Aaron looked at his manager for a moment, and considered going against her order, but eventually relented. The estrogen flowing his body seemed to be making him gradually less aggressive. He reluctantly stripped out of his sneakers work jeans, revealing his smooth, shapely legs and slender feet with their painted toe nails, as well as his shapely backside and his panty-covered vagina. And he handed them all to Natalie, who handed off her skirt in exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I may have an old pair of running shoes in my locker Aaron, I'll look in a bit.\" Natalie said, as she slipped her hairy legs into her new black jeans, then put on Aaron's socks and trainers too. \"Oh that's better.\" She smiled, feeling properly attired again. She gave her boner a stiff rub through her jeans and then glanced at her co-workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody else seemed to have been swapped further... at least not yet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She now sported all of Mark's lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the toilet stall, a distraught and much shorter Mark suddenly staggered out on his new size 5 feet, leaving his size 11 sneakers behind, along with the rest of his clothes from the waist down.

Her frame shook gently, but in the end, she coughed and exhaled some smoke. Kiran brought the rolled-up cigarette up and take another drag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Isn't that what Liam usually smokes?'', Jade recognized the distinctive brand on the cigarette paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What? Let me see,'' Charlotte held Kiran's hand steady while she took a good look at the rolled-up cigarette,''How can anyone smoke this shit?'' the older Wilkos staff turned away in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, I quite like it,'' Kiran laughed at Charlotte's jibe. She wasn't ruffled at all by Charlotte's rather 'rude' and obnoxious behaviour. Although she'd just been very recently 'loaned' to the current Wilkos to help out and to get some training, she had been able to integrate well with the rest of the staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Speaking of Liam,'' Charlotte opened her mouth again, '' I can't understand how he's still working here,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What'd you mean?'', Jade exhaled a long stream of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Guy's a slacker,'' Charlotte complained, '' and a perv,'' the girl adds quickly. ''I once caught him staring at Becca's ass when they worked together stocking up the toiletries.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Becca does have a nice ass,'' Kiran said dreamily as she stared at Jade's almost C-cup chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Huh? Did you say something?'' Jade turned to Kiran, making the latter break her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nothing,'' Kiran murmured as she took another drag from her rapidly shortening cigarette,''Probably the guy couldn't help it. Even I want to take a look sometimes,'' Kiran giggled, the image of Becca's ass forming on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I think you caught Liam-itis,'' Charlotte rolled her eyes, ''Speaking of which, this is the second time you've covered his shift this week. Don't feel like you have to do it just because Liz assigned you with him. I don't even know what Miss Big Tits was thinking.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, don't worry about that,'' Kiran said and threw the stump of her cigarette, before extinguishing it with her sole, ''I could use the extra money and experience anyway,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're working too hard,'' Jade laughed. ''Besides, what happened to him anyway?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran folded her arms under her B-cup bosom, ''Oh, he's doing other things, I think. He didn't say much.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I bet he's just too lazy to turn up to work. '' Charlotte snickered and snuffed out her cigarette. ''I say we should get back now before Miss Big Tits comes out to find us,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Right behind you,'' Kiran followed the two employees as they walked back to the building from the staff entrance, while admiring their asses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Great work all,'' Liz said as every employee shuffled out from the staff room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiran made her way out of the store, she saw some employees huddling around the entrance talking among themselves. Just out of sheer curiousity she made her way towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, Kiran,'' Luke greeted her,''We're going to have a pint before going home, want to tag along?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Who's 'we'?'', Kiran walked closer to the group and saw the faces more clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh, yeah,'' Luke muttered, ''Steven, Charlotte, Rob, Shaun, Aaron, Natalie, Melissa,\" He pointed to the people standing there, ''Oh, of course I'll be coming, and Liz and Elizabeth might come along after they lock up, at least that's what Liz said,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's what she said,'' Rob quipped, perhaps a bit too loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ignore this guy,'' Natalie laughed and turned to Kiran, ''We could get to know each other better,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, sure,'' Kiran smiled. Unconsciously, she patted her small duffel bag, where a Costume Gun was hidden underneath some clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Is Jessica still around?'' Natalie scanned the horizon for a few seconds, ''We could ask her to tag along too.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, come on then. Are we just going to be standing around?'' Aaron grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran looked around and she soon spotted the red-haired girl standing by the bus stop. ''I think I saw her, I'll go and ask.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Go on,'' Luke nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, do you want to tag along for a pint?'' Kiran asked the red-haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I wish I could, but I'm just dead tired,'' Jessica gave her friend a weak smile, her eyes still trained to the distance, expecting a bus to pop up anytime soon.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a moment's thought, 'Kiran' decided to let Jessica go home undisturbed. They were both in again tomorrow anyway, along with everyone else. \"Oh okay then, but we'll have to have some fun some time.\" Kiran caressed Jessica's shoulder with her dainty hand, giving it a squeeze as her eyes once more locked onto Jessica's sexy little rump, her pert breasts and the high heels she loved to wear so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, definitely.\" Jessica smiled, nodding as she looked down at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kiran turned around and headed back to the rest of her co-workers. She had more choice amongst this lot anyway. \"Jessica's tired, we've agreed to go out some other time though. We going?\" she said to Luke, approaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, let's go guys.\" Luke gestured to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Kiran had returned to the others, Liz and Elizabeth had locked up the store, but Elizabeth also took a 'rain check'. She had to get home since her fiance's youngest child was sick. \"See ya tomorrow.\" Kiran waved at her manager as she clicked down the street in her glossy black heels. Again, Kiran was a little disappointed about the departure of another co-worker, but there were still several left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to start bossing us around are you Liz?\" Charlotte suddenly asked. She was half joking, trying to hide the fact that she wasn't impressed that 'Miss Big Tits' was accompanying them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz laughed slightly. \"I'm not your supervisor outside of the store Charlotte, you know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but still, you might be tempted.\" Charlotte mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran smirked, listening to the banter as she her co-workers walked around the corner to the nearest pub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll buy the first round.\" Liz said, calling a barmaid over to them as they sat around two tables close together. This made Liz instantly more popular, even with Charlotte, who definitely loved her alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a coke for me.\" Kiran spoke up. She wanted to keep a clear mind, and she rested her bag on her lap as she sat there, protecting it from any prying eyes or hands in the immediately vicinity. Kiran ignored Charlotte as she made fun of her for ordering a coke. And then, Kiran, looked at each of her co-workers in turn, but not really lingering too long on Steven, Rob, Luke, Shaun and Aaron. She sized up Melissa, Charlotte, Liz and then Natalie in turn. Each had their good points and bad points. Liz for instance was a little chubby around the waist, but she had the biggest breasts in Wilko by far. Charlotte was a little on the tall side at 5' 9\", but Kiran liked the contrast between her and the others. Natalie's teeth weren't prefectly alined, but unless she smiled, it wasn't noticeable, and she was still cute. And then there was Melissa, her other friend from the Parkgate store. She was a looker, with a decent figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're quiet Kiran. You okay?\" Liz suddenly snapped the girl from her train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes Liz, I'm great thank you.\" Kiran smirked, hugging her duffel bag as she sipped her coke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, nobody noticed Kiran slipping a hand down to her crotch.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sukhi felt around the wall and finally found the light switch and activated it. All the fluorescent lamps turned on at once, showing off a laboratory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSukhi was here on orders from her parents. They hadn't heard from Adesh for several weeks now and they were worried about him. Sukhi on the other hand thought it was nicely quiet at home. Her uncle would come at her house once a month to show off his newest inventions. To say they weren't successful was putting it mildly. Sukhi still remembered the toaster-incident. Hearing the sound of a toaster made her jump down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now things were quiet for some time, so her parents asked her to visit her uncle while on her way to work. She hadn't been here since she was a little girl. Uncle Adesh liked his privacy. The front door was unlocked as Sukhi just pushed it. Walking inside she could see the living room was sparsely decorated. There was only one picture of uncle Adesh and the rest of the family. Going further inside she walked into the kitchen. She saw it wasn't cleaned in a while; there were even a few maggots crawling around in the sink. Sukhi quickly left the kitchen seeing that. The next room she found herself in was her uncle's laboratory. Looking around Sukhi was curious to see what her uncle invented. At the least she could warn her parents about it. But the place was empty. No inventions, no tools, nothing. Except for one thing. On the workbench she found a small little gun, similar to a kid's toy. Was this what her uncle had been doing this whole time? Inventing a toy for children?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSukhi picked up the gun and put it in her bag. She then left the laboratory and checked out the rest of the house. Checking upstairs she noticed the bed had been used recently but her uncle's favorite lab coat was still lying on a nearby chair. He would never remove that old thing. In the bathroom she saw the toilet hadn't been flushed for a while, yet there were traces of shaving cream in the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSukhi bit on her underlip as she didn't like this. It looked like the house was used recently, but why were there no signs of her uncle? What if it was a killer that was using her uncle's house and she would be next! Feeling her heart pumping faster Sukhi quickly went down the stairs and out of the house as she breathed heavily. She didn't want to stay in that house any longer. She would tell her parents about it. They should call the police to investigate it. But first she needed to get to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that what's happened.\" Sukhi ended her story. It was break time and Sukhi decided to tell someone about what she had seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was this person she told her story to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aaron was standing in the loading bay of Wilkos taking his smoke break. Aaron nervously picked out a cigarette and lit it up. Aaron was a 28, 5'10 Brit who worked at a large hardware store near downtown London. Aaron had a short temper, one that was often flared up through a combination of not being able to smoke in the store and having to deal with clueless customers and his fellow co-workers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron had just stormed out of the store after Elizabeth, his manager, had told him he had to work the whole weekend. Aaron had planned to go to the football match on Saturday with a bunch of his friends, but now he had to work from 9 to 5. \"Fuckin' cunt. Tellin' me to work the whole weekend. Piss off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron angrily puffed away on his cigarette as Helen, the one co-worker Aaron actually got along with, joined him outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that cunt gave you the whole weekend!\" Helen sharply told Aaron as she lit up a cigarette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats two weeks in a row! Do we really have so few people that we can't rotate or something?\" Aaron complained as he continued to explain his anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had god damn plans! I was supposed to be getting fucking drunk with my pals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Aaron. I'd take your place but it's my anniversary this weekend.\" Helen told Aaron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we'll you better at least have some fun. Anything sounds better than being here all weekend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aaron and Helen continued to enjoy their smoke break in the alley behind their store, a loud bang was heard in the building across the alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell was that?\" Helen questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly four more loud bangs filled the air. \"Sounds like gunfire!\" Aaron told Helen. \"But that building has been closed off for months. Who the hell would've gone in there?\" Helen replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building used to be a small local computer business. The company that leased the space had gone out of business months ago and the space had set dormant for three months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aaron and Helen stood there in worry, a woman's scream filled the air. Aaron, worried for the safety of whoever was screaming, ran towards the abandoned office and tired to enter. Helen followed closely behind. The two tried to open the door, but found the door locked. Aaron, being pretty fit, told Helen to stand back and kicked down the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron and Helen expected to find the space vacant, but were surprised when they saw row after row of large, complex looking computers. The machines looked like they were state of the art. Rather than having monitors, the computers had holographic screens showing a strange logo with what appeared to be a human head surrounded by an atomic symbol: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Popular_culture_atom_symbol.svg.\" target=\"_blank\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron and Helen were surprised to find the building occupied, but were quickly drawn away from their amazement when they heard the woman scream once again calling for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron and Helen rushed down a long hallway leading to a large high ceiling room in the center of the rather large office complex. All around the area were several dead individuals. It looked like something out of a horror movie. It looked like the dead individuals, many of whom were in lab coats, had all been shot. Several of them had been shot multiple times. Helen shrieked in horror as she walked past a man who had been shot multiple times in the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aaron and Helen observed the massacre, a woman\u2019s voice called out, \u201cPlea...please...help me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron rushed over to the voice and removed a metal cabinet from a 60 year old, gray haired woman. The woman had been shot in the stomach and was bleeding out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry....take me....take me to the computer room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer room?\u201d Aaron remarked, \u201cyou need to go to the hospital lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...time....computer....now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron, being strong enough, lifted the elderly woman off of the ground and began to run to the computer room. Helen, wanting to get away from the dead bodies, followed behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron took the woman back down the long hallway he and Helen had just walked down and reentered the computer room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dying woman told Aaron, \u201cput me in the middle of the room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly, in the middle of the computer room was a large metal disk that sat flush with the rest of the floor. Aaron set her down on the disk and the older woman called to Helen, \u201ctype Quantum FEM43AD into the computer.\u201d The older woman was barely breathing now. Her breaths were short....quick...and she was ghostly pale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron tried to tend to her and sat over her on the metal disk. The woman\u2019s breath was laborious and soon stopped. Aaron began to perform CPR on the woman. \u201cStay with me...stay with me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen meanwhile opened the large holographic touchscreen and began to type in the code the woman had given her. After typing in the code onto the computer screen, the large computers surrounding the room began to hum with activity. As Aaron continued to administer CPR the machines began to scream. Suddenly, a large blue light began to envelop the disk that Aaron and the woman were on. Helen watched in amazement as a sort of blue electric bubble surrounded the metal disk. Suddenly, in a flash, Aaron and the woman disappeared. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He opened his eyes and was surprised to find himself seated on a couch in what looked like to be a break room. It definitely wasn\u2019t the break room from the Wilkos store. Aaron looked to his right and saw a door leading to what looked to be the Beauty Salon across the street from Wilkos. Aaron faintly remembered the name of the store and tried to think of it. Beauty...beauty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, next to him, Aaron heard the older woman speak up, \u201cBeautylicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron turned to his right and was shocked to see the woman he had recently been administering CPR to. Shockingly, the woman looked fine. She wasn\u2019t bleeding from the stomach, and didn\u2019t look as if she was going to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow...how are you ok? You were shot. You stopped breathing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I did. Which is actually why the two of us are here.\u201d The woman replied in a British accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Aaron questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sequence I had your friend enter was going to save my life. Unfortunately I had to be alive when the sequence was started in order to benefit from it. Sadly, I\u2019m now dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDead? How can you be dead? You\u2019re sitting right here next to me?\u201d Aaron sternly told the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually...I\u2019ve been integrated into my program. I\u2019m a ghost in the machine if you will. It was an emergency failsafe I added yesterday. Thank God I did. Thank your for trying to help me, but your friend entered the program too late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron told the woman not to worry about it, but he was still confused with the situation, \u201cSo if the program didn\u2019t work. Why are we at Beautylicious? How the hell did we get here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...the program actually did work...on you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you...\u201d Aaron looked down and was shocked at what he saw. Rather than his large, muscular, male body, Aaron saw two slender tan legs jutting out from a short frilly black shorts-dress. Aaron reached forward to touch the legs, and was shocked to see two, tan, slender female arms reaching forward to touch the legs. The hands were slender and hair the nails painted black as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached up to his chest and was surprised to find two mounds rather than his former firm pecks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to me? How am I a woman? Why do I still have my own voice?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman tried to calm Aaron down, \u201cBecause the sequence can only use living recipients, you were taken into the program. You are now a quantum head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuantum head? I\u2019m a woman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...you\u2019re a woman now... You\u2019re still you however. You are now a quantum head. Feel your face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron reached up with his slender female hands and reached upwards to his face. Surprisingly, he felt his strong jawline and rough stubble rather than a smooth woman\u2019s face. \u201cI have my own head? I\u2019m some man with a girl\u2019s body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo yourself, yes. To others you\u2019re a pretty 25-year-old woman.  We started this project nearly twenty years ago. We were researching ways to effectively complete teleportation. Recently, within the last five years, we made great strides and are now capable of teleporting small objects vast distances. As soon as we made this breakthrough, M16 forcibly took over our program as a method to both insert agents undercover and as a way to protect the royal family by hiding them anywhere in the word. Today we were attacked by some organization. They were trying to steal our research and pretty much destroyed it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all fine and dandy, but how the hell can I get back to my body? I\u2019m not walking around dressed like this slutty tramp.\u201d Aaron sternly told the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll that is part of our current problem. The group that attacked our lab today extremely restricted our ability to recall agents to their former body. Because of that, our emergency failsafe\u2014at a secret, hidden location\u2014has undoubtedly activated. This means that every night at three in the morning you, and all the other agents, will swap randomly with various individuals.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I may be able to be a man again?\u201d Aaron tried to rationalize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I told your friend to enter our female program because I though I\u2019d get put into the system. Unfortunately you did. Your friend instituted the female head program. That means you\u2019re stuck with only females.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron\u2019s stomach sank. \u201cHow...how could this be possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Kate by the way. The good news is that I will get to follow you everywhere you go. One of the perks of being fully integrated into a massive supercomputer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron placed his male head down into his female hands. He muffled from in between his girly hands, \u201cI\u2019m Aaron.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, you\u2019re Vanessa Williamson. She\u2019s a 25-year-old hairstylist at Beautylicious. You only have to work for another twenty minutes and then you get to go home for the day. You have a big date tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this. I\u2019m not doing that shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a curvy looking blonde woman walked into the backroom, \u201cVanessa I need you to get out here. Vicky is here for her appointment.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the woman wasn\u2019t alarmed at Aaron\u2019s appearance, nor did it seem that she even noticed Kate\u2019s presence in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate spoke up to fill Aaron in on the situation \u201cThat\u2019s Carly. She runs the shop. She\u2019s your boss. Vicky is a friend of yours and you need to get out there and cut her hair.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron stood up and began to wobble in his high heeled boots. As he jutted his arms out to try and gain some balance, then he placed his hands on his narrow hips. Opposite of Aaron was a full length mirror. It was at this moment that Aaron had the opportunity to look at his new body in full glory: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CFTFrE8WYAAT-DY.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CFTFrE8WYAAT...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Our program messes with time, and reality itself. Despite our ability to manipulate reality we learned that once someone entered the quantum head system they ceased to be. No matter how much we tried, it seemed that only people within the system knew of the previous reality. This made keeping track of our operatives difficult, because after they entered the system no one would have any memory of them. So we initiated a system where after someone entered the system, they would fill out a biography form and send it to a specific email address. This way we could keep track. The good news is that when someone left the quantum system reality sort of fixed itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're telling me I basically never existed?\" Aaron tried to rationalize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Basically. Sort of like King Andrew.\" Kate replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Andrew?\" Aaron asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was one of the first humans to enter the quantum program. He is the Queen's older brother. He ruled until about 5 years ago when his health failed him. He entered the quantum system shortly thereafter. That's why you've never heard of him. No one outside the quantum project has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bollocks.

She had been called down to the Research and Development for something extremely important, but she had no idea what. There was a lot of secrecy about the work done in that branch of the Agency - depending on who you talked to, they were allegedly working on anything from time travel to dissecting alien corpses. Having seen some of the things they'd produced, there was little she would doubt. Whatever it was that she was going to see today, it was apparently classified enough that she'd been briefed in only the vaguest possible terms. To hear her superiors describe it, it sounded like she was going on an important mission, yet she wasn't even leaving the building. <i>What could possibly be so important about me checking out their latest invention?</i> The young agent thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She stopped outside the door, which opened before she even had the chance to enter her access code. \"Ah! Miss Harrington! Right on time!\" Victoria found herself face-to-face with Trevor Burns, one of the top-ranking scientists in the department. She'd met him a few times before, and her general impression of him was not a positive one. It wasn't really that he was rude, or nasty, or anything she could easily pin down - there was just something about the boyish blond scientist that was generally off-putting. For starters, she wished he'd refer to her as <b>Agent</b> Harrington. She hadn't worked her way up to such a high position in record time to be denied her due title by some geeky eccentric, no matter how smart he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How much have they told you?\" Dr. Burns inquired as Victoria stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just enough to have me confused,\" she responded. \"They told me to meet you here today, but wouldn't tell me why. That I was supposed to treat this as an official mission, even though I wouldn't be going anywhere, but that I didn't need to bring anything, presumably <i>because </i>I'm not actually going anywhere, so I don't know why --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, sorry to interrupt,\" said Dr. Burns, \"but you will be going somewhere...er, sort of. You're sort of right and wrong about not leaving the facility, as it turns out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Victoria gave him a blank look. \"What? What the hell does that mean? How can I be wrong <i>and</i> right? Am I going somewhere, or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Allow me to explain,\" said the doctor, escorting her into a room where some technicians were working on a rather intimidating machine. \"This is the Quantum Transposition Machine. You're to be its first human test subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Victoria couldn't think of a response. She stared at the machine. Several bulky pieces were connected by wires and tubes to some display screens and to each other, but the focus of the whole thing was a chair in the middle. On the arms, legs, and seat, she could see a number of restraints, currently unfastened. Above the chair was something that looked like a hair dryer from a beauty salon, but much larger and substantially more sinister. <i>Oh, God, what have I gotten myself into?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry to keep you in the dark,\" said Dr. Burns, \"but we couldn't risk you knowing about it before you actually came down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Quantum...Transportation Machine? Is that what you called it?\" Victoria was trying to get a handle on things, but her training hadn't exactly prepared her for this. \"Is it some sort of teleporter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Almost! Very nearly, but not quite. And it's Transposition, not Transportation. You see, what it does is swap your identity with another person's anywhere in the world: It literally puts your head on someone else's shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Literally?\" Victoria was only growing more uncomfortable the more it was explained. \"What do you mean, <i>literally</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Literally as in <b>literally</b>,\" explained Dr. Burns, suddenly looking as if he was explaining something to an idiot. \"We lower that beehive-looking part over your head, and zap it onto someone else's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He must have seen the look on her face. \"Oh, no, don't worry!\" he continued. \"We've tested that part very thoroughly. It's all very quick, very seamless, no pain at all.\" To Victoria, he gave the impression of someone who didn't completely believe what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You've tested it? I thought you said I was the first human test!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"First human test, yes! We've already tested it in computer simulations and on live monkeys, all of whom are in perfect health!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Though some of them are still on the wrong bodies,\" one of the other scientists added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, <i><b>thank you</b></i>, Robinson!\" Dr. Burns snapped angrily. \"Really, I assure you, there's nothing to be afraid of. So, what do you say? Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Agent Harrington had probably never wanted to do anything less in her life, but she knew her duty as an agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ready,\" she said. \"Don't make me regret this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So whose body will I end up with?\" she asked as the attendants strapped her into the chair. \"Is there another one of these machines somewhere else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We're sending you to a small town in England, near a Wilkos if our coordinates are correct. You will arrive on the body of a random citizen at this location. Thanks to Quantum Distortion, to all others it will appear as though you are, and always have been, the person whose identity you assume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So I'm going in blind,\" she said. \"Fantastic.\" The hairdryer/beehive-looking thing began to lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, but we'll be able to keep in touch with you through the neural link you had implanted last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, good,\" said Victoria, joylessly. \"Will I at least be a woman on the other side as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There's no way to know in advance!\" Dr. Burns was beginning to shout as the hum of the machinery grew louder. \"It's possible you may end up a man, or even a child! Don't worry though, for the first test you'll only be gone a couple hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait, <i>first</i> test? How many times am I going to have to - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was a bright blue flash.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is very quiet and has a very girlish giggle when laughing, she is also a smoker, and she's married, like a lot of her colleagues. She has D-Cup breasts and is not what people would call 'slender', but neither is she a large woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bright blue flash faded, Victoria noticed that Dr. Burns was no longer there. In fact, she wasn't even in the lab anymore. Looking around, Victoria noticed that she was sitting down on the loo and was already peeing. Victoria looked around and was glad to see that she still had breasts. Looking past her breasts, she noticed some pants and knickers around her ankles that presumably new belonged to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering why she was here, Victoria pulled some of her hair up to her face and noted what appeared to be her normal blonde locks. As she let them go, she began inspecting her unfamiliar hands. They were about the same color as her hands normally were, but they looked quite aged and had an unfamiliar wedding band on her left hand. Feeling that she had finished relieving herself, Victoria pulled a wad of toilet paper and wiped the unfamiliar lady parts she now possessed. It was really weird taking in all the different sensations her body gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Victoria had been extremely fit and everything on her body was firm and shaven. This body she had felt soft around the legs and waist while her new lady parts hadn't been trimmed in who knows when. As Victoria stood up and pulled up her clothing, she noticed how heavy her larger breasts felt against gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping outside the stall, Victoria washed her hands at the nearby sink before looking into the mirror. She had never seen anything first hand that was weird as what she saw. In the mirror an older woman that looked to be in her forties stared back at her with wavy black hair and brown eyes. Pulling some of her hair back to her face, Victoria saw that is looked like her normal blonde locks until she looked back into the mirror. The woman in the mirror was mimicking her perfectly while holding her wavy black locks in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria let her hair go and leaned in towards the mirror to get a closer look at the woman she saw. She wasn't ugly, just much older and more average than what Victoria had grown accustomed to seeing in the mirror her whole life. Stepping back, she tried to get a look at her upper torso. This woman was quite large in the chest department and wore a red polo shirt with a name tag on it. Looking down, Victoria pulled it up from her large breast and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilkos Associate, Helen\" Victoria read the tag to herself before thinking \"I guess to the world I'm now this Helen woman until this machine wears off.\" Victoria had been an exceptional agent. She had mastered hand to hand combat, hacking and shooting enemies of the crown. However, this felt like unfamiliar territory to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could continue to examine her form further...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud explosion that made the walls of the bathroom shake. Victoria knew the familiar sound of a bomb quite well. As she ran out of the bathroom, she could hear people screaming and panicking. A blonde woman with a ponytail wearing the same clothing as her tried to get customers and staff towards the back end of the store as she told a man named \"Steven\" to lock the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria ran up to the blonde woman that looked like she was in charge and asked \"what is happening?\" The woman helped hide another younger female employee take cover behind a checkout counter before noticing Victoria. She was not quite as tall as Victoria was, but she made up for it in bust size. As Victoria saw her name plate, Liz said \"Helen, I need you to get in the back and see that the customers are safe.\" Suddenly Victoria heard screaming by the front of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man whom Liz called \"Steven\" had been knocked to the floor as the last door was forced open before he could lock it. A masked man wielding a large knife had forced his way in and began yelling about death to all that could not run. Steven managed to crawl off and hide behind a nearby cash register. Liz was in absolute terror as the man went straight towards her and Victoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the masked man got closer, Victoria could hear what sounded like automatic gunfire outside the store. While feeling not as strong and somewhat sluggish, Victoria still felt confident that she could take this man down. Once he managed to get within a few meters of Victoria, she made her move and lunged towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dodged his first slash and palmed him in the face. He retaliated with a sideways slash that Victoria mostly dodged. She could feel a burning pain below her breasts. Victoria couldn't move fast enough as the man punched her in the jaw and knocked her onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind that mask, Victoria could tell he was confident that she would be his first kill in the store and she wasn't sure if he would be wrong. The man jumped on top of Victoria and tried to stab his knife into her throat. Using both of her hands, she kept the knife from stabbing her. She tried kneeing the man in the groin, but she didn't seem to have the lower body strength to hit him hard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria began getting tired as her older arms were losing strength. The knife got closer and closer to her throat until the man called \"Steven\" came up from behind and knocked the masked attacker in the head with an umbrella with a wooden handle. Although it didn't knock him out, it disoriented Victoria's attacker enough for her to change positions and twist the blade around back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the masked attacker could recover, Victoria managed to summon enough strength to hit him hard enough in the groin with her knee. As he became debilitated, Victoria thrust the blade into his chest. The man rolled off of Victoria and died. Victoria used her hand to find where she had been slashed and found quite a bit of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager, Liz came rushing over to Victoria with a small first aid kit and tried to see if there was anything she could do. Victoria began feeling tired. Time seemed to slow down for her as she watched other employees and eventually Policemen approach her before passing out.</span></div></div>",

As she rounded a corner, she felt several jolts of sharp pain in her chest and abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell to the ground as she emptied her weapon into the two gunmen that had waited for her.

Tired and unable to move, Victoria reloaded her weapon while hoping that there were no more attackers left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single gunman doubled back after getting stuck at a blast door leading into the inner rooms where most of the valuables were. Seeing that the mission was a lost cause, he ran back into the hallway where he saw his last two men lying dead. As he slowly rounded the corner, he narrowly avoided several bullets. Behind cover, he pulled out a grenade and pulled its pin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLow on blood and ammo, Victoria tried to stop what she thought was the last gunmen from being a threat. Hopefully she could get reinforced and some medical aid soon. The gunman popped out around the corner and Victoria sent 4 rounds his way. At least 3 of those rounds hit him, but he managed to throw something at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what it was, Victoria tried to roll away from the loose grenade before it exploded.</span></div></div>",

Only this time she couldn't move much as she was fully encased in bandages while most of her body either ached or felt numb. Unsure how long she had been spending in and out of consciousness, She managed to catch several doctors, including Dr. Burns in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usually eccentric Trevor Burns however seemed genuinely worried this time. Seeing Victoria awake, he ran up to her to bedside and tried talking to her. Victoria tried asking Trevor what happened but she only managed to let out incoherent grunting that was painful. Trevor knew what she was probably asking and began catching her up. \"Ms. Harrington... Victoria, you saved the lab and the Transposition device from being stolen. We lost 5 security guards and 3 technicians. You were badly injured and been out for the last 15 days. You lost both of your legs and one of your arms had to be amputated, while both of your lungs collapsed. You're quite worse for the wear my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everything she had been through, she couldn't believe it. Victoria thought that her life was over. It basically was. Her days as an agent were done and what was left of her would have to depend on caregivers for basic needs. \"Why did they keep her alive after all of this?\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor continued with what Victoria was the typical speech that people told every agent who suffers a crippling fate. \"Headquarters has already approved of your early pension and began looking for your replacement... However, I requested that you remain with my program while I continue to improve it.\" Trevor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria wasn't sure she heard him correctly. He wanted her to remain on his team. Trevor explained further \"Even though your body is compromised, your mind and experiences can be used on a new host to allow you to pick up where you left off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that Victoria wasn't grateful for the opportunity, but being other people felt weird to her. Like when she was that Helen woman at Wilkos. She could have easily taken out that knife wielding terrorist if she had been herself. But with that older woman's body, she wasn't in good enough shape for basic hand to hand combat. There was just something wrong to her about inhabiting other people's bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the broken husk that Victoria had become, Trevor asked \"So with your left arm, are you interested in round 2 with the Transposition device?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just a regular day for the Wilkos Department Store. As usual, people of all kinds filled nearly all of it's aisles in search of various goods for their home or leisure. There was one person, however, who was here for no such purpose. He was an old man, appearing to be in his mid 60s. Although he was in very good shape and stood at over 6 feet, the man had a hunch in his back, making him appear to be much frailer and shorter. He walked with a cane that made a light tapping noise on the ground as it shook with his hands due to his growing arthritis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, can I help you sir?\" A young woman asked with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man smiled back, looking the young woman over. Although her name-tag read 'Liz,' the old man was much more interested in the large mounds of flesh jutting out from her chest and pushing against her polo shirt, trying their best to break free from the constraining clothing. \"<i>Nein</i>\" he said, beginning in his native German before immediately switching to his rather weak English. \"Sorry. My English not great. Not first language,\" he said in a heavy accent. \"Assistance not necessary. I know what it is that I look for\" he said, turning around and walking towards the men's restroom. Liz watched as the old man walked away. She thought about what it must be like to live to be so old and hoped that the man would be alright. Little did she know that that old man would soon be having a major impact on the entire store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man grinned as he let himself into the handicap stall in the restroom. He then sat on the toilet and began to wait. His thoughts of the high percentage of beautiful women working in this store kept him awake. He chucked to himself as he thought over his plans. The man's name was Doctor Viktor Von Strasser. He was a top notch scientist that had formerly made his fortune in assisting various governments with rather unethical experiments. With now over 40 years of research in his field, Doctor Von Strasser was convinced that he would be able to change the world with his inventions.  Of course, he thought that he would be able to change the world with his inventions. Just recently, Dr. Von Strasser was given two months to live. The radiation that he had worked with in his formative years as a scientist had taken it's toll on him, and the cancer that his body had was incurable. Of course, that didn't mean that Von Strasser was going to die. In fact, the news of Von Strasser's days coming to an end was a welcome development for the old scientist. With his life over, Von Strasser would no longer have to devote his work to others. He could now devote his time to what truly mattered. Himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Strasser had his next moves meticulously planned out. He would take over this strip mall and make it his new lab, where he would have a nearly unlimited range of unwilling subjects. He would set up his new lab in the basement of Wilkos and would continue his work in secret for as long as he wished. But in order to do that, Von Strasser first had to transcend the cancer that was ripping through his body. He would have to leave behind his current form in favor of a newer, younger model. Von Strasser knew that this would be the most important choice that he would make. His upgraded form would have to be someone with unlimited access to this area, but also someone who would be able to go for several hours at a time without being seen or needed. After watching this store for the past several days, Von Strasser knew whose form he would be stealing. He smiled evilly as he felt his aged dick hardening. Soon he would no longer be the old and ravaged Viktor Von Strasser, but he would be a very nice looking young woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...have some time for fun\" he said, licking his shriveled lips as he opened up his wallet to reveal a picture of Elizabeth, the full-time manager of Wilkos. She was perfect for him. Not only was her body more than three decades younger than his own, but Elizabeth was a gorgeous woman with a job that guaranteed to make her a solid continuous income. Her job allowed her to spend long amounts of time in her office without being bothered or checked on and her position allowed her full reign on who she saw and when she saw them. Such access would be invaluable when it came to deciding on future subjects for the doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot wait to be you, my dear\" he said, looking at the picture. Von Strasser had made sure to be thorough in his research on Elizabeth before making his final decision. He had followed her home and looked into her family life. Von Strasser was happy to see that Elizabeth was single and had a whole house all to herself. The picture in his hand was taken when the woman was just getting out of the shower and revealed her body in all of it's glory. Having time to kill, Von Strasser began to vigorously masturbate to the picture in his hand, knowing that the body in the image would soon belong to him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several hours later, it was time for Wilkos to close it's doors for the night. The customers had all left, and the last employee was signing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a long day!\" Liz exclaimed, stretching her arms a bit. \"Not that you would know, being in your office all day long\" she said with a teasing wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth giggled cutely, smiling at Liz. \"Hey! Someone has to run things behind the scenes here!\" she said, mocking offence. \"You know, I could always demote you for taking that tone with me\" she said to Liz with a grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you would never do that, would you? Then you'd have to do all of my work yourself. Let's be real here, there's no one in this store that would be a better supervisor than me\" she said cockily. Of course, Liz was right about that. Many of the employees in the store either had no interest in such a position or were simply not competent enough for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. Liam's been doing awfully well recently\" Elizabeth said, but couldn't keep herself from laughing as she said it. Liz laughed too, Liam was the type of employee that Liz was genuinely curious about why he was kept on the paycheck. He never seemed to do any of the work that he was assigned, yet he somehow managed to stay hired while others were let go. Of course, the reason that Elizabeth kept him on was because his grandfather owned the strip mall and would have Elizabeth's head if he were to be fired, but both Elizabeth and Liz (as well as several other employees) were all guilty of fantasizing about how they would give him what was coming to him were he to no longer have that connection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you can go for the night, Liz. I just need to lock up like I always do\" she said. The two women then said their goodbyes. Once Liz was gone and Elizabeth was the last person in the whole store (to her knowledge), she walked down the aisles one by one to make sure that everything was where it should be. This was the closest that her day got to actually working, but it was one of those mechanical activities that Elizabeth did in exactly the same way every night. It has become routine for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss\" a voice suddenly said, causing Elizabeth to jump. She turned around to see an old man with a confused expression on his face. \"I...I must have fallen asleep on the toilet\" he said in his broken English, sounding very ashamed of himself. \"You could help me to door?\" he asked, holding out his hand, which shook a bit as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's expression softened up once she realized what must have happened. She put on a reassuring smile and walked over to the old man. \"Of course, sir. Let me help you\" she said, gently taking his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, foolish girl\" the man said, and then suddenly stabbed his cane into Elizabeth's leg. Elizabeth jumped and put her hand on her leg. It was one of the rare days when Elizabeth had chosen to wear a skirt suit instead of her typical trouser suit. Since it was so warm outside, she wasn't wearing any form of leggings, leaving the skin below her knees bear. Dr. Von Strasser had taken advantage of that by using his cane to inject a powerful mind control drug into the attractive manager's system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth removed her hand from her leg, seeing the scar where the drug had been injected. She looked at the man with a confused look before the light in her eyes seemed to die. She then stood up stiffly. It was as if Elizabeth was gone and had now been replaced by a robot of some kind, completely devoid of thought or emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are under my power now, yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth nodded. \"That is correct, Doctor\" she said obediently. Von Strasser smiled evilly, his dick once again becoming hard as many thoughts rushed to his head. Unfortunately, he had to push many of those thoughts out of his mind. He drug would run it's course in just over two hours, and he needed to make sure that all would be prepared well before that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Please escort me outside and help me to my car. Then lock up store as usual\" Von Strasser then handed Elizabeth a folded piece of paper. \"When done, drive to this address. I will be waiting there with further instructions. Understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Doctor\" Elizabeth said, taking the paper and putting it into her jacket pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Strasser then blushed a bit. \"Ehh, before locking up, why don't you give me a kiss. Has been long time since I have been alone with woman as pretty as you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth immediately and unquestioningly embraced Von Strasser in a passionate kiss. Von Strasser felt himself getting more and more turned on by this experience, but he knew it could not laugh. He was so close to beginning his plan and he could not afford to be distracted by petty sexuality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" he said, pulling himself away from his temporary slave. \"Now walk me to my car\" he said, extending his hand. Elizabeth took it in her own and did as she was asked, making sure that Doctor Von Strasser got safely into his car. \"Go lock up. Then meet at address\" he said before rolling up his windows and driving away. He drove for about 20 minutes and then came to an abandoned warehouse. Inside of the warehouse, Von Strasser was doing his current research. All sorts of technological wonders could be found here. It was truly a shame that all but a few of them would soon have to be destroyed. In the corner of the lab, Von Strasser looked at a dead body lying on the floor. The body was once that of a local homeless man. Von Strasser had used him as a preliminary test, by transforming him into an exact replica of himself. Unfortunately a later experiment killed the subject, but Von Strasser now very conveniently had a dead body that matched his DNA exactly. God, he loved science. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Strasser walked to one particular machine and grinned. It was a machine that looked very much like a high-tech computer hooked up to a juice machine. Von Strasser used the computer to store information that was then used to make serums with the ability to alter the user's mind and body in any way that Von Strasser desired. Some of them, like the will nullifier that he used on Elizabeth, were intentionally temporary while others would last indefinitely. Of all of the machines in this lab, it was this that Van Strasser would be saving to use for his future experiments at Wilkos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Von Strasser was in the midst of making his plans, there was a knock at the door. \"Well speak of the devil\" he said with a smile. Van Strasser opened the door to reveal...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ahh, hello my dear, good of you to come.\" Von Strasser smiled wickedly, as though Elizabeth had really had a choice. It was starting to rain slightly and her hair was a little damp, but not much. \"Please, enter.\" The doctor stepped aside, allowing the store manager to walk into the warehouse, still wearing what was basically a blank expression on her face. \"Please, ignore dead body, not had chance to do what you call... spring cleaning.\" Von Strasser laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elizabeth kept walking, her high heels impacting the hard ground created echoes in the large building, much of which was empty. \"Now stop, and wait.\" Von Strasser directed the drugged woman in front of him, who did as she was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes doctor.\" Elizabeth nodded obediently. There was no sign of any puncture wound on her leg now. Her 'captor' continued smiling in approval as he admired Elizabeth's body from behind. Her supple legs, her nicely shaped backside and her slim figure. Her breasts weren't too big, but when he circled around in front of her, Von Strasser saw the perky B-cups pushing out her white blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbutton your top my dear, I would like to have a look at your... breasts.\" Von Strasser directed, and Elizabeth again obeyed, raising her hands to unfasten the top two buttons on her blouse, before pulling it open to expose the tops of her boobs and her bra. \"Oh yes, very nice, I cannot wait.\" He grinned, rubbing his hands together as he let his cane lean up against him. \"You can button up again now.\" he said, even though that was unecessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Strasser made his way back to his machine to prepare things further, then he glanced at his watch. The mind-controlling serum he injected into Elizabeth would soon be wearing off. He turned back to his delectable captive and pointed over to a cage with an automatic lock on it. \"My dear, lock yourself away like a good girl, please.\" he told Elizabeth, all the while retaining his manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perhaps ironic that a man with such a devious mind should have such good etiquette. Elizabeth walked over to the cage with the open door and went inside, before turning and closing the door, allowing the lock to engage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, the Q14 mind-control syrum makes things whole lot easier.\" Von Strasser chuckled, as he readied another serum for use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time ticked by....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Von Strasser filled a small syringe dart with the serum, he heard a few whimpers from the cage nearby. Turning, he saw Elizabeth shaking her head and bringing her hands up to her face. \"W-w-what is t-this? W-where am I?\" the bewildered manager aksed, eventually noticing her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my laboratory, my dear. Not much to look at, I know, but soon... whole new laboratory.\" Von Strasser answered Elizabeth's question, turning to her wild-eyed for a moment as he held up the dart gun he had now 'loaded'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth frowned, then recognized the old man as the person she'd found in the store after locking up. \"You!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his cane again, Von Strasser just smiled. \"Yes my girl, it is I, Doctor Viktor Von Strasser. But not for much longer...\" he chuckled menacingly as he made his way over to the cage as fast as his frail form would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth back stepped twice, looking around frantically. \"Oh god...\" she muttered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh god, oh god, oh god...\" Elizabeth said, over and over as the old man slowly but surely made his way closer to the cage. \"Please...please let me out. I don't know what I did to deserve this\" she said, tears falling from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Stasser smiled and laughed a bit. \"Funny girl, you are\" he said, looking over his now-loaded dart gun. He frowned, as if there was something wrong. \"Hmm...it seems something not right. May need you out of cage, anyway\" he said, noting the look of relief on Elizabeth's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Please, let me out of here!\" she exclaimed as Von Strasser turned around and hobbled back a few spaces. He grabbed what appeared to be a metallic headband and tossed it into the cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wear that, I will let you out of cage\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth looked at it closely for a few minutes. She picked up the cold metallic device and looked it over curiously. \"Wh-what will it do to me?\" she asked, clearly scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Strasser sighed. \"You ask many questions\" he said, holding his temples, as if he had a headache. \"Headband will not hurt you. You want out of cage or not?\" He asked, clearly in some amount of pain. He reached into his pocket and took out a pill before swallowing it with considerably effort. \"Apologies. Am not as healthy as I once was. Will change that soon though\" he said with a smirk. \"No put on headband. Will only take a few seconds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth frowned and did what she was asked. Suddenly the headband started beeping as Elizabeth felt a tingling sensation throughout her body. \"What's happening to me?\" she asked, confused by the sensation she was feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Headband is scanning your mind and body. Will be valuable to me\" he said with a shrug. After a brief moment, the headbands's work was done and it seemed to power down. \"Toss headband back to me, please\" he said. Elizabeth did as she was asked, willing to do anything if it meant her freedom. \"Thank you\" the scientist said as he caught the headband and walked over to his computer like device. He plugged the headband into the computer and watched as what seemed to be a loading screen came up on the monitor. \"Slow loading...\" he said, sounding annoying. \"Will have to upgrade it after I upgrade body\" he said before looking at Elizabeth. He aimed the dart gun at her and fired. The dart his Elizabeth right in the arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Elizabeth yelled as the serum from the dart made it's way into her bloodstream. She quickly ripped the dart out from her and threw it outside of the cage. \"What happened to letting me out?!?\" she asked before falling to the floor, feeling pain rip through her entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Strasser simply shrugged. \"Promise is promise. You will be released from cage. Eventually\" he said with a grin as the loading screen finished it's work. Von Strasser smiled as he input several commands into the computer. Soon, a vile was filled with a strange looking pink liquid. Von Strasser took the vile in his free hand and then hobbled back towards the cage. He watched as Elizabeth began to spasm with a pained expression on her face. \"Apologies again for discomfort. Your DNA is being rewritten at it's core. Last person who went through procedure died. Luckily, process has been improved. I hope\" he said as he watched the transformation playing out in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's body continued to shake as her body began to change. Elizabeth suddenly began screaming in pain. She sat up and tried to stand only for her skin to suddenly become withered as if she were aging at an accelerated rate. Her muscles became weaker as she lost strength in her body and fell to the floor. The hair on her head quickly grayed and began falling out while the hair on the rest of her body grew longer. Although her muscles became weaker, Elizabeth's bones themselves became bigger. Her body expanded and her clothes ripped apart as she grew to over 6 feet tall and her back became hunched. Her feet also became much larger, literally ripping out of her shoes. Elizabeth's breasts faded away to nothingness as she suddenly felt a fiery pain in her crotch. Her screaming intensified as she was wracked with more pleasure that she had ever felt before. The pleasure, however, soon became pain as her vagina closed up and remade itself into a shriveled and old, yet very erect penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what you...do....to...me?\" she asked, her voice changing to become that of Von Strasser. Elizabeth felt pain throughout her entire body. She could barely make herself even stand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Von Strasser laughed as he observed the copy of himself. \"My, how stupid you look, Herr Doctor\" he said with a grin. \"Not only is your clothing torn to shreds, but are also dressed like a woman. Is beneath your character, no?\" he asked, teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I am you now?\" the now apparent Von Strasser asked, frowning and then wincing. Every motion that he made, even to speak, brought pain throughout his entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe true Von Strasser laughed. \"Must be hard for you. No worry. You are not me fully. Made sure that only your body become mine. You no have any of my genius. You no have fear of my mind and memories overtaking yours. For now, is only one me! Reason you have accent is because it fun for me to listen to\" he said with a grin. He then held up the vile that he had taken from his machine. \"This serum is opposite of one I gave you. I will drink this and become you in every way. Unlike you, this serum will give me your memories and some personality as well. My plan is simple. Take over your life and make your store my newest lab. Will run experiments there. Will be very fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...sick...evil..bastard\" the former Elizabeth said, looking at Von Strasser with pure anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Strasser just laughed again. \"You cannot stop me. You are weak old man. You have none of my medication in your system. You can barely even move\" he said, taking a few steps back. He reached into his labcoat and smiled, pulling out a remote. He pressed a button, opening the cage. \"As promised, cage is open. Not that you will be able to get out\" he said. \"Have talked to much. Now is time to embrace my new life\" he said before drinking his serum in one gulp. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Have been waiting for this moment for long time. Finally, youthful new body, and also ability to speak...er... fluent English?\" Von Strasser chuckled as he watched the pathetic copy of himself that Elizabeth had become pull at the shreds of her skirt suit and blouse. Her shriveled, erect cock could be seen poking out the side of her underwear from under the split skirt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for the mixture Von Strasser had imbibed to take effect. But when it did, he was overtaken by a warm, pleasant feeling, opposite to the painful transformation his victim had just gonr through. He knew however that the process might not be entirely pain-free. <i>The price of science.</i> he told himself, while grinning incessantly at a tearful Elizabeth in his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with the previous morph, Von Strasser noticed the first change was in his skin. The wrinkles began fading before his very eyes, and the hair that covered his body began to recede, either fading to fine hair or disappearing completely. His bald scalp was the next to start tingling, and what seemed like sharp pin pricks covere his head as the hair folicles were activated... causing him to sprout blonde, feminine hair that stopped at Elizabeth's former length and style. Oh goodness, is happening... Von Strasser gasped in delight as he felt his muscles starting to rejuvinate... become stronger as the years dropped off his body. Unlike Elizabeth, Von Strasser didn't have the discomfort of having to rip out of his clothes. He felt his body shrinking in height and size, causing his lab coat and sweater to appear huge on him as he dropped down to 5' 5\" tall. His large, aching feet shrank in his shoes as they morphed into slender, feminine ones with pedicured nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh yes, oh... god...</i> Von Strasser cried out - as his voice abruptly altered in pitch, becoming a high alto. \"This feels... wonderful my dear.\" the delighted doctor then said in Elizabeth's former voice... and mroe importantly in a perfect English dialect. Just after he said this, his face began reshaping itself into his victim's and he brought his now dainty hands up to his chest as two firm, B-cup breasts pushed their way out against his sweater. Then came more changes. After his feet had changed, his legs did the same, turning from his frail, hairy spindly legs into Elizabeth's shapely, smooth ones under his slacks, which were prevented from falling down only by the flaring out of his hips and backside. The final change was what excited Von Strasser the most. His cock, old and stiff... slowly began to diminish in size... pulling back into his body to form into Elizabeth's vagina. His testicles also retreated, becoming his new ovaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was done...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth, prone on the floor and trapped in her tormentor's aged form, stared up helplessly at the sight of 'herself' wearing the deranged doctor's ill-fitting clothing. \"Oh my word, I have to say - I made an excellent choice.\" Von Strasser cooed in his new feminine voice, as he held his hands up in front of him, admiring his french-tip manicure. I feel so much more... stronger and beautiful.\" he continued, cracking his slender neck to left then right as he checked himself out. He rubbed in between his legs and he could already tell that his pussy was getting wet. \"So arousing, wouldn't you say my girl... or should that be... doctor?\" he addressed Elizabeth, who had suffered the indignity of having a hard-on while watching Von Strasser take on her shape<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you... sick old... bastard!\" Elizabeth again cussed, coughing in her frail voice, and in broken English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Strasser ignored her insult, too mesmerized by his new body to care. \"But these clothes won't do at all. Luckily, I now know where you keep all your clothes, including the spare set at Wilkos.\" he said with a giggle. Von Strasser stepped out of his shoes, which were now way too big for his feet, and also rolled up the bottoms of his pant legs until he could get changed into some of his victim's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also know... wow, sometimes I amaze myself.\" he said to Elizabeth, as he flicked through Elizabeth's memories in his head. Parts of her childhood, her school years, her first boyfriend... and her first time having sex. It was all there. But more importantly... everyone she knew at Wilkos. All this information would be invaluable to him in the coming days and weeks... even months and years.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The new Elizabeth couldn't help but feel pleasure as she noted the seductive sway of her hips with every step that she took. If only her clothing were a bit tighter, the new Von Strasser would have surely appreciated it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...you...doing?\" the former Elizabeth asked, trying with all her might to look at the monitor to see what the old Von Strasser was busy typing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you and I have one thing very similar\" the woman who was once Von Strasser said as she continued typing away. \"We both really love dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dogs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. You've...sorry, I've...been in love with them since I was a little girl. The only reason that I never bothered to adopt one of my own was because I didn't think I'd be able to take care of it well enough\" she said with a chuckle. \"But the old me...you, I suppose...actually once had a dog. You would know that if I had given you any of the memories that went along with your body. His name was Einstein and he was such a good Labrador. He unfortunately got struck by a car many years ago, but I've missed him so much, I loved that dog as if he were my own child and he loved me back. After all, I was the best master that a dog could ever hope for. Well, not I suppose that I'll be the best mistress that he can hope for\" she said as she finished inputting her commands into the computer. Another vile became filled with liquid, this one brown in color. The new Elizabeth smiled as she filled the liquid into a dart, just like the first one. \"I'm sorry about this Elizabeth\" she said, looking at the weak old man. \"I don't need you around as you are anymore. I already have a perfect replica of my own dead body and I have every memory that was once floating around your head in me. All I really need before getting my show on the road...is my dog\" she said with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of horror came to the face of the former Elizabeth. \"No...Please...please, no....\" she said in her broken English. Tears formed in her old eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new and improved Elizabeth just shrugged. \"Sorry.\" was all she said before she shot the old man with the dart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the old man that was once Elizabeth started screaming in pain. His hair grew rapidly as his body shrunk down. Muscle was replaced with flab and his old penis actually managed to grow and become stronger. After several minutes of yelling, the torn clothes that were once Elizabeth's fell to the floor and all that was left in the pile was a Labrador with a confused look on it's face. It seemed to look down and look over it's own body and then started growling at Elizabeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your mind still in there?\" Elizabeth asked, curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog barked angrily at her and continued growling. The posture that it took on made it clear to the new Elizabeth that the old one was very much in control of this canine body. \"Well, that's a shame. This was really a 50-50 chance. I hoped that giving you Einstein's body and mental functions would make him take over you and leave me as the only Elizabeth consciousness still around. There's still a chance of that though\" she said, looking at the golden watch that was loosely around her wrist. \"Let's see if you last any longer. If you become Einstein then I'll make you my loyal pet. You get to come to work with me and be around the lab keeping me company. But if you don't...then I'll have to put you down\" she said sadly, removing a real gun from her lab coat. \"Any minute now, I'll have my answer\" she said, waiting for an indication of change. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You in there boy?\" the new Elizabeth smirked, slowly pocketing her gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog barked pleasantly, and the woman formerly known as Viktor Von Strasser bent down, holding out her hand and gesturing the dog over to her. Einstein stood up, the dog's impressive genitalia swinging beneath it as it approached Elizabeth. The dog took a sniff of the clothing the new Elizabeth was wearing, then began to wimper, in apparent joy. The former Von Strasser smiled warmly as she petted Einstein and kissed his head. \"Good boy, you recognize your old master don't you, even in this body.\" she laughed, ruffling Einstein's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From master to mistress. It's wonderful to have you back boy.\" Elizabeth said, grinning again before standing up. \"Now go and lay down.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The now only Elizabeth smiled as she looked around her lab. No, not her lab. This was Doctor Viktor Von Strasser's lab. And Von Strasser's dead body was laying in the corner, waiting to be discovered by authorities at a later time. From now on, Elizabeth would be forging her own scientific path, independent of what had come before her. She walked to the pile of clothing that had once been worn by Einstein (that was all the dog was now. Calling him by his former name was an insult to the wonderful pet). She bent down and looked through the pockets, removing her wallet, car keys, and any other things of importance, remembering exactly where she had them on her from the memories that were floating around in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was all in the pockets of the lab coat, Elizabeth walked to the other corner of the lab and picked up what appeared to be a crystal ball of some kind, though it had a large red button on top of it. Elizabeth then looked around the lab. \"Time to clear out what matters\" she said, enjoying the sound of her voice as she walked over to the most important device in the room. The metallic headband and the computer/serum-making device were easily the most valuable things in the lab. There was no doubt that they would prove to be the base of Elizabeth's experiments on her employees and customers. With that thought, Elizabeth pointed the crystal ball at it and pressed the red button. A red laser beam exited from the ball and enveloped the machine. Once the light faded, the machine was nowhere to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, you worked like a charm\" Elizabeth said, kissing the ball in her hand. The ball was essentially a shrink ray. Whatever was zapped by it would become microscopic and then be pulled inside of it, to be released whenever Elizabeth wanted. Elizabeth then went around Von Strasser's lab, shrinking the devices that she deemed to be important enough. Once she got the handful of devices that she wanted, Elizabeth put the crystal ball into her pocket and then motioned to Einstein. \"Here boy!\" she called as the dog ran towards her, his tail wagging happily. \"We're going to leave and start work on our next project, okay boy?\" she asked, petting the dog happily. After taking one last look at the lab, Elizabeth closed the door and walked to her car, parked exactly where she remembered that it was. Einstein happily sat in the passenger seat as Elizabeth drove away. She knew where she lived, and she was sure that Einstein wanted a real bed already, but Elizabeth also didn't want to waste any time with her plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of driving, Elizabeth parked in the Wilkos parking lot. \"I'll only be a few minutes, boy\" she said to Einstein as she exited the car and reopened the department store. Elizabeth smiled as she walked through the aisles. The last time she did this, she was still that disgusting old man. Finally Elizabeth got to her office. She draped her lab coat on the back of her chair and then stripped off her clothing, glad to get the loose fitting antiques off of her. The now naked woman smiled as she felt her body all over. \"Mmmm, I'm a very nice looking woman, aren't I?\" she asked, making sure to take a moment to cup her breasts. \"You know, I could always be better though. Maybe I can devote a few experiments to give myself the body I've always dreamed of\" she said, remembering the days when a teen aged Elizabeth wished that she could be a supermodel. Rather than continuing to think about this, Elizabeth knelt down on the floor and pulled out a box from under her desk. \"Ahh, here are my spare clothes\" she said triumphantly as she slid on the underwear, black leggings, pink tank top and flats that she kept in her office in case of emergencies. Elizabeth took a few minutes to enjoy the feeling of her body in clothes that were more appropriate for her figure before she put the lab coat back on over her new clothes. The rest of Von Strasser's clothes were thrown into her garbage to be brought to the dumpster tomorrow morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth then looked around the rest of her office. She had a very large space all to herself. The door would have to be made soundproof, but Elizabeth should have no problem turning this office into her own lab. She took out the crystal ball and aimed it at an unused corner in her office. Sure enough, all of the machines that she had salvaged from Von Strasser's lab appeared in the room, working perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to ensure my privacy\" she said before making her way out of her office and locking the door behind her. Elizabeth then walked to the room that had all of the store's security camera footage. She quickly set things up so that all footage of her entering the store at this hour would be deleted. She also cut off the cameras from her office, ensuring that nothing would be recording from there again. Finally, Elizabeth set the cameras so that they would not start to record again until she was safely out of the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone with her work, Elizabeth, went back to her car. \"Sorry I took so long, boy\" she said to Einstein, scratching behind his ears. She smiled at the store that she would make into her playground and then reached into her pocket, pulling out what appeared to be a detonator. Although neither Elizabeth nor Einstein saw the result of her pressing the button on the detonator, the result was that Von Strasser's lab burst into flames. By the time the fire is put out, authorities Would find the doctor's charred remains along with several inventions that would be irreparable. \"Alright boy\" Elizabeth said with a smile as she put her car into drive. \"Let's go home, shall we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruff Ruff!!!\" Einstein said happily. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just as she was about to close the door, one of Elizabeth's neighbors, a brunette named Megan, 22, happened to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was at college, bit of a geek, wore glasses, but she was cute. Her major flaw though... talking too much. \"Oh is that your dog, he's soo cute!\" Megan said out loud, causing Elizabeth to look up at the younger woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Elizabeth replied, eyebrow arched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dog, he looks adorable.\" Megan gushed, leaning on the fence separating the gardens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth sighed. \"He is not CUTE young lady, nor adorable, he's my faithful pet Einstein... not a baby rabbit or infernal guinea pig.\" she berated the girl. Not that it did any good, for Megan also had a tendency to block out anything she didn't want to hear and just keep talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he's popular with the lady dogs right?\" Megan laughed, \"I mean... judging from the size of his... you know...\" she grinned, too embarrassed to say it. Insead an irritating giggle escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth opened her mouth to say something else, but then just rolled her eyes and let out an annoyed sigh. She just slammed the door shut without uttering a single word to Megan. \"Annoying girl. I think I'll include her in one of my next experiments.\" Elizabeth muttered as she wandered through her house. Everything seemed to normal and familiar, despite the fact that this Elizabeth had never been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEinstein had already jumped onto the sofa to make himself comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, cherry blossom.\" Elizabeth said as she sniffed the air, detecting the air freshener in the room. Another contented smile rather than an egotistical grin appeared on Elizabeth's face. This was her home. She brought her hands up to her perky breasts again and fondled them through her pink tank top. And that was the moment when her smile became more... wicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here boy, your mistress just has to take care of something.\" Elizabeth winked at her dog, even as she slipped a hand down the front of her leggings, into her knickers and teased her vagina with a manicured finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Elizabeth was going to have some fun getting familiar with her svelte, attractive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she'd be able to concentrate solely on her important work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Elizabeth was about to finally get acquainted with her body, she heard a faint sound from outside. Elizabeth walked to the room's open window and looked outside to see Megan yapping on her phone with one of her friends. Since the conversation was happening so loudly, and since Megan herself was speaking so much, Elizabeth easily made out that Megan was currently burdened with watching her 12 year old brother while her parents were away for the night. Why Megan was having this conversation outside for the entire neighborhood to hear was not Elizabeth's concern, but Elizabeth knew that she would not be able to concentrate on her own fun until the girl was made to be quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was just getting ready to enjoy being the woman that I am\" Elizabeth said with a dejected sigh as she removed her hand from her leggings. \"Soon enough,\" she muttered before picking up her purse and taking out the containment sphere. Unfortunately, Elizabeth had left her most useful piece of equipment back at Wilkos, which meant that this would take a lot more effort that it would have to otherwise. Once Elizabeth realized how little of this incessant talking she would have to put up with once she was done, she quickly decided that the effort was worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back soon, boy\" Elizabeth said to Einstein before leaving her home and getting in her car. She quickly drove to Wilkos and got her device into the containment sphere before returning to her house. She got out of the car and looked at Megan, who was still yapping loudly on her phone. Elizabeth looked at the open window in Megan's house to see a young boy quietly on his computer, presumably studying for school. A marvelous idea came to Elizabeth's mind as the woman returned to her house, ignoring the friendly wave from Megan as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that this annoying girl is making me go through so much of an effort\" she said to herself as she removed a vile from the containment sphere. \"At least I can try this out finally\" she said as she took a large gulp of the transparent liquid. Elizabeth felt her body tingling, but otherwise did not notice anything different about her. It was only when she looked at the mirror that was in the room, that Elizabeth saw that she had become invisible. \"Perfect\" she said with a smile, as she picked up the containment sphere, which also became invisible in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get to work\" Elizabeth said with an evil grin that no one would be able to see. She left her house and walked invisibly behind Megan, who was unsuspecting of the invisible woman now just inches away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I know he's so hot! I just don't think he's my type you know? He's nice and all but soooo quiet\" she said to her friend on the other line just as the invisible Elizabeth stabbed her neck with a syringe. \"Ow!\" Megan yelled in shock, dropping her phone to the ground. Megan held her head briefly before feeling herself become light headed. eventually, her will faded from her completely and she took on a robotic expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick up your phone again. Tell your friend that something just came up and that you'll talk to her soon\" Elizabeth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded and picked up the phone. \"Sorry, Lisa. Something super important just came up. I'll call you back tomorrow\" she said and hung up her phone before her friend even had a chance to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walk into your house with me and call your brother downstairs\" Elizabeth said, her tone sounding very annoyed. She couldn't believe that this woman was the reason that she just wasted her last batch of will-nullifier. Sure, she would soon have a fully functioning lab to make more of the stuff, but until then, she didn't have many resources. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan did as said, unlocking the door and calling for her younger brother. \"Hey! Martin! Come down here please!\" she said, yelling up the stairs for her brother as Elizabeth felt herself tingling again, meaning that she would once again be visible for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, sis?\" the young Martin asked as he walked down the steps. the 12 year old had bushy black hair, very thick glasses and braces. He was basically the stereotype of 'nerd'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Martin\" Elizabeth said with a smile. \"My name is Elizabeth. I live next door\" she said in a friendly voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" Martin said, frowning. His frown then widened when he saw the emotionless expression on Megan's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can tell, your sister is not exactly herself right now. Nor am I. Tell me, have you ever heard of Viktor Von Strasser?\" Elizabeth asked, noting the fear in Martin's eyes as he realized that something had been done to his older sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin nodded. \"He was a famous scientist! He just died\" he said, fixing his glasses, still staring at Megan. Elizabeth was impressed to see that the fear had quickly faded away. He seemed to be intrigued and even a bit turned on by this experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth grinned and shook her head. \"Not quite, Martin. You see, I am Von Strasser. I used my technology to steal this young woman's appearance. The body that the police found was a fake. If you want evidence that I tell you the truth, just look at my technology\" she said, releasing her supercomputer from the sphere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Martin said, his eyes widening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth placed her manicured hand on the 12 year old's shoulder. \"That's right. This is the device that I invented and used on Elizabeth here. I'd like to use it on your sister as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On Megan? Why?\" he asked, looking up, into Elizabeth's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attractive woman ruffled Martin's hair. \"Well, your sister is a bit of a chatterbox. She's very annoying. All I wanted to do was work on my newest inventions but she just talks and talks going on and on and on. It's really rather annoying. At first, I was simply going to fix up her mind and make her more acceptable, but you seem like a young man that truly cares about science. Would you like to help me with an experiment?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of experiment?\" Martin asked, raising his eyebrow. He looked at Megan again, but did not get a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to take Megan out of the picture. She's too much of an annoyance for me to keep her around. I want her personality gone with, but I have no problem keeping her body around for the time being\" she said, tossing a headband like what Elizabeth had worn to get her mind copied towards Megan, who caught it reflexively. \"Put that on\" she said to Megan before turning back to Martin. \"Anyway, I'd like to put you into Megan's body. That way, you get to live life as a college girl. I trust that you won't be nearly as loud or bothersome as your sister would be. In return for that, I'll let you try out some of my new inventions, what do you say?\" Elizabeth asked as she went over to her computer and began copying Megan's mental patterns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin gulped and watched this all as it was happening. \"I...I don't know\" he said, waving his hands in front of Megan's blank face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth looked at the monitor screen which began flashing. <b>Copy complete</b>, it said in large letters before asking <b>Delete original mind?</b> Elizabeth smiled. She had pressed no for the previous user of her name because she thought it would be fun having her watch her own transformation. With Megan, she had no such interest and did not hesitate to press <b>yes.</b> \"Sorry Martin, but I just deleted Megan's mind. Other than the copy of it that I have uploaded into my storage device, your sister is now dead. Would you like to reconsider my offer? If you say no, your sister's body will not manage for long and she will be dead within hours\" Elizabeth said, licking her lips. Either way, at least Megan would no longer be annoying her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin now looked horrified. He looked at the woman sitting by the computer and then at his sister, who was now apparently dead mentally. \"Okay\" he said to Elizabeth, a bit quicker than expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marvelous\" Elizabeth said, impressed with how the boy was blowing away her expectations. Perhaps he would be usable in the future to her. Elizabeth pulled the headband off of Megan (since the girl now had no mind, her body would remain unmoving besides for basic bodily functions even with the control drug still in her system) and tossed it to Martin. \"Put it on\" she said to the young boy, who did as he was told. He heard a faint buzzing as his body and mind was scanned by the device and uploaded onto the computer. This time, Elizabeth selected to save his original mind. Elizabeth hummed a tune to herself as she put various commands into the computer. The result was two viles being filled. Elizabeth sniffed the first vile and handed it to Martin. \"Drink up.\" she said as she pulled the headband off of him. Martin frowned as he sniffed the vile as well. \"Oh don't worry! It won't kill you!\" Elizabeth said as she pored the contents of the other vile into a syringe. Megan herself would be unable to drink it in her current state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin looked at the vile in his hand and then at the older woman. Strangely enough, he trusted her, Outside of his own mother and older sister, Martin had never been talked to by a good looking woman. Although Elizabeth wasn't nearly supermodel material, she was a fairly attractive woman. The fact that she also seemed to be an inventor that Martin knew about was also something attractive to the young boy. After thinking for about a minute, Martin took a large sip from the vile. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After imbibing the fluid Elizabeth had given him, Martin looked over at the smiling woman and waited. \"I don't feel anything.\" he told her, as he looked down and held up one of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it time my boy, the concoction is flowing throughout your system. It should work within the next few... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin suddenly grasped his stomach and grunted, dropping the empty vial he was holding. \"There we go.\" Elizabeth chuckled as she sat down and crossed her legs and got ready to enjoy the show. Martin gazed once more at the lifeless body of his sister, then he felt a strange tingling run throughout his body. He first reached up his head as his hair began growing at an accelerated pace, his fringe creeping down over his glasses. At the same time, he looked around as his height also started increasing... gradually at least. His jeans became tighter as his ass started expanding and morphing into a feminine shape, his skinny legs gained a little mass under his jeans and slowly became smooth to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... this feels w-weird!\" Martin said, looking apprehensively over to Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, it's all happening as I planned it. Just enjoy the changes my boy.\" Elizabeth reassured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute or so later, after his height peaked at 5' 6\" (an increase of four inches), Martin felt his chest ripple - and then push outwards... forming two perky breasts underneath his t-shirt. At the same time, his pre-pubescent penis and testicles shrank away to nothing, morphing into his sister's vaginal lips. The moans and whimpers escaping Martin's mouth slowly changed from those of a young boy... into those of a young woman. Martin also grunted as his feet pressed against the insides of his sneakers, without actually ripping them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his face changed into his sister's, his braces disappeared as his teeth re-aligned and Martin was momentarily terrified when his eyesight worsened. Elizabeth quickly came to his rescue, whipping his glasses off and passing him Megan's glasses instead. \"Here, these are yours now, my 'girl'\" Elizabeth grinned, looking at the cute, slightly nerdish 22-year old woman stood in front of her wearing the too-tight clothing of a 12-year old boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!! It worked, I'm-I'm a girl?\" the new Megan exclaimed, feeling her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was delighted. \"Yes you are, 'Megan', and do you notice anything else?\" she asked the former 12-year old. \"Think carefully, about the things your sister normally would.\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin looked downwards as his now adult hands roamed over his feminized body. \"I know what a period is! And... I... I like boys?\" he stuttered, a little creeped out by the thoughts now in his head. Elizabeth had also made a few mental tweaks to Martin, giving him his sister's sexuality (but lower libido) and all the knowledge of hers he would need to help him adjust to his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you're not crazy about boys like your sister was.\" Elizabeth said, gesturing to the empty 'vessel' that was Megan's body behind her. \"And knowing about the menstrual cycle... or period... is very important when you're assuming a woman's appearance, I should know.\" she chuckled. \"So let me first to congratulate you on becoming such a pretty young lady.\" Elizabeth smiled at the new Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... thanks.\" Megan returned the smile, albeit nervously as she continued feeling herself up. One rub between her legs was enough to dampen her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now run along and get changed out of those clothes, they're not yours anymore.\" Elizabeth directed Megan, who nodded and scurried off to what had been his sister's bedroom - now his bedroom, to check out his wardrobe.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now then....what to do with you, my dear...\" Elizabeth said as she looked at the motionless body of the original Megan. Without a personality, her body was essentially not even truly alive. She would continue to breathe and do other necessary body functions, but would be unable to do any activity that required any form of conscious thought. Since she would be unable to feed herself, she would likely die if left alone. \"I can't just leave you like this....maybe I should bring you back with me and use your body in some experiments?\" Elizabeth mused about that for a little bit. That would be fun, but would also leave people suspicious as to what happened to Martin, since he would be the one that people would assume to have gone missing. \"No, that won't do\" she said with a frown. \"Besides, I'll have plenty of subjects in my experiments thanks to my position at Wilkos. I guess I'll just have to use this like I originally planned\" she said, looking at the needle that was filled with the second batch of liquid that the computer had generated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth suddenly stabbed the needle into Megan's neck. With no mind inside of her body, she didn't show any sign of the pain that she was no doubt feeling as Elizabeth pushed the liquid into her blood stream. Megan's body suddenly shook as she began to shift and change. She shrunk down to just a little over five feet and became very skinny and frail looking. Her vision blurred as her teeth became crooked. After several seconds, there was a perfect copy of Martin passed out on the floor. He appeared to be sleeping peacefully, using the clothing that he found around him for warmth since they were too big for him to wear otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth knelt down and ran her hand through his hair. \"Interesting\" she said in a gentle, soothing voice. \"Your body couldn't properly adapt to your new mind, so you've passed out in order to get used to it. I should have expected that, I suppose\" she said before pressing a button on the containment sphere. \"I just have to make one more finishing touch for you\" she said, taking out the small metallic ball that had come out of the sphere. Elizabeth gently opened his mouth and opened the ball in, which surrounded Martin's crooked teeth and formed a set of braces identical to what the real Martin once wore. \"There. Now you're all done\" Elizabeth said and gently kissed the top of Martin's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth left the sleeping boy on the floor and made her way up to what she assumed to be Megan's room before knocking on the door. \"Y-yes?\" Megan's voice asked from the other side of the door, sounding nervous. Elizabeth smiled. She had made sure to only give the new Megan enough memories to make living as a girl easy. Since she gave her none of Megan's personality or personal memories, the personality in charge of the body was entirely Martin. That meant that Megan would likely never again be the loud-mouthed chatterbox that she once was, providing Elizabeth with constant peace and quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, 'Megan'\" Elizabeth said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh. I'm sorry, doctor. I didn't realize\" Megan said, opening the door gently. \"W-what is it?\" she asked, looking very nervous. Megan's body was now stripped down to her under garments. Obvious Megan had been in the middle of examining herself in much the same way that Elizabeth had been planning on doing before she was interrupted by the conversation outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled, enjoying the sight of the cute girl in front of her. \"I just wanted to let you know that Martin should be waking up within the hour. He'll be a little confused as to why he's wearing some of your clothes, but I trust you to explain enough to him that he'll be okay. Take care of him, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded nervously. \"Of course. He's...he's me after all. Isn't he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth thought for a moment and then nodded. \"Yes, I suppose he is. Now have a good night, dear\" she said, closing the door. Elizabeth turned invisible again before heading back downstairs. She stayed in the house just so long enough to get another glance of the sleeping Martin. The personality that was now inside of that body was one that Elizabeth would watch with interest from now on. Elizabeth had given the empty shell that was originally Megan the personality and memories of Martin, but also added parts of the original Von Strasser's intelligence and personality to him. The boy was still 12 years old, but would likely be one of the smartest 12 year olds to have ever lived. He would likely be running his own experiments on his 'sister' very shortly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, Elizabeth headed outside to return to her much needed self-exploration. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wasn't gone that long.\" Elizabeth chuckled, petting and stroking her faithful pet. Then she dismissed him back to the couch and made herself a drink of coffee before locking the front door and making her way upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rested her containment sphere on her bedside dresser and kicked her ballet flats off her slender feet. A wry smile played around Elizabeth's lips as she held her coffee cup with one hand, and played with her right breast with the other. \"This should prove rather fulfilling.\" Elizabeth muttered to herself, before finishing off her beverage and sitting down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting up her pink tank top, the garment effortlessly came over her head and off, being neatly folded instead of tossed to one side. Von Strasser had always been one for neatness where he could help it, and now Elizabeth would be the same. Only then did she start closely inspecting the B-cup breasts that sat snug in her bra, cupping and squeezing them gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating!\" Elizabeth grinned, her eyes lighting up with joy. \"Being female will certainly be an interesting experience. I must make notes of my thoughts.\" she said to herself, eyeing a pad and pen on the dresser. \"But maybe not yet...\" she then chuckled, as she expertly reached around and unclasped her bra, removing it from around her torso. The garment joined her tank top nearby. As the cool air of the room caressed her nipples, Elizabeth began to breathe a little heavier, and her nipples began to harden, her pussy dampen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this is getting better by the second. I definitely made the right choice with this one.\" she almost moaned, as she rubbed her thighs together and tweaked her feminine nipples. What she had just done with Megan and her brother also helped to excite Elizabeth, proving what a 'deviant' she now was. The very brilliant deviant Viktor Von Strasser had once been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Elizabeth had peeled off her leggings (neatly folding them), revealing her smooth, shapely legs, which she was justly proud of. She ran her manicured hands along their length, before eventually removing her knickers as well. She now stood naked, gazing down at herself, the glistening lips of her pussy on display. \"Such an improvement on what I once had down there.\" she giggled, as she used a single finger to probe the outline of her vagina... then sliding it under her labia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHH... my goodness!\" Elizabeth cried out, still sounding quite refined as he fingers penetrated her sex. It was a feeling unlike any other, and she proceeded to pleasure herself until she reached the inevitable climax several minutes later. Von Strasser it seemed, had enough of Elizabeth's sexual knowledge in his pretty new head to know just how to bring himself to orgasm quickly. Not that it took much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night proved to be a very erotic night for the new Elizabeth as she fully familiarized herself with her attractive body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Elizabeth arrived at Wilkos at her normal time, early enough to be the very first one at the store. She put her key into the lock and walked casually inside, as she had done every day since becoming the full-time manager years earlier. Elizabeth smiled as she looked around the store that would within hours be filled with all sorts of employees and customers waiting to be experimented on by her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, this is where my life changed for the better\" she said, stopping at the spot where she remembered Von Strasser first calling out to her last night. It was interesting. While Elizabeth knew that she was in fact formerly Viktor Von Strasser, she could only remember the meeting from the point of view of herself. She shrugged quickly and continued her walk through the store. Since she chose to give herself Elizabeth's memories and personality along with her body it made sense that she would be remembering things from Elizabeth's point of view where there was overlap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth now walked towards her office with an added sway in her hips. Not wanting to attract too much attention or suspicion, Elizabeth was wearing exactly what she was expected to wear to work. A simple pant suit with a white blouse. There were only two differences between what she wore today and what Elizabeth would wear on any other day of work. First, Elizabeth was wearing heels a couple of inches taller than she would normally wear without a special reason. Second, Elizabeth had her blouse open a few buttons more than it would have been, revealing her breasts more than she had ever shown at work before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed one of her favorite pieces of music as she unlocked her office and walked inside. Elizabeth smiled excitedly as she began to set up her technology throughout the office. If she had to have any meetings in here, she would return it all to the containment sphere before unlocking her office. Elizabeth grinned evilly as she sat down in her chair and rested her feet on her desk in a very un-Elizabeth style. \"I can't wait to start my experiments\" she said with a bright smile on her face as she closed her eyes and waited for her first subjects to arrive.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Elizabeth watched the busty woman arriving on the security cameras, instantly recognizing her as the woman who had asked 'Von Strasser' if he needed help yesterday. \"Well, hello my dear, nice to see you again.\" Eizabeth smirked, carefully observing Liz as she locked the door behind her and made her way upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later there was a knock on her office door. Elizabeth swung her legs off the desk and neatened her blouse and jacket. Then she stood up and strode over to the door in her heels, exiting the room. She didn't want Liz to see any of her scientific equipment after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning!\" the chirpy supervisor smiled at who she thought was her usual boss, not knowing the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, Liz, just the person. It's lovely to see you. I want to go over the work schedule for the day, who is working where, etc.\" Elizabeth said in a professional tone as the two women walked through the hallway. This surprised Liz a little, since Elizabeth didn't usually interfere in such things. Liz was the staff supervisor and it was normally her job to assign the employees to jobs. But... she didn't protest, instead she just listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elizabeth laid out her plans to Liz, she looked down at the older woman, in particular at the large, heavy 30H breasts straining her polo shirt. They were clearly the most unique part of Liz's otherwise 'average' body. Elizabeth approved. \"I think it's important to pair the employees off differently, have male and female staff working together more. It will create a more positive working environment I think.\" Elizabeth explained, as Liz listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... okay, I guess I can do that. But there are more girls here than men.\" Liz replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled. \"Oh yes, I know, and don't worry about that. We can just... swap them around from time to time.\" she chuckled. Liz not knowing just how literal Elizabeth was being. Besides, a healthy number of male customers would even things out when it came to her experimentation. \"Now run along and prepare a schedule and bring it to me to look over, okay?\" Elizabeth said to Liz, who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the supervisor headed back downstairs to the shop floor, Elizabeth took a deep breath. She was going to enjoy today very much.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just barely over an hour later, the store was ready to open at its usual time. Elizabeth flipped a switch in her office to illuminate the neon sign outside of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the sign was turned, Elizazeth noted one last employee straggling inside. Elizabeth quickly remembered this employee as Liam, a rather lazy worker who only maintained his job thanks to family connections. There had been many times since he was hired that Elizabeth or Liz found Liam slacking off on the job. While his pay had been docked as much as it could be, the fact that he still worked here greatly annoyed the old Elizabeth, who saw his employment as a waste of money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont think you're a waste at all, Liam. In fact....I think you're just perfect for me\" Elizabeth said with the grin on her face that said she was coming up with an evil plan. Elizabeth had a feeling that the only reason that Liam was so lazy was because he was bored constantly. Odds were that he realized that this job was the farthest his life would go. Luckily for him, Elizabeth had many ideas of where it could go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth looked at the nany pieces of technology scattered across her new \"lab\". While it was small, it would work for its purposes. Hopefully Elizabeth could start a work schedule for new inventions and eventually take over the Wilkos basement, but for now, she would have to be based in her office. Since she would likely be unable to leave, it was imperative for her to have a trusted spy in the store to help her on the ground. This would give Liam some interest at the very least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Liam was not the only option for this position. Liz would obviously be ideal for it given her position. Elizabeth would easily be able to get the busty supervisor into his presence long enough to brainwash her to the cause. The same could be done with many employees involved in various social circles. Unfortunately, though, it would take most of the day to whip up a new batch of will nullifier and Elizabeth wanted to start her experiments as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth thought for a few moments before coming to her decision. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liam had only just started what he termed 'work' when he suddenly heard the intercom crackle into life, interrupting the music. \"Staff announcement, will Liam please come to my office, that's Liam, thank you.\" he heard Elizabeth's melodic voice over the intercom. It was her voice... yet the manner of speech sounded ever so slightly different for some reason. Liam just grumbled to himself. Great, what have I done now? he shook his head while trudging upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing outside the manager's office, Liam was hesitant to knock and announce his presence. But he didn't have to, for Elizabeth now had a hidden camera outside her office as well. \"Come in my boy.\" Liam heard his boss call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that's just creepy.\" Liam frowned, before turning the door handle and heading into the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw in there pretty much stunned him. Not only the array of scientific machinery but also how Elizabeth was slouched in her chair with her legs up on her desk, looking very relaxed. \"Nice to see you Liam.\" Elizabeth announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hi.\" Liam forced out a smile of his own, while looking nervous. \"Am I in trouble again?\" he just felt he had to ask the question rattling around in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth removed her legs from her desk and sat more professionally, befitting the manager she now was. \"Oh no, you're not in bother my boy, just have a seat. I have a little proposition for you.\" she tried to allay Liam's worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam took a seat, then took another look over at the weird machinery in the office. \"Admiring my technology?\" Elizabeth smiled proudly. \"All what you see if the result of decades of work. But it was worth every minute I spent slaving away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decades??\" Liam replied skeptically. He knew Elizabeth was only 30 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth started chuckling as she leaned forward, making sure Liam got a view of her cleavage inside her blouse. \"I'm not who I appear to be my boy. It may be hard for you to believe, but I am Doctor Viktor Von Strasser, a brilliant scientist and geneticist. I have taken over your manager's identity by assuming her appearance, as you can see.\" Elizabeth said, cupping her boobs for Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam wasn't swallowing any of this, and Elizabeth could tell. So she retrieved her containment sphere to give him a demonstration. She miniaturized a piece of her equipment before his eyes, then made it reappear. \"That is just a sampling of what I can do my boy. Convinced?\" she said to Liam, whose eyes were pretty much out on stalks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah, I guess so, but... WOW!\" Liam responded, not knowing quite what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, back to my proposition. How would you like to become my assistant and help me run experiments on your friends in this store?\" Elizabeth asked Liam, getting an instant frown from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not my friends, they all hate me!\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's expression changed to a sympathetic one. \"Ahh yes, I know what it's like to have colleagues looking down on you, calling you names. But see, this is the perfect opportunity for you to turn the tables on everyone here. So - what do you say?\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam didn't have to think for very long. \"Count me in Doc!\" he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... call me Elizabeth, we must maintain the subterfuge in order for me to turn this entire building into my laboratory.\" Elizabeth muttered, wagging a finger a Liam for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gotcha, sorry.\" Liam apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now stand up a moment please.\" Elizabeth told Liam, who did as he was told. She then took a moment to study his appearance. \"Hmm, what would you say to a change of form my boy? I mean, to look the part of my new assistant?\" she chuckled in a wicked manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change of form?\" Liam again frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth rolled her eyes. \"A new body, my boy.\" she clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam looked down at himself, then shrugged. \"Um... I guess, but... what's wrong with my helping you like this?\" he asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth tutted and shook her head, standing to her feet and pacing around Liam in her high heels. \"Because your colleagues won't take you seriously will they? Maybe you should approach them from a position of authority?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning?\" Liam mumbled, as he scratched his scraggly, brown, ponytailed hair.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A mischievous grin came across Elizabeth's face. \"I'm offering you....I suppose you can think of it as a promotion of sorts\" she said before standing up and cracking her back. Liam's gaze followed her as she walked to the computer device that was now in the back corner of her office. She picked up the metallic headband and threw it to Liam, who caught it and looked at it curiously. Elizabeth sighed. She had to already explain what it was so many times and it was beginning to get annoying. \"Put it on your head. It'll scan you. I'll explain things while that's happening\" Elizabeth said as Liam did as he was asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel kind of tingly\" Liam said with a frown as the headband did it's thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth shrugged apathetically. \"Sorry about that\" she said before continuing. \"Anyway, you are going to be my assistant from now on. You will be aiding me in all of my future experiments in this store. You will also be my 'man on the ground' so to speak. If I need something done physically, it will be you that handles it so that I can remain here in my...lab\" she said, frowning that she had to call this quickly put together room a lab. Not to worry though. Soon this whole store would be her lab. \"Now, as we said, you are not particularly well liked by your coworkers. They see you as a fool and kind of a creep who only works here because of your family connections. That might very well be the case, but I refuse to judge you the way that the old Elizabeth did. Do you know what I see in you, Liam?\" she asked as the scan finished up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Liam asked as Elizabeth walked over to him and took the headband off of him. She then tussled his hair a bit and smiled in a friendly way. A way that Elizabeth had never smiled at him before. Liam had to admit that that felt...nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see so much potential in you, Liam. But that potential is being wasted\" she said, walking back to the computer and putting some commands into it. \"I know that you are a bright boy. And I know that you are capable of doing so much more than you think you are. That's why I want you as my lab assistant. And once you're my lab assistant, I'll give you two upgrades. First, you'll be the new employee supervisor of the store, giving you almost as much access as me to the store and even more personal access to the average employee. Secondly, I don't think you need a reminder that your coworkers do not see you as having any authority. Even if you were to become the new supervisor, you would not be looked at any differently. It would likely be seen as your family pulling strings from the background and would cause many hard working and honest employees to quit. That's why I'm going to transform your body as well. How do you feel about Liz?\" she asked as some liquid was poured into a vial which Elizabeth then carefully held between her fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz? Er, she's alright. Decent looking for sure. And she definitely has one hell of a rack. It's a shame she's always such a bitch to me though\" Liam said, not understanding why he was being asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth giggled a bit. \"Well tell me. How would you feel about becoming her?\" she asked, as she poured about a quarter of the liquid into a small syringe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam got very flustered all of a sudden, his face turning red. \"I, uh, I w-would love that!\" he said. \"Is that possible?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth laughed again. \"Of course it is! I'm standing right in front of you in the form of Elizabeth after all!\" she said. \"You have my word that I can give you Liz's form and identity. Once you are her, she will be made into one of our lab rats to experiment on however we see fit. And I just know that you want to have some say in that, Am I right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam nodded. \"Yeah. I'd like to give her some payback for sure\" he said, making a fist with his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled!\" Elizabeth exclaimed happily. \"You will become Liz and act as my full time assistant. But first, you'll have to prove yourself to me\" she said with a smirk on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do I do that?\" Liam asked, sounding annoyed. He was clearly hoping to be made into Liz as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth handed him the small syringe. \"That has in it a special mind programming liquid. I once had access to one strong enough to nullify a human's will entirely for up to three hours. Unfortunately, since my main lab recently got destroyed, I have to start pretty much from scratch here. The strongest that I was able to make on short notice is one that will make whoever it is injected into a little more submissive for a fraction of that time. Because their will is not fully nullified, they will still be themselves in their entirely but will just be more open to suggestion for a bit. I want you to use it on one of the other employees here. It can be anyone you want. Have whatever fun with them as you like and then take a break for lunch. Now if you impress me, then you will be rewarded with your new life as my lovely assistant, Liz. But if I am not impressed, you will return here to be given a memory suppressant and will forget all about our little chat. Your life will return to normal with you being oblivious about me. Now are you ready to prove yourself, Liam?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam frowned, looking down at the needle in his hand. He knew that he wanted to do this, but wasn't this going too far? What if whatever he did wasn't enough to impress Von Strasser? Liam sighed, deciding on an answer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liam gave it some thought, about what he could possibly do with the mixture Elizabeth had given him, then a sly smile appeared on his face. \"Yeah, I think I can do this alright.\" he assured his boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was pleased to hear it. \"Excellent, then run along and have your fun. Remember I'll be watching you on the cameras, so I'll know EVERYTHING you get up to, in any part of the store.\" she told him, which also doubled as a warning for him not to double-cross him. Not that Liam was thinking of doing such a thing, since a promotion was hanging on this, not to mention a new body. His erect cock was tenting his pants at the mere thought of becoming Liz, and Elizabeth could tell how excited he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotcha, I t-think I know what to do.\" Liam nodded, as he turned to leave the office door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and remember, not a word about what you've seen or heard in here, not even a slip of the tongue if you can help it. We don't want our plans ruined before they even get off the ground do we?\" Elizabeth smirked, as she sashayed over to her task chair and sat down, slipping her feet out of her heels to give them a rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course not, er... I'll see you in a bit Elizabeth.\" Liam again nodded at his new and improved manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door was shut, Elizabeth kicked her legs up on the desk again and slouched back, taking a moment to pull her blouse open a little more to ogle her pert breasts. \"I do hope so my boy.\" she mumbled, moaning as she groped her 'assets'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liam emerged onto the shop floor, a whole array of emotions were going through him. First off he was afraid of screwing up somehow, breaking the syringe before he could use it. Second he was not exactly eager to socialize with any of his co-workers, even though he had to pick one to use the mind controlling drug on. And lastly of course, he was nervous, mainly because...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were upstairs a while Liam. I suppose you had a proper grilling this time huh? Whatever you did must have been pretty bad.\" Liz's voice chimed up behind him, startling him. Liam turned and saw his big-breasted supervisor stood there, and his eyes immediately locked onto her chest, causing her to scowl. \"STOP staring at my boobs Liam, I'm up here.\" Liz snapped, pointing to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry Liz, I didn't mean to.\" he apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's what all the guys say when they're ogling them.\" Liz rejected Liam's apology. \"Look, I don' t care what Elizabeth had to say to you, all I want from you now is for you to go to your section and start working. I want the stock put out within the hour, okay?\" she made herself crystal clear to Liam, who grumbled under his breath as Liz walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just wait...\"</i> Liam growled to himself, glaring at Liz as she disappeared around some shelving. Taking the syringe out of hic pocket, Liam knew he couldn't just start work. He had to prove himself to Elizabeth, and that was most important. And as for his choice of 'victim', well that was made easy when he saw Charlotte staring at him, flipping him 'the bird'. If anything, Charlotte was the person in the store whom Liam disliked even more than Liz. In fact the word 'despised' would be more appropriate in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam just smiled as Charlotte put a box of soap down and prepared to open it with her safety knife. Acting on impulse, Liam surged forward. \"Ow! What the fuck are you... doing?\" Charlotte winced, standing up as her sentence trailed off. The look of anger on her face changed to one of partial 'blankness' as the mixture took immediate effect. \"What... is... \" Charlotte began slurring a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Charlotte, I don't want to hear your voice again. You understand?\" Liam told her straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl before him blinked a couple of times, shook her head at first, as if trying to shake off whatever was coming over her, but then she nodded. \"Okay.\" she nodded obediently. She then fell silent as Liam became quite 'giddy', his cock hardening again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now follow me Charlotte, to the basement warehouse downstairs.\" Liam gave Charlotte another command, which the girl found herself powerless to disobey. She rubbed the back of her neck for a moment, and then started following Liam downstairs. Once hidden from the rest of the employees, Liam faced his victim again, giving her a once over. It felt great to have control over the bitch. \"Take your top off Charlotte, and your bra, I want you to play with your tits for me.\" Liam ordered, and again Charlotte did as she was told, quite expressionless. After a few seconds, she was fondling her boobs and tweaking her nipples while Liam was rubbing his erection through his pants vigorously. But he stopped himself, not wanting to waste his next load of cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam's eyes widened with excitement as he gave Charlotte her next commands, not knowing how much time the mixture in her blood would give him. \"Drop to your knees and give me a blowjob, bitch.\" he practically cried out to her. The thought did enter Liam's head, that if everything worked out as he hoped, this might the first and last time he had a chance of having his dick sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's hesitation, and blinking a couple of times, Charlotte slowly dropped to her knees, unzipped Liam's trousers and reached it to wrestle his erect penis from his boxers. It was already dripping pre-cum as Charlotte slipped it into her mouth and began sucking. There was no force or passion behind it, but to Liam... his first ever blowjob felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, given his aroused state, he didn't last long. Two minutes later he felt his balls tense up and then his cock erupted in Charlotte's mouth.. spraying his load down her throat. \"Oh.. my... OH... GOD!\" Liam groaned loudly, as he emptied his balls in their totality. He was in so much bliss, he almost forgot about his restricted amount of time. After pulling his deflating member out of Charotte's mouth, feeling her buck teeth scrape his bell-end, he instantly tuked his cock away and told Charlotte to get dressed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of excellent timing, Liam got back upstairs with Charlotte just as the mixture started wearing off. It had lasted just 20 minutes. \"Why am I walking with you, loser?\" Charlotte suddenly growled, causing Liam to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but smirk at her. \"I don't know, you must be so attracted to me.\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte glared at Liam, flagged him off again and then went back to her section, not noticing the passage of time. The box she had been about to open was gone, worked by another employee. Charlotte scratched her head, then had to assist a customer who needed help. And for the life of her she couldn't figure out why she had a weird salty taste in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam kept his laughter to a minimum, then heard his name over the Intercom again. \"Staff announcement, Liam to my office please.\" Elizabeth's feminine tone again sounded out. Liam took a deep breath, then caught another annoyed glance from Liz before making his way upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped he'd done enough....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not that Liz was especially glamorous or anything, but she was Liam's immediate superior and of course Liam was curious as to what those big tits of hers would feel like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excited Liam?\" Elizabeth grinned, already knowing the answer to that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, definitely.\" Liam smirked, nodding like a bobble head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just try and relax, and try not to have an 'accident' okay. I saw how fast you came when Charlotte was blowing you.\" Elizabeth giggled, causing Liam to turn red in embarrassment. \"But don't worry, once you're rid of that pesky penis, I'm sure you'll find sex a whole lot more enjoyable... and it will last longer too.\" she winked at him playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sex?\" Liam arched an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth just sat back and continued smiling. \"Well yes. I'm sure you'll be eager to experience sex as a woman when you have Liz's identity right? And don't forget... you have a 48-year old husband waiting at your future home.\" she reminded him that Liz was a married woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww shit, I forgot about Eric.\" Liam grumbled, not liking that part of assuming Liz's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth reassured him. \"Not to worry, we can use him in our experiments as well, Maybe give him a new form too and make him into a kinky maid who does all the housework for you.\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Liam grinned, liking that idea. And just then, Liz knocked on the office door and came in when Elizabeth gave her permission. Upon entering she was astonished at all the peculiar machinery in the room. \"Wow... er... you wanted to see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes luv, come in and close the door, and take a seat.\" Elizabeth replied, gesturing to a chair beside Liam. As his supervisor sat next to him, unaware of what was in store for her, Liam glanced over at her and for once, he wasn't in the least bit scared of her. In fact he made a point of staring at the huge 'melons' straining against the inside of Liz's polo shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz scowled at Liam while Elizabeth wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response he just smirked at her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She made sure they all remembered nothing, but she now conveniently had all of the information that she would need to move forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...uh, why did you want to see me?\" Liz asked, clearly uncomfortable.

He enjoyed seeing her scared, after all the grief she had given him since he started working there. He was just looking forward to becoming the bitch, to have those huge melons of hers grow on his chest. God he was rock hard just thinking about it, the tent in his trousers obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Liam didn't know, is that Elizabeth's latest serum would not cause a physical swap between him and Liz, but rather a mental one. It was an experimental serum that Elizabeth hoped would successfully re-wire two people's minds and essentially cause them to think they're each other, without any kind of physical swap having to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The door's locked bitch, you're wasting your time.\" Liam chuckled menacingly, as the dart flew out of Elizabeth's gun and stuck in Liz's left shoulder, causing her to wince out in pain and reach up to pull it out immediately. But it wasn't quick enough, for the serum had already entered her blood stream and was on its way up to her head to go to work on her mind.

His thoughts began to slow down. It got harder for Liam to think. Darkness began forming around Liam....wait...Liam? No, she was Liz. But she felt so strange...She felt weak. She could barely stand up. She opened her eyes for just long enough to see her own body on the floor across the room. Liz suddenly screamed at the top of her lungs, but only succeeded in hearing Liam's voice. Elizabeth laughed, knowing that her experiment was a success.

Elizabeth now knew her mental alterations had limitless possibilities. \"You are now in Liam's body.

That body is now yours\" she said. \"But before you go to get to know yourself...what should we do about that one\" she said, pointing to Liam, who now believed himself to be Liz in Liam's body.

The one who wins the hand can swap anything he wants from the other players simply by saying the words \"I want to swap ... with ... \". What you swap can be anything but it is not allowed to swap everything at once. For example you can swap heads with someone but you cannot swap the whole body in one hand.<br>\r\nWhen a swap takes place nobody except the ones playing at the moment will notice anything strange, reality will alter so that it was always that way.<br>\r\nThe words for a swap have to be spoken within a time frame of two minutes. If not, a random swap between the winner and one of the losers takes place.<br>\r\nA swap which takes place cannot be reverted by the persons who participated in the swap for 48 hours. For example if Steven swaps hair with Jade neither Steven nor Jade can swap their rightful hair back before 48 hours have passed but it is possible for someone other to swap hair with the two of them.<br>\r\nIt is also not possible to swap something back you had before within 48 hours. For example: Steven now has Jade's hair, Jade has Steven's. Kiran wins the hand and swaps hair with Steven so she gets Jade's hair. Steven now has Kiran's hair. It would be possible for Jade to swap hair with Steven so she would get Kiran's hair but it is not possible for her to swap hair with Kiran in order to get her own hair back.<br>\r\nClothes adjust when someone swaps clothing or if some other physical aspect is swapped which would not fit with the clothes currently worn. For example if someone swaps height with some his clothes adjust to his sight so they fit just like the clothes before fit.<br>\r\nThe swaps are not limited to physical appearance. It is possible to swap lives or personal information. If someone decides to swap lives he exchanges places with the person he swaps but keeps his body, clothes and first name. Family, friends and gender get swapped. It is possible as well to swap tastes, personality, connections to persons If someone quits playing the game while the others continue, the person will only notice the swaps prior quitting the game. Every swap which takes place afterwards will be completely unnoticed by the person. Also it is impossible to tell someone who not participated what has been swapped, because every information regarding a swap cannot be heard by someone who did not participate. For example: Suki tells her mother that she swapped hair with her friend. For Suki's mother she will have not said anything. Not even her lips moved.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be interesting.\" Suki said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he send you, dear?\" Her mother asked her as she was coming out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, Mum.\" Suki replied back as she was pulling her coat on. \"I need to go to work, I will see you later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** *** ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki arrived at the store and made her way to the Tea Room to see who had arrived for their shift.

Kiran, Jade, Josh, and Steven were all around the room. \"I got these cards from my Uncle in India.\" Suki started to say as she then explained the rules to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it's real?\" Kiran wondered as she glanced at the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it might be, do you fancy a go to see if it does?\" Jade said the group as she got the cards out. \"I mean, we still have 30 minutes before the start of our shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" The others said as the gathered around a table and Suki dealt out the cards.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly a light bulb went off above her head.  \"I want to swap groins with Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What did you do that for?\"  Josh chuckled.  \"I doubt I can give it...\"  He was soon cut short by a tingling in his groin area, it was as if something was receding back into his body.  He then stood up and looked down and put his hand down his pants to confirm if his suspicions were correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"  Steven asked as he chuckled.  \"Did you lose something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he did and I will tell you one thing this is interesting.\"  Kiran said as she stood up and everyone noticed the sight bulge in her pants.  They all gasped as they saw this.  Just then Jade and Suki started to ask what seemed bombard her with questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, can I see?\"  Suki wondered as she began to make her way over to Kiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have an erection yet?\"  Jade wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, girls.\"  Kiran said with a smile on her face as she looked towards them.  \"All in due time.  Right now we still have roughly 18 more minutes left before we have to go down and start our shift.  So let's deal out the cards and see if we can try some other things out.\"  Soon they were all seated again at the tea room table and Jade dealt out another hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, moving from one country to another.\"  Suki replied back to him.  \"I should know, I lived in India for the first 5 years in my life and now I live here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but I am sure once I start working again and get some friends, I will start to enjoy it more.\"  Josh said nonchalantly to the table, not really thinking about what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't think you didn't have anybody to hang out with.\"  Kiran said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, did you think all my friends moved here with me?\"  Josh chortled to her.  \"Heck, all my siblings never saw out of the state their living in, let alone another country.  And it looks like I have 2 pair, Queens and 2s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad but it certainly doesn't beat my Full House.\"  Jade answered back to him as she lay down her cards to show the group.

I want to swap chests with Steven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Why me?\"  Steven nearly screamed.  He looked over to Jade and saw her 'girls' start to deflate at a gradual rate under her shirt and about the same time, Steven felt his chest start to inflate.  After about 20 seconds or so Steven had a pair of healthy female breasts.  He took his hand and lifted one of them up to test out the physics and let it fall and felt the jiggle of it as it fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought you would look cute with them.\"  Jade said coyly to a slightly blushing Steven as she got the cards ready for another round.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At which time, it can go back to it's owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm stuck with it for 2 days?\"  Josh said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not too bad.\"  Kiran said as she continued to rub her crotch slightly.  \"It's not like I have any diseases or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, I guess you're right.\"  Josh said as he looked for something else to swap with the group.  \"I want to swap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"  Jade said as she leaned forward to better hear what he was going to choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"  Josh said as he thought about what he was going to choose.  He knew he had to make it something small so that he could get along with the next several days without any major changes.  \"I want to swap...\"  Josh started to say but soon felt something shift around him.  \"What was that?\"  He wondered as he looked around the room and down at himself.  He soon noticed that he was wearing something different than he started the game with.  He found that he was now wearing a Wilko fleece jacket, a pair of of tight black trousers, and a pair of black lace up shoes.  He looked around the room once more and noticed that Suki had her clothing changed as well.  \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...  Let me see.\"  She picked up the rules once more and soon found the 2 minute rule.  \"It seems that you have 2 minutes to make a choice, but if you are not able to make a choice within that time period, then the game will make a choice for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have your clothes now?\"  Josh wondered as he look down at himself and back to Suki who nodded.  \"So is it just the work clothes or everything at home too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know but we will have to wait until we get off tonight to find out about it.\"  Suki said as she gathered uip the cards and got ready to deal out another hand.</span></div></div>",

They now knew what the guys usually had to go through, all the heavy lifting was tiring. \"My back is aching now.\" Suki whined as she stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too.\" Jade nodded, before smirking and glancing down to her groin again. \"Totally worth it though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki agreed. \"Oh yeah, absolutely.\" she grinned, still amazed by how much stronger she was now. \"I wonder how the others are doing?\" Suki then wondered, causing Jade to glance around to see if she could see any of their three swapped companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go and see.\" Jade shrugged, making for the toiletries aisle. Steven was still on there, and he seemed relieved the shift was almost over. \"Hey titch!\" Jade joked, greeting Steven with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh very funny, making fun of my height.\" Steven groaned. It was clear he wasn't in a great mood anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was joking, pull the stick from up your ass.\" Jade rolled her eyes, smiling then scooping Steven up in her arms and spinning him around. She was really surprised about how light he was now. \"How are you liking my boobs?\" Jade then asked Steven as she put him down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still there, see.\" Steven responded, grabbing the tits on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Liz's voice came on the tannoy and she told everyone that they could get their things and go home. \"Finally!\" Steven groaned loudly, being one of the first ones upstairs, despite his shorter legs. Five minutes later everyone was outside, and most of the staff went straight home, but Kiran, Josh, Jade, Steven and Suki all met up outside to have a little chat before heading home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he walked over to it, he took out his phone and responded back to Kiran's, or rather now his, friend.  Telling her that if she would come pick him up, he would be glad to go with them.  \"So Josh, are you going to go with them?\"  Kiran asked him as he went up the stairs towards the tea room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked to her and had to look up due to her height increase.  \"Yeah, I think I will.\"  Josh replied back.  \"I don't have anything else to do.  Soo... are you going to go watch the movie with Marcie?\"  He opened the door and noticed that Suki, Jade, and Steven were waiting for them by the lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but I'm not into scary movies too much.\"  She said as she opened up her locker to gather up her belongings.  Josh opened his and noticed a pink jacket with a bag too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not too bad, I usually do something else while she watches it.  I'm not too into them either.\"  Josh replied back to her as he put on his new jacket and looked into the bag to see a hairbrush, a wallet, and some other items.  \"I guess this is mine.\"  Josh muttered as he pulled some of his red hair in front of his eyes to get a better look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was soon brought out of it by Suki's voice. \"You guys up for a trip to the pub?\"  She looked over at everyone as they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, I'm not old enough.\"  Josh replied as he looked at his phone.  \"Besides I have other plans.  So do we have any plans on when to switch back?\"  He wondered as he was putting his bag on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you guys say 2 days?\"  Suki wondered as she put the cards in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, since that's the minimum.\"  Steven answered her.  He put on his coat as they made their way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so we will meet back here on Monday to switch back before the start of the shift.\"  Suki announced as she heard a car honking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, over here.\"  A girl's voice shouted towards the group.  Josh looked at the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess my ride is here.  I will see you guys tomorrow.\"  Josh said as he waved them goodbye. The others waved him goodbye and they made their way to one of the pubs near by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh neared the vehicle a young lady who looked around the age of 17 came out to meet him.  \"Glad you were able to make it.\"  The young lady, who Josh remembered was named Felicity, said as she threw a bag to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then looked at the bag and asked, \"What's this?\"  He looked into the bag and noticed that there was some clothing in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly.  You told me to bring a change of clothes, luckily we are the same size.\"  Felicity said to him.  Josh then noticed that they indeed were the same height and physique.  \"Let's go, the movie will start in 45 minutes and you can change in the car.\"  Josh sighed as he got in the passenger side of the vehicle and Felicity got in the driver's side and they made their way.  He looked into the bag and started to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Meanwhile with Suki and the others</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way over to one of the local pubs.  Jade made her way to the door and opened it.  \"Ladies first.\"  She said as she held it open for them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven sighed as he looked over to her.  \"Well, I'm not really a lady.\"  He motioned towards his crotch as he looked up towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have Kiran's height and Suki's strength.  So you kind of look like one.\"  She was quick to point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way to one of the corner booths and sat down.  Kiran was the first to speak up.  \"Jade are you going to show me what you took?\"  She wondered as she gestured towards her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade thought about it for a moment and tried to remember what she told her back at the store.  \"Yeah, let's go to the toilets and I will show it to you.\"  Kiran squealed with delight as she quickly got up and practically ran in there.  Jade couldn't help but laugh at her enthusiasm as she followed Kiran.  Suki, not wanting to be left out, got up too and followed Jade and Kiran in there.  Steven couldn't really believe whatjust  happened and just sat in the booth and ordered himself a water as he waited for the others to return from their little adventure. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Suki and Kiran both turned back to Jade, she had not only taken her Wilko top off, exposing her new muscles and flat chest, but she had unfastened her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade grinned... and gasped in unison with her two friends when she wrestled her cock free from the confines of Steven's former boxer shorts. A sit came into view, all three had silly grins on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...\" Suki said wide-eyed. \"Now I wish I'd taken Steven's dick.\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran though suddenly had mixed emotions, since she knew she should have been the one with with Josh's cock, but Jade had to go and 'steal' it from her. Still, she was pleased to see it in the flesh. And as Jade caressed her member, it grew to it's full erect length in her hand. \"Believe me girls, this feels... AMAZING!\" Jade smirked, as she felt her heart rate increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea Jade, I did have it for a little while - remember? Before you took it!\" Kiran responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, are you still sore about that? It was a swapping game, nobody said anything about rules.\" Jade rolled her eyes in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have swapped with Steven instead, he still had his penis.\" Kiran scowled at Jade, as Suki stood to the side watching things rapidly deteriorate. She was afraid of saying anything incase she was accused ot taking sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted Josh's dick, OKAY!\" Jade spat at Kiran, as she gestured down to the throbbing member in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!! Have fun with it.\" Kiran grumbled, kicking the makeshift wedge from under the door and then walking out of the pub toilets. Jade just let out an angry groan and then quickly got dressed again, tucking her cock back in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven as taking another drink from his glass of water when he saw Kiran storming past, heading for the doors. The now 6' girl accidentally knocked into a barmaid carrying a tray of empty glasses, but luckily none of them were smashed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Steven asked Suki, as she and Jade returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A classic case of penis envy is what happened.\" Jade sighed angrily, as she slumped down in a seat and ordered a strong drink.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a pair of slacks that looked to be a size or two too small for him, a black long sleeve blouse, and a pair of brown ankle boots with what looked to be a 2-inch heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity slowed to a stop at a red light and looked back at him.  \"Why haven't you started?  Nobody is going to see you and we are going to be there in about 10 minutes.\"  She wondered as she looked at him.  \"Don't tell me you changed your mind.  You told me to bring that outfit tonight, you still want to impress Brad, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was taken a back slightly when he heard this.  '<i>Am I to flirt with a guy for Kiran?</i>'  He thought to himself and looked back at Felicity.  \"So nobody will see me?\" He asked just to make sure nobody will see his new feminine form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time, no.\"  Felicity said, laughing slightly.  \"I mean, I know you like to think of yourself as a guy, but this tomboy streak that you're stuck in will have to end soon.  That's why you asked me to bring you this outfit, remember?  You wanted to make a good impression on Brad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I will change.\"  Josh said in a slightly defeated tone.  He started to strip to his, or rather Suki's underwear and got a good look at his body.  He had Kiran's flat crotch, which signified that he had her teenage vagina between his legs.  He looked at his chest and noticed that they were a darker shade than the rest of his body and knew that it was because he had Suki's breasts and her skin tone to go with them.  After putting on the blouse that Felicity brought him, he made work to pull up the pants and noticed that they hung on him much like a second skin would and he decided quickly that he didn't like it, but noticed that with his lack of male 'equipment' they were comfortable in the crotch region.  Lastly he put on the boots that were brought and zipped them up.  '<i>I wonder if I will be able to walk in these?</i>'  He thought to himself as he put Suki's work uniform back into the bag.

Suki had decided that the next round she was going to try and get a penis to see what it was like after seeing Kiran and Jade fight over Josh's.  They both got their drinks and Jade noticed what he was drinking.  \"Really, water?\"  Jade asked her shorter friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Steven asked as he looked at his glass.  \"I'm not much of a drinker. I don't like the taste and the way it makes me feel.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's your body.\"  Suki said trying to get Jade to avoid another conflict.  \"If he doesn't want to drink he doesn't have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right.\"  Jade announced as she took a drink from her glass.  \"I don't know what's gotten into me.  It's all happened since we got off of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because you have new hormones flowing through your body now and you don't know how to handle it.\"  Steven suggested as he looked around the nearly vacant pub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's the case, I'd hate to see what Josh is going through.\"  Jade chuckled, somewhat worried at what was happening.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jade was right, it really was itchy. He hadn't told his friends, but having Jade's breasts on his chest was really giving him a hard on. He could feel his erection straining against his (Jade's) knickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Suki continued, \"I think Kiran already has a new round of cards lined up.

Although, if there's no other choice...\" Suki winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven hit Suki's arm, then smiled, before the two of them got ready to start work with the others. By the time they got downstairs to the shop floor, they were both surprised... and pleased to see Kiran and Jade talking. It seemed they had managed to make up, much to everyone's relief. \"To think, my penis can cause so much truoble.\" Josh suddenly poked his head in between Steven and Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think someone's ego needs deflating a little.\" Suki laughed, as she ushered her now two shorter male co-workers in front of her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes, I'm having loads of fun.\"  He said as he rolled his eyes, which caused Carly to chuckle more.  \"While you're here, I have a question for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"  She said apprehensively.

I guess Sunday would be a good day and we close early on that day.  How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan, but Zoe is working that day and I let her daughter stay there with her on that day.\"  Carly answered him.  \"You know how it is, seven years old and wants to be like her Mum.\"  She chuckled, actually starting to hear her biological clock ticking and feeling her yearning for a child of her own.  <i>'I wonder if it's true and I can swap lives with Zoe.

She seemed to be a little more cocky since the last game, when she gained his penis and Steven's height. '<i>I hope it's nothing too bad.</i>' He thought to himself. He then looked over at the other players that would be joining them this round. Steven and Kiran were here from the last round. But Zoe had joined them for this round and it seemed interesting that she would be joining up with them. 'I wonder what Kiran said to her to get her to join up with us.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay we're here.\" Steven said as he opened the door to hear a door chime go off to signal that a customer had arrived. As they walked inside, the smell of nail varnish and polish remover was clearly evident in the air. Steven looked around and saw that it was mostly empty and then realized that they were supposed to close up in about 5 minutes time. \"Hello?\" He called out tentatively. He heard a slight rustle from the back and a young girl appeared from around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" The young girl responded as she saw the group consisting of 2 men and 2 women standing in the lobby. She turned around and announced to an unknown figure in the next room. \"Ms. Carly, I think your friends are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Arissia.\" The voice responded back with a chipper voice. And within a minute she turned the corner. Carly was a blonde at about 5' 2\" in height, but seemed to be 5' 5\" with her heels on. She was dressed in a pair of skinny jeans and a tight shirt, which seemed to accentuate her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in your normal uniform.\" Steven replied to her as he looked around the salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, today was my day off and Zoe was kind enough to watch it for me.\" Carly said as she checked out the group of people that had entered her salon. \"Zoe, luv, are you almost done?\" Carly called to the back. \"Our friends are here for the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I will be out in a moment.\" Zoe called from the back. \"Arissia, honey, how about you go to the lobby so that you won't be in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, mummy.\" A cute voice called from the back and soon a little girl around the age of 7 with dark brown hair that seemed to cascade over her shoulders with her bangs cut, so that they would stay out of her eyes. She was wearing a pair of jeans and a pink blouse, with what appeared to be a well worn pair of mary-janes on her feet. Her eyes were like none that Josh had seen before. Their stormy gray color seemed to clash with the chipper personality of the little girl. \"Hello, are you all here for the game?\" She wondered to the group of visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lil' one.\" Josh replied as he sat down in one of the chairs that appeared to be in the waiting room. Soon the others gathered around and Carly had brought a table to sit in the middle so that they could play on. To his surprise, Arissia sat down next to him. \"Umm... Is she going to play too?\" He asked Carly, who was busy rearranging some chairs around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" She replied as she called to the back once more. \"Zoe, is Ari going to play too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just poker right?\" She wondered as she came from the back wearing her usual business attire, a pink tank top with their logo emblazoned upon it and a pair of tight pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really.\" Kiran answered back as she explained the rules to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mummy, I want to play. Daddy taught me how to play.\" Arissia asked her mother who seemed somewhat angry to the fact that her husband taught her daughter how to play poker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did, did he?\" She asked with what seemed like fire in her eyes. \"I am going to really hurt him when I get home tonight\" She steamed as Josh and Steven backed away slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can I?\" Arissia wondered back to her mom. \"I won't get too upset.\" She exclaimed trying to assure her mother and the others that it would be okay. Kiran looked over to Josh and Steven, since they were the only males in the room. They seemed indifferent to the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it will be okay.\" Kiran said to the girl, who was now beaming up at her. \"Just don't get too upset over what happens okay?\" Arissia nooded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Kiran, what was this surprise you wanted to tell us.\" Steven wondered as he took a seat in between Liz and Kiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks for reminding me.\" Kiran said as she looked to the group. \"Well, I was looking over the rules and the set that we played the other day is just one form of the rules.\" The group seemed to be a little perplexed at what was just said. \"You know how we would play a round and the winner would utter the phrase?\" The group nodded. \"Well, this time we bet some of our attributes, like legs, arms, height, hair, and other stuff too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what are they worth?\" Josh wondered and instantly a holographic display appeared in front of each of them displaying the 'cost' of each part for the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Trait - Points<br>\r\nSmall body parts (e.g hands, feet, lips... etc) - 1 Point<br>\r\nSmall Possessions (e.g. jewelry, single books, single dvds) - 1 Point<br>\r\nOne clothing article - 1 Point<br>\r\nPersonal Infos (e.g. Age, name... etc) - 2 Point<br>\r\nLarger body parts (e.g. torso, legs, face... etc) - 2 Points<br>\r\n'Medium' Possessions (e.g. small personal library, DVD collections) - 2 points<br>\r\nSkills - 2 Points<br>\r\nMale/ Female body parts - 3 Points<br>\r\nMajor possession (e.g. cars, houses, all of one article of clothing) - 3 Points<br>\r\nGender - 3 Points<br>\r\nPersonality changes - 4 Points<br>\r\nWhole Outfit - 4 Points<br>\r\nLife - 5 Points</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we can do it like that.\" Steven said as he looked over at the others and all of whom seemed to be indifferent. \"Well let's get this over with before it gets too late.\" Steven looked up at the clock which read 6:03 pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Arissia has school tomorrow and I want her in bed by 8:30.\" Zoe said as she looked at her daughter who seemed to be beaming, being allowed to play with the adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I want to stay up later.\" Arissia complained as she wrapped her arms around her chest as if she was pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already told you this.\" Zoe said slightly exasperated. \"When you get older, then you can stay up as late as you want, but right now, you're only seven and you need as much sleep as you can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Arissia said as she looked at the others, hoping that they would help her out, but much to her dislike, that didn't happen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiran was happy to deal out the cards, although it certainly would be different with a 7 year old playing with them and she decided that she wasn't going to take it easy on her until she was able to get what she wanted.  As she finished dealing out the cards, she noticed that her hand was a good one, but didn't want the others to know.  She looked down at the holographic display that the game gave everyone for guidance.  \"So I have to bet something worth 1 point.\"  She mumbled to herself as she looked at her hand.  \"Oh, I will bet my hands.\"  And as if on queue a holographic display of her hands were being shown in front of her.  \"Wow, didn't expect that.\"  She exclaimed as she looked around and saw the dismay on everyone's face.  \"Carly, I do believe it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly glanced back down at her cards to see what she could do.  \"Hmm...  I guess I will bet my lovely lips and while I am at it, I think, my earrings too.\"  She announced to the group and she looked over to see a lovely pair of feminine lips and her exact earrings were next to them.  As if on instinct, she brought her hand up to her left ear and felt to see if they were missing, but much to her relief, she found they were still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn.\"  Zoe said cheerfully.  \"I will bet my job.\"  With that a clipboard with '<i>Beautician</i>' written upon it materialized in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You trying to tell me something, luv?\"  Carly chuckled as she gestured towards the clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all.\"  Zoe quickly said.  \"It's the first thing that came to mind actually.\"  She grinned as she turned to her daughter.  \"Arissia, it's your turn, sweetheart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded gleefully.  \"I think I will bet my pretty hair.\"  As like the others, her hairstyle appeared in front of her.  \"That is so cool, Mum.\"  She chuckled as she pointed to her bet that was in front of her and Zoe nodded to her appreciatively.  \"Mr. Josh, I think it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Lil' one.\"  Josh commented, as he too looked at his cards.  From the looks of it, he had a good hand and could win if the bets didn't get too high.  \"I think I will bet my gaming system.  Liz, I do believe it's your go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded as she too looked at her hand and thought about what would be a proper bet.  \"Hmm... So I need 2 points to stay in.\"  Kiran nodded as she looked at her hand.  \"Well in that case, I think I will bet my voice and my ample bosom.\"  The others laughed at this comment as her huge breasts took center stage on the table.  \"Well at least the game censored the nipples.\"  The group nodded as they smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven seemed to smile more than the others as he looked at his hand.  \"I think I will bet my job and I guess my gender won't be too bad.\"  He announced as he looked over to Josh who seemed to quiver slightly at the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I will bet my groin.\"  Kiran announced with a bit of pride.  Josh knew who would be the recipient of that prize if she won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum, whats a groin?\"  Arissia wondered to Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she bet her 'gina'.\"  Zoe said to her trying to get her to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think it will be funny if one of the boys get it.\"  Arissia chuckled to her mum and Zoe couldn't help but chuckle along with her.  Carly, Steven, and Zoe folded their hands with this latest bet.  \"I guess I will too.  Daddy showed me the winning hands and I don't have anything too good.\"  She said as she also lay her hand down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked to see what he had.  \"I think I will bet my Job experience.  I think that will help me out with getting my job done a little bit better.\"  He chuckled as he looked to Liz to see if she would join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will bet my legs.\"  She announced to the group as her legs appeared right beside her chest and her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My go.\"  Kiran said proudly.  \"I think I will bet my gender too.\"  Josh then threw down his cards and folded after hearing this.  \"Liz looks like it's between you and me.  Let's see what you got.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz smiled broadly as she lay down her hand  \"I have 3 of a kind\"  She showed the group her hand as she lay down a trio of 9's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That indeed is a good hand.\"  Kiran said smiling. \"But it won't beat my straight.\"  As if on queue all the traits found their way over to Kiran who in turn squealed with delight at having won.  As they migrated towards her, a figure for each player popped up in front of Kiran with their name displayed on the front.  \"That was interesting.\"  Kiran muttered to herself as she thought about what she wanted to give each player.  \"Well, I know Josh was expecting this when I bet it, so I will give Josh my groin and my gender too.\"  Josh didn't need to feel himself like last time, he knew that he was now a woman in his pants and on paper with her gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mr. Josh now has a 'gina' too.\"  Arissia asked Kiran who nodded to her.  She then giggled at the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Josh?\"  Kiran asked.  \"You looked cute with long hair last time so I think you should try it again.\"  She then dragged Arissia's hair over to his character and he felt his hair grow out and it reached his mid back, much like hers had been seconds earlier.  He then glanced over to Arissia, who now sported his shorter hair style, but it appeared that she didn't mind it too much.  \"To take care of it, I think you should have Zoe's job and her experience.  Steven, I think you should have Liz's job and legs, but I think I will take her chest.\"  With Kiran's smaller stature, Liz's chest seemed huge on her.  I will take Carly's hands because I've always liked the the fact they always look nice.  Steven, since you have Liz's job, I think you should have her voice too and take Carly's lips and earrings.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\"  Steven asked, with Liz's voice emanating from Carly's painted lips and he reached up to his ears and felt that they indeed were now pierced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it would be funny.  But you sound like a girl, so I think your gender will go to her too.\"  Kiran said with a smile.  \"Oh and Josh, I think your gaming system will go to Arissia, since you have her hair.  Well that's all for this round.\"  Everyone looked at themselves, among other changes, Josh had a beautician's job and knowledge, Steven had some nice lips and legs, and Kiran got free breast 'implants'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too weird.\"  Josh said as he got up and went over to one of the work stations to grab a couple of hair ties.  He noticed a mirror on one of the work stations and he looked in to see that his hair was now longer with short bangs, much like you would find on a primary student and, if almost on instinct, he started to braid his new hair into 2 perfect braided pig tails to rest on his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's the braid that Mummy always does for me before bed.\"  Arissia smiled to Josh as he made his way back over to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering why it came to me so easily and try to go easy with my gaming system.\"  Josh said to her smiling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright, but I don't think I will play it.\" Arissia exclaimed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should at least try it.\"  Josh told her with a smile.  \"You will never know, you might enjoy it. I know my wife certainly does.\"  He chuckled as he thought about his wife playing some of her games, cursing at he opponents as she tried to kill them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I can try it out? She plays video games too?\" Arissia asked with a look of wonder on her face.  \"She sounds like a cool person.\"  With that said, Arissia had an idea go through her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, she loves it and yes she is.  Well, let's get the next round going.\"  The other nodded as Carly gathered up the cards and started to deal them out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Carly dealt out the cards, Kiran was on cloud 9 with her new acquisition.  Just thinking about it, caused it to stir slightly within her knickers.  She looked at the cards in her hand and noticed that her hand wasn't as good as last time, but decided to see what she could out of it.  \"Carly, I think it's your turn to lead us off.\"  Kiran said to Steven's blonde friend, who was nice enough to let them borrow her shop for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked around to the slightly changed group, then down at her own hand.  \"Well, one point to lead off.\"  Carly muttered to herself.  \"I think I will bet my feet.\"  Soon, a pair of feet, which included her french-tipped pedicure appeared.  She looked over to Zoe who was looking somewhat depressed.  \"What's wrong, luv.?\" She asked her former co-worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just that I went to school for this, but now I have other knowledge in my head.\"  She replied back to her friend.  \"Before I had the information about manicures, haircuts, and waxing, but now it's filled with useless knowledge of some computer programs and Earth Sciences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that useless and I do want it back after this is over.\"  Josh said to her smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you can be sure that I will return it, because I want my knowledge and job back.\"  Zoe said to him.  \"Now, let's see, I will bet my hands.\"  Her hands soon appeared in front of her to join Carly's feet.  \"Arissia, sweetie, it's your turn now.\"  She then grew near her and whispered, \"Try not to bet too much, okay?\"  Arissia looked at her with her wide grey eyes and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked down at the cards in her hand and gave a toothy smile.  \"I am going to bet my age, I don't like having to go to bed so early.\"  She glanced at the table and noticed that it took her bet and a small cake appeared with 7 candles that were ablaze on it.  \"Mr. Josh, it's your turn again.  Wait, it's Ms. Josh now.\"  She said giggling as she remembered that he was now a girl thanks to Kiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's brow furrowed slightly as he heard this.  \"I am going to try and get my job back, so I am going to bet Zoe's job that I just got.\"  Josh announced as a clipboard appeared and like before, the word '<i>Beautician</i>' was written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Josh?\"  Carly said to him with a smile on her face.  \"Not wanting to work with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing like that really.\"  Josh replied back to her.  \"It's just that I enjoy the people that I work with.\"  He lied to her not wanting to really tell her that he didn't want to work doing manicures and stuff for the next several days.  \"Liz are you going to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at her cards and announced.  \"I think that I will bet my work knowledge, that way Steven will have a better knowledge of what to do.\"  In front of her appeared several work books with different positions in the store, '<i>Supervisor</i>'  '<i>Cashier</i>'  '<i>Stocking</i>', among others were with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"  Steven said to himself with Liz's voice coming out of Carly's lips.  \"It's not getting too bad right now, so I think I will bet my arms.\"  His fairly muscular arms could be found next to the others' bets.  \"Besides, if I am the supervisor now, I don't think that I will have to lift too much stuff.\"  He smiled slightly when he looked over to Liz, who seemed to frown with a slight disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what you think I do?\"  She replied to him.  \"Stand around bossing others around.  I think this will do you some good to know what it's like.  Besides, Kiran, I think it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran not wanting to get into the argument that they seemed to be having.  \"I think I will bet my musculature, I want to know how it is to feel strong.\"  Carly and Zoe looked at the cards in their hand and decided not to get too far into it and promptly folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arissia, sweetie, do you want to fold too?\"  Zoe looked over to her daughter who seemed to be smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, mummy.\"  She replied back.  \"I think I can win this, so I am going to bet all my pretty clothes.\"  Soon she found a rolling rack with all sorts of dresses, pants, shirts, and shoes on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but be careful, I don't want you to get too disappointed.\"  Zoe asked her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\"  She said with her sweet smile gracing her face.  \"Ms. Josh, are you going to stay in?\"  She wondered as she saw the frown on his face with her calling him Miss again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha Ha.  You seem to be getting a lot fun out of that.\"  He faked his laugh.  \"I think I will call with my, I guess my height.\"  He announced as a tape measure with 5' 10\" measured out.  The others, Steven, Liz, and Kiran folded, not really wanting to get too far into it.  \"So you're not going to fold Arissia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a small moment to look at her cards and decided.  \"No, I think I have a good enough hand.\"  She replied to him and Zoe, wondering what she had looked over her shoulder and smiled.  \"What do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Josh.  Show her what you got.\"  Zoe chided with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I have a straight.  5 through 9.\"  Josh said with a satisfying grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not bad.\"  Zoe said with her fingers near her mouth with an attempt to look like she was deep in thought.  \"Show him your hand sweetie.\"  She instructed her daughter who was giddy with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but will you help me with deciding who will get what?\"  She asked her mother who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it's your win.  I will help you if you want me to.\"  Zoe replied back appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia beamed up at her and nodded.  \"Okay, I have all hearts.\"  Josh's heart fell as he saw that her hand beat his.  \"First I think I will take my mummy's job from you Josh and Kiran I will give you Mr. Steven's muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost?!?  So what does that mean for me?\"  Josh wondered to Zoe and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a job and her job is a primary school student.\"  Zoe replied back to Josh who didn't seem to like what he heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you mean, that I now go to her classes and school?\"  Josh exclaimed as he took out his wallet and noticed that all he had was a driver's license and nothing else, no money, debit cards, or credit cards.  All he could find was a photo of him with his hair done up in pigtails, almost like a school photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did you find?\"  Zoe wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go to her school now.\"  Josh pouted as she showed the picture to Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, you look just like Arissia did when she got her's done.\"  Zoe said trying to stifle a laugh.  \"The only thing that's different is the clothes are different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\"  Arissia yelled with glee.  \"I get to have my Mummy's job!  Mummy, I will take your hands, but I think you can have Ms. Carly's feet and Mr. Steven's arms.\"  Zoe looked down at her hands and instantly noticed that they were smaller in comparison to her body and attached to Steven's not-so-muscular arms, surely didn't seem to help with the size difference.  \"Steven, since you have Ms. Liz's job, I think you can have her work experi...  This thing.\"  She said as she brought  Liz's work knowledge over to Steven's character.  \"Mummy what should I do with the height, age, and clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe sat there for a moment and replied to her daughter.  \"Well think about it for a moment.  You're a beautician now right?\"  Arissia nodded at her question.  \"And Josh is in your classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, not that.\"  Josh started to say waving his hands trying to send a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  I think I get it.\"  She replied as she slid her age over to Josh's character and Josh pulled out his wallet once more and noticed that he no longer had his driver's license, as he wouldn't need it for 10 more years.  \"You think I should give him the other stuff too?\"  Arissia wondered to her mum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's up to you, Ari.\"  Zoe commented using her daughter's pet name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if he's going to go to my classes, I think he will need to be smaller.  Don't you guys think?\"  Arissia asked the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.\"  Kiran said nodding her head and smiling over to Josh, who seemed to be waving his hands frantically but after hearing what she said gave her an obscene gesture while Arissia wasn't looking.  Kiran saw his gesture and frowned.  \"Actually Arissia, I think he should have your pretty clothes too, if he's going to go to your school.  What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia quickly turned to Josh and saw him bring his hands down suddenly.  \"I guess you're right.  I mean, he is a girl now because of you.\"  She thought about this for a quick moment and brought over her height to him and clothing as well.  Soon she felt weird as her height increased from her usual 4' 1\" size to Josh's 5' 10\" frame.  She also felt a shift as her clothing shifted to Josh's work attire, black pants, red shirt, and trainers.  She then looked over to Josh to see that he was now wearing her pants, blouse, and mary-jane shoes.  He also shrunk down in size too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look too cute.\"  Carly said giggling as she saw him petting himself to assess the damage that occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah.  Laugh it up.\"  Josh said to her.  \"I feel weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you look cute with your hair done up like that.\"  Kiran said to him.  \"But you're a little too hairy for a primary student though.  And I wonder what your wife will think about the entire thing?  Is she still your wife?\"  She wondered to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can always fix that in the coming rounds.\"  Zoe suggested as she looked over her now masculine arms and her smaller hands thanks to Steven and Arissia.  She looked over to Kiran, who seemed to be in heaven with her new found strength as she flexed in a mirror.  \"I guess we should start the next round.\"  Zoe suggested as she picked up the cards and got ready to deal them out for the third round.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Zoe started to hand out the cards, she noticed Josh sitting there kicking his legs back and forth freely under the table.  \"Are you doing okay over there Josh?\"  She wondered as she started to notice that he started to look somewhat like her daughter.  With her hair style, height and clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just a little weird, is all.\"  Josh said as he continued to swing his legs.  \"I mean, I haven't been this small in quite some time and these clothes.\"  He let out a big sigh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you want to sit out the next round we understand.\"  Kiran said with an approving smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's alright.  We only have a couple more rounds left anyhow.\"  Josh replied back to her.   He tried to sit up a little bit higher in order to see the table a little better, but failed in his attempt.  Carly noticed him doing this and offered to get him some books to sit on, which he painfully agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so it's my turn to go first right?\"  Zoe asked the group who all nodded.  \"Well in that case, I think I will lead off with my eyes.\"  Just then a pair of eyes, complete with eyelashes sat in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia looked at her cards for a moment and without making a face or anything said.  \"I will bet my job experience.\"  As soon as it was announced, a couple of school books appeared in front of her and Josh knew instantly who was going to be the recipient of that.  \"Mr. Josh, it's your turn.\"  She said looking down at him and smiling.  She definitely looked happier and appeared more confident with her new found height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't really do anything with these cards, so I am going to fold.\"  Josh announced as he lay his cards down.  Much to the disappointment of Arissia and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting too much for you Josh?\"  Carly wondered as she looked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just didn't have anything.\"  Josh said to her with as much assertiveness that he could muster, which was hard given his new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Liz said.  \"We trust you.  Now, I see Kiran is having a lot of fun over there, so I want to put up my groin.\"  Just then a picture of her groin popped up with a censor bar over her vagina and Kiran hoped that it wouldn't be like the last game with Jade taking it from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...  I think I will bet my interests and my favorite game.\"  Steven announced as a list appeared and his favorite video game '<i>Mass Effect 2</i>' right next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...  I think I will join Josh and fold as well.\"  Kiran announced as she followed Josh's example and folded her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much going on tonight.\"  Carly chuckled as she looked around.  \"I think I will bet my arms and my age.\"  A pair of feminine looking arms and, like before with Arissia, a cake with the number 33 appeared on it.  Zoe, not really liking where this was going, decided to follow Josh and Kiran's move and folded too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will bet what I am to my Mummy.\"  Arissia said as she looked to see if it took it.  \"Why didn't it do anything?\"  she wondered to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to bet that sweetie?\"  Zoe said as she caressed her new shorter hairstyle.  Arissia nodded to her and Zoe replied back to her.  \"Okay, you want relationship status then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I will bet my relationship status and I guess my hair too.\"  Arissia announced with great joy.  Just then another list appeared with her shorter hairstyle appeared.  Liz, seeing the new bets, decided to fold. \"Ms. Carly, are you going to fold too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really.\"  Carly announced with a smile.  \"I will call with my voice.  What do you have?\"  Arissia lay down her cards showing that she had 2 pairs, J's and 9's.  \"Not too bad, but I don't think it will beat my 3 of a kind.\"  She seemed happy that she won a round and thought about who would get what.  \"Hmm... Sorry Josh, but if Arissia is going to be working in my salon, then she will need to know what she is doing.\"  Carly then brought over the '<i>lack of' work knowledge</i>' that Arissia had and deposited it over to Josh.  Almost instantly, it seemed, Josh didn't know what it felt like to have a job, all the knowledge that he had received from Zoe was now gone. The inverse happened to Arissia, who now knew how to do everything her Mum knew.  \"And Arissia, I will give you Kiran's hairstyle, since she is now considered a man.\"  Kiran felt her head and felt her start to recede back inside as Josh's hairstyle took over.  Arissia was happy to have 'girl's' hair again, that she promptly went over to one of the work stations, much like Josh had done earlier, but this time she adopted a more adult hairstyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran looked over to Arissia and had to comment on her hairstyle.  \"You know what that actually looks good.\"  She complimented the former younger player.  \"Zoe, you sure know how to do some nice styling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kiran.\"  Zoe replied back to her.  \"You should come by when we swap back and I will see what I can do with it.\"  Carly liked hearing the compliments coming about her employee's skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe, I don't want you to hate me about these next 2 swaps.  Oh and Josh, I am about to solve your problem with your wife.\"  Carly said with a devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Josh replied back to her.  He was lost in his thoughts with the lack of knowledge he now had, but soon realized what she was talking about.  \"Geez, did I do something wrong to deserve this punishment?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but you can't be married as a 7 year old.\"  Zoe said to him.  \"Besides, I will still be worrying about Arissia, but I can always come and pick her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not too upset about me making him your daughter?\"  She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe shook her head. \"No, not at all and I think we will have fun.\"  She winked over to Josh.  \"Besides I think his blue eyes will look great on me.\"  She chuckled to her friend and former boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed and resigned to his inevitable fate as he saw Carly bring Arissia's relationships over to his avatar.  He then knew that his wife was now Arissia's and Zoe as now his Mum.  He then felt his eyes shift slightly and he had to blink.  When he opened up his eyes, he glanced over to Zoe and noticed that his eyes were now gracing her face.  \"You know what Zoe.  I have to admit, my eyes do look good on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but it's Mummy, now sweetie.\"  Zoe said with a grin and a wink.  \"But, thank you I liked them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious.\"  Josh responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take that tone with me young lady.\"  Zoe said with a grin, which made the others chuckle.  \"What are you going to do with the other things, Carly?\"  Carly looked down at her voice and arms and decided that she wanted to keep those for the time being.  \"I know Josh has a voice slightly too deep for a young 'girl', but I am going to keep my voice and arms for right now.  So you can rest easy about that, Josh.\"  She looked over at Josh, who seemed relieved that he was out of the woods for the rest of the hand.  \"Steven, I think it's time for you to branch out a little bit more.\"  Steven looked dumbstruck as Carly picked up his 'interests' and decided who to give it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Just don't give it to Arissia</i>.'  He thought to himself as he held his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Kiran will like to know what it's like to have male interests.\"  She said as she brought over his interests and favorite game over to Kiran, who seemed interested with her new interests with video games.  Steven, however, wanted to check out a sale at a shop nearby and the new lotion shop that opened at the mall nearby.  \"Steven, luv, you can't be a woman, without giving up your penis.  So, I think Liz will enjoy it as much as Kiran is right now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz felt weird as she felt something start to push out between her legs and had to adjust herself to accommodate it better in her pants.  \"Wow, that feels nice.\"  She couldn't help but say as she rubbed it to get an idea of it's size and felt it get hard.  <i>'I think I am going to enjoy this.</i>'  She thought to herself.  '<i>I wonder if Eric will enjoy it</i>.'  The thought of it seemed to make her harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and for my age, I think I would love to be younger.\"  Carly responded to the group, which seemed perk Josh up a little.  \"Not that young, Josh.\"  With that said, it seemed to deflate Josh's ambition to join the older ones.  \"But Kiran, I think I would love to try being 17 again, do you mind?\"  Kiran shook her head and Carly brought her age over to Kiran's avatar and deposited it. \"Well, I think that's everything.  How does everyone feel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small and insignificant.\"  Josh was quick to reply as he knew that nobody would want what he he had now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, sweetie it's okay.\"  Zoe said to him with a grin on her face as she saw him wince at the word 'sweetie'.  \"Do you think you will get anything that you want?\"  She inquired over to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know, but I think I will need to start thinking about filling in the gaps about who I will be for the time I am like this.\"  Josh said as he started to think about some of the traits he would give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really like what?\"  Kiran wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you will have to wait and find out when I bet them, won't you?\"  He replied back which caused her to glower at him for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you two.\"  Zoe responded to them.  \"Arissia, do you want me to shuffle the cards for you?\"  She nodded and Zoe proceeded to shuffle them and gave them back to her to hand out to the group for the next hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arissia dealt out the cards and didn't really like what she saw.  The last couple of hands that she was dealt seemed to be much better than what she had now.  \"Is everyone enjoying themselves?\"  Kiran asked the group, who all seemed surprised by the gesture.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at his cards and didn't look up as the question was asked.  \"I have to say that I'm enjoying it.\"  Zoe answered with a smile.  \"But I wish I still worked at the salon though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might still work after the night is over with.\"  Carly replied back to her with a small twinkle in her eye.  \"Well, Arissia, I do believe it's your turn to lead us off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia nodded.  \"I think I will bet my voice.  I don't think it fits a lady in her 30's.\"  With her bet placed, a piece of paper with what looked like a musical note on it was placed in front of her.  Josh knew he was going to be the one to get that even though he really didn't want it.  \"Mr. Josh it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked over to Arissia, who seemed pleased with her new height and job.  \"Tell me Arissia, are you liking the stuff you got from me?\"  He asked her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very much, I'm happy that I get to stay up late.\"  She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I will bet my physical age then, so you will know what it's like to be older.\"  Josh said as a figure morphing from baby to child then to adult sat in front of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly is that?\"  Zoe wondered to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know exactly, but I think if I give it to Arissia, I will get all her energy.\"  Josh responded back.  \"And while I am at it, I think I will bet my favorite color too.\"  A color wheel appeared next to the figure from his bet just seconds before, it was pointing to blue. \"Liz, it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz contemplated on what exactly she wanted to bet. \"Hmm... If Steven thinks it's easy to be me, then I think I will bet my relationships too.\"  A list appeared in front of her with all the relationships in her life, Mother, Father, Husband, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said it would be easy to be you.\"  Steven replied defensively.  \"I was just thinking out loud is all.  Well, since it doesn't appeal to me much anymore, I think I am going to bet my gaming skills and the earrings that I got from Carly.\"  Much to the astonishment of the others, Steven's gaming skills manifested as a video game magazine with the earrings he got from Carly sitting right next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran looked over her cards once more and frowned.  \"I don't have anything, so I am going to fold for this round.\"  She laid her cards down and looked over to Carly.  \"Did you get anything decent this round?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\"  Carly responded back to her.  \"I think I will do Zoe a favor and bet my job and work experience.\"  Just like several times before, several books and a clipboard with 'Beautician' written on it.  She then looked over to Zoe, who was speechless.  \"That way you can be with your daughter and work together.  I don't mind taking a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will do that for me?\"  Zoe asked her friend and former employer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it will be nice to get away and I can talk to Steven and Liz.\"  Carly replied back to her.  \"Besides, it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have anything, so I am going to fold too.\"  Zoe said as she laid down her cards.  \"What about you, Arissia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like her Mum, Arissia looked at her cards.  \"I don't think I have anything either, mummy.\"  She then proceeded to lay her cards down too.  Josh quickly followed suit and folded too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you guys, but I'm going to keep going.\"  Liz said with a smile.  \"I will add my height and my name too.\"  Added to her relationship, a tape measure with the measurement of  5' 4\" and a paper '<i>Hi, My Name is..</i>.' next to it.  This seemed too much for the others and Kiran, Steven, and Carly all folded their hands too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you won this one.\"  Josh said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and I am happy for it too.\"  Liz responded back to him.  \"Now, let's see what we have here.\"  Liz looked over the spoils that migrated over to her when everyone folded their hands, leaving her the winner of the hand.  \"Steven, I think I will take your height.\"  She brought her height over to Steven and noticed him fidgeting slightly.  \"It won't be too bad.\"  She said as she gave him her height.  Almost instantly she started to grow 8\" to Steven's former height of 6' tall.  \"I think I am going to like this.\"  Liz responded as she looked at how much smaller everything seemed to be compared to before.  \"I think I'm taller than Eric now.  Speaking of Eric, that gives me an idea\"  She then picked up her relationship and dragged it over to Steven.  \"Let's see if you think it's easy to live with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said it would be easy.\"  Steven said with Liz's voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's too late now.\"  Liz responded to him.  \"Hmm... I think Kiran will enjoy your gaming skills, but I think you will keep Carly's earrings.\"  Before, Steven had a lot of knowledge of all the different games on the market and how to beat them all, but now they all escaped him.  He'd heard of Mario, but didn't really know it worked or how the game played out.  \"Zoe, I think I will give you Carly's job and work experience, since she gave her consent for you to have it.\"  She brought over Carly job and work experience over to Zoe who was now the owner and lead beautician of the salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does that mean that I work with my Mummy?\"  Arissia wondered as she looked over to Liz.  Liz nodded and Arissia was clearly happy.  \"Yay, we are going to have so much fun.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I think your voice does need to be more adult.\"  Liz said as she brought Arissia's voice over to Kiran and deposited it.  \"Hmm... Josh, I will give your bet of physical age to Arissia.\"  Liz watched in wonder as his skin firmed up slightly, but what really shocked her was when he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank...\"  Josh started to say, but stopped suddenly.  His voice was higher and it seemed more girly.  \"What happened?\"  he asked as he brought his hands up to his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I think since you have my gender, the game made it seem that you're now a young girl.\"  Kiran hypothesized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this.\"  Josh said as he put his smaller hands up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz seemed to interrupt his despair with the next bet.  \"Josh, I think I will give your favorite color over to Kiran.\"  Josh saw her drop it over to Kiran and thought about his favorite color.  \"So what is it now?\"  She wondered as she looked at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought hard about his favorite color and it came to pink.  \"Really Kiran, you couldn't think outside the box for a different color?\"  He practically yelled, which seemed shrill with his higher voice.  This caused the group to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why what is it now?\"  Carly asked as she tried to keep from laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed slightly as he lightly muttered his favorite color.  \"Pink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked at him and Zoe was the one to speak up.  \"I'm sorry, we didn't hear that?\"  She said with her hand near her ear to emphasize the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pink.  My new favorite color is Pink.\"  Josh says as he sulked slightly in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not too bad.\"  Zoe answered.  \"Besides, since you will be staying in Arissisa's room, you will enjoy it.  It's everywhere in there.\"  Hearing this, Josh seemed to have a slight giddiness inside him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I need to use the restroom.\"  Josh replied as he got up.  \"So wait for me and I don't want you guys playing a round without me.\"  Josh proceeded to the bathroom and sat down on the toilet and emptied his bladder.  Not wanting to hear it when he walked out, he wiped to make sure it was all dry before he pulled up his new pants.  He also took this opportunity to look in the mirror.  He was amazed at what he now looked like.  His eyes were no longer blue, but instead a hazel color and it looked like he was younger.  Well, this was expected because of the physical age he got from Arissia.  \"This is definitely going to be an interesting 2 days.\"  Josh said to himself as he made his way back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back.\"  Kiran said.  \"It does look like we have enough time for one more hand.\"  Kiran said as she gave the cards to Josh so that he could give them a good shuffle and dealt them out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh started to deal out the cards and actually had a chance to get a look at Arissia and what the physical age swap did to her.  She had slight crows feet appearing under her eyes and her chest seemed to be bigger, it looked like a B-Cup.  It was as if she actually went through puberty without the hardships that would normally come with it.  He then looked at his cards.  \"Josh, I know this is the last hand of the night, but we need to get it going.\"  Zoe said to him.  \"I don't want you to be cranky tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be cranky.\"  He replied defendingly while crossing his arms across his chest.  \"Fine, I will bet my name.\"  Just like with Liz, a paper name tag with '<i>Hi! My Name is...</i>' appeared in front of him.  \"There, now we can get it going.\"  Josh said over to Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked down at her hand, not wanting to get involved with what was brewing with Josh and Zoe.  \"I think I will bet my hair.\"  She proudly announced as her shoulder length, dirty blonde hair appeared in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked at his cards.  \"I think I will bet my computer.\"  He said somewhat willingly.  He was willing, due to his new interests from Kiran.  He now seemed more interested in some games on his phone more than on a console or computer.  '<i>I won't miss them too much.</i>'  Steven thought to himself.  '<i>Besides, I have some nice sales to check out, that will keep me busy</i>.'  \"Um, Kiran  I think it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and double checked her cards.  \"I don't think I have the winning combination.\"  Kiran said as she folded and put her cards down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will bet my chest.\"  Carly announced to the group.  Her impressive C-cups were now on full display, with the nipples censored out.  \"So Zoe, do you have anything to add?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was still at a loss with what had transpired the last round.  The last thing she expected to happen was Carly to give up her job and knowledge for her.  It was almost enough to make her tear up, but not quite, she had to keep her makeup in check after all.  \"I think I will bet my taste in books.\"  She said to the group as an array of romance books appeared in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you gave those up, luv?\"  Carly replied slyly as she looked at her bet in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I did... mostly.\"  Zoe responded.  \"But, I recently started it up again.  Arissia, I do believe it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, mum.\"  Arissia replied back to her.  \"I think I will fold too.  I don't have anything either.  Josh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...?\"  Josh looked up at Arissia.  \"Oh, I think I bet my interests too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you resigned to your fate?\"  Steven said wryly as he looked over at Josh who didn't really miss a beat in responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really.\"  Josh responded.  \"I just wanted try something new for the next couple of days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\"  Arissia said abruptly.  \"I thought this was permanent.\"  The look on Josh's face was priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no.\"  Josh practically yelled while waving his arms.  \"As long as we have all the cards, we can swap back, thankfully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, don't you like being so little?\"  Zoe wondered over to her new daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say, I like being tall.  I can live being a woman or everyone thinking I am a woman, but being so small is what I'm not liking.\"  Josh responded back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz finally spoke up.  \"Can we finish the last round?\"  Everyone nodded and Liz responded by placing her bet.  \"I think I will bet my earrings.\"  Her small studs appeared right next to her hair. \"And while I am at it I think I will bet my life too.\"  Just then, what looked like her soul appeared right in front.  Everyone seemed overwhelmed by the amount they would have to put in to keep us and promptly folded.  \"And that is how you do it.\"  She replied to the group.  \"I think I am going to keep my life and earrings.\"  She brought those traits back over to her avatar and placed them there.  \"Steven, do you have a suggestion on who to give your computer to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked confused for a moment and didn't know.  \"Not really, but I think Kiran will like it more than I will right now.\"  He motioned over to Kiran, who looked like she wanted it.  Not really wanting it, but it seemed needing it.  She nodded, as if to say, that she wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then.\"  Liz said as she brought it over to her and she seemed ecstatic over it.  \"Now we have the chest of Carly, and Steven, I think you need them.\"  She brought over the forms and deposited onto Steven.  He looked down and watched his chest slowly inflate until his chest now resembled Carly's natural, busty C-cups.  Liz looked at Steven for a moment and brought her fingers up to her mouth.  \"I'm missing something.\"  She looked at him for a moment.  \"I know, I think you need a nice hairdo.\"  She brought over her hairstyle and dropped it on Steven's character.  As she did this, she felt her hair recede back into her head until it reached Steven's more closely cropped hairstyle.  She glanced over to Steven and noticed him trying to keep it out of his face.  It appeared that when her hair receded back into her head it dropped her scrunchie that she was using on the ground.  She bent over and picked it up and tossed it over to Zoe.  \"Would you mind helping him out with his new hair while I finish up handing out the bets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, luv.\"  Zoe replied back curtly.   She made her way over and grabbed a hair tie from one of the drawers and started to work on Steven's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so Zoe, I am going to give your book preferences to Carly.\"  Liz said as brought it over to Carly's character and dropped it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess.\"  Carly replied back to her.  \"I guess I will need something to occupy my time in the tea room.\"  Zoe and Steven chuckled at this while Zoe finished his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, I think I will keep my earrings.\"  Liz said as she brought it back over to her character.  \"Now, let's see here.\"  She looked at the last 2 items left on the table.  \"Josh's name and interests.  I am going to be nice and let you pick your name.\"  She looked over at Josh.  \"So who will it be?\"  Josh looked around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pick Carly.\"  Josh replied to her.  \"She has my work experience and job, so it's only fitting that I take her name.\"  He chuckled at the thought of being called another name besides his own.  He watched as Liz brought over his name over to Carly and dropped it off.  \"So what about the interests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about that.\"  Liz said as she looked down at the table.  \"Well, we can't have Arissia freaking out when a lady who looks like a princess walks in or get excited over some small thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  Josh said as he resigned to his fate, much like Steven referred to earlier.  \"I understand, I mean, this is a learning experience, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm glad you're not throwing a fit.\"  Liz responded to him.  She brought over his interests over to Arissia and dropped them off.  \"Well that's it for tonight.  Arissia, do you mind gathering up all the cards and putting them back in the box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all.\"  She replied as she saw all the others go to the mirrors to check to see how they changed.  <i>'Now's my chance.  Josh said that as long as all the cards are here, we can change back.  So all I have to do is take one of the cards and hide it somewhere and we can change back when I want.</i>'  She thought to herself as she picked up one of the cards and quietly slipped it in her back pocket.  She then placed the remainder of the cards back in the box and handed it back to Kiran.  \"Here you go Kiran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Arissia.\"  She thanked as she grabbed the box from her and put it in the bag that she brought with her.  \"So, Suki will be back in 5 days.  So I think we can stay this way for let's say 4 days?\"  Majority of the group approved, but Josh and Steven were the only ones that didn't want to do it that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have class tomorrow?\"  Josh wondered over to Zoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded,  \"So we need to get a move on and get you home so that you can get a bath and go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia was checking out her new reflection when she felt a buzzing coming from her pocket.  She reached in and found her new mobile, which originally belonged to Josh.  \"Who is Marcie?\"  She wondered to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh chuckled slightly as he was gathering up his items.  \"She is your new wife and it looks like she is outside waiting for you.\"  He pointed out the window to a small SUV with a lady waving to Arissia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I gotta go.\"  She said to the group.  \"I guess I will see you tomorrow, mummy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, until we change back I need you to call me Zoe, okay?\"  She inquired to her.  She nodded in agreement as she waved good bye to the group and made her way out the door and into the car with the extra card still in her back pocket.  \"As for you.\"  She turned to Josh.  \"You will need to call my mummy until we change back.\"  Josh begrudgingly nodded. \"Alright everyone, I need to lock up for the night.\"  She announced as she looked to the group.  All seemed to understand as they gathered up their belongings and made their way to the door and their new lives for the next several days.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Zoe locked the shop up for the night, Josh waved everyone good bye.  They all seemed to be interested with the traits that they gained from each other.  Steven was engrossed in his phone with some app that he found, Kiran was interested in getting home to see what she could play for the night, and LIz made her way to Steven's apartment to have some time to herself.  \"Alright, Josh.\"  Zoe announced from behind him.  \"All locked up and now we can head out.\"  She leaned down slightly and out of instinct, grabbed his hand to help guide him to ensure he didn't get too far away from her.  \"The car should be right over here.\"  She pointed to a nearby parking lot, which a small compact car was parked.  \"Here we are.\"  She clicked the button on the keys to unlock it and opened the back door for Josh to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to sit on that?\"  Josh wondered as he looked at the princess booster seat that sat in the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sweetie.\"  Zoe replied as she easily picked Josh up and put him in the seat.  And what seemed like a few seconds, he was buckled in and ready to go.  As she got in the driver's seat she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Zoe?\"  Josh wondered.  \"I heard you sigh.  Are you okay with this whole swapping thing?\"  Zoe started up the car and navigated to the roadway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am.\"  Zoe answered.  \"It's just different.  I don't know if this is all worth it, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but how would we know how the others live.\"  He stated as he watched the buildings pass.  \"Take Liz for example.  She got her chest swapped out with Kiran, so she will won't have back pain for next several days.  Kiran, on the other hand, will now know what big breasted women will have to go through, plus she is now classified as a man now too.  I wonder how that is going to work out.\"  He chuckled to himself just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe couldn't help but chuckle too.  \"Yeah, I guess I got off lightly, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did, Steven and I on the other hand.\"  Josh looked down at his transformed body and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it won't be too bad and we will have fun too.\"  She said as she turned left down another road.  \"Just do me a favor and try to play along with my husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\"  Josh said as he yawned.  As he continued to watch the buildings pass, he felt a wave of drowsiness pass over him and couldn't help but fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***  <b>Checking in with Steven</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven had a worried look on his face as he got out of Liz's car at his new home for the next several days.  '<i>You can do this, Steven.</i>'  He thought to himself as if trying to psych himself up.  He rummaged through his pockets to find the key that will lead to his new life.  He soon found it and unlocked the door to find Eric coming around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Stevie.\"  He said as he helped Steven get his jacket.  \"How was your night?  I hope they didn't run you too ragged.\"  He took his jacket and started to hang it up in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it wasn't too bad.\"  Steven replied back with Liz's voice.  \"I think I just need to sit down and relax for a moment or two.\"  He then made his way to the bedroom and changed into something a little more comfortable, a pair of old pajama pants and a T-Shirt.  As he made his way over to the couch, Eric motioned for him to come closer.  He did as he was asked and sat next to him, and he seemed so small compared to him, thanks to Liz's height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we have a seat and watch a movie.\"  Eric suggested as he turned on a movie and grabbed a blanket.  Together they sat on the couch and watched the movie.  As the movie started, Steven found himself leaning on Eric's shoulder and soon found his arm wrapped around him.  He felt so safe in his embrace, almost as if nothing could harm him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing what was happening, Steven sat up quickly and shook his head and felt his longer hair hit his face.  '<i>What's going on?</i>'  He thought to himself.  '<i>With Kiran's interests, do I now find men attractive?</i>'  He was soon brought out of his thoughts by Eric asking him if anything was wrong.  He turned to Eric.  \"No, not at all.  I just thought I forgot to do something back at the store.\"  He lied and laid back down on Eric shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Meanwhile with Arissia</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she got in the car with Josh's wife, Arissia was taken aback at how she looked.  Even though she was 5' 2\" tall, Marcie was a ball of energy that few could stop.  Her reddish hair and beautiful face, she seemed wonderful.  \"Sooo... How was your night, honey?\"  She asked her new spouse, not really knowing that an hour before, she was a 7 year old child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was different.\"  Arissia replied back with a smile.  \"Do you know anything different about me?\"  Marcie took a moment at a red light to look over to her, to take her in and see if she could spot what was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do something different with your hair?\"  She asked as she brought her attention back to the road and proceeded down the road.  \"Did Zoe help you with it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia smiled as she realized that she didn't notice a thing.  \"Yeah, do you like it.\"  Marcie nodded.  \"Zoe helped me style it differently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it looks nice on you.\"  Marcie said with a grin.  \"So I guess you weren't too busy tonight, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia shook her head.  \"No not at all, a couple manicures and a wax.  That was it.\"  Arissia was surprised to know how to do all those in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, perhaps you can help me out with a new style when we get home.\"  Marcie asked as they turned down another road.  \"Why should I be married to a hairstylist, if I don't get some treatments at home.\"  She chuckled at her little joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Back with Josh and Zoe</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked in the rear view mirror to see Josh passed out in his booster seat.  She took a minute to think about all that happened.  Sure according to everyone else, he was now considered her 7 year old daughter named Carly.  But to her, he was Josh, a poor guy that got too caught up in a game of poker.  Soon they found their way to the small bungalow that she and her family called home.  As she pulled in the driveway, Josh woke up from his slumber in the back seat and asked.  \"Where are we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're home.\"  Zoe announced as she got out of the car.  She went over and opened Josh's door for him and helped him out of the car.  \"Don't forget Arissia's, I mean, your stuff.\"  She pointed to the bag that was sitting nearby.  He nodded as he grabbed it and put in on, taking care not to get his hair caught up in the straps.  They made their way up the steps and opened the door.  \"Now, I need you to get ready for a ba...\"  She was soon interrupted by Chris, her husband walking out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are my girls.\"  He said with a smile as he knelt down with his arms open.  He sat there for a moment as if he was waiting for something and Josh knew what he was waiting for.  Josh ran over to him with his arms open to and soon found him in his embrace.  \"I hope you were good for your Mum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was Daddy.\"  He replied as he tried to keep the nausea that he felt about the entire thing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that you were good for her.\"  He said.  \"Now, I do believe your in need of a bath.\"  He then swatted his bum as if to say, 'Hey time to get going.'  Josh nodded and followed Zoe to the bathroom to get clean.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carly felt odd going back home for the night.  She was now considered a 17 year old with everyone around her.  She pulled into the parking lot of the flat that she was renting out since her divorce from the previous year.  It had been a nasty one and even though there weren't any kids involved, she was glad that her friends were there for her.  Without them, she didn't know where she would be now.  She took out her key for her door and unlocked it and noticed that her neighbor Mrs. Johanson was coming out.  \"Hey there Josh.\"  She greeted Carly.  \"Just now getting home?\"  Carly nodded.  \"Must have been a long night, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you have no idea.\"  Carly replied back to her. She waved her good bye as she closed the door and locked it behind her.  Letting out a sigh, she quickly got comfortable.  She made her way over to her bedroom and immediately noticed a bookshelf that wasn't there when she left this morning.  With great curiosity, she made her way over to it and noticed several shelves filled with romance, pirates, and many shirtless men.  She pulled one out at random and looked at the cover and instantly felt something deep inside her stir, almost a yearning to read it and learn about the muscular man that was on the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put down the book on the sofa, for later on and made her way back to the bedroom to finish slipping into something more comfortable.  Taking off her shirt, the first thing that she noticed was the fact that her chest was now indeed 'flat as a board' and found that it was hairier.  \"It must be from Steven.\"  She said to herself as she finished getting ready.  She quickly got ready and made her way back over to the sofa, so she can check out the book that she left there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***  <b>Kiran</b> ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she left the salon, Kiran knew she made a mistake.  Her larger breasts were now starting to hurt her back, she started to rub them to see what she was in for and instantly remembered something from earlier in the night.  Josh's, or rather her penis started to get erect, slowly start to rise as she rubbed her breast.  \"I think I better stop.\"  Kiran said as she heard a car horn honk from behind her.  She turned to see her Mom pulling up.  And like in true motherly fashion, was waving.  Embarrassed and attempting to cover her face, Kiran made her way over to the car and got in.  \"Mum, do you have to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to her and was smiling.  \"Awe, what's wrong, I can't embarrass my Lil' Man?\"  Kiran was at a loss over the entire thing.  She knew her Mom was only 38 years old and with her new age, courtesy of Carly, she should of had her when she was 5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mum.\"  Kiran asked.  Her mom turned to her and had the look of 'Yes?', clearly written on her face.  \"How old were you when I was born?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, honey.\"  Her mom replied back with complete sincerity.  \"We already told you, we adopted you.  You were always coming around and you never really knew your parents.  Well, one thing led to another and John and I decided to adopt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>The way the cards work certainly are weird.  Re-writing history to better fit the swaps</i>.'  Kiran thought to herself.  Then she remembered, she brought her hands up to her chest and felt the breasts that she acquired from Liz and remembered what her mom said.  '<i>Hey Lil' Man</i>.'  \"I should have planned it better.\"  She muttered to herself so that her mom wouldn't hear her.  She finally realized that the world now sees her as a man.  A man with an impressive bust on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Liz</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz got the information from Steven on where he lived.  She got in her car and made her way to her new place for the next 4 days.  As she started to put on her seat belt, Liz noticed that her back wasn't really hurting as much as it usually does at this time of the night.  She brought her hands up to her now much smaller chest and realized that the reason why her back wasn't really hurting her as much was because of how she now has Kiran's smaller bust.  Soon she found her way to the location that Steven gave her and noticed that it wasn't too far from the store.  \"I guess that's why Steven is always on time.\"  She said to herself chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way up the flight of stairs and soon found herself at the door that would grant her access to her new home.  Liz sighed as she unlocked the door and as she opened it, she said quietly to herself. \"At least, i can treat this as a break from Eric.  He certainly has been more handsy lately.  As she looked around her new flat, she noticed that several of her favorite magazines followed her over to her new place.  She quickly got some of her night clothes on and made her way over to the sofa to relax for a bit and to catch up on some celebrity gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Arissia</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia and Marcie had found their way home.  As Marcie was getting ready for the night, Arissia took the card out of her back pocket and quickly put it in a book.  She really didn't catch the name of the book that she put the card in, but it was by some author named Steven King, whoever he is.  As she looked around the home that she now shared with Josh's wife, Arissia started to notice some things.  First, the game system that she won from him was already hooked up and ready to go.  Secondly, she had to fight the urge to start it up and play a couple games.  True, her Uncle had a game system, but she though that only boys played video games and her mum said that it was certainly unladylike for her to play one.  Then just over an hour ago, she won it from Josh and she had the urge to start playing it.  '<i>It must be from the Interests that I got from Josh</i>.'  She thought to herself as she made her way to find Marcie and get ready for the night too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her clothes and noticed that her clothes were still Josh's and she might have to pick something up to match what Ms. Carly and her mum wears during work hours.  Arissia turned the corner and found her new wife holding a bag from a local department store.  \"I got these for you today.\"  Marcie said tossing her the bag filled with some clothes.  \"I don't know why you never really had any woman underwear, but I decided it's time that you start wearing them.  And I took the liberty to pick you up and new uniform too.\"  Arissia looked in the bag and noticed that it indeed held a pair of skinny jeans, a nice skirt, and some random underwear for her to try out.  \"Well, we better get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia looked at her with an inquisitive look.  \"Ready for what?\"  She wondered to her new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you would watch a movie with me again.\"  Marcie said with a slight grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\"  Arissia replied innocently as she looked around for something to wear and decided to wear a pair of pajama pants and a T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Josh</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had taken his bath and was surprised to find out how much more fun it really was than taking a shower.  Of course, he was now smaller in size and could fit much better in the tub.  But he seemed to be more interested in the fact that he could move around and play.  Thinking back on it, the physical age that he got from her certainly did give him her energy.  That would certainly explain why he fell asleep in the car on the way back home.  He pulled the pink towel closer to his smaller body and made his way out to the living room.  \"Jo...  I mean, Carly, sweetie, your clothes are on the sofa.  After you get dressed, I want you to come over so that I can brush your hair out and fix it so that it won't be so unruly in the morning.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around and found his way to the living room and found a small bundle of clothes sitting on the sofa.  He looked at them and noticed that there was a night gown with a princess on it and a pair of knickers.  \"Great, I should have guessed.\"  Josh said to himself quietly.  He did as he was told and got dressed.  He slid the knickers up his legs and put on the night gown.  As he looked down at himself, he knew this was going to be an interesting few days, especially with him going back to primary school tomorrow.  Still playing the part he went to go find Zoe who doing some last minute things and replied to her.  \"Okay, mummy.  I'm ready for you, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was fast, usually it takes Arissia several minutes to get ready.\"  Zoe answered back to him with a smile.  She grabbed a hair brush and made her way over to the sofa and had Josh sit in front of her.  She picked up a remote and turned on a cartoon show for Josh to watch as she went to work on his hair.  As she was brushing his hair, Zoe found several knots and had to get them out, which caused Josh to wince in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\"  Josh cried as he instinctively pulled away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you would take better care of that hair, then it would be like this.\"  Zoe retorted back to him.  \"Now stay still.  I am almost done.\"  She continued to brush his hair and quickly finished.  She started to braid it to match what it looked like when he did it earlier that night.  She looked down at Josh to tell him that she was done, but noticed that he was now engrossed in the show that was now on the television.  She looked up to see what show it was and noticed that it was one of the Disney princess shows.  \"Josh, I'm done.\"  She whispered in his ear.  \"Do you like this show, normally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head as he continued to watch it.  \"Do you know what it is?  I've never really seen this one.\"  He asked as he got more comfortable on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's <i>Sofia the First</i>, I know it's one of Arissia's favorites too.\"  Zoe replied back to him.  \"I think when you got your interests with her, you got her favorite stuff.\"  She concluded as she picked up the remote and turned it off.  \"Besides, I think it's your bedtime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe.\"  Josh said as he pouted.  \"I want to stay up later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you have school tomorrow.\"  She said as she showed him his new bedroom. </span></div></div>",

As they walked in, Josh was overwhelmed with all the pinks and purples that were surrounding him.  He noticed that he had to walk around several items that were strewn across the floor, a couple dolls, a princess dress, and what looked like a tiara, too.  \"She isn't very tidy is she?\"  Josh asked Zoe as he gestured around to the items that he found on the floor. To make things worse, he felt a need to pick them up and play with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she isn't.  But what do you really expect with a rambunctious 7 year old.\"  Zoe replied back to him.  \"But if you feel like helping me out, you can clean up in here.\"  She pulled back the blankets on the bed and motioned for Josh to climb in.  He did as he was told and climbed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, I can help you out, since you're letting me stay here and everything.\"  Josh said while he tried to stifle a yawn. \"I think I got her sleep patterns, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it makes sense.\"  Zoe answered him.  \"I mean you got her physical age and that would mean that you have her waking and sleeping patterns too.\"  She looked down at Josh and saw him nod sleepily.  She left the room and closed the door slightly, almost as if on she was on autopilot and Arissia was still in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Arissia</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia was frightened and scared, as they watched the movie that Marcie picked.  Of course unbeknownst to Arissia, Marcie was a horror movie fanatic and practically had to drag Josh to watch them with her.  Being from a somewhat sheltered household, she had to call her Mum to tell her everything would be okay.  \"Um... I will be back in a minute.\"  Arissia told Marcie.  \"I just remembered that I have to talk to Zoe about something for tomorrow.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie looked disappointed, but she understood.  \"Go ahead, do you want me to pause it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's alright.\"  Arissia answered her as she waved her hand.  \"I will be right back.\"  She got out Josh's cell phone and made her way outside to keep the phone call somewhat private.  She dialed her Mom's cell number and after a few digital rings there was an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"  Zoe answered.  \"This is Zoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mummy?\"  Arissia said to her mom on the other side of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arissia?  What's wrong?\"  Zoe asked somewhat startled at her daughter, or rather now her co-worker, had called her. \"Is Josh's wife being mean to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing really.\"  Arissia lied.  \"Josh's wife is really nice and she had me watch a movie with her.\"  She went on to tell how the movie was scary and she didn't really know how to react to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just excuse yourself and go do something else.\"  Zoe answered.  \"I mean, you have his interests now.  So go play a video game or whatever he likes to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right.\"  Arissia replied back to her.  \"That does sound like fun.\"  Just the thought of it seemed to call out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now just don't stay up too late, okay?\"  Zoe asked.  \"Josh is already asleep.\"  The both of them laughed with the thought of him sleeping at such an early time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I won't and I guess I will see you tomorrow.\"  Arissia chuckled as she said good bye and hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Back with Zoe</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe just got of the phone with Arissia and wasn't really surprised to hear that she was still up.  \"I'm glad to hear that she's having fun, somewhat.\"  She couldn't believe that she sat through a scary movie, even if it was for a short bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\"  Chris wondered as he came out of the kitchen with a bag of popcorn.  He sat down on the sofa and switched the television on and started to watch one of his favorite shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe turned to him as she put her phone back in her bag and wondered how everything will work out.  \"Oh that was Arissia.\"  She replied back to him and noticed no shock coming across his face or him thinking that something was amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the lady that you work with at the salon?\"  He wondered as he put some of his late night snack into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she had a question on some new techniques.\"  She lied back to him.  He nodded as if to say, '<i>Oh, I don't really care.</i>'  She made her way over to the sofa to sit down next to Chris.  As she was getting comfortable, she heard her phone start to ring again.  She got up to answer it.  \"Hello?  This is Zoe.\"  She sat in the kitchen and talked on the phone for several minutes.  She made her way back into the Living room and sat down next to Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?  Arissia again?\"  He wondered as he changed the channel to find something better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head.  \"No.  Apparently there is a flu outbreak and they are going cancelling school for the next several days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to take Carly to work with me?\"  Chris wondered.  \"I don't think my boss will mind too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  It will be okay.\"  Zoe replied back to him  \"I don't mind it, I think she will like it better at the salon.\"  Zoe wanted to say '<i>He</i>' but quickly caught herself, not wanting Chris to think she was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you say so.\"  Chris said as he looked to his wife.  \"But it she gets too out of control, let me know and I will come and get her.  Okay.\"  He gave her a quick peck on the cheek and got up to clean up his mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, but I think I will be okay.\"  Zoe responded.  \"I mean, what girl doesn't like to spend the day at a salon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\"  Chris said as he bet down to give is wife another kiss.  \"I'm going to go to bed.  You coming too?\"  Zoe nodded as she made her way with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was fast asleep and couldn't help but dream.  He was walking around Wilko's asking people if they needed some help in finding something.  Everybody seemed so tall and intimidating.  \"Ma'am, the stationary is over there next to the pens and pencils.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older lady looked down at Josh with his hair in pig tails and a yellow dress.  \"Well aren't you a cutie?  Where's your mummy?\"  She asked as she looked around the store, but Josh looked back up at her and seemed mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, I do work here.\"  Josh replied back with an authoritative tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is a hard candy.\"  She said as she gave Josh a wrapped candy.  \"Do you need help finding your mum?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head.  \"No lady.\"  He said as he turned and waled off with his shoes clicking as he went.  As he walked he noticed a poster for the new video game.  He stopped to look at it on the way out, but he didn't seem to like it.  '<i>A nice coloring book would do great</i>.'  He thought to himself and found a nice princess one for \u00a31.  Josh paid for it and made his way back over to the salon, ready to start the activities in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>The next morning</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe made her way into Arissia's room to wake Josh for his day.  As if on autopilot, she laid out some clothes.  \"Josh, it's time to wake up.\"  She watched as he stirred and just like Arissia did, he fell back asleep, not wanting to get up for the day.  Zoe, knowing what to do, yanked the blankets off of the bed and told him to wake up.  \"You have a busy day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to stir once more and as he did he noticed something tickling his face.  His eyes opened wide as he sat straight up, feeling his braided hair hitting his back as he did.  \"It wasn't a dream was it?\"  He said with his higher voice?  Zoe shook her head.  \"So I do have to go to her school today.\"  He looked crestfallen, but noticed that Zoe again shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it appears that there is a flu outbreak and they are going to cancel school for the next several days to make sure it dies down.\"  She answered him and he seemed to be happy.  \"But, since you are 7, I will need you to go with me to the salon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can deal with that.\"  He said as he started to get up for the day.  He looked around and noticed a yellow sundress was laid out.  \"What's that?\"  He asked as he pointed to the piece of clothing, as if it was going to bite him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe couldn't help but chuckle.  \"That is what you will be wearing today.  Now, let's go, I have to open the shop in 20 minutes and I still have to set up everything.  I don't have the time to help you find something else, besides it is a learning experience, right?\"  She winked at him and Josh knew he should have chosen a new set of words last night.  He begrudgingly accepted, got dressed and interested in what he would be wearing today. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Strangely enough, he didn't have the answers for any of them. The dream grew blurier and all of a sudden Steven's eyes flickered open. He took a deep breath and brushed the long, dirty blonde hair from his face before rolling over onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick reach up to his chest confirmed that it wasn't a dream. He cupped Carly's former breasts in his hands and gave them a squeeze. A slight, feminine moan (in Liz's voice) left his new lips and he became aware of the 'empty' feeling between his legs. His 'morning wood' wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the first things on his mind oddly enough was getting to work on time that morning. All he could think was that arriving late for work would set a bad example to 'his' staff members. <i>Guess I really do have Liz's job and work ethic.</i> Steven sighed, as he kept fondling his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was movement in the bed beside him, and Steven turned his head to see Liz's husband laying there. <i>Oh right, yeah...</i> Steven muttered, biting his bottom lip for a second. He was married to Eric now. And strangely enough, as he remembered spending last night in Eric's arms, he didn't really mind that fact. In fact Steven's eyes wandered down Eric's covered form and down to his crotch to see if he could see a bulge in the sheets. <i>Stop it!</i> Steven shook his head, whispering to himself as he threw the bed sheets back and looked down at his altered body. He had Liz's height and vagina, Carly's breasts, Zoe's arms and Kiran's physical build (muscles), among other things. \"Ooh boy!\" Steven mumbled, slowly swinging his legs out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning honey.\" Eric's voice sounded out as Steven was about to leave the room to head to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... hey babes.\" Steven replied instinctively, using the word Liz normally used to refer to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up early.\" Eric commented, noticing the time was only 7:03am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven smiled, as he stood in the doorway naked... and not minding Eric see his mis-matched body.  \"Yeah, had a weird dream that woke me up. No big deal.\" he shrugged at Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, soon as you're done in the bathroom, come back to bed for a bit.\" Eric winked, patting the still warm bed beside him. Steven couldn't believe he was finding a man... and an older man at that... so attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My shift starts at 9:00am babes.\" Steven smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plenty of time.\" Eric dismissed the concerns of who he now saw as his 'wife'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" Steven winked back to Eric, before blowing him a kiss and walking into the bathroom. Steven looked down admiringly at his breasts as they jiggled with each step he took. He particularly took note of the tattoo of a rose on his left breast.. as if he needed confirmation that they were Carly's tits. Steven was feeling horny, as indicated by the growing 'wetness' between his legs. He at least knew his (Liz's) vagina was functioning properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just knew this was going to be an .interesting' day...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"center\">***   <b>Kiran</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran began to stir after her adventurous night.  She was able to procure the one thing she was wanting, but seemed to gain some others too.  Kiran woke up suddenly and sat straight up, causing her new chest to bounce in the process.  She winced as she brought her hand up to soothe the pain as much as she could, but soon noticed that her first acquisition began to spring to life.  Since she was playing some games last night, she forgot to check it out.  Taking care, she got out of bed and made her way to the bathroom to get ready for a shower and began to strip.  Soon, Kiran was standing naked in front of the mirror to check out her new reflection.  The first thing that she wanted to see was her new groin and she was certainly impressed at it's size.  Even though it was because she was a petite woman, it looked absolutely huge on her.  \"I knew I chose wisely when I picked him.\"  She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still remained at her normal height, but now had a lot more muscle to get her job done.  \"I don't look too bad.\"  Kiran said to herself as she continued to look, but soon realized that she needed to get ready for work, before Liz said something.  \"Wait, not Liz, but Steven.\"  She said correcting herself as she leaned over the tub to start up the shower.  Soon the shower was warm enough for to to get in and she quickly grabbed the soap and started to build up a lather and started to experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***  <b> Arissia</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia wasn't able to sleep well the night before, a mixture of sleeping in a different bed and watching that movie with Marcie, certainly played their part.  She stirred, but was soon held in place as Marcie wrapped her arm around her.  \"Not yet.\"  She replied sleepily.  \"I still have 30 minutes before I have to get up.\"  She nudged her way closer to Arissia.  Blushing and slightly embarrassed, Arissia didn't seem to mind.  She felt comfortable with the arms wrapped around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over to the clock that was on the night stand and quickly woke up.  \"You might have 30 minutes, but I have to be at work in 30.\"  She replied as she started to get up but froze.  'How did I know that?'  She thought to herself as she made her way to the bathroom to start to get ready.  As she entered, she noticed herself in the mirror and was shocked at what she saw.  Arissia was in such a hurry last night that she wasn't really able.  Looking in the mirror, she noticed Kiran's long brown hair framing her face and she had slight wrinkles around her eyes.  Then looking down, she noticed her new breasts.  Although they weren't very big as big as her mum's, but they were certainly new to her.  \"I know one thing, I like being tall.\"  She said to herself as she reached up and was able to touch the ceiling. \"I think I will need to talk to mum about that.\"  She said after noticing all the hair that seem to spring up on her body over night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you sure that you still want to go into work?\"  Marcie asked as she wrapped her arms around Arissia and massaging her breast.  Arissia was shocked at the feeling that were coursing through her, the touch seemed to radiate through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know.\"  She stuttered as she moved away from her touch so that she could compose herself.  \"I need to get in the shower.\"  She leaned over the tub so that she could start running the water.  \"I think we can come back to this tonight.  Zoe is going to be here soon to pick me up.\"  Not wanting to make her mad at her or Josh, Arissia decided to play it safe and tell her later on.  As she looked over to Marcie and noticed that she seemed not as disappointed as she would have thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Carly </b>  ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly lay awake in her bed and continued to read the book that she started last night.  She was tired, but didn't really want to put down the book as it was starting to get steamy.  \"Now I can see why Zoe enjoys these so much.\"  An alarm started to go off and Carly groaned.  She put down her book and turned off the alarm.  \"It's time already?\"  She groaned.  She had set the alarm just in case she got too engrossed and she was glad that she did.  Zoe always seemed to get too far into her books sometimes and Carly would get frustrated.  She had got so frustrated at one point that she banned the books in her shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I better get going.\"  Carly said to herself as she stretched.  \"I would hate to be late on my first day.\"  She made her way to the bathroom and started her normal morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Liz</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in a while, Liz was able to get a decent night's sleep.  Eric was always trying to push her for sex and it was starting to get troublesome. \"I hope Steven enjoyed his night.\"  She said to herself as she started to stroke her new penis.  She had totally forgotten about one of Steven's gifts.  She made her way into the bathroom and started the shower.  As she got undressed, Liz admired the protrusion in between her legs and decided to test it out in the shower while she got ready.  '<i>It will be like killing 2 birds with 1 stone.</i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Arissia</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia was in a hurry to get ready.  After telling Marcie that she would pick up where they left off later on that night, she was finally able to get in the shower.  As a matter of fact, she was barely able to finish getting her shoes on when she heard a car honk outside.  She got up and made her way to the door.  \"Where do you think you're going?\"  Marcie called out as she once again wrapped her hands around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get to work, my m... Zoe is waiting for me outside.\"  Arissia cried out as she tried to get out of her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, have a good day at work.\"  Marcie replied as she leaned in for a quick good bye kiss and Arissia had no choice but to comply.  She leaned in to meet her lips and actually enjoyed the intimate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will see you later on tonight.\"  Arissia called as she closed the door behind her.  She made her way over to her mum's car and couldn't help but notice a body in her usual seat in the back.  As she grew nearer, Arissia couldn't help but laugh at the sight of Josh in her princess seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and laugh it up.\"  Josh said as he crossed his arms across his chest in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I intend to.\"  Arissia replied back to him as she got in the car.  \"Oh, and I like your dress.\" a wry smile crept across her face.  \"I think it goes great with your new hairstyle too.\"  She saw her hair unbraided and in a high pony tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed as he uncrossed his arms.  \"Thanks, I guess.\"  He was starting to get uncomfortable in his seat and moved slightly to make himself more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked in the mirror and saw him.  \"Josh, you might want to watch how you sit.\"  Josh looked down at his legs which were splayed open and he quickly closed them.  Zoe chuckled. \"You don't want the world to see your knickers.\"  Josh blushed as he continued to look out the window.  \"Right.  We will be there in a couple minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So will he be okay while we are with customers?\"  Arissia wondered, somewhat excited to work side by side with her mum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, since he got your interests too, I brought some toys and a couple coloring books to keep him occupied while we work.\"  Zoe pointed to the bag in the floor board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I think he will let us paint his nails and stuff too.  He might like that now.\"  Arissia winked to Josh.  Josh felt giddy at the thought of sitting there with Zoe looking at his nails.  He shook his head vigorously trying his best to get the thought out of his head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had called to a clothing shop on the way to work for a bra, since he didn't like the thought of his Wilko shirt chafing his new tits all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning.\" Steven chirped in Liz's voice, as he reached back and felt to check his ponytail was tidy enough. \"It was... okay, thanks.\" Steven lied. \"Peculiar\" would have been a better description of the previous evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how's the hubby?\" Elizabeth asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven frowned upon hearing that one. \"Yeah, he's fine too, same old Eric.\" he chuckled nervously. One feeling Steven had not yet got used to was the lack of equipment in his pants. It still felt weird having Liz's vagina instead of his own penis and testicles. He gyrated his hips a little when Elizabeth wasn't looking, hoping that would help. Then he set off walking again, approaching Elizabeth. He felt Carly's boobs jiggling in his bra with each step he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good. Oh... I would like a word with you before you start work love.\" Elizabeth then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, no problem.\" Steven smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Elizabeth led Steven upstairs towards her office. But Steven realized he would first have to pee. \"Just got to... you know.\" Steven said to Elizabeth, as he started pushing open the doors to the gents toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... in the MEN's toilets?\" Elizabeth emphasized, a little shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven closed his eyes and cursed himself for not remembering he now had Liz's gender too, so he was seen and classed as a woman. Made sense really, since he had breasts and a vagina too. \"Oops, yeah, might be a bad thing.\" Steven chuckled, correcting his course and backtracking for the ladies toilets. \"I'll meet you in your office okay.\" he called back to Elizabeth, who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the ladies room, Steven took stock of his appearance again in the mirror, and raised his eyebrows. He puckered the luscious lips that had been Carly's until last night, along with the breasts that he saw fit to grope again. As he did so, he felt a warm feeling between his legs as his pussy began to moisten a little. He stopped himself before he went any further. Work wasn't the right place for masturbation. And besides, he now had responsibilities and a whole store full of employees under his wing. He knew it was going to be an interesting day once Liz, Kiran and 'Josh' (Carly) turned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another sigh, Steven walked into a stall and began unfastening his trousers, before sitting down to pee.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had to discuss with her who would be tackling it so that it would get done in time so that there wouldn't too much stock left in the back.  As he did his walk of the store, just like Liz did everyday before the start of any shift, Steven noticed his crew walking in for their upcoming shift.  Kiran walked in, seemingly too engrossed in her phone to know what was going on.  '<i>Probably playing a new game or something.</i>'  He thought as he continued to walk the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <b>Meanwhile upstairs in the tearoom</b>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran started to walk in the tea room, still engrossed in her phone.  Last night she found a nice game that seemed really neat and she couldn't really put it down.  Well, that and the computer that she got from Steven had some nice games.  Who knew a game called Mass Effect would be so interesting.  '<i>I don't really know if it's because I got his interests or that I might actually find it interesting.</i>'  She thought to herself.  She finally looked up from her phone and noticed that Carly, or rather 'Josh', was sitting at a table reading one of the books that she got last night.  She made her way over to her and sat down.  \"Hey Josh, hows everything going?\"  She wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked up from one of the most interesting stories that she's read in a long time.  \"Oh, hey Kiran.\"  She picked up her bookmark and saved her place in the book and set it back down.  \"Not too bad, how was your night last night?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran looked down at the enhanced bust that she had got from Liz the night before and felt Josh's penis start to stir.  \"It was decent.  I am really enjoying the games that I got from Steven.\"  She picked up her phone to emphasize the fact. She got close to her ear and whispered.  \"Plus, you might want to try to get a penis next time, it is definitely a life changing experience.\"  She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... if we play again, I will have to try it out.\"  Carly replied back, fighting the urge to open her book again.  \"So how do you think Steven did last night with Liz's husband and everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran just shrugged.  \"I don't know, but I think we can talk to 'her' later on.\"  Just then Liz walked through the door and made her way over to Kiran and Carly.   \"So... How was your night?\"  Kiran wondered as she looked at Liz with a judging look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz blushed slightly and replied with Steven's deeper voice.  \"Oh, you know the usual.  But I do have to say, I enjoyed not having my husband breathing down my neck while I slept.\"  The 'girls'  chuckled.  \"Plus, I have to say the umm... 'appendage' that I got from Steven sure was fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran nudged Carly.  \"See, what did I tell you.\"  She said chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.\"  Carly said picking her book back up.  \"I will have to see what I can do to get one next time too.

Steven looked up at Liz, who was significantly taller than him now, then he glanced at Kiran and 'Josh'. He cleared his throat, and Liz immediately smiled hearing her own voice coming from Steven's new lips. Steven had to remind himself (as he adjusted his bra strap) that he was now in charge. He had to act like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here's where you'll all be working today.\" Steven said, as he handed his friend each a piece of paper, on which was the section they were assigned to and the person they would be working with. Liz was assigned to work with Natalie, Kiran with Jade and 'Josh' (Carly) would be working with Charlotte for her first shift at Wilko. Steven thought nothing of throwing her in at the deep end, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You big meanie!\" Liz chuckled in Steven's voice, as she noticed who Carly was paired with. \"Not even I'd do that, you ball-buster.\" She said. And as she happened to glance at the C-cup breasts distending Steven's shirt, Liz felt her cock swell and start to press against the fabric of her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, as you were so determined to see me take on your role, you can deal with the consequences.\" Steven told Liz in her own voice as he smirked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran and Carly glanced at each other, they could actually feel the tension in the air. \"So um... I take it Charlotte is... awkward to work with?\" Carly said nervously as she raised her hand, licking Steven's former lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine. Charlotte has her faults like everyone else, but she's not all that bad. If you have any trouble with her, just come and see me okay.\" Steven answered Carly's question as he reached up to feel his ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thanks.\" Carly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran's cock meanwhile was even harder than Liz's was, but Kiran was turned on by her own (Liz's) huge breasts instead of Steven's (Carly's) smaller ones. She had to wonder whether she should have given Liz's boobs to someone else instead. \"W-we should start work.\" She stuttered, trying to distract herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you should, now go downstairs and go to your sections, I'll be by to check up on your soon.\" Steven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis swapped friends then strode past him, Liz still smirking devilishly as she looked down at him, running her hand over her really short hair. Kiran and Carly though just smiled at Steven, as though to give him encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be a fun day.\" Steven mumbled in his feminine tone, before exiting the tea room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She got out the mirror at showed her client the outcome of her visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Johnson looked in the mirror and smiled.  \"Arissia, luv, you are the reason why I come in here.  Again, you have reached into my mind and got it to look like I wanted.\"  She got up and made her way over to Kay to pay for her services.  Zoe looked up and proudly smiled at her daughter with what she was able to accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mrs. Johnson done and out of the way, Arissia had an hour until her next appointment.  She decided to see what Josh was up to.  Making her way towards the reception area, Arissia noticed Josh was laying on the ground behind the reception desk kicking his legs back and forth while coloring in one of her Activity books.  As she got closer, she heard him humming as he worked.  \"Carly, you having fun up here with Kay?\"  She asked and Josh turned his head to see Arissia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am up here coloring in my book.\"  Josh said trying to stay in character as much as he could.  He held up the book to show Arissia.  Honestly, he didn't mind coloring in the book and it seemed to keep his attention fairly well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks very pretty, Carly, good job!\"  Arissia said with a grin on her face and Josh seemed to be beaming with the work that he was able to accomplish.  \"I have an idea.\"  She said as she motioned for him to come closer.  Josh obeyed and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your idea, Ms. Arissia?\"  He asked without really thinking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia moved her head closer to his ear and whispered.  \"I have an hour before my next appointment, so how about we go paint your nails.  Does that sound like fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood there for a moment with the urges fighting in his head.  He really didn't want to do it, but something in the back of his head was telling him to jump up and down and say '<i>Yes!</i>'.  But before he could say what he wanted, the voice and urge in the back of his head had won out and he was jumping up and down clapping his hands.  \"Yes!\"  He stopped for a moment to think about what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia wasn't really surprised at what he said, she had a feeling that this is what would happen.  \"Okay, how about we go ask your mum first.\"  She said and before he could object, she grabbed his smaller hand and led him to where Zoe was finishing up with a client.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure she had Steven's stronger arms, good for pulling the wax strips off her clients' skin, but she only had tiny hands, thanks to the swap with her daughter. She felt like she belonged in a circus at times. But at the back of her mind, as she and her daughter saw to the clientele that poured through the door, Zoe couldn't help but worry about the way things were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia seemed to be enjoying this whole thing, which wasn't bad in itself of course. But Zoe was asking herself, what if Arissia didn't want to swap back? What if she liked being 32 years old and 5' 10\" tall. Zoe couldn't stay like she was, that was for sure. Even Carly's feet were too small for Zoe's longer legs. She did however like having Carly's job and work experience, and even Josh's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just an uneasy feeling at the back of Zoe's mind. She didn't think it fair to keep Josh as a little girl either, especially her daughter. Because he seemed to be slipping into the role a little too easily. As if she needed proof, 'Carly' was giddy as Arissia painted 'her' nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Arissia was finished with Josh's new 'manicure', she walked back into the reception area. \"I think he enjoyed that.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, try not to pamper him too much. Remember he's really a man sweetheart, and men shouldn't have painted nails.\" Zoe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it right to call a co-worker sweetheart, Zoe?\" Arissia reponded with a smug little smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe wasn't impressed. \"Honey, you're still my daughter, no matter how old you are now, how tall you are, and even if you have a wife. Remember that, okay?\" She basically reminded Arissia. \"This is just a learning experience remember, to get you ready for growing up.\" Zoe continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia sighed. Then she smiled again. \"I'm already grown up.\" She said, reaching tp her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean really growing up sweetie. Not magically swapping ages with a grown up.\" Zoe shook her head in slight annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum, you're a spoilsport. Stop it!\" Arissia sighed, before walking over to the appointment book to see when her next client was due in. \"I will remember who I am okay, don't worry about me, or little 'Carly' for that matter.\" Arissia chuckled again, thinking of Josh. As Arissia then disappeared in the back again, Zoe wore a concerned expression. She'd be keeping a close on both her daughter and Josh from now on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'<i>I can't believe she is being this way.  If I want to show Josh a fun time I think I should be able to</i>.'  She thought to herself.  She soon found her way over to the appointment book and saw that Mrs. Cook would be here in 10 minutes.  While she waited for her next client, she saw that Josh was sitting down in the customer waiting area looking at his nails.  She made her way over to him and sat next to him.  \"What's wrong, don't you like it?\"  She asked her new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh jumped slightly as he was too engrossed in his hands that he didn't hear her coming.  \"Oh, hey Arissia.\"  Josh said with a sigh.  It's just that I really didn't want it, but something in the back of my head was screaming for it to get done.\"  He looked back down at his hands and the pink color that now graced his much smaller hands.  \"Plus, I think Kiran's favorite color is getting the better of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArissia chuckled.  \"I think my interests got the better of you.  I know last night, I enjoyed playing a few video games with your wife.\"  She looked back down at Josh and noticed that he didn't seem too pleased.  Just then, Arissia heard a chime that signified that somebody entering.  She looked up to see that her Dad had just entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Arissia, is Zoe around?\"  Chris asked as he noticed Josh sitting down kicking his legs back and forth.  \"Hey Princess, you being good?\"  Josh winced hearing this term of endearment.  Still playing the part, he nodded.  \"Good, I'm glad to hear it.\"  Soon Zoe made her way over to her husband and gave him a peck on the lips.  \"Hey, I have a question for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked at him with confusion.  \"Okay...\"  She didn't really know where this was going and seemed kind of apprehensive over what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was talking to a client and he was wanting to take us out to dinner tonight to show us how much he appreciates what I was able to do for him.\"  He smiled to his wife.  Chris knew that Zoe has been working a little too much lately and this would be an excuse for her to relax, at least for a night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was slightly taken aback at what was going on and didn't know what to say.  \"But what about...\"  Zoe glanced down to Josh who was busying himself with the activity book again and not paying attention to what was going on around him.  \"Carly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind watching her.\"  Arissia quickly spoke up.  \"I'm sure Marcie would love to have a little one running around, at least for a night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris raised his hands as if to say 'There you go.'  \"I don't know.  Do you think she will be alright over there?\"  Zoe wondered.  She was worried about him going back to his wife and her not really knowing who he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and since there won't be school tomorrow, we can rent a movie and order pizza.  Have a girl's night in while you guys have a night out.\"  Arissia replied back to her trying to reassure her.  \"And we have a guest bedroom that she can sleep too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we can go.\"  Zoe sighed.  \"What time should we drop her off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the dinner is starting at 7, so how about 6:15 or so?\"  Chris asked as she looked over to Arissia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, I will give Marcie a call after I get done with Mrs. Cook.\"  Arissia said with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And since he had Liz's voice too, he sounded exactly like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh listen at you, letting the power go to your head are you?\" Liz chuckled in Steven's deep voice as she stood up straight, looking down at him. Steven could tell that Liz was enjoying being taller than him. What he didn't know, is that Liz was loving every trait she had got from him. Steven's short haircut, his hairy stronger legs and especially the erect cock straining against her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, just do as your're told, okay, otherwise I'll have you in Elizabeth's office.\" Steven said, hand on hips as he scowled at Liz. He was getting a little fed up with her attitude to be painfully honest. And the fact was... he was now in charge. HE was the supervisor, not Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" Liz chuckled a little, letting out a sigh. She didn't like being threatened. She had to wonder whether the stress of having her job, her vagina and her husband (among other things)  was getting the better of Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven scowled again at Liz and then walked off, going to check on someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright Steven?\" Kiran suddenly asked as she approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked at the more muscular Kiran as she reached down and idly scratched her crotch. \"Oh, yeah things will be okay, as soon as Liz stops being a bitch.\" Steven grumbled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to talk to her?\" Kiran squeaked in Arissia's childish voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven sighed. \"You can if you want, but I don't think it will help. I think having testosterone in her system has made her even more stubborn.\" He explained. \"Have you got your work done by the way?\" He then asked Kiran, changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, almost done my work, and I'll go and have a word with Liz okay.\" Kiran smiled, as she tried to avoid staring at Steven's C-cup breasts too much. She was hard enough as it is 'down there'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Steven nodded in gratitude, then he went about his supervisory duties again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh then stood up and unbuttoned his pants and pulled them down slightly to see what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\"  Kiran said as she got up to check inside her pants.  What she saw was her light pink knickers that Josh now wore.  She finally was able to get her pants unbuttoned and looked down to see his plaid boxers instead of her usual knickers.  \"I guess its too late to fix it now.\"  She said as she got the cards and gave them to Suki to deal them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down his shirt and fixed his breasts so that they fit better in the cups. \"This is certainly going to be an interesting 2 days.\" He said to the group.

He reacted by flexing his right bicep - only to see his muscles diminish rapidly. The muscles all over his body did the same as he acquired Suki's muscle tone (or lack of). His work clothes became loose on him, but not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reverse had happened to a delighted Suki as Steven's physical strength was transferred to her. After a minute or so she was flexing her biceps like some kind of amateur bodybuilder. She felt so much stronger, so much more confident about herself. Steven was at least grateful that his height hadn't been affected. \"This is so cool!\" Suki declared, as Kiran, Jade and Josh looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all right Steven?\" Kiran asked out of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Steven sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then, we going again or not?\" Suki asked, gathering the cards up for another hand. She fiddled with the short sleeves of her Wilko top, which were now a little tighter on her upper arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm game!\" Jade nodded, aware that she hadn't been swapped yet. She was a little nervous about it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran, Josh and Steven all nodded, indicating they were up for another round too.

Not that he would mind that much. His attitude was much more positive with his new female mind-set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade had already made her decision. \"I want to swap chests with Steven.\" she blurted out. And instantly she put her hands to her breasts ad felt them melting away into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven experienced the opposite, he sat back in his chair and gasped as Jade's tits formed under his shirt. \"Yeah why not, might as well the whole package.\" Steven grumbled, realizing he now had Jade's voice, vagina and breasts as well as Suki's height and muscle mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran and Suki were paying attention to Jade, who was looking more masculine than Kiran was now.

We can have another game in a couple of days, or whenever.\" Suki nodded, as she gave her own cock another rub through her trousers under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I enjoyed that.\" Kiran smiled. \"But I need a pint now.\" she laughed, thinking of an ice cold beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might join you.\" Jade said to Kiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and Josh meanwhile were now in similar situations, except that Josh had the female disposition to deal with his changes better, while Steven pretty much felt insecure in his current state. He didn't whine about it too openly though. He knew he'd have to accept his changes. \"I'm heading home.\" Steven grumbled in his girly new voice, as he got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll walk with you if you like.\" Josh offered, eliciting a nod from Steven. He'd appreciate the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You 'girls' be careful.\" Suki quipped before Steven and Josh left.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon they found themselves walking down the way to a nearby pub.  Along the way, Kiran and Suki loved the new height that came with their swaps.  Soon they found that they were in front of the pub, they entered the establishment and found that it wasn't as busy as it usually was.  Suki and Jade soon found themselves in the Women's toilets looking at their new appendages.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki liked what she saw, of course it didn't match her brown skin tone, but it did look big.  She didn't know if it was because it was now on her body, or if it was because she never really saw one so close up before.  She touched it and soon found that it moved with excitement.  \"This is going to be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going to be fun?\"  Jade wondered as she closed her stall door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure you will find out soon enough.\"  Suki said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my lord.\"  Jade called out.

I remember Kiran's first time getting one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is freaky.\"  Steven said with Jade's voice, but they were soon confronted by several guys who were clearly taller and more muscular than them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what we have here, a couple of trannies.\"  One of them said to his friends.  \"If you two want to pass, you will have to pay the toll.\"  He then put his hand out as he expected some money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I know you guys don't want to do this.\"  Josh said to them.  \"And I am letting you know that I am prepared to defend myself if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy, He says that he can defend himself.  The little guy looks like he can barely lift a box.\"  Another guy said back to his friends.  \"You know what, I think I would like to see that.\"  He then placed his hand on Josh's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will give you 5 seconds to remove it.\"  Josh said to the guy as he started to countdown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, I just think we should pay them and we can be on our way.\"  Steven said to his new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should listen to your friend over there, shorty.\"  One of the guys said to Josh.  But Josh continued to count down until he reached zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your last chance.  Remove your hand and go on your way or I will remove it for you.\"  Josh said with a matter of fact tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut it.\"  The thug said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\"  Josh replied back as he grabbed the thugs wrist and forearem and twisted it until he went down to his knees.  Then grabbed a pressure point in his left arm and he yelled in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him go!\"  one of the other thugs yelled back at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, if you guys go on your way.\"  Josh replied back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shove off!\"  He said as he started to come toward him with a knife.  Without missing a beat, Josh dodged the knife and grabbed the wrist of the thug and twisted it until the thug stopped his momentum forward and fell backwards. dropping the knife in the process.  Josh stepped on it and kicked it back behind him to ensure that they wouldn't be able to reach it without getting by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I will ask you again.\"  Josh replied back. \"Go back on your way or I will have no choice but to hurt you.  I was holding back and didn't want to hurt you, only because it usually means a lot of paperwork and I don't really have the time to deal with that right now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thugs didn't know what to think, here was a guy with tits, long red hair, and really short.  How can he hand their butts to them in the manner that he did?  \"You win, mate.\"  Just don't hurt us anymore.\"  The leader said as they began their retreat and soon they were out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\"  Steven said to Josh with a look of awe and fear on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That?  That my friend is Aikido.\"  Josh answered back to him. \"It is a martial art where you use the opponents momentum against him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can do that with your current body?\"  Steven inquired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it actually made it easier.\"  Josh said to him as they made their way to Steven's apartment  \"I'm glad I came along, I would have hated to see what they would have done to you otherwise.\"  Steven nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though she didn't have one herself, she did have Josh's experience with one. \"Yours looks weird.\" Kiran did however comment to Suki's contrasting skin tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Suki giggled, in vague protest, as she waved her penis around before tucking it back into her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these things always hard?\" Jade asked, rubbing her bulge again. She'd had a couple of drinks already and the alcohol was beginning to have the desired effect on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because it's new to you... and you're excited, that's why it's hard.\" Kiran said, sounding knowledgable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, get her!\" Jade laughed. Truth be told, Jade looked like your typical lesbian now that she had short hair and a muscular build, not to mention her flat chest and bulging crotch. Suki also looked a little on the butch side. While Kiran, she was now 5' 10\" tall, was dressed in Josh's clothes and lacked her usual breasts, she at least looked more feminine than her two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tomorrow's shift is gonna be a laugh I think.\" Suki giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.

(Copied from <b>Swap Poker</b>)<br>\r\nYou play a normal round of poker but instead of betting money, you bet traits of yourself. The traits can be anything you can name. The traits are not equal in worth, some are more worth than others. A list can be found below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game will be played like a normal poker game, you bet and the one with the best hand wins. The winner can choose to either swap his traits with those in the pot or swap these with the other players. You can't swap back traits you had when you began the game. It is possible to win and lose other traits throughout the game. For example it is possible that Mark gets red hair, loses it and wins the same again during the game. He can't swap his own hair back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping ages or genders does not change you physical. People just think you're that old or the opposite gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't matter what you bet, it is possible that there are several of the same trait in the pot. It's not possible to swap a hand for a foot or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start of every hand, two people have to place a pot. The person dealing has to give in traits worth 1 points, the person right to him/her has to give traits worth 2 point. That then circules clockwise the next hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen someone set bets, the other players have to bet equal or more points to continue playing, e.g. Katie has bet traits worth 4 points, then the other will have to bet traits worth 4 or more points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality adjusts to the swaps. It is only possible to leave the game table in between hands not when the game is played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll swaps can be reversed any time after two days when all players gather, put their hands on the card box and saying a magical formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrait - Points<br>\r\nSmall body parts (e.g hands, feet, lips... etc) - 1 Point<br>\r\nSmall Possessions (e.g. jewelry, single books, single dvds) - 1 Point<br>\r\nOne clothing article - 1 Point<br>\r\nPersonal Infos (e.g. Age, name... etc) - 2 Point<br>\r\nLarger body parts (e.g. torso, legs, face... etc) - 2 Points<br>\r\n'Medium' Posessions (e.g. small personal library, DVD collections) - 2 points<br>\r\nSkills - 2 Points<br>\r\nMale/ Female body parts - 3 Points<br>\r\nMajor posessions (e.g. cars, houses, all of one article of clothing) - 3 Points<br>\r\nGender - 3 Points<br>\r\nPersonality changes - 4 Points<br>\r\nWhole Outfit - 4 Points<br>\r\nLife - 5 Points</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be interesting.\" Suki said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he send you, dear?\" Her mother asked her as she was coming out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, Mum.\"  Suki replied back as she was pulling her coat on.  \"I need to go to work, I will see you later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki arrived at the store and made her way to the Tea Room to see who had arrived for their shift.

'I only have a pair of 5's, but I have to make the first bet.'  \"I bet my hair\"  She replied and was astonished to see a holographic display appear above her head with her hair pictured.  \"Wow, that is trippy.\"  The group nodded dumbly in agreement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is the real deal\"  Kiran replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...  Jade, I think it's your turn.\"  Suki said as she looked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"  Jade replied back as she looked at her cards.  \"I bet Name.\"  She then looked up to see a holographic name tag with her name on it. \"Rob, it's your go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking, I'm thinking.\"  Rob replied back,  \"I am going to bet my eye colour and my shoes too.\"  He then saw a picture of his shoes and his blue eyes appear above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time to up the ante, I am going to bet my height and my current outfit.\"  Kiran replied and looked up to see a picture of her current outfit with her earrings and watch appear above her head along with a tape measure with her current height of 5' 0\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats with the outfit bet?\"  Jade wondered. \"Don't we all wear the same thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I thought it would be a great way to get some points.\"  Kiran replied back to her and Jade nodded back in agreement. \"Steven, it's your go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I bet my Face, Hands, and all of my Shoes.\"  He said as the appeared above his head.  \"Suki, you now have to bet 5 more points to stay in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can win, so I fold.\" Suki announced and Rob agreed and followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to bet 4 more points to stay in, so I am going to bet my feet and my Gender.\"  Jade announced as her feet and the female gender sign appeared above her head.  \"Lets see what you got.\"  She said as she showed them her 2 pair. \"Queens and 2's.\"  She proudly announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, not too shabby, but it doesn't beat my 2 pair, Aces and Kings.\"  Steven said with great pride as he got ready to get the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast.\"  Kiran announced, \"It may beat Jade, but it certainly doesn't beat my straight.\"  She then lay down her cards to show them the 7, 8, 9, 10, J that were in her hand.  As her cards were laid down the game knew that she was the winner and all the holographic displays migrated toward her so and pictures of each player popped up so she can give the traits to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so cool.\"  Rob said somewhat geeking out over the whole experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but we have to get these handed out so that we can go get ready for our shift.\"  Kiran announced as she grabbed her height. \"I think Steven can have this, only because he is the tallest and I want to try it out for a while.\"  She said as she brought the symbol over to his character and saw him shrink to her former height as she instantly grew another foot.  \"I wasn't expecting that.\"  She said as she looked over to Suki and Jade who were whispering back and forth to each other.  Jade then looked up to see Kiran looking at them and quickly got up and whispered something in her ear.  Kiran's expression went from intrigue to smiles as she looked at Rob and Steven.  \"Now for my outfit, I will have to give that to Steven too.\"  She announced as she brought it over to him and saw his face blush a brilliant shade of red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you blushing?\"  Suki wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was about to answer her when Kiran replied back for him.  \"The outfit swap swapped something not thought of...\"  She was also blushing.  \"Our underwear and my bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to see this,\" Kiran said as she quickly went over to Steven to see in fact that he was now wearing her light purple bra under his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for the outfit, I think I will take your face as compensation and take your hands too.\"  Kiran said to Steven.  \"As for your your shoe collection, I think Jade will like those, but you will have to take her feet and Suki's hair too.\"  Steven's usual cropped hair instantly grew out to be black hair down to his mid back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so heavy and why didn't my shoes change from your outfit?\"  Steven wondered as he pulled his now longer black hair over his shoulder so that he could get a look at it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you said all your shoes, so I think the shoes at home will be swapped.\"  Jade said back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all we have left is Jade's name and Rob's shoes and eye colour.  Jade, your name can go to Rob and you can have his blue eyes and his shoes.\"  Kiran said to the group to clear out the bets and the table was reset to the default positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was not confused.  He started off being a confident guy of 6 feet to this... he was wearing ladies undergarments and now only stood 5 feet tall. \"How long is this for again before we can swap back?\"  He asked the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says here that it's for 48 hours\"  Suki replied as she looked down at the paper.  \"I like having short hair, it doesn't get in my way as often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"  Steven replied back as he was trying to keep his hair out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an additional hair tie if you want to use it.\"  Kiran offered him \"and I can help you with it too.\" Steven agreed and Kiran helped him put it up in a small bun style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this next hand going,\"  Jade said as she started to pass out the cards again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was starting into space out a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you doing okay, Steven?\"  Suki asked him. \"I mean we can stop if you want.  I know this can be a little much losing your height and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's quite alright.  I think it will be fun to try something new.\"  Steven said to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, let's begin the second round.  We still have 20 minutes before the start of our shift.\"  Suki said everyone grabbed their cards and began to look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade looked at her cards and she had a pair of kings. 'I might be able to bluff to win this round.  I better start small and work my way up.'  She thought to herself then she made her bet.  \"I bet all my piercings.\"  Just then a holographic image popped up above her head of her body with white dots portraying all of her piercings.  Mainly on her face and ears, but it appeared that her nipples and belly button were pierced too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am betting my current name.\"  Rob said \"And a copy of my favorite movie.\"  An image of a name tag with \"Jade\" written on it and a copy of the Avengers appeared above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, don't like your name, <i>Jade</i>.\"  Kiran said teasingly.  \"I bet all of my mates.\"  Just then, a list of individuals appeared on a holographic clipboard above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I bet my current hair and all of my Pants.\"  Steven said as his hair and a rolling rack of pants appeared above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet my torso and chest\"  Suki answered as the images appeared above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call with my legs and hips,\" Jade answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting too much\"  Rob said.  'I put the name out there so it could get swapped with Steven, that way I can get a masculine name.'  He thought reassuringly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now it's time to put the nail in the coffin.'  Kiran said to herself as she made her bet. \"I bet my age and my gender.\"  As she made this bet Jade, Suki, and Steven all folded leaving Kiran the victor of this hand.  All of the bets made their way over to her and the images of the players also appeared, ready for their new traits to be given to them.  \"Let's give these out. Let's start with Jade's bets.  Her piercings will go to Rob and you can take her hips too, but I think she can have your favorite movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Rob felt pinching on multiple points on his ears, eye brows, nipples, and belly button.  He looked down his shirt and found some feminine looking piercings.  \"What kind of weirdo are you?\"  Rob said as he looked over to Jade.  He was so worried about the piercings that he didn't feel his hips swell slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you don't like them.\"  Jade said with a smile. Rob just sighed as he shook his head in a joking manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, you're going to keep the hair, because I think it looks cute on you, but your pants will go to Jade since she already has your shoes and you can have her legs to go with her pants.  But I think you will have my age and my mates, only because I want to be able to go to a pub and buy a pint by myself.  My mates are going to you only because I need a break from them, they are getting too needy lately.\"  Kiran said with a wink and a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven didn't feel any different, so he took out his Identification to find out that his age was now 17 years old.  He then pulled out his phone and looked at his contacts to only find female names and the occasional guy's name.  \"I hope this isn't going to be bad.\"  He said to Kiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I think I have a way that you can have more in common with your new friends.\"  Kiran said to him with a smile on her face.  \"I will give you Suki's chest and torso, but I won't give your my gender.  The proud new owner of that will have to be Rob.\"  Rob knew what that meant and he didn't have to look at his ID to know it, he was now a female and would have to use the female toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be an interesting few days.\"  Steven said to himself as he felt his now trimmer waist line and he bounced slightly to feel his new chest move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think of it as a learning experience.\"  Suki said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope I will enjoy it.\"  Steven said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I am in her phone and so is Jade.\"  Suki said to him trying to comfort him.  \"If you want to do something, just give us a call.\"  Steven nodded at this and got ready for the next hand, hoping that he would be able to win a round.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He noticed that he had a decent hand and might actually win this one, but he would definitely have to wait and see how the others bet. Rob then made his bet, \"I bet my current name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran then looked at him and said laughing \"I can't believe you are trying to get rid of it.  I will bet my arms and my makeup too.\" An image of her feminine arms appeared next to a vanity with some makeup on in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was next as he said, \"I bet my body hair, jewelry, and eyes.\"  Then the image of his body with the hair on his body appeared along with his necklace and eyes.  The necklace was a gift from his mum for completing school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki looked at her cards and thought that she had a good chance at coming out on top. \"I bet my hips, hair styling skills, and my skin. The skills will help you in the coming days, Steven.\"  She said with a wink. \"And besides, I don't want to look like a pear so I got rid of my hips.\"  The other girls laughed at that comment and their attention went to Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade contemplated on what she would bet, she knew that it would have to be good in order for the others to fall for the bluff. \"I bet my muscles, all of my shirts, and while I am at it, my favorite color too.\"  An image of the female musculature, A rack filled with different shirts and blouses, and the color red appeared above her head.  \"I might as well get rid of my shirts since I have nothing to go with them now.\"  She said with a smile.  Rob knew he was beat and promptly folded his hand and Kiran soon followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki looked down contemplating whether or not she had the cards needed to win this one. \"Oh what the hell, I bet my muscles and my gender.\"  Steven folded his cards too he didn't think that his 2 pair would have beaten her hand. \"I win again and all I had was this measly pair of jacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?\"  Steven said to her. \"I gave up 2 pair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, my luv, is what you call a bluff.\"  Suki said as she looked at the loot that she gathered and wanted to see who was befitting for their new traits.  \"Hmm...  Rob, I think your muscles will go to Jade and you can have her favorite color too.\"  Rob felt a shifting throughout his body and he looked down to see the trim musculature of a young woman.  \"Suki, I think you would look lovely with Steven's eyes and you can have his body hair too, since he has your hair on his head.\"  Steven felt in pricks all over his body and face, he knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, Steven, your begining to become a real cutie.\"  Kiran said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Steven, these next ones will be for your benefit.\"  Suki said and Steven prepared for the worse. \"You will get Kiran's arms since you have her hands and her makeup collection.  Since I have your torso, I will give you my hips and you can take these too.\"  Suki said as she pushed Jade's shirts, her hair styling skills, gender, skin, and muscles toward his character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked down at his body and saw the trim muscles of a young woman and also saw that his skin darkened a few shades to match her former Indian heritage. \"Did I just pick up a new ethnicity?\"  He wondered to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Steven, I am going to give you a choice on this last swap, since I gave you all of that earlier.\"  Suki said as Steven turned toward her. \"You can either have Rob's current jewelry, which would include all the exotic piercings, or you can have Kiran's jewelry?  Those are the options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven thought through the options and decided. \"I want Kiran's.  I don't want to set off a metal detector if I go somewhere.\"  he said jokingly toward Rob and Jade.  Suki obliged and gave Kiran his jewelry and her ear piercings found a new home in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we have 7 minutes left and we have to report to the shop floor.\"  Jade said as she gave the cards to Kiran to deal out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's enough from you two.\"  Kiran said as she placed the first bet.  \"I bet my voice.\"  An image of a musical note appeared above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked down at his hand and knew that he wasn't going to win this one and decided to give in to his current predicament. \"I bet all of my underwear.\" An image of a drawer full of boxers appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for something more comfortable?\"  Suki said to him.  \"I bet my genitals, since it's going against the look I am trying to achieve.\" An image of the female genitalia appeared above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see if we can do something interesting.\"  Jade said.  \"I bet my work knowledge\" An image of books appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think that will do?\" Kiran wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but it took it.\"  Jade said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough chit chat, I bet my name, these piercings, and my favorite music.\"  Rob said with an attitude.  An image of a name tag, the piercings, and a CD with Rock appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, somebody is getting snippy.\"  Kiran said as she got ready for her bets. \"I bet my drinking knowledge and my makeup skills.\"  As an image of some books appeared above her head. Upon hearing this, both Jade and Steven folded their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will finish it up with my foreign language skills.\"  Suki said as more books appeared above.  Rob cursed as he folded too. \"What do you got Kiran?\" Suki wondered as she showed her hand which consisted on 3 Kings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but that won't beat my Full House.\"  Kiran responded as she showed her hand which consisted of 3 10s and a pair of Aces. \"Rob, you will get my favorite music, which is Pop by the way and you can sing along with my voice too.\"  Rob groaned as he heard this. \"Jade, I think your work knowledge will go to Suki and Suki I think your language skills go to me.  I am sure it will be interesting.\"  Kiran now knew how to speak mostly Hindi.  \"As for Steven, luv, these swaps are for you.  You get my drinking knowledge, since I don't really have any and you can't go out without a legal guardian, also my makeup skills to go with my make up.  All of your underwear will go to Suki so that she can be comfortable with your genitals.\"  She said this as she gave Steven her genitals.  Steven instantly felt a pull in his groin as he knew he now had Suki's female parts and also her knickers as well at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is it.\"  Suki replied back \"It's time to get ready for our shift.  We don't want Liz to be mad at us for not coming down on time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven agreed, \"But first I need to see myself in a mirror.\"  He made his way over to the ladies restroom and found a mirror and gazed at his new reflection.  He now had Kiran's lovely face with Suki's brown eyes and her long black hair.  Upon closer inspection he now saw that his face had a light dusting of makeup too, not too over done, just enough to get by.  \"This is going to be an interesting few days.\"  he said to himself as he made his way to the floor.  He would have to wait until the shift was over to check out everything else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven sighed as he descended the stairs and emerged onto the shop floor, he was the last of his little cards group to do so. \"Ahh Steven, there you are love.\" Liz smiled at him, glancing at her watch momentarily. \"Can you go and give Natalie a hand on toiletries please.\" she told him. Steven just acted dumbfounded at first. How could Liz not see that he was now a hotch potch of parts, an amalgamation of parts from three of his younger female co-workers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... sure Liz.\" Steven muttered in reply. He still had his own voice amazingly, as well as his own name of course. But he was technically now a 17-year old girl, and he even had the social life of one too. He was even dressed in Kiran's clothes, while he knew most of his clothing at home had no doubt been replaced with the majority of Jade's wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you just standing there there?\" Liz asked, when she saw Steven studying the dark skin on 'her' hands. Liz now viewed Steven as a girl, thanks to him having Suki's gender. The same went for Rob, who had Kiran's gender as well as her voice. But compared to Steven's changes, Rob had got off lightly in their little game of cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, nothing. I'm on my way.\" Steven sighed. \"Help Natalie right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded, gesturing the way. \"Oh and don't forget to get some ladders. I don't want to see you standing on the shelves to reach the top shelves, okay love.\" she said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Steven nodded. Then he noticed for the first time how much shorter than Liz (four inches) he now was. He shook his head and ran his fingers through Suki's former hair, before setting off to where Natalie was currently working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\nMeanwhile, Suki had started working with Helen, where she had been assigned. And with Steven's gender, muscles and his penis between her legs, she felt... empowered. Working was much easier. She had a silly little smile on her face the whole time while she worked, much to Helen's amusement. Suki also loved her new Caucasian skin tone and short hair. Bringing the cards to work had been a briliant idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suki, are you feeling okay?\" Helen asked Suki, who she now viewed as a man, and not just because of the 'equipment' between Suki's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been better.\" Suki giggled, as she scratched her stubbly face. She actually even liked her new body hair, which she thought was fun to have. Since she now had Jade's work knowledge though, Suki didn't find it all that easy working on the stationary aisle. (Jade's usual section was toiletries). Products were hard to find on the shelf, but it was no problem, she just asked Helen whenever she couldn't find anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time flew by as Suki enjoyed herself with her new traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\nKiran though was probably the most contented by the results of the game upstairs. She was now viewed as a 36-year old man, thanks to her swapping ages with Steven and genders with Rob. And she relished being taller, everything seemed so much smaller around her. She chuckled in her new, deeper voice as she straightened the glasses on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven thought Suki had got most of Steven's muscles, Kiran had his arms and hands, and she found working was easier too. Especially when it came to grabbing and picking up big boxes and the like. Steven's clothes were also so much more comfortable than her own had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least I won't have to deal with Felicity talking my ear off.</i> Kiran chuckled to herself, thinking of one of her friends... who was now Steven's friend, along with Katie, Megan, Sophie, Kylie, Samantha and all her other acquaintances. She'd miss some of them to be sure, but this was so much more fun. She figured being classed as a man - she'd get more respect from people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSad thing was, she was probably right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\nJade wasn't all that affected (physically) by the little game of cards she had upstairs with her co-workers. Well, she had Steven's longer legs and larger feet and Rob's muscles, but compared to Suki and Kiran, she had got off lightly. She missed her piercings, but what bothered her most strangely enough was the knowledge that she now had most of Steven's clothes at home instead of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the fact that she couldn't get used to everyone calling her 'Rob'. She was still classed as a girl, but now she had a guy's name. Weird!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob?\" A voice suddenly called out to her. <i>There it was again</i>. Jade rolled her different colored eyes and turned, ready to scowl at the person talking to her. Until she saw Liz standing there..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... er... hi Liz.\" she mumbled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any reason you're just standing around?\" Liz quizzed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade couldn't think up an excuse. \"Er... no, just thinking, sorry Liz.\" Jade muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sighed. \"Well, can you think while you're working. I'd appreciate it Rob.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade quietly got back to work, grumbling to herself while Liz moved on to check on someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\nRob, despite being 'afflicted' with the least number of changes, was not as happy as Suki and Kiran, and he wasn't as 'curious' as Steven was or as 'indifferent' as Jade. He was now viewed as a girl thanks to his gender swap with Kiran, and he even had her voice to match. All the piercings that now adorned his face and body were already getting annoying, as was his lack of physical strength thanks to his series of swaps with Jade. <i>Great.</i> he grumbled, glancing down at the feminine, black, lace-up shoes on his feet (also Jade's).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he'd done on returning to the shop floor was have a chat with Laura, and he winced every time she called him 'Jade'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, at least I'm not as worse off as Steven.\" he shrugged his shoulders as he worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a part of Rob was amazed by what the cards had been capable of. Transferring traits from one person to another... was mindblowing. And he knew he would want to take part in another round some time in the future.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having to use the ladders was starting to get ridiculous.  \"I wonder if Kiran is enjoying not having to use these bloody ladders.\"  Steven said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say something, luv?\"  Natalie asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, just talking to myself.\"  Steven said to himself.  'I know one thing.  These high waist trousers are starting to drive me nuts.'  He thought to himself as he was having to adjust them.  He had to admit that his skin looked decent, Suki must take really good care of it.  **Hmm**  **Hmm**  \"What in the world was that?\"  He reached into his back pocket and pulled out his mobile and saw that he had a missed text message from Felicity.  He opened the message to read it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Steven, I still can't believe what Alex did, can u believe it?  I can't w8 for u to get off.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, I need you to get off of your mobile and finish stocking the shelves.\"  Liz said to him as he put the mobile back in his pocket. \"Oh, and Elizabeth would like to talk to you in the office in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I will be there in a moment.\"  He replied back as he got down off of the ladder and made his way up to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was walking on cloud 9 and almost nothing could bring her down.  She definitely felt empowered with her new 'equipment'.  She was still having a hard time figuring out where everything is supposed to go.  She still needed to get help from Helen, but it started to come together piece by piece. Besides, it was nice being able to pick up the big boxes without needing any help for a guy.  \"These boxes get pretty heavy, don't they?\"  Suki asked Helen, trying to strike up a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you get used to it.  I think that's why they put you here instead of over on toiletries.\"  Helen said back to her.  \"And trust me, it's nice to get some help, even though your still new in this section.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You think I'm new, but in all actuality, I have been in this section for the past 3 months.' Suki thought to herself as she started to play with the hair on her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran was loving not having to use a ladder to put products on the top shelf.  It was like she was free, free to reach for the sky without any assistance.  \"I wonder if Felicity has gotten a hold of Steven yet.\" She said mostly to herself.  \"But I am free from that too.  This is going to be awesome.\"  She noticed that Steven didn't have many mates to hang out with, but she was sure that she would find some down at the pub.  'Maybe, Suki or Jade will go with me.' She thought to herself but was brought out of her thoughts when Liz came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiran, I like how you put away the stock in this section.\"  Liz said to her. \"I do believe Elizabeth is looking for you and Steven.  I already told her and she is on her way there now and I think you should go too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, I will head there now.\" Kiran replied back to her as she put down the stock she was working on.  As she made her way there, she could believe that Liz referred to Steven as a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way to the office, she noticed that Jade and Rob weren't particularly having as much fun as she was.  I mean Jade had the muscles from Rob and everything, but it looked like she wasn't having fun.  \"I will need to make sure to talk to her when the shift is over to see what is going on.\"  She said mostly to herself as she made her way to the office.  After a few minutes, she was finally at the door and she knocked on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\"  was the reply from Elizabeth.  Kiran opened the door and saw Steven already sitting down with the messy bun style on his head.  \"Have a seat, don't worry, your not in trouble.\"  She said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on Elizabeth?\"  Steven said as he pulled some hair out of his face and tucked it behind his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got some good news.\"  She said to them. \"I just hired a new employee and he is going to be starting tomorrow evening.  The only thing is he isn't British.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, is he French, German, what?\"  Kiran said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's American and his wife was transferred to a nearby university and he just gained citizenship here and was wanting to do something rather than stay at home.\"  Elizabeth said to them.  \"He said he's worked in stores before and would just need a refresher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, I am sure we can make him feel at home.\"  Kiran said to her and she winked over to Steven.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone made their way up to the tea room.  All the players from the game sat together in order to gather their thoughts on how they felt.  The diminutive Steven was the first to speak. \"So what do you guys think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am enjoying it.\" Suki said as she flexed Steven's muscles for the group. \"I can actually pick up the heavier boxes, which comes in handy with Stationary.  What do you think Kiran?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind it too much right now.  But I am sure when I go to the pub and toss back a pint, it will be much better.\"  Kiran said with a smile.  And I'm liking your hands and arms Steven.  They are certainly coming in handy.  What do you think about this Jade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade looked at the group and said \"Honestly, I don't see any difference rather than the way my legs feel.  I am able to pick up the bigger boxes.  So I don't think it's all that bad. What do you think Rob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like it.  I am feeling weak and these piercings are really getting on my nerves.\"  He said as he pulled up his shirt to give a view of his nipple rings that had a shield covering them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least your patriotic.\"  Kiran said laughing as she pointed down at his belly button ring had the Union Jack dangling from it.  Rob realized what was happening and quickly pulled down his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that I am ready to switch back and I might play it again in the future, but I don't know.\"  Rob said as he blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, Suki, can I talk to you for a minute?\"  Kiran asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  She said as they walked away from the group.  \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran talked to her about the new guy starting tomorrow and how she was thinking about asking a member of management to come too, but they shouldn't add too many players, it could get confusing.  They both agreed to talk about this later on as the break was almost over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That evening after work, Kiran and Suki decided to go and have a drink at a little pub she knew in town. They were going to talk about what their plans were for tomorrow, once the new employee had started work. As far as anyone else at the pub was concerned, Kiran and Suki were just two mates having a pint, like all the other 'men' in the pub. Suki at least had the 'equipment' of a man, thanks to her swapping genitals and chests with Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't taste like it normally does.\" Kiran grimaced after taking a sip from her beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki just laughed. \"Yeah well, Steven wasn't really a drinker you know, and now you have his drinking habits.\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran sighed. \"Forgot about that.\" she mumbled in Rob's voice. She then changed the subject. \"So anyway, what do you think about this new starter we're getting tomorrow. I think his name's Josh.\" she asked Suki, who had to reach down into her trousers for a moment to adjust her penis into a mroe comfortable position. \"You really have to do that?\" Kiran frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing is always getting caught up in itself.\" Suki grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you chose to bet your vagina, love.\" Kiran had little sympathy, as evidenced by the smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'm not complaining. I actually like having a dick.\" Suki said quietly, as she took another drink from her beer glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause, then Kiran smiled at Suki again. \"So anyway, I was thinking for our next round - we should get Liz involved. That would be fun. And the newbie too, Josh. You willing again?\" she said to Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Suki nodded. \"Though not sure what I've got left to bet.\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could always wait until the 48 hours are up, and get things back to normal before playing again?\" Kiran suggested. \"I'm sure Rob will be glad to get his gender and his name back.\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's having your voice that's annoying him most I think. The fact that he <i>sounds</i> like a girl.\" Suki shared in Kiran's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo hoo.\" Kiran muttered sarcastically. \"Next time I might take his dick too.\" she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then expressed her support for playing another game, with Liz and Josh this time, and maybe someone else. Both she and Kiran knew Steven would probably agree to play again. Suki then had an idea. \"You know, Steven is friends with the beautician who owns the salon up the road, you know - Carly. Maybe we can persuade Steven to take us up to the salon or something after work tomorrow. We can take Josh under our wing too.\" she suggested. \"Give him a real British welcome, in our own unique way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can ask Liz to come with.\" Kiran smirked wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan. \" Suki nodded. \"We'll fill Steven in on it tomorrow.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\" Kiran said, raising her glass to Suki's.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having to talk to Felicity most of the night, something about her ex-boyfriend seeing another girl.  Even though they had broken up last week, apparently she thought that they had to be single until she found somebody.  Steven now knew why he stayed at home, he didn't have to deal with most of the drama.  \"At least, I have to get through today and I can switch back tomorrow.\"  Steven said to himself as he got up for the day.  He walked over to the closet to see how much his wardrobe had changed, he wasn't able to see it the night before.  He opened the doors and was astonished at what he saw.  All his new clothes were not as girly as he thought they would be.  \"Mostly trousers and T-shirts, I thought I liked Jade for a reason.\"  He said as a smile crept across his face.

She waited for several minutes and noticed that it started to go down.  \"Thank goodness,\"  She then thought about the night before with Kiran.  She thought about the idea that she proposed and decided that she would get with Steven to see if he would be up for it too.  \"I wonder if the new guy would be up for it?\" She said to herself as she hopped in the shower to get ready for her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob wasn't able to sleep much the night before.  The new piercings that he received from Jade continued to bother him.  'The nipple ones were by far the worse' he thought to himself.  He got out of his clothes and turned on the radio and noticed that it was already set to a pop station.  \"This must be one of Kiran's favorite stations to listen to.\"  He said as he soon found himself singing along to Katie Perry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran was ready to tackle the day head on.  She got ready with a new fervor and quickly found herself back in Steven's uniform which she just got done washing.  \"I have to admit, I like these pants, they certainly fit better than the high waisted ones that I usually wear.  I hope we can get some more players to go along with the game tomorrow, it certainly would be nice to experience new things.  I might even follow suit with Suki and swap my vagina out.\"  She said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade didn't feel any different.  While she enjoyed having the muscles.  She stood several minutes posing in the mirror and enjoyed the fun that she had the night before with the stocking she had to do.  \"I might play again, but I don't know, I will have to think about it.\"  she said to herself as she looked in the mirror.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And she was talking to herself in Hindi, with Rob's deeper voice, grinning. When she saw Suki she smiled, then she couldn't help but notice the obvious bulge in Suki's trousers. \"You excited or something?\" she had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki rolled her eyes as she pulled up a seat. \"Thing's got a mind of it's own.\" she grumbled. \"Feels nice though.\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, must say I'm tempted to try one out myself. You know... since everyone sees me as a man anyway.\" Kiran said. \"So how was your night?\" she asked Suki, expecting details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was... interesting.\" Suki chuckled. \"Oh... and your Hindi is flawless by the way. I still think it's weird that I don't know how to speak in my native language anymore.\" she continued. She then instantly changed the subject. \"I brought the cards, don't worry.\" she smirked, producing the pack from her pocket. She put them on the table for a moment, then pocketed them again. She didn't want to mislay them or have them stolen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we still playing another round later?\" Kiran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't asked any of the others yet. But yeah... I'm definitely in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can ask Jade and Rob if you want. Though I doubt Rob will agree to another round.

Kiran had to admit, the idea of their supervisor joining them was thrilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the new guy?\" Kiran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon as we meet him, we can talk to him together if you want, invite him in.\" Suki shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran fidgeted in her seat. \"I think Elizabeth is still inducting him in her office.\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're not ready yet anyway.\" Suki said. And at that moment Steven walked into the tea room. Still as short and dark-skinned as when he left, and attired in Kiran's work uniform. His tits formed two modest mounds under his shirt and there was no sign of a bulge in his waist-high trousers. \"Hey 'girl'.\" Suki chuckled as Steven sat down next to them, sweeping his hair from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" Steven sighed. Kiran still couldn't get used to seeing her cute face attached to Steven's head, along with Suki's hair and skin tone. She straightened her glasses and smiled at him nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'girls' then proceeded to inform Steven of the plans for the day. He was willing to participate in another round of cards, even though he was eager to reverse his current swaps with Suki, Kiran and Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then. Just several more people to ask.\" Suki beamed, she didn't tell Steven though that she was planning to invite Liz to join them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd find that out later.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh, can you also talk to Carly to see if she would like to join us too?\"  Suki asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will have to think about it, but I will let you know before the end of the shift and I will give Carly a ring to see if she would like to join us.\" Liz said to her.  \"Now let's head downstairs and start the night, shall we?\"  Suki nodded as they headed downstairs to begin their shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and Kiran were showing the new guy around.  \"So Joshua, where are you from originally?\" Kiran asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Josh, Joshua is for when I get in trouble.\"  He quipped back at Kiran.  \"Originally, I am from Oklahoma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that where the tornadoes and all the indians are?\"  Kiran asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.  That is where they got moved to as for the tornadoes, they aren't that bad.\"  He said back  \"They can real beautiful if you know what your looking at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you were from a different place than most of the sort that come in here.\"  Kiran said to him as they made their way to the Goods In area.  Steven and Kiran both explained the process that is done and how they need to get it done in an orderly manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   About an hour later   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was working in the Stationary section again when she heard somebody come up behind her. \"Hey luv.\"  Liz said behind her. \"About tomorrow night, I think I will join you and I gave Carly a ring and she said that we can go over there after the shift is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I will let everyone else know.  Thanks.\"  Suki said back to her supervisor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is supposed to happen with this game of yours?\"  Liz wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then told her what they did and how she will never see life the same again.  \"I know you won't believe it, but I used to not look like this.  I used to be a girl.  But just come tomorrow it will all make sense to you.\"  Suki said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran soon put Josh to work in the Toiletries section and went to find Suki.  She soon found her with Liz and as she approached, they went their separate ways.  \"What was that about?\" Kiran asked Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she was just telling me that Carly and her are in for tomorrow night.  All we have to do is find another guy to replace Rob.\"  Suki replied back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that, I think the new guy is definitely interested.\"  Kiran told her with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was happy to hear it too, she was sure that he had some nice additions to give to the game.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rob was grateful for this day, it meant that he could get these things off of him and swap his voice back.  That is what bothered him the most, it wasn't being called ma'am by the yank.  \"I will have to give him a talking to after I get swapped back.\"  he told himself as he put Jade's shoes on and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   **</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran was indifferent about the day.  She was really enjoying her new height and perhaps she could bet it again so that she could be taller than the 5' she was usually.  She looked through her work outfits to see if she could find Steven's, but she couldn't find it.  Instead she put on one of her extra ones so that she could get to work and get ready for tonight's game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was ready to get her piercings back.  She thought that's what made her, her.  \"I have to admit, I am liking the shoes.  I might have to get Steven to swap with me again.\"  She said to herself as she got Rob's shoes back on from the day of the swap.  \"Well, time to go back to being plain old me\"  She said to the mirror as she flexed one more time to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki looked at her male form one last time as she started to get dressed.  Out of all the things that was swapped with her, she enjoyed the male appendage the most.  It certainly made it easier to use the restroom and she didn't have to wait in any lines at the pub to use the toilet.  She got dressed in her usual uniform and ran her fingers through her short hair one last time before she left for her shift at Wilko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was ready to swap back his height.  The main thing that really irritated him was the fact that he had to use ladders all the time to put items on the top shelves.  The other thing was the new guy, Josh, calling him ma'am every time he asked him to do something.  He was a nice guy, but a little bit too polite for his tastes.  Steven quickly got dressed in Kiran's work uniform so that they could swap back here in roughly 30 minutes or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   ***   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob and Jade were the first to arrive and they sat down at a table nearest to the door waiting for the others to come.  \"What did you think of the whole experience?\"  Jade asked Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't like it, I mainly got a girl's voice and your piercings.\"  Rob complained.  \"Maybe if I got something else, I might of had some more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think you will play again in the future?\"  Jade asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I might do it later on, but not anytime soon.\"  Rob replied back and noticed that Steven and Suki just arrived.  \"Hey girly, how was your time?\"  Rob asked Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven glared at him and tried to look intimidating, but it didn't work with Kiran's face.  \"Very funny, at least I still have my old voice.\"  he said back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rob could react, Kiran walked back into the room and the Suki grabbed the cards and found the incantation.  She spoke words that nobody could hear and after a blinding light, the group looked around and found that they were back to normal...  Well Mostly.  \"I'm sorry Steven, I couldn't find your uniform from that first night so I put on one of my own.\" Kiran apologized to her friend. \"I thought that it would automatically swap it back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I wore this for the past several days, one more day won't hurt\"  Steven said back to her as he looked back down at himself to ensure that everything made it over properly.  \"Now that is cool\"  Steven replied back to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded, and soon found that Liz and Josh had arrived as well for the next shift.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steven was somewhere in between. He had been fascinated by the swaps, but just hadn't enjoyed everyone treating him like a 17-year old girl all that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with them all hard at work, the time soon flew by, and before they all knew it, the shift was drawing to a close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Suki saw Liz, she had a big grin on her face she couldn't hide from her supervisor. \"Are we ready?\" she asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz just nodded. \"Elizabeth is going to lock up tonight, so yes we can nip up to Carly's salon and see her there.\" she replied to Suki's question. \"I must say I'm curious about these cards of yours. If they can do what you claim, well... let's just say I'm sceptical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be.\" Suki smugly reassured her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the store, the group gathered, Kiran, Suki, Steven, Liz... and then Josh nervously arrived. His second day at work and he was already 'hanging out' with his new friends/co-workers. He was as curious as Liz was about what was coming. \"Come on then.\" Liz gestured up the street with her head. Her four staff members followed her dutifully up the street and soon arrived outside <i>Beautylicious.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside, the group all caught a whiff of nail varnish, nail polish remover, lipstick and hot wax, all the things you'd associate with a beauty salon. And stood by a table neatening a ling of different colored nail varnishes... they saw a cute looking blonde, no more than 5' 2\" tall. She had cropped, stylish hair and was dressed in a black <i>Beautylicious</i> low-cut top, a white pencil skirt and a pair of black patent pumps with metallic-tipped stiletto heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Carly.\" Liz greeted her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking hot as always.\" Steven weighed in with his own compliment for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked up and smiled, clasping her manicured hands together. \"Hey guys, come on in.\" she chirped in her lovely voice. \"So what's this unique 'game' Liz told me about over the phone?\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst.. the introductions were made, since Carly had not met Suki or Kiran personally, and she of course hadn't even seen Josh before. Then after that, Suki more or less took over explaining things from her supervisor. She produced the pack of swapping cards, held them up - and a mischievous grin appeared on her face. \"Here's the game Liz was talking about. Let's all have a seat shall we?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly brought a couple of spare chairs from the back of the salon and the group sat around the small table Carly usually used to paint her client's nails. This was after she had locked the door to prevent any disruptions. \"You're lucky, Zoe only left a half hour ago, one of her clients was late.\" Carly explained as she took her seat in between Josh and Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, she could have joined us.\" Kiran smirked. \"But no matter, we'll still have fun.\" she said, looking forward to what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'm intrigued.\" Carly smiled, resting her elbows on the table and in turn resting her head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, a curious Liz just looked on, glancing between Steven, Suki and Kiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Josh... remained silent for the time being, not sure what to say.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone but Josh and Carly nodded their head.  As if on queue, some holographic cards appeared on the table in front of each of the players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"  Josh exclaimed as he was surprised by the sudden appearance of the cards in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you that they would change your life, just wait until you win a hand.\"  Kiran said.  \"Suki, since you dealt, you bet first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I bet my feet.\"  Suki announced as a holographic display of her feet displayed above her.  Josh didn't know what was going on.  With his Degree in Geology, he looked for an answer, but no matter how much he looked he couldn't find anything that would explain what he was seeing in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, can't find it can you?\"  Suki asked as she looked over to Josh.  He just shook his head.  \"Steven, it's your go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet my legs\"  He announced as his legs appeared above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet my chest, these things are heavy and I don't mind getting rid of them for a little bit.\"  Liz announced as her breasts (with nipples) appeared.  This gave Josh and Carly a fright as they weren't expecting the nipples to be shown too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will bet my torso and feet.\"  Kiran announced as her thin waist and narrow shoulders appeared along with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was at a loss and just decided to go with it, he was always for an adventure and a new experience.  \"I bet my DVD collection and my legs too.\" What appeared to be 4 boxes filled with DVDs appeared and his legs soon came above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are all those DVDs?\"  Kiran wondered as she looked at the boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, when I was in college, I used to work for a movie theater and I stocked up on movies because I got a discount.\"  Josh answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's my go, right?\"  Carly wondered as she looked at the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, luv, it is.\"  Liz answered back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet my hair, hands, and my name.\" Carly said as she saw her hair style, hands, and her name tag appear above her head.  Suki looked at her cards and decided to fold.  Steven and Liz soon filed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will raise the pot with my gender.\"  Kiran said as the female symbol soon hovered above her head.  Both Josh and Carly looked at their hands to ensure that they thought they could win.  They both decided that they didn't want to risk it and soon folded their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you win this one.\" Suki said as she noticed all the wagers that all the players made soon found themselves in front of Kiran and the holographic figures of the characters soon showed up to receive their new traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now Steven, I am going to take your legs and I always wanted to try a bigger bust, so I will try out Liz's for the time being.\"  Kiran announced as she slid these traits into her figure.  Josh and Carly both watched in awe as they saw Kiran's bosom expand and Liz's deflate at the same time until they mirrored each others breasts. \"Now Carly, I think you might enjoy longer hair so I will give your hair to Suki and you can have her shoes.  They might be more comfortable than those you have right now.  Now, Josh, I'm want to try out your DVD collection, but I am not going to take it, I will give you my torso as compensation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then looked down to see his waist narrow down and his chest and shoulders become smaller to match hers. \"Let me guess, you needed something bigger to support your new additions?\"  Josh wondered as he gestured toward her now ample bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran nodded \"Very good observation, just for that, I think I will give you Carly's hands and legs.\"  She said as she brought the last 2 traits over to his character and dropped them off. \"Trust me Carly, you will enjoy the legs over the next several days.  Guy legs seem to be much better at standing around and you won't even get as tired.\" Josh looked down to see that he lost a good inch or two in height with the latest swap.  He raised up his dainty hands to see the french tip manicure now decorating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you do anything with these nails\" he replied to Carly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you will get used to it after a day or two.\"  She replied back to Josh \"I can give you some tips after we are done, if you want.\"  Josh nodded as Steven gathered up the cards and got ready for another hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are really dry, but don't worry, I will take care of them while I have them for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess\"  He replied back to her as he looked down at his hand to see if he hand anything good.  \"He noticed that he had 2 pair, they were pretty low, but he might be able to bluff his way to a win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I dealt, I will lead off,\"  Steven said as he looked at his cards. \"I bet my pants.\" As his pants floated above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will bet my face and arms\"  Liz announced as she glanced up to see her own face and her arms. \"This still freaks me out how lifelike it all looks.\"  Everybody nodded at this comment as they looked at her traits above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will bet my work experience and my hips.\"  Kiran said as a clipboard appeared with papers and some female hips also.  The hips were moving back and forth like she was walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at his cards again, \"I will bet my current outfit. It shouldn't hurt too much, right?\" He wondered as he looked around the group.  Steven gave him a wary look that made Josh second guess his decision.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can do almost anything right?\"  Carly wondered as she looked toward Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, as far as we can tell.\"  Steven replied back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I will bet my childhood memories.\" She decided as a photo album could now be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, I wonder what that will do.\"  Kiran wondered out loud.  Carly shrugged as she thought it might be neat to try if she wanted to give it up, she was still debating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki announced \"I will bet my feet and hands.\"  Her feet and hands soon could be found above. Steven and Liz both decided that this was too much for them and folded their hands instead of wagering more of the their traits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran saw that she had more room to add to the pot, \"I will add my face to the pot too.\"  She said as her face soon floated above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do anything more with this hand.\"  Josh declared as he put his hands down and folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I think I will call with my feet.\"  Carly replied back.  \"Lets see what you got?\"  Carly laid down her cards to show her 3 of a kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That beats my 2 pair\" Kiran announced as she showed her hand to the group.  As if on queue, the pot migrated its way over to the rightful winner of the hand and the characters popped up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to hand out the goodies.\"  Carly announced as she looked over the spoils. \"Steven, I think I will give you Liz's arms, but I will take those pants of yours.\"  She slid his pants onto her character and saw her skirt morph into a pair of black trousers. \"Josh, luv, since you have my legs, I will give you my feet.\"  She then leaned over to whisper in his ear.  \"They match my hands.\"  He could feel his feet start to shrink slightly until they matched her old feet.  \"Josh I will give your current outfit to Suki and I will help you out by giving out Kiran's work experience to help you out.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down to see that he was wearing her Wilko polo shirt, a Wilko fleece jacket and a pair of of tight black trousers. He then felt something around his chest and a slight constriction on his groin and some tugging in this ears as he reached up to feel that they were now pierced and also noticed that his wedding ring was now on on Suki's hand instead of his own.  He opened up his jacket and polo shirt to see that he now had a light pink bra under his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that got swapped too, but don't worry too much.\"  Steven said to him with a reassuringly good manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Kiran, I will give your face to Steven and then I will give Liz's face to you.\"  Carly announced as she slid all the parts to their appropriate new owners. \"Suki, since Josh now has my hands and feet, I think you will let me borrow yours. Oh, and Josh to help you fill out your new pants, I will give you Kiran's hips too. I think I will hold onto my childhood memories for right now, but I might try it later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down at his pants to see that they started to flair out slightly as his bones rearranged to match those of a 17 year old female, and he tried to remember all the previous jobs that he had.  \"Umm...  when you swapped our work experience, you took all of them.  All I remember is working in the departments at Wilko.  Not the jobs in College and High School, just this one.  But it's only for a couple days and I don't think anyone will call me in that time.\"  He said out loud but mostly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Kiran wondered as she thought back.  She remembered the movie theater job, where she cleaned the theaters and worked the box office, working in the clothing store and the office supply stores too.  \"This is so cool.\"  She said to the group.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She handed out the proper number to all the players and then looked down at her hand to see what she dealt herself.  She actually had a decent hand and would try to win this one.  She knew she had to put 1 point down to start the game.  \"I will bet my hands.\"  She said as her hands soon materialized above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran looked and decided to bet too. \"I will bet my hair and I will put my muscles in too, it was fun last time.\"  She said giggling as her musculature appeared above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to see if he could put a nail in the coffin, so to speak. \"I will bet my adventurous spirit and my eyes too.\"  He announced as what looked to be a map with an X on it to mark the location of something and a picture of his eyes also appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked at his eyes and wanted to get a closer look at them.  \"I would kill to have those eyes.  The light and dark blues, they almost look like a starburst cut stone.\"  Josh just nodded, he honestly got that alot. \"I will bet my lips and my nail care skills.\"  Her plump lips and a small book appeared above her head. \"And to make up points, I will bet my skin too.\"  Her smooth, delicate skin appeared above her head too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I think this is going to be a good hand.\" Suki said as she decided to go along with them. \"I will bet my body hair and skin while I am at it.\"  Suki actually liked being a Caucasian for the past couple of days and actually liked growing a slight beard.  She thought she would try to get it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have anything and I will fold this round, besides there is too much at stake at the moment.\"  Steven said as he put his cards on the table. Kiran and Liz also followed by folding their hands too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then said. \"Let's see what you girls have.\"  As he said this, he looked over at Suki and Carly as he got ready to lay his cards down.  He had 2 pair, 8s and 10s, which beat Suki's and he looked over to Carly.  His heart started to beat faster with anticipation, would he actually win this round.  Carly lay down her hand too.  She had the same hand.  Looks like it will be decided with the last card.  \"My last card is a King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked down and smiled.  \"Well, I guess that would beat me, if I didn't have an Ace.\"  Josh was downtrodden as he saw this.  The others tried to comfort him saying that was a close hand and he almost won that round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I was hoping to win a round.\"  Josh said as he forced a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Kiran, I know you enjoyed having muscles the last time, so I will help you this time.  I will give your muscles and hair to Steven.  Steven, luv, I think you look like a darling with your current look.\"  Carly said as she looked at her friend who now looked smaller, but he had a lovely head of hair on his head. \"But I think this will look good too,\" she said as she dragged Liz's hands over to him. \"And regarding lips, I think Josh will love mine for the next couple days, but I will take your lovely eyes.\"  Josh felt his lips and eyes tingle, but only for a moment.  He brought his hands up to his lips and felt that they now felt fuller.  \"I think I will give you my nail care Skills, that way you can take care of my manicure while it's on your hands and I think I will keep my skin right now, but I will give you Suki's body hair, since you pretty much look like a young lady\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh grimaced as he heard this.  He felt his face and it was now smoother than he remembered and glanced over to a mirror that was close by and noticed that his eyebrows were now thinner and arched.  \"I didn't really expect that to happen.\"  He said as he felt his new eye brows.  He then thought about the other changes and looked at his hands and now knew what to do to keep them longer and how to moisturize.  Glancing over to Carly he noticed that she now had his blue eyes, which meant that he now had her hazel eyes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh was starting to have a hard time with the cards since getting Carly's hands, but once he got the skills from her they started to become easier to deal with.  Kiran looked at the cards and made her bet.  \"I will bet my feet.\" She announced as they were now shown above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at his hand and decided that he didn't have anything that would merit betting some of his traits.  \"I am folding, I don't really have anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will bet my age and my voice with accent.\"  Carly said as the number 33 appeared on top of a birthday cake and a music note.  Josh bet he knew who would receive that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..  Carly, don't get me wrong, I like your hair and everything, but it's starting to bother my neck.\"  Suki said as she ran her fingers through her hair to help emphasize what she was talking about.  \"I will bet my current hair, Josh's wedding ring, and my muscles.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grimaced as he heard this, 'At least it won't be as bad as getting Kiran's height'  he thought to himself.  He soon realized that it was now his turn.  \"I bet my job title.\" It was now showing above his head like all the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz saw this and wanted to try something.  \"I saw this on the list and want to try it.  I will bet my life.\"  She saw what appeared to be a soul with her name on it was now floating above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly and Kiran folded, saying that this was starting to get too rich for them.  \"So it's between me and Liz, because I will put in my mouth too.\"  Suki said as she looked at her opponent.  \"Let's see what you have.\"  Suki said to Liz as she showed her the straight that she had in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That beats my 3 of a kind.\"  Liz said as she showed her hand to the group and the bets made their way over to Suki to deal out to the players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki looked at the items and came up with something to do.  \"I am going to put back Josh's wedding ring, but he will need to take Carly's hairstyle and my muscles.\"  She said as she noticed her hair slowly regressed back into her head until it matched Josh's former short brown hair.  Josh on the other hand now had Carly's shoulder length blonde hair.  \"I will take Steven's mouth and I will give him Carly's age and Kiran's feet to go with her legs.  Liz, I will let you keep your life, but I will swap out your job title with Steven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many more rounds should we do?\"  Carly wondered  \"Enough to get all the players a turn at dealing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone thought about this and agreed to this. \"I think that sounds fair.\"  Suki said, \"but I think we should take a quick break.  What do you guys think?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everybody but Josh and Liz nodded, Suki then did proceeded to go over the bets once more.  \"Got it?\"  She wondered to the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I got it.\"  Josh replied back to her as he looked down at his cards.  \"So since Kiran passed out the cards, then that means she goes first, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\"  Kiran responded.  \"And I will start with my hands.\"  Just then a pair of holographic appeared just above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, how did...  what is causing...\"  Josh stammered as he looked all around the salon to see if he could see anything that was really causing these holograms to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't find it can you?\"  Suki giggled.  \"It doesn't matter where you go, you will still see the holograms.  Don't know why it happens, but it does.  Steven, it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\"  Steven continued to look down at his cards.  \"I will put in my age.\"  A birthday cake with the number 36 appeared above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy it last time.\"  Kiran wondered towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was okay, but you might not get it.\"  Steven replied back to her with a wink in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn.\"  Liz said trying to interrupt the moment. \"I will bet my chest.\"  2 large breasts were now floating above her and it took Josh almost everything he had to not to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki looked at her cards and finally made her decision.  \"I will bet my body hair and while I am at it, I will bet my genitals too\"  A diagram depicting the female anatomy and some hairs right next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was surprised by this turn of events.  'I wonder what kind of cards she has.' Josh wondered as he looked at his own cards.  'It doesn't matter, I think I can beat her with these cards.'  \"I guess, I will also bet my chest and I guess my legs too.\"  His bare chest and his legs were now being displayed above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will bet my voice and my accent too.\"  Carly announced as a musical note and the Union Jack appeared next to it.  Josh already knew who was going to be the recipient of that if she won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So 4 more points to stay in.\"  Kiran said to herself.  \"I will bet my hair, muscles and torso too.\"  A model of her hair, musculature, and torso appeared next to her hands.  This seemed to be too much for Liz and Steven, as they folded, not wanting anything else to be put in the pot. \"I guess that's everyone, time to show your cards.\"   Kiran then lay down her hand to show that she had a Full House.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze, Kiran, you could let us put our cards down too?\"  Suki chuckled as she and everyone else folded their useless hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on queue, all of the traits found their way over to Kiran and she looked at them to see who would be the recipient of each.  Little figures popped up in front of her with everyone's names written on them.  \"Let's see here, Steven, your age will go to me and I will give you my muscles too.\"  As soon as she brought it over to him, he seemed to trim down tremendously, while Kiran bulked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you will have fun at work over the next several days.\"  Liz chuckled to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I think I will help you out too, Liz.\"  Kiran said as she brought something over to her figure.  Liz noticed something in her chest as it started to deflate until it reached her new size of Kiran's B-cup.  \"Suki, it seemed that you enjoyed having some body hair, so I will give you Josh's and he can have my hair too, I think he will look cute with it.\"  Josh soon felt his body hair being sucked into his body, while his hair grew out to down past his shoulders.  \"I was right, you do look cute with it and your eyebrows too.  I think I will give you my legs and while I'm at it, I will give your chest to Carly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\"  Josh nearly screamed as he felt Carly's breasts start to push out of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would enjoy them.\"  Kiran said with a smile.  \"You nearly sound like a woman when you screamed, so I will give you her voice and accent too.  Your living in England now, so I think you should sound like it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly soon felt a tingle in her throat.  \"Did it work?\"  She said with Josh's baritone voice and certainly lacking her accent, but instead now sported an American one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes.\"  Josh replied with Carly's voice and accent.  This caused the group to chuckle a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the last two items, I will give my torso to Steven, I need some more support for my new additions.\"  Steven looked down to see his shoulders shrink down in size a bit and his waist contract inwards. \"And I certainly love your hands Carly, so I think I will borrow them for a bit.\"  She brought her hands over to Carly's figure and instantly noticed the nice manicure that she was now sporting on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This certainly is going to be interesting.\"  Josh said to himself with Carly's melodious voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\"  Carly agreed as she was now looking at her new hands.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking at his cards, Steven let out a small, inaudible groan.  \"I will put up my hands.\"  Soon an image of his hands were soon to be found above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz took a long hard look at her hand and finally decided.  \"I will bet my hair.\"  With that bet made, the image of her hair was floating above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was up next, although she didn't have as good of a hand as last time, she still had a somewhat decent one.  \"I think I will bet all my books.\"  A box filled with different titled books could be seen above her.  Everyone at Wilko knew how much of a book worm Suki was.  It seemed like every week, she had a new title that she was finishing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...  I think I will bet my work experience and my height too.\"  Josh wagered as he looked around the table to see if he could find a tell on some of the faces, but alas, there was none to be found.  But this didn't discourage him, he knew that he had a good hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must either have a good hand or you're bluffing.\"  Carly said as she looked Josh in the eyes.  \"I think it's the latter.  So I am going to bet my skin and I guess my Interest in clothing.\"  This was something that Josh didn't really expect.  \"What's wrong Josh?  A little bit too much?\"  She wondered as she smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not at all.\"  Josh answered back.  \"I was just wondering who I was going to give it to when I win.\"  Everyone chuckled at this comment and brought their attention to Kiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will bet my Makeup and my friends again.\"  She said as she didn't look up once.  Steven, Liz and Suki all folded after this bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Kiran?  Need another break?\"  Suki wondered with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\"  Kiran answered back, still not looking up from her cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will call with my pants.\"  Josh exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and I will bet my Beautylicious Shirt.\"  Carly answered back as she looked at him and Kiran.  \"So what do you have?\"  Josh laid down his  cards to show his 2 pair, 8's and 10's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that beats me.\"  Kiran said with an exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may beat her, but it won't me\"  Carly announced as she showed her full house to everyone. \"Now let's see here.  I will let Liz have Steven's hands, but I will give her hair to him.\"  She moved the pieces around to their new owners.  Soon Liz had Steven's manly hands and closely cut hair. \"Hmm...  Suki, I will give your work experience to Liz and I will take your skin.  Kiran your friends will go to Suki and your make up will go to Steven.\"  She did the proper movements and noticed the change almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking good over there Carly.\"  Suki said as she was now observing her new skin tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I think it beats having a tan.\"  Carly chuckled.  \"Now where was I?  Suki your books can go with Steven.  I think your going to have alot more fun with Kiran's friends to read them.  Josh I will take your height and pants.\"  She dragged them over to their new locations.  Carly noticed as her white pencil skirt soon morphed into Josh's black trousers and also her height increased 8 inches until it reached Josh's 5' 10\".  Josh in turn felt the change too, soon he could see Kiran's legs peaking out from his new skirt.  \"You're looking cute over there Josh, but I think you should complete it too by having my shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't help but look down to see he was now wearing her top to accentuate Carly's breasts.  \"I think these are about to pop out.\"  Josh said as he examined his new form.  \"And how can you wear this thing everyday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you get used to it, and plus it's honestly comfortable.  I think this will let you love it a little more.\"  Carly said as she looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no you don't have to do that.\"  Josh said as his eyes were now as big as saucers, but it was too late.  \"I think you are right.  I don't know what I was thinking.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, these clothes are so much more me now anyway.\"  Carly said as she looked down at her frame.  \"But this bra and knickers are really aggravating.  I think  I will have to take care of that next round.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><span class=\"cmaroon\"><i><b>Wilko</b></i></span> is a discount hardware store in a small English town, situated in a town center and surrounded by other businesses. Among these other businesses is a beauty salon named <i><span class=\"chotpink\"><b>Beautylicious</b></span></i>, a small cafe, a florists called <i><b><span class=\"cgreen\">The Rose Garden</span></b></i>, a clothing store, <i><span class=\"clilac\"><b>Internacionale</b></span></i> and an office supply store, <i><span class=\"cblue\"><b>W.H Smiths</b></span></i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the details of this story are the same as the other three. There will not be quite as many characters, but a couple of new protagonists will be introduced in the list below. Plots can be set outside of Wilkos if you like, but please no straying from the character list too much. The story can contain any kind of swaps, transformations and morphs. Whatever your mind can think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Wilko Employees:</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Elizabeth</b>, 30, the acting manager of the store. She has short blonde hair and is of petite build, standing about 5'5\" without her heels on. At work always wears a trouser suit (sometimes a skirt suit), and high heels, her large B-Cup breasts are a \"nice handful\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Liz</b>, 33, is the supervisor of the evening team. She is only 5'4\" tall... but she makes her presence known. Her blondish-brown hair is long, past her shoulders and she wears it in a ponytail. She has large 30H breasts. She is a bit of a tomboy regarding clothes, never seen wearing a skirt, even out of work hours. While at work she wears a red, company polo shirt, black, boot-cut trousers, socks and a pair of flat, black leather, lace-up shoes or sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Steven</b>, 36 years old, he is 6'0\" tall, he wears glasses and is 'average' looking. He isn't one for going out and enjoying himself with others, preferring to stay indoors. He nonetheless likes and gets along with his co-workers and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Caroline</b>, 41 years old, is also a supervisor, but subordinate to Liz, She has shoulder length, straight hair that is a dusty blonde color. She has a voice that is slightly 'graty' but not annoying. She is also 5'5\" tall and has C-cup breasts. She wears her red Wilko blouse, a pair of comfortable trousers, socks and a pair of sensible black shoes. Caroline is there as back-up for Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Natalie</b>, 29, another of the female employees, an attractive woman with shoulder-length, straight brown hair with blonde highlights, she stands 5'6\" tall and is very slender, has a modest backside and breasts that are almost into a C-Cup...but not quite. Not overly curvy, she is still very pleasing to the eye. She is due to be married to her long-term fiance Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rebekah</b>, 20, one of the youngest staff members, very cute girl, about 5'5\" tall, long blonde hair, B-Cup breasts, has a gap between her front teeth that makes her look even cuter. Very warm personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Aaron</b>, 28, he is about 5'10\" tall, quite fit physically. He is a heavy smoker, and not just of cigarettes, he finds it hard not to include foul language in normal conversation. Known for his temper, he sometimes refrains from speaking to anyone if he is in a bad mood, much like Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Helen</b>, 45, standing about 5'7\" tall, she is a very pleasant and likeable woman, with shoulder length, wavy black hair. She is very quiet and has a very girlish giggle when laughing, she is also a smoker, and she's married, like a lot of her colleagues. She has D-Cup breasts and is not what people would call 'slender', but neither is she a large woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Becca</b>, 25, one of the chattiest workers in the store, standing about 5'5\", she LOVES to talk to anyone about anything, she has perky, B-Cup breasts and has a large ass, which some boys actually found sexy. She is always changing her hair color, but it was currently a blood-red color, slightly gothic in appearance, but not a lot. She is an easy person to talk to, but sometimes she doesn't know when to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Waggy\"</b>, 40, (real name Tracey) a bubbly blonde woman, about 5'5\" tall, always in a good mood and knows how to have a laugh, bit of a party girl. She's the mother of two small children, she has a slender build and 36B breasts. At work she wears black trousers and black, slip-on shoes as well as her red company top. \"Waggy\" is Tracey's nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nicola</b>, 44, one of the shortest employees (about 5'0\" high), mother of eight children. She is very out-going and polite, wears her dyed blonde hair up in a bun most of the time, but occasionally she lets it down. Clothing style (at work) is usually a compulsory red company polo shirt, black pants/trousers and a pair of comfortable black flats. Nicola has 36C breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Luke</b>, 22, a tall individual at 6'2\" in height, has a short, crew cut hairstyle and is quite handsome. Not been working at the store for as long as others, is popular and easy going, always one to have a laugh with his friends. He wears a red company shirt, black pants and smart, dress shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Laura</b>, 19, another 'newbie', a shy, quiet girl (except when she's with her boyfriend out of work). Standing about 5'5\" tall, she also wears her dark blonde hair in a pigtail at work, and wears the trademark company polo shirt, black, boot-cut trousers, black tights underneath and a pair of sensible black flats with a single strap across the top of each foot.
