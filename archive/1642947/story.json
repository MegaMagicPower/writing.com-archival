It's been a life-long dream of mine to become one of the greatest pokemon masters even known. To follow my dream, I'm attending a little school called 'Pokebrains Academy'. There, they teach kids how to become the best trainer, breeders, or nurses. So many kids were enrolled, that a new school was created in Route 29. Located there, was our school's rival, 'Brawlfist academy'. It was filled with a bunch of snobby kids who focus of the strenghts of pokemon. I wasn't worried about them. I was mostly focused if I was going to claim my first pokemon choice. I was finally going to graduate and become a trainer! I just hope nothing goes wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was laying on my bed, waiting for my snorlax-decorated clock to ring. I couldn't believe I was just one week away from graduating and off to my journey. I wondered if I was going to get the pokemon I choose. I began to imagine myself in a battle stadium, facing off against a mysterious figure. I pulled out my pokeball, ready to release it. \"Cyndaquil! I choose you!\" I threw the pokeball, as a bright light flashed, and out came a simple free-minded cyndaquil. \"Cyndaquil!\" My opponent released their pokemon, and out came a ferocious steelix. The steelix was coming quick for a bind attack, but I commanded cyndaquil to dodge it and use flamethrower. This caused a great mass of damage against steelix. Then, steelix burrowed into the ground. I looked at the confused and startled expression on cyndaquil's face. \"Keep a sharp eye, Cyndaquil!\" Without a hint, steelix popped out of the ground, blasting cyndaquil into the air. Steelix quickly used its slam attack and brought cyndaquil to the ground. Steelix tried bind again, and it hit successfully. \"Cyndaquil, flamethrower!\" It didn't help as the fire-type was to scared to move. Just as steelix was coming close for crunch, a loud yell filled the stadium...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shank! Get up! It's the final week of school, and you don't want to miss any day!\" I awoke from my fantasy, thinking that I might not have what it takes to become a trainer. I got out of bed, and tried to search some decent clothes to wear. My results were some black jeans, a white T-shirt, and a wristband. It wasn't my choice of fashion, but it was the only thing that was left clean. I headed down the stairs to find heaping plates of food set on the dining table. \"Good morning, honey.\" \"Hey, mom.\" I took a seat. \"Are you excited on your last week of Pokebrains Academy?\" \"Of course! I'm going to get my first pokemon,\" I took a sip of orange juice, \"I get to participate in the annual battle tornuament after the ceremony,\" I took a bite out of a blueberry muffin, \"And then I get to start off on my pokemon journey!\" I was so excited, I couldn't sit still in my seat. \"Well you better hurry, because it seems like some of your classmates are going to school early.\" I looked out the window to see a bunch of kids heading over to the school. \"Oh, Yeah! How could I've forgotten?!\" I totally forgot that I was suppose to get there early to claim the pokemon we picked. \"Sorry, mom, but I got to get going. See you later!\" I grabbed my pack, headed out the door, and stood at the end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line was progressing very quickly, as I saw each kid handed a pokeball and went into the school. It was also a sight to see Professor Elm as the guest of honor, as he congratulated  the students the best of lucks. I saw my best friend, Trever, walk up to me. \"Hey, Shank.\" \"Hey, Trever.\" I noticed the pokeball in his hand. \"Did you the pokemon you wanted?\" \"I sure did! Check it out.\" He tossed his pokeball, and a cute, furry mareep popped out. \"Your mareep looks so cool.\" I started at Trever's mareep, who was chewing on the nearby grass, then cuddling up to Trever. \"Mareep!\" \"It's okay, girl. So do you think your going to get your cyndaquil?\" \"I sure hope so.\" Trever then called back his mareep into her pokeball. \"Well, I better get to class. See you at lunch.\" He then walked into the building. I didn't even realize I was three kids away from getting my pokemon. I just hoped I was going to get a cyndaquil. I started to think of all the fun adventures we might have. \"Next!\" I was next up to meet Professor Elm. \"Why, hello! Fellow trainer.\" \"Hello, Professor Elm.\" \"And what would your name be?\" \"My name's Shank Forroy.\" Professor Elm then started to ruffle through his stacks of paper, until he pilled out a blue slip, one that resembled what pokemon I wanted. \"It seems you wanted a cyndaquil, am I correct?\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"Then let me just check in the back.\" He entered the shed behind him, and left me alone waiting. I was starting to worry if they he ran out of cyndaquils. Professor Elm returned with a pokeball in his hand. \"Is that it?\" With a worried look on his face, Professor Elm nodded. \"What's wrong?\" \"Well it's just that this is the last of the cyndaquils.\" \"Ok. So I'm lucky?\" \"Probably not. You see, there's a slight problem with this one.\" \"Well, what's the problem?\" \"It just that-\" Then a loud honk rang. We turned our heads to the vehicle. The driver pulled his head out of the window. \"Professor Elm! We got a problem at the lab! You must come quickly!\" I turned back to the professor who turned back to me. \"Sorry, Shank, but I got to figure out what's wrong.\" \"But wait. What about cyndaquil?\" \"You'll find out eventually, but right now I got to go.\" Professor Elm jumped into the van, and drove off. Now there was only one question in mind: \"What was wrong with Cyndaquil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't concentrate on my studies. I was still wondering what could be wrong with the cyndaquil I recieved. \"Maybe it has an attitude problem. Maybe it can't use any fire-type moves. Maybe-\" \"Mr. Forroy!\" I looked up to see the annoyed teacher. \"Yes, miss?\" \"Please pay attention! It's not graduation yet.\" \"Yes, miss.\" She turned back to the board, and I saw the rest of the class snickering at me. \"Nice going, shy guy.\" My self-esteem just dropped. When the bell rang, I raced out of that room like a furret. I quickly entered the cafeteria, and found Trever sitting in the usual spot. \"Hey, Trever.\" \"Hey, Shank. Did you get your cyndaquil?\" I turned to the pokeball. \"Yeah..\" \"What's the matter?\" \"It's just... Professor Elm told me that there's something wrong with this Cyndaquil.\" \"Well, what's wrong with it?\" \"That's what I want to know.\" Then we saw the Dean prepare for an announcement. \"Ok, students. Time for our graduates to show off their new pokemon. And not only them, but I gladly invited the graduates from Brawlfist too.\" Everyone groaned at the hearing of everyone's rivals. We all looked over to the side to see those uniform freaks come in. \"The Bests have arrived!\" That guy was Chetz, the popular kid at Brawlfist. He came up to me and Trever's table. \"What's up, geekguy and shyboy?\" \"What do you want, Chetz?\" \"Only to show off the pokemon of the best.\" \"Well, what is it?\" \"Sorry, geek. Your just going to wait like everyone else.\" Chetz then turned his attention to me. \"What's the matter, Shyboy? Meowth got your tounge?\" Him and his posse started laughing at me. Then the Dean got up on stage. \"Ok. Now it's time for the graduates to get up here and show their pokemon. Let's begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood in line once again, watching each graduate show off their starter pokemon. I saw hoppips, woopers, and much more. I saw Trever, who appeared to be next. He stood in the center of the stage, and tossed his pokeball into the air. The circular capsule opened, only to reveal the mareep I saw earlier. The mareep was cuddling against Trever, which caught the audience attention. An applause was created, and both mareep and Trever bowed and left the stage. A few more student were on stage, then it was Chetz's turn. \"Ladies and Gentlemen! I present you... my pokemon!\" He tossed his pokeball into the air, and from my bright light appeared a dark-coated houndour. It howled a mighty roar, and it still made the crowd cheer. They took a bow and left the stage. It was only a few more people till my turn. I just crossed my fingers, hoping my cyndaquil isn't so horrible. It was now my turn. I tried to turn back, but the kids in back of me pushed me on stage. \"Uh, hi.\" It was going well, until some kid said, \"Are you going to show us your pokemon or not?\" \"Oh, yeah.\" I grabbed the ball out of my pocket. \"Here goes nothing.\" I tossed it into the air, and the light flashed, and what appearednext to me was a small, sleepy cyndaquil. It only took a tiny yawn to get the crowd's good side. It looked like I was worried for nothing. I took my words back when cyndaquil looked up at the crowd. As it took a peek, it stood frozen and motionless. \"What wrong with it,\" is what the crowd kept saying. Then Chetz had to talk. \"Looks like the tiny mouse has stage fright, which means it might be shy also! Ha! Like trainer, like pokemon!\" The crowd started to point and laugh at me and Cyndaquil. As I was just in shock, Cyndaquil acted fast, and crawled up my shirt. It's flaming back was heating my skin. \"Ahh!\" I was running around the stage like an idiot! Instead of a bow with an applause, I was laughed off the stage. I ran back to my table, burying my face in shame, and Cyndaquil was still hiding in my shirt.The laughter finally died after the last graduate. I looked at Trever, who felt sorry for me. \"Looks like my pokemon has the same problem as me. That's what I was afraid of.\" Then Chetz appeared at the table. \"Nice choice, Shyboy! That little squeak will never win the tournament. Looks like you'll always be a loser.\" Chetz's houndour growled at Cyndaquil, which caused him to be more startled. \"See you friday, chumps! Ha!\" Him, his posse, and the rest of the Brawlfist students left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Trever were walking home along with their pokemon. I saw Cyndaquil and Mareep chasing each other. \"It looks like they became friends real quick, Trever.\" \"They sure have.\" I was still thinking of what Chetz said. Maybe I don't have what it takes...\"Are you still thinking of what Chetz said?\" \"Uh...\" \"Well he's wrong, dude. I know you have the talents to win the tournament.\" \"You really think so?\" \"Of course.\" We stopped at Trever's house. \"Well, see you tomorrow. Come on, Mareep. I want to show you to the family.\" Then he entered his home, and I started to walk to mine. I carried Cyndaquil home, who kept smiling at me. When I got home, my mom played the trombone, which scared Cyndaquil and hid inside my shirt again. \"Hey, honey! How was your first day? Did you get your pokemon?\" So many questions rushed through me. \"Mom, relax. And yes I got my pokemon.\" \"Let me see him! I can't wait.\" I pulled Cyndaquil out of my shirt, and showed him to my mom. \"He's...so adorable!!\" She grabbed Cyndaquil and squeezed him to death! Cyndaquil quickly struggled out of my mom and ran back under my shirt. \"What wrong with it?\" \"That's the thing. It has a little shy problem.\" \"Oh. I get it.\" My mom tried to sweet-talk Cyndaquil, hoping it would work. \"Here, Cyndaquil. I won't bite. I'm a friend.\" Seconds later, Cyndaquil popped out of my shirt and scurried over to mom. He then snuggled against her. \"See? I'm not scary.\" \"Cyndaquil!\" Later, I was in my room, doing my final homework. I looked at my bean bag chair, where Cyndaquil was soundly sleeping. I was starting to think what Chetz said. \"I going to prove him wrong.\" I looked at Cyndaquil. \"Don't worry Cyndaquil. I'll make sure we'll beat Chetz and win the tournament.\" Another thought ran into mind. \"I'll also promise to take care of you. No matter what!\" I turned off the lamp, crawled into bed, and fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n During the next three days, I've been training Cyndaquil for future battles. I even got Trever and Mareep to help us out. But no matter how much battling we do, I can't seem to get Cyndaquil out of his social problem whenever we went out in public. As we were doing our daily training, Chetz passed by with his houndour. \"Hey, Shyboy, you still training? Why don't you just quit?\" \"Because me and Cyndaquil are working hard to beat you and win the tournament. Right, Cyndaquil?\" Cyndaquil was chewing on an oran berry. \"Cyndaquil!\" Chetz bursted out laughing. \"You really think you have a chance against my Houndour? You must be dreaming, dork!\" \"Oh, yeah? How about we battle right now?\" \"Sorry, dork, but we got some intense training to do. Come, Houndour.\" Houndour growled at the both of us and left with Chetz. \"Grr! Come on, Cyndaquil! Let's keep training!\" We trained hard till it was finally nighttime. \"The tournament's tomorrow! We just gotta win! Cyndaquil, use ember!\" But what I saw was not an ember. \"Woah!\" I quickly grabbed Cyndaquil and hugged him. \"I didn't know you could learn that move yet! Now I'm sure we could win!\" Me and Cyndaquil went back into the house, anticipated for the next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was finally the day! It was the final day of school for me, plus the ceremony and the tournament. I looked down at Cyndaquil, who was happily sleeping on the bean bag. I was still thinking of that expert move he did the night before. Then Cyndaquil woke up drowsy from a hard's day work. \"Today's the day, Cyndaquil! Are you feeling it?\" \"Cyndaquil! Cyndaquil!\" It looked as if Cyndaquil was ready for some battling. I quickly got changed into the same outfit I wore monday, because it seemed to suit me. As we were about to head out the door, my mom caught us. \"And where do you think you two are going?\" We both turned to look at my mom, tapping her foot constantly. \"We were just going to school early for some last-minute training.\" She gave herself some time to think. \"Uh... okay. I'll be at your school later for the ceremony.\" \"Ok, mom. See you later.\" \"Bye, sweeite. Have fun.\" Me and Cyndaquil was outside, smelling the fresh dew of grass, and walked out to Trever's house, who was also out of the house. \"Yo, Trever!\" He turned his head toward my direction. \"Hey, Shank. Ready for today?\" \"Yeah. Sure. Listen. I got to tell you something.\" \"Sure. What is it?\" I came close to Trever's ear, and told him what I saw last night. His expression grew surprised. \"Your kidding!\" \"No, I'm not! It actually happened.\" We both looked at Cyndaquil, who was playing with mareep. \"Well I'm not sure it going to happen very soon again.\" \"Why do you say that?\" \"Becuase he's too young to learn that move yet. That was a one-in-a-million shot move. It'll be rare for it to happen again.\" \"Your probably right. Man, it would have been so helpful for the tournament today.\" \"It would have. But I bet you would do great.\" \"Thanks. Now lets get to school and register.\" \"Ok.\" We were now heading for school, along with our pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school was packed with both Pokebrains and Brawlfist students.It took us a while to find the sign-in desk. \"Hello. We're here to register.\" \"Ok. Just fill out these and bring them back when finished.\" The administraitor handed us two clipboards, filled with paperwork. We picked a table and filled it out. There was something that caught my eye. \"Hey Trever, listen to what this says. 'WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INJURIES OF PAIN CAUSED WHILE BATTLING.'\" \"Sounds dangerous. We better be careful.\" As we were finishing up the paperwork, Chetz came up to us. \"What's up, losers?\" \"We're busy.\" \"Whatever. Just wanted to say that it'll be best to just drop out of the tournament. There no way you guys can beat me.\" \"You'll see. Your going to lose.\" \"We'll see. Smell ya later, wimps!\" Then him and his posse left in the crowd. \"I can't wait to cream him.\" \"Just keep your cool, Shank. You still got time.\" \"Your right. Let's turn in these paperworks.\" We brought out paperwork back to the desk. The dean grab a microphone and started to speak. \"Okay everyone! Time to start the ceremony! Graduates form a line to the stage, and parents can sit where ever they please.\" We all quickly got into a single line, and I was neither far nor close. Every student felt so estatic that they were graduating. When I got on stage, I grabbed my diploma, shook the Dean's hand, and hugged the hottest secretary in the school. I could have sworn she placed her number in my pocket and winked at me when I walked away, but I would deal with that later. Right now I was focused on the tournament. After we all took pictures, the Dean began to speak. \"Okay everyone. Now that the ceremony's over, let the tournament begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly changed out of my gown and put on the clothes I normally brought here. We were all called out whenever it was our turn to battle. I was up first, against a fellow friend of mine. His name was Asthon, and he look like he was going to throw a tantrum. \"I'm going to squash you like a bug!\" \"Asthon, why are you yelling?\" \"Oh, sorry, Shank. I just want to get my trashtalk right. What is good?\" \"Good enough to get me frightened.\" \"Cool. Good luck.\" \"You too.\" \"Trainers Ready? Go!\" Asthon made the first move. \"Shuckle! I summon you!\" He threw the pokeball, and his shuckle appeared for battle. \"Ok, Cyndaquil. Let's go!\" I released my pokemon to get the match started. \"Ok, Shuckle. Use constrict!\" Shuckle came close to Cyndaquil's personal space. \"Ok Cyndaquil. Jump over shuckle and use tackle!\" Cyndaquil did as he was commanded as he flipped over shuckle and was heading for it with tackle. Shuckle quickly reacted and popped through another one of its holes. Cyndaquil's move failed, and constrict hit perfectly. Shuckle tossed him over to a corner, leaving him bruised. \"Ok, Shuckle! Finish him off with constrict!\" I was starting to panick. \"Don't give up, Cyndaquil! Use smokescreen!\" The whole area went dark, as shuckle couldn't see where Cyndaquil has gone. \"Where he go?\" \"Cyndaquil, use ember!\" Then my blazing mouse appeared behind shuckle and spouted flames from its mouth and hit Shuckle. \"No!\" \"Now finish with tackle!\" Cyndaquil charged until it made an instant hit on shuckle, and left him out cold. \"Shuckle is unable to battle. The winner is Shank and Cyndaquil.\" The crowd went wild as I won the first match. It didn't look so well as Cyndaquil was tired out. \"Take a good rest, buddy.\" I sent Cyndaquil back into his pokeball, and enjoyed the rest of the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tournament got real intense, as Trever barely made it to the second round, and it was no surprise that Chetz passed. Match after match passed, and only four contestants were left. I was up against Trever, and the tension was rising. We stood on the opposite ends of the fields, bowing before the match starts. \"Don't hold back, Shank. It wouldn't be fair.\" \"I'll give it my all, dude!\" \"Trainers Ready? GO!\" I brought out my Cyndaquil, who look healthy and ready to battle. Trever brought out his Mareep, and we were ready to brawl. Trever made the first move \"Mareep, use tackle!\" Mareep was charging, but not quick enough. \"Cyndaquil, dodge and use tackle as well.\" When Mareep got close enough, Cyndaquil dodged and tackled Mareep. It was a good start. \"Okay. Time to turn up the heat. Mareep, use thunder wave!\" A wave of electricity struck Cyndaquil and paralyzed him. \"Ok. Mareep use tackle!\" Mareep was charging once again. \"Cyndaquil, dodge it!\" He was about to move, but static ran through his fur. \"Oh, no!\" Mareep tackle him badly. \"Ok, Mareep, do it once more!\" Mareep was charging again. \"Cyndaquil, use smokescreen!\" The field darkened again. \"Cyndaquil, use ember!\" \"Mareep, dodge!\" Mareep dodged the flames, and then the smoke faded. \"Mareep, use thundershock!\" The attack was quick, and Cyndaquil was hit. \"How can get Mareep to stop attacking?\" I gave it some thought. \"Now I know!\" \"Mareep, tackle!\" Cyndaquil, smokescreen!\" Cydaquil was still paralyzed, and was hit by tackle. \"I don't think he can take another hit! I hope this works. Cyndaquil, smokescreen!\" The smoke reappeared again, and everything was set for my plan. \"Ok, Cyndaquil, tackle Mareep into the air!\" Cyndaquil wasn't effected by any shock in his body, and blasted Mareep into the air. \"What are you planning, Shank?\" \"Cyndaquil, use ember under Mareep's body!\" Then Cyndaquil blasted tiny spurts of flames directly towards Mareep. It was a direct hit. Mareep came down with a thud, out cold. \"Mareep is unable to battle. The winner is Shank and Cyndaquil!\" The crowed cheered once again. I walked up the battlefield, meeting up with Trever. \"That was a great match, dude.\" \"Good luck in the final's, Shank.\" Then we walk out into the lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was now up against Chetz, who looked pretty determined. It was the final match of the tournament. It was all or nothing. I walked up to the field, seeing Chetz already there. \"Ready to lose, wimp?\" \"Nope. But you are.\" \"Your going to eat those words!\" \"Trainers Ready? Go!\" Chetz quickly released his houndour. It looked as mighty as ever. I let Cyndaquil out to get the match started. \"Houndour, use Howl!\" Houndour was starting to yell a deafening tone. \"Cyndaquil, use tackle!\" Cyndaquil was rushing over to houndour with anger. \"Houndour, dodge and then use ember!\" Houndour quickly moved and burned Cyndaquil. \"Oh, no!\" \"You haven't seen nothing yet! Houndour, use bite!\" \"What?!\" With Cyndaquil burned, Houndour bit him very hard. \"Houndour learned bite that quick?\" \"Let's just say we had some perfect training. Can you handle the heat?\" He was sorta right. This was going to be hard to beat. \"Cyndaquil, use smokescreen!\"  The smoke filled the field. \"It's not going to work with me! Houndour, use roar!\" The roar not only blew away the smoke, but it startled Cyndaquil. \"Houndour, use bite again!\" Houndour ran up to Cyndaquil and bit him once more. Cyndaquil yelled in pain. \"Cyndaquil!\" \"This isn't good! Oh, if only he could know that move.\" \"This tournament's all in the bag. Houndour, use bite with all your might!\" I only had one choice and to use that one move. It was a risk, btu it was the only way. \"Cyndaquil, use smokescreen!\" The smoke raised. \"That's not going to save you now, wimp! It's over!\" I couldn't hold it much longer! \"Cyndaquil, use fire blast!\" Just as all hope seemed lost, a miracle appeared. As Houndour came close, Cyndaquil blasted a star-shaped blaze out on houndour. \"It's not possible!\" The crowd was shocked, to believe such a small pokemon could learn such a move. It blated Houndour across the field, out cold. \"Houndour is unable to battle. The winner of the tournament is Shank and Cyndaquil!\" Everyone jumped out of their seats and screamed my name, along with Cyndaquil. I wanted to congraduate Chetz, but he left the field without a word. Now I was ready to start my journey. I had what it took to be a pokemon master!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked home with Trever, as we both stared at the trophy I won. \"I can't believe I beat Chetz! That'll teach him to mess with me again.\" \"Ok, calm down, champ.\" We made it to my house, seeing a van parked out front. \"That looks like Professor Elm's van.\" \"I wonder what's he doing here.\" \"I don't know. Let's check and see.\" We walked in, seeing my mom and Professor Elm sitting on the couch. \"Shank! I heard you won! Congradulations!\" \"Thanks, mom!\" I turned my attention to Professor Elm, who was enjoying a slice of cake. \"Why, hello again, Shank.\" \"Hey, Professor Elm. What are you doing here?\" \"Well I just here to give you this.\" He pulled out six pokeballs and a pokedex. \"Your going to need these for your journey.\" \"Thanks, Professor!\" \"Let me just tell you this isn't going to be a walk in the park. your going to face many challenges along the way, and your probably going to face them alone.\" \"No he's not. Becuase I'm going to go with him.\" Trever stepped in the conversation. \"Well two trainers are more better than one. But you guys do know survival skills, right?\" \"Of course.\" To tell the truth, I couldn't tell the difference between poison ivy and a regular leaf. \"Here, honey. I already got your stuff packed.\" \"Thanks, mom. Your the best.\" \"Just be careful out there. I wouldn't want you to get hurt.\" \"Don't worry. I won't.\" \"Also, Shank. To start off, you might want to entered your first gym in violet city.\" \"Sure thing. I'll see you later.\" Me, Trever, and our pokemon walked down the trail to route 29, heading towards violet city to win my first gym badge. It was the beginning of my pokemon journey, feeling new foes, new allies, and many challenges are planned for me.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shank was surprised to see <br>\r\nProfessor Elm at his front steps, congradulating him in person. He was getting packed up to start his enormous journey. Now our heroes are traveling through Route 29, excited about their new journey, and hoping to catch some wild pokemon.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry!\" I was walking along the grassy plains, trying to ignore the whines of Trever. \"Dude, I'm hungry. Can we go back?\" \"No. We need to work on our survival skills i we're ever going to get good at this. And besides, what happened to all the trail mix you had?\" \"I ate it all...\" I wasn't all that surprised, since Trever was never any good with food. \"Fine, you can have some of mine.\" \"I ate all of yours too.\" I wasn't expecting that. \"What the-\" I grabbed my bag harshfully, hoping what Trever said wasn't true. I looked inside. No trail mix. \"Why did you eat MY trail mix?\" \"Because I was hungry. Can't we just go back.\" \"No.\" \"Why?\" \"It's in the guide.\" \"What guide?\" I pulled out my junior \"Trainer Journeys for Nitwits\" from my pocket. I kept flipping pags till I got to the tips. \"It says here that Trainers must never turn back if they want to succeed.\" \"Can I see that book?\" \"Sure.\" I handed it to Trever, who suddenly ripped it to shreds. I looked down at the million pieces that was once a book. \"Great. Now we're going to be lost.\" \"We'll, if we go back, we can get another one.\" \"If you haven't eaten all our food, we wouldn't be in this mess.\" We started to fight like a couple of bickering Mankeys. We kept snapping against each other, until we saw a Sentret out in the open. We bother turned to each other, looking to see who was going to catch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's mine.\" \"No, it's mine. I saw it first.\" We started to fight again, but decided to stop, so we wouldn't scare the wild pokemon away. \"Ok, Trever. The only way we're going to decide is to toss this coin.\" \"I call heads!\" \"Ok... here we go!\" I flip the copper coin into the air,watching it land on the grass. We both tilt our heads to see what has landed. \"Heads! Yes! Now watch and learn, Shank.\" I stepped back to see Trever attempt to catch that Sentret. \"Ok, Sentret. Prepare to be mine. Come on down, Mareep!\" He threw out Mareep, looking fiesty and pumped up. \"Use thunder wave!\" A lighting wave was coming straight at Sentret, until it quickly dodged and used scratch on Mareep's body. Then is quickl used quick attack, damaged Mareep sme more, and fleed from the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice 'battling', dude.\" \"Shut up. It's not like you could have done better.\" \"I bet I could have. Let's find somwhere to rest.\" We found a hill to sit down a take a rest. \"Cyndaquil, come out.\" Cyndaquil was looking bashful and ready to sleep. We all turned to Mareep, who looked depessed. Trever became concerned. \"What's wrong, Mareep?\" \"Mareep!\"  had a feeling what was wrong with it. \"Your sad because you couldn't catch the Sentret for me, right?\" She nodded he head. \"It wasn't your fault. We just need to work on our stradegies, that's all.\" \"Yeah, Mareep. Everyone isn't perfect, you know?\" Cyndaquil came close to Mareep, trying to cheer her up. Mareep grew a small smile. While we al tried to chill, a rattata appeared in sight. Me and Trever went at it again, fighting who was going to get the pokemon. I looked over to Mareep, who looked determined to catch this pokemon. Rattata started to run away, and Mareep decided not to lose it. \"Mareep,where are you going?\" Mareep left far enough to be ut of our sight. \"What are we still doing here? Let's catch her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe crossed over the many patches of grass in this route. We got pecked by some pidgeys, scratched by some sentrets, but it was easy to scare them away with Cyndaquil at my side. We look everywhere, but we still couldn't find Mareep. We saw from a distance, Mareep facng off against the rattata. Rattata used tackle and kept running. Eventually the two pokemon ended up in front of an open gate. \"I can't believe it.\" I looked up at the title of the school. Brawlfist Academy. \"So this is where it's located.\" I brought Trever down to hid in nearby bushes. \"Will you zip it? If they found out Pokebrain kids were here, who knows wat the could do to us?\" \"You just worry too much. Now if you'll excuse me, I got to get Mareep back. He jumped out of the bushes, trying to tame his pokemon. \"Come here, Mareep. I don't need a rattata.\" Mareep was ust about to obey until rattata used tail whip in her face, and got her irritated. Rattata ran through the gates, and Mareep followed. \"Mareep, no!\" Trever suddenly chased after her. \"Terver, what are you doing?\" I just couldn't let him go alone. I looked at Cyndaquil, who seem confused about the whole situation. \"I don't know how this is going to turn out. Lets go help them.\" \"Cyndaquil!\" We ran out of my hiding hole and went after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrever caught Mareep around the corner, as she tried to struggle out of his hands. \"Mareep, forget rattata! Let's just go.\" Soon, Mareep did calm down, and forgot why she was all figitive. Cyndaquil suddenly turned around, becoming alert. \"Cyndaqil, what's wrong?\" He tried to point out the problem. I saw someone coming close to us. \"Excuse me, gentlemen.\" We both got scared, afraid to turn around. \"I said excuse me!\" We quickly turned the other direction, looking at a suited man, with wild hair picking out. Neither of us wanted to talk, but we had no choice. We were deep in their lair, so their was no way we could get out of this easily. \"Hello?\" \"Yes, sir?\" \"Do you go to this school?\" \"No, sir. We just-\" \"Then why are you here?\" This guy raised his voice in a heartbeat. \"We just needed to get our Mareep back. That's all.\" He looked across the side of the building, then back to us. \"Looks to me as if you guys were stealing that pokemon from the inventory.\" \"No. That's not true.\" \"Listen, punks! I'm the dean of this school, and I won't allow theiving.\" He pulled out a walkie-talkie. \"Yeah, I'm going to need back-up. I got some thieves in my hands.\" In a couple of seconds, The dean's goons showed up. They grabbed me, Trever, and our pokemon. They carried us to the gate and threw us out, all except Mareep. \"I'm putting this pokemon back where it came from. Have a good day, boys.\" \"NO!\" Trever tried to run back for what rightfully belonged to him, but the gates closed shut, and we were locked out from the outside. \"Aw, man! How am I going to get Mareep back?\" \"Don't worry, dude. I got a plan.\" \"Really?\" \"No. But let's stay here and figure something out.\" We sat behind the bush, thinking of brilliant ideas to get Trever's fellow Mareep back in his care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Me and Trever were sitting around for an hour and a half, with not a single thought on how to break into the school, get Mareep back, and get out safely. Just as we were about to give up, the same rattata appeared in front of our eyes. \"You!\" Trever couldn't keep his cool, trying to strangle the wild rat. \"Trever, calm down!\" \"If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be in this mess!\" The rattata was startled and fleed. \"Man, I can't wait any longer! I'm just going to jump the fence and get her back.\" \"Will you just wait? A chance will come.\" \"When? I can't wait no more!\" \"Will you just-\" All of a sudden, the gates started to open with an annoying creaking sound. We tipped our heads over the bush, a saw two janitors walking over with a pile of trash. \"You know, I think I should ask the boss for a raise.\" \"You do that, and you'll be looking for a job. You know the boss is cheap.\" \"Yeah, but it wouldn't hurt to raise a salary.\" \"Your probably right.\" We got bored of the conversation, and I just got an idea. \"Trever, I got it!\" \"Tell me, dude!\" \"Ok. The only wa we get in is if we were part of the school.\" \"Which we're not.\" \"We're about too.\" We looked back at the janitors, knowing we had the same idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe waited for the right chance for the janitors to get close enough. Once they past by the bush, we hopped out of the bushes, grabbed them, and brought them back behind the bush. We held them down close to each other, forcing them to face Cyndaquil. \"Ok, give up the I.D.'s, uniform, and fake assesories. If you don't...\" I pointed to Cyndaquil, prepared for a fire-attack. They started to dtch the outfits, throw out thir I.D.'s, and strip off their moustaches. I looked into my bag, pulled out some rope, and tied them. Trever found tape, and placed some over their lips. \"We better hurry. Who knows how long until they get out.\" \"Your right. Let's go.\" We quickly crossed the gate before it closed, and finally infiltrated the school. Inside it was a dump. The bathroom, hallway, and even classrooms. A dump. \"Don't these janitors do their jobs?\" We were walkin along the dirty path, until a group of overweight students came up to us. \"Hey, Janitors! You might want to check to bathroom, because I left a big one there!\" His posse started to laugh at me and Trover. They came close to us and knocked us down, leaving Trever taste his mop, and my head stuck in a bucket of waste. The kids laughed on their way to class. \"I hate this school!\" \"Will you calm down?\" \"I been calming down all day! And do you know what happened?\" \"Shh. Quiet.\" I needed him to hush down, so I could hear what was going on in the room near us. We looked up at the sign, knowing it was the place: Pokemon Inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe barged in the room, in pefect timing to see the dean trying to get Mareep into a pokeball. \"Incompenent pokemon! Will you get in the ball?!\" \"She's not stupid! Mareep, use thundershock!\" \"You two again?\" In seconds, the Dean was shocked by Mareep, and let her go. Mareep quickly jumped into Trever's arms, cuddling for forgiveness. \"It' ok, girl. Your safe.\" The dean seemed pretty ticked off. \"Guards!\" Once again, the goons came back to follow their boss's orders. \"Seize the pokemon their trying to steal.\" \"For the last time, this is my pokemon!\" \"How can you be so sure?\" \"Becuase she obeyed to use thundershock on you, didn't she?\" \"True, but if that's the case, what were you two doing at Brawlfist Academy?\" \"We'll,you see... there was this Sentret and-\" \"I don't want to hear your lies! Your not leaving this school so easily.\" \"What do you want from us?\" \"I want your Mareep.\" Trever was surprised. \"What?! Why?\" \"Because it would cost me a bunch for just one. It'll be better if I just took one.\" \"And what if I don't give her up?\" \"Then I'll call the police for trespassing.\" I quickly grabbed Trever by the shoulder. \"What sould we do, Shank?\" \"Leave it to me. Again.\" I decided to speak up. \"Look, Dean. How about a battle?\" \"You want to battle a dean? A much more experience battler, in my days.\" \"I'm not going to battle you.\" \"No?\" \"Nope. He is.\" I pointed at Trever, who was even more baffled. \"Are you serious?\" \"Well, this is your pokemon on the line. This is your battle.\" Trever took a long thought. \"Ok. I'll do it. I'll battle you.\" \"Excellent. Now follow me to the auditorium, so everyone can see you fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe follow the Dean until we reached he auditorium. We looked around to see a huge crowd chanting the same line: \"Squash him dead! Squash him dead!\" \"I guess these kids hate visitors.\" \"Yeah. I better win, or I lose my pokemon.\" \"You'll do fine. Just go out there and give ityour all.\" Trever walked over to his side of the field, along with the Dean waiting at the opposite side. \"You ready tobe taught a lesson, kid?\" \"We'll see who gets taught.\" I stayed in the sidelines with Cyndaquil, cheering Trever and Mareep to win. \"Trainers, and Deans, ready? Go!\" Trever already had Mareep on the field, looking frightened and scared. \"Now to come out and support, Sneasel!\" He tossed his pokeball, and out came a sleazy sneasel. \"Mareep, use thunder wave!\" A slash of statc was heading for Sneasel. \"Sneasel, dodge.\" In a flash, Sneasel sprinted out of the way. \"Wow, Cyndaquil. Sneasel's sure are fast pokemon. We gotta remember that.\" \"Sneasel, use faint attack!\" Quickly, Sneasel came close and strikes Mareep hard. \"Are you all right?\" \"Mareep!\" \"Ok, then. Try thunder wave once more!\" Another slice of static was attempted again. \"Sneasel, dodge and use fury swipes!\" Again with its incredible speed, Sneasel dodged and swiped furious slashes upon Mareep's face. Mareep looked so hurt to stand up and fight some more. \"Trever, remember! If you fail, you lose Mareep!\" \"Thanks for reminding me!\" \"Just think! How can you stop a pokemon with so much speed?\" Trever thought long and hard. \"I got it!\" \"Sneasel! Finish with Fury swipes!\" Mareep was frightened not being told anything. \"Just hold it, Mareep. We need to be patient.\" They wated till Sneasel got close enough. \"Mareep, use thunder wave!\" \"What?!\" Just before Sneasel had a chance to touch Mareep, it was hit by a slash of static. \"No! Sneasel, use faint attack!\" Sneasel tried to move, but it was paralyzed all around. \"Now, Mareep, use thundershock with all your electric power!\" Mareep came charging in against the immobilized pokemon, and shocked the lights out of it. It timbered down to the gym floor. \"Sneasel is unable to battle! The winner is Mareep and trainer!\" Though I was the only one cheering, everyone else booed and threw lunch at us. \"You won! Now let's get out of here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe quickly ran out the building before we got hurt. We hid in the bushes, still seeing the tied up janitors there. We pushed them into the way of the mob, and watched as they got carried into the school. \"Well that was a day's worth of fun. Now what do we do?\" \"I think I know.\" I pulled out a pamphlet from the enterance. \"It's a map of the Johto region, since you did rip up my guide.\" \"Well, where sould we go now?\" \"Let me see...\" I flipped age to page, until I found what was near oute 29. \"There's suppose to be a city called CherryGrove up ahead.\" \"Well, if we have more like these, it'll be a fun journey.\" \"Yeah. You stll feel like going back now?\" \"Heck, no! Let go on to Cherrygrove city and find some food.\" \"Let get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Using their day by saving a fellow friend, out heroes head on out to Cherrygrove City, hoping to experience new adventures such as today. What will be in store for them? Find out...)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt like years since we've been in a town. I think I need to reload our items.\" \"Yeah, yeah. I think I'm going to find some food.\" As we were planning on what to do, a slim, looking stranger came up to us. \"Hey, how you doing?\" He was talking at a fast pace. \"We're-\" \"That's nice. How about buying some rods?\" \"Huh?\" He quickly opened his jacket, showing an inventory of packed rods. \"Just 10 bucks, what do you say?\" Trever stepped in. \"Sure!\" He pulled out 10 bucks, and the stranger snatched the money, threw the rod at us, and ran into Route 29. \"Well. That was strange.\" \"Who cares? I got a rod!\" Then another guy came up to us. I made sure it wasn't a scam. \"Hi-\" \"Are you going to sell us something?\" \"No. I'm the guide guy.\" \"And?\" \"I'm here to give you a guide.\" \"Sure!\" Trever stepped in, making undecided decisions. \"What are you doing?\" \"Come on. What can possible happen?\" \"Splendid! Let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked up to a red and white building, with a shape of a pokeball printed on the roof. \"This is the pokemon center.\" \"Cool. I read about it back in Pokebrains. It kind of like a hospital for injured pokemon, right?\" \"Correct. They're located all over the world.\" \"That's cool.\" We went inside for a veiw of the inside. Inside, there was a main desk, some comfty couches, and a white machine. \"If I'm right, that must be a PC.\" \"That's right.\" Trever seemed annoyed. \"Must you know everything?\" \"I'm just saying.\" We canceled our dispute, and listened to the guide. \"This machine is used to switch out pokemon with others you caught.\" Trever raised his hand. \"Yes?\" \"Where do the pokemon go when you've had your seventh catch?\" \"They go to the person who gave you your first pokemon.\" \"Then that would be professor Elm.\" \"Sure.\" We now headed over to the desk, where a young nurse was filing some paperwork. \"This is Nurse Joy.\" \"Why hello. Are you beginners?\" \"Yes, we are.\" \"Well don't be shy to ask any questions.\" She must have not known I was shy. Trever spoke up. \"I got a quest-\" Then a chansey popped out from the backroom. \"Chansey, Chans!\" \"Really?\" she looked back at us. I'm sorry, but I got a bunch of hurt pokemon. There's been a lot of injuries today for some reason.\" \"Well, you can go and we'll just come back later.\" \"Ok. Be safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe exited the pokemon center, heading down the building next to it. \"I wonder why there's so many injured pokemon today?\" \"Calm down, Shank. I bet they just battled each other harshly.\" Our next stop was at a blue and white building. \"This is the poke'mart. Its where you can buy stuff necessary for traveling. \"That's just what I need!\" We went inside, and saw that it looked like a grocery store. I saw many people buying ropes, pokeballs, and potions. \"Well, we should get going.\" The guide led us out, but I knew I was coming back anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lead to some outside features. We saw patches of flowers, being watered by the people living here. \"This is what makes our town so graceful.\" \"The flowers?\" \"Yes. People come here because of the sweet aroma of these wonderful flowers.\" \"That's cool.\" \"Yes. It is.\" He led us to a giant pool of water. \"Out here is an offshore island. There is somone who lives there, but he rarely comes out.\" \"Why? Because he's afraid of people?\" If that was the reason, I could see why. \"No one knows the reason for why he stays there. He rarely has any visitors.\" \"Hey.\" Trever needed to say something. \"Does this lake have pokemon?\" \"Yes. Why?\" \"Cool! I'm going to catch some pokemon.\" I turned back to the guide. \"I think we're done with the tour. Thanks.\" \"No problem.\" He reached into his pocket, pulling out a sheet of paper. \"No, thanks. We already got a map.\" \"But I'm not giving you a map.\" \"Huh?\" I opened the paper, and found cash inside. \"Wow! How much is in here?\" \"2000.\" \"But why?\" \"Because I see your going to need a lot of help in your journey.\" \"Well, if that's the case, then thanks.\" \"No problem.\" He looked over at route 29, seeing another bunch of confused rookies waiting near route 29. \"I better get going.\" \"Ok. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was with Trever, who was testing out his rod at the lake. I stared over at the house far away, thinking about the man who lived there. I was also thinking of the kids who had their pokemon injured. \"Something tells me those kids's pokemon weren't hurt in battling each other.\" \"Your still thinking about that? Sheesh, you should stop worrying and enjoy that your not hurt.\" Trever's carelessness was beginning to annoy me. \"But don't you even feel a little bit of sadness for those kids?\" \"Not really.\" \"Ugh. Whatever.\" \"What? You want me to feel bad for a couple of strangers, who I've never met before?\" \"You know, I'm just going to go to the pokemart to stock up on our supplies.\" \"Sure.\" \"Then I'll go to the pokecenter and talk to those kids about what happened.\" \"You'll know where to find me.\" \"Ok.\" I made my way to the pokemart, knowing Trever wasn't going to join me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited in the long line, with a bag of 5 pokeballs in one hand, and another bag filled with 3 potions. \"I bet Trever already caught a bunch of water pokemon.\" I was next in line, ready to make my purchase. The cashier seemed quite friendly. \"Ok. That'll be... 1900 pokemoney.\" \"What?\" \"Hey, these are the prices, kid.\" \"Man. I pulled out the bunch of money the guide guy gave me, and paid off my supplies. \"Come again!\" \"Sure..\" I turned to the door, but quickly crashed into a mysterious person, with a sharp hat covering their face, and a dark coat on. \"Watch it, punk!\" The vioce was feminine. \"Sorry.\" She quickly left the store. \"What the hack was all about?\" I rushed out the store, trying to find where she went, but no trace of her was marked. I forgot about her, and paced over to the pokemon center, to get some information on the kids. When I entered, I saw a new victim, who looked like he just got beat up. \"Excuse me. Can I talk to you?\" The guy turned around, having a recognizable face. \"Trever! What happened?\" He had mareep in his arms, looking badly injured. He tried to speak, but fainted on the floor, along with Mareep. I got close to him, trying to hear what he was whispering. \"Don't..Lake..Bad...\" He was then out as a light. The only thing questioning in my mind was: What's happening in the lake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nusre Joy came it with Chansey, and they both looked worried. \"Nurse Joy! Will they be all right?\" \"Well I only specialize in pokemon, not people, Shank.\" I began to feel bad inside. I shouldn't have left Trever alone. I knew something was up with this town. \"But I think that both of them just need some rest. I know for sure Mareep will be ok, since we treated it. I think Trever will need some rest, and he'll be good as new.\" \"That's good to hear.\" We just stood, until I needed to ask her something. \"Nurse Joy?\" \"Yes?\" \"Do you know why so many kids are getting hurt today?\" \"I don't know what's happening, but everyone who came in kept mentioning the lake. Maybe you should ask them what's going on.\" \"That seems good.\" Follow me.\" I followed Nurse Joy out of the room, and into a bigger one, filled with her kids, along with their pokemon. I just heard the groaning and cries of all these kids in pain. Nurse joy led me to a boy with a cap, who was caring for his damaged Ledyba. \"Damien, here, has been the first one to get hurt. Due to that, he's been recovering. He must be healthy enough to talk about what happened.\" Damien raised his head. \"Hello.\" \"Damien?\" \"Yes, Nurse Joy?\" \"This is Shank.\" \"Hi, Shank.\" \"Hi.\" \"He wants to know what happened to you.\" \"Ok.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a seat next to Damien, ready to hear out his story. \"Well, me and my friends were outside, ready to catch some pokemon near the lake. We were planning on getting a Krabby or Corsola. We were getting no bites, and my friends were getting pretty bored. We left to go somewhere else, but I heard a noise behind a bunch of boulders. I told my friends I would catch up with them. I went to see what was hidden behind those large boulders, and what I saw was just horrible. I knew why no water pokemon were biting. They were captured in a giant orb, and I didn't like how the pokemon were bunched up together. I brought out my pal, Ledyba, to help me free those pokemon. He used comet punch so many times, but the orb wouldn't break. Then I heard a command behind me, and when I turned around, I was hit by a beam of light.\" \"Then what happened?\" \"I was knocked out. When I woke up, I was in the middle of town, with a crowd surrounding me. I looked to my side, seeing Ledyba hurt. I quickly got the strenght to pick him up, and carried him to the pokemon center. Now here I am, trying to take care of him.\" I looked over to Ledyba, who looked he had trouble breathing. I got up from my seat, and was heading out for the door. Nurse Joy was worried. \"Shank, where are you going?\" \"To find our who's responsible for all this.\" \"Please, Shank! I don't need anymore injured people.\" \"Don't worry. I'll be fine. What could possible happen?\" I walked out of the center, feeling confident and thinking I can fix this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Cyndaquil were standing in the sandy area, looking for those boulders. \"There they are, Cyndaquil!\" I pointed over to two giant boulders, big enough for something to be hidden. \"Let's go.\" I began to walk over there, but Cyndaquil wouldn't make a move. \"What's wrong?\" \"Cyndaquil! Cynda!\" I think I had a thought what he was saying. \"Look, if your scared, then you can just stay here.\" Cyndaquil moved back to the grassy area. I need his help, whether he liked it or not. \"Ok, but I'm doing this for the kids, who'd probably give the hero some reward for such bravery...\" Cyndaquil came running back to my side. \"That's the spirit. Now let's get ot the bottom of this.\" \"Cynda!\" We walked over to the boulders, checking our surroundings, until we saw it. We saw the giant orb containing all those water pokemon. \"Cyndaquil. Try to use tackle on a certain spot.\" \"Cynda.\" Cyndaquil started to bang his head at the contraption. He kept tryingand trying, but not a single scratch was implanted. \"Just like Damien said.\" I kept watching Cyndaquil use tackle until I saw a reflection. It was a pink pokemon and a person in it. \"Espeon, use Psybeam! \" \"Cyndaquil, move!\" We both moved out of the way from the beam of light. We looked at who did it, and just found two stranger with two pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyndaquil came over to me, trying to help me pick myself up. \"Thanks.\" I looked back at the strangers. One of them was the woman I ran into back into the pokemart. \"Who are you?\" \"We're the baddest of the bad. The best of the best. We're...\" The took of their coats and hats. They were in uniform. They were two blondes, who looked exactly the same. \" I'm Judy.\" \"And I'm Trudy.\" \"And we're the mischievous twins. We capture pokemon and returned them back to base.\" \"Well, what's the base's name?\" \"We've said enough, already. And you have seen too much. Espeon, get ready for battle!\" Espeon looked very fierce. Trudy brought out her pokeball. \"Let's go, Umbreon!\" She let out the dark version of Eevee. \"Espeon, use Psybeam!\" \"Umbreon, use Faint attack!\" Both of the twins pokemon came straight for Cyndaquil. \"Cyndaquil, use smokescreen!\" The area became cloudy, and Cyndaquil merged into the shadows. \"Now use ember!\" Cyndaquil spurted his flames, and burned Espeon. \"You good, kid. But not good enough to beat us.\" \"That's right, Judy.\" \"Thanks. Now Espeon, use helping hand!\" \"And Umbreon, use Pursuit!\" Espeon was giving power to Umbreon, then Umbreon striked Cyndaquil with Pursuit. \"Cynda!\" I could see that Cyndaquil was getting hurt. They both talked on the same line. \"Now use Psybeam and Faint Attack!\" I knew this was going to be good for both me and Cyndaquil. We thought we were finished until someone called out an attack. \"Scizor, use X-scissor!\" Then a bright red Scizor came out of the blue and sliced both Epseon and Umbreon. They both got hit back to their trainers. I looked at the side, seeing the guide guy lending me a helping hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guide guy! What are you doing here?\" \"I heard some battleing behind here, and I wanted to see what was going on. Shank, you should have ran. These girls look like trouble.\" \"I know, but the pokemon. I couldn't have let them be captured.\" \"Leave this to me.\" The tiwns looked ready for more battling, but a ring set off. Judy grabbed a phone from her pocket. \"Yes?\" ... \"Really? But we're just about to bring these pokemon and-\" ...! \"Fine. We'll be there.\" She hanged up. \"Sorry, you annoyances, but we got to split.\" \"Oh, no! Your not leaving! We're not finished yet.\" \"Until next time, losers.\" Then threw a dark orb, and a smokescreen surrounded us while they escaped. \"Let's find them!\" \"Not now.\" I turned to the guide. \"They need our help.\" I looked over to the pokemon, still trapped in the ball. \"Scizor, use X-scissor!\" \"Cyndaquil, use tackle!\" Our pokemon used their attacks at once, and because of that, the ball cracked. The pokemon flowed with the water, and back into the lake. \"Looks like everything's back to normal.\" \"Who are you?\" \"None of that matters. Right now, you got to get back to the pokemon center. You friend must be waiting for you.\" \"Oh, yeah. I forgot about Trever. Thanks.\" \"One more thing.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Don't say that I helped.\" \"Um. Sure.\" I ran through the boulders, looking back to see the guide guy handshake his pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got to the pokemon center, I saw Trever and Mareep on one of the couches, looking as healthy as ever. \"Shank!\" We both knuckle-touched. \"Dude, where've you been?\" \"I went to see what the problem was.\" \"What? What happened?\" \"They're gone now, with a little help.\" I remember the promise I made to the guide guy. \"Well at least Mareep is feeling much better now.\" I saw our two pokemon happily playing with each other. \"Well you ready to go? We got a long way till we get to violet city.\" \"Sure.\" We thanked Nurse Joy for the help, and walked out of the pokemon center, where the guide guy was standing out for us. \"Hey, its the guide guy!\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"I just wanted to escort you guys to route 30. He lead us to the open route, seeing it was a long path. \"Just follow this, and you'll be in Violet City in no time.\" \"Thanks! Let's go Mareep.\" Trever and Mareep left into the grass, starting out the journey. \"Before you move, Shank,\" He went back into his pocket. \"Here's some more money.\" I opened the wrapper once again, revealing 5000 pokemoney. \"Wow. Thanks.\" \"Just be careful. I have a feeling those tiwns will be back, and I won't be there to back you up.\" \"Don't worry. I'll get stronger.\" \"You better, or else you'll wind up losing your pokemon.\" \"The next time I see them, they'll be asking for it.\" \"That's good to hear.\" \"Shank!\" I looked over to Trever. \"Come on, man! Let's go!\" I turned to the guide guy. \"Well. Thanks for the help, guide-\" \"Please. Call me Frank.\" \"Ok, Frank. See you.\" \"Good luck at the violet gym.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(After solving the problem of the mischievous tiwns and returning the water pokemon back into the fishing area, Shank and Trever continued on their journey, on their way to violet city, and the Violet city gym leader.)</span></div></div>",

Now, our Heroes venture through the pleasant path of route 30)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrever and I were walking around a huge pack of grass, trying to capture some pokemon. We did a double battle. I stood in front of a caterpie, and Trever was facing against a weedle. We both had out our starter pokemon, ready to battle. \"All right, Cyndauil. Let's catch this caterpie!\" \"Give it your all, Mareep. It's about time we got a new pokemon.\" We both gave our pokemon their commands. \"Cyndaquil, use ember!\" \"And Mareep, use thundershock!\" Flames and shockwaves came out to our opponents, who fortunately ddged the attacks. Then out of nowhere, Caterpie shot its string shot at both m and Cyndaquil, and we obth we tangled in a rope of web as Caterpie fled. Trever laughed at out perdictament. \"Ha!Ha!Ha!\" It wasn't long till weedle shot rever and Mareep with string shot, and fled from the battle. I turned over to Trever, chuckling on the inside. \"Oh, Shut up!\" \"Hehe. Sorry. Want to take a break?\" \"I'm not stopping till I catch that weedle!\" All of a sudden, the same weedle came back, and shot a string shot at Trever's face. It left taunting at the both of us. \"Now?\" Trever nodded, agreeing to a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe set up a place to relax, away from any patches of grass, and near a body of water. We each opened a bag of chips. Trever seemed depressed, as he ate his chips gloomy. \"What's wrong, dude?\" He looked at me, lik I was stupid or something. \"You can't see the problem?\" \"Well,there are othr weedles...\" \"What are you talking about? I'm not sad about that.\" \"Then what?\" \"Look around.\" I did was Trever asked me to do. What I saw was many trainer couples working together. \"You want us to work together more?\" \"If you can't see it, then-\" \"Will you just tell me?\" He sighed for a minute, then told me his dilemma. \"We need a chickin this group.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I mean, hanging with your friend is fun, really, but if we had a girl here, it woul be so much exciting.\" \"You know, I have been thinking about this also.\" We just stayed there in silence. \"Well,where are we going to find a girl that isn't already part of a group?\" We looked around. \"How about that one?\" I pointed to a big girl. \"No.Too chunkey.\" \"Her?\" \"Looks insane.\" This wasn't going to be easy with Trever being so picky. I finally found a girl that may be just right. \"What about her? She's not fat. Doesn't look like she just got out of rehab.\" \"Let's see.\" Trever and Mareep walked their way to her. \"Wait up!\" Me and Cyndauil followed behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe caught up with Trever and Mareep, who were observing the girl behind a rock. She was sketching the wil pokemon that were nar her. \"I call dibs.\" I was confused by his quick statement. \"What?\" \"I mean, I'm going to ask her out, and to join our group.\" \"Why you? I saw her first?\" \"Come on, Shank. Back at Pokebrains, you were too shy to tak to any girl. I just wasn't lucky. So can I have this one?\" \"Uh-\" \"Thanks, dude!\" He left to confront the girl, not gving me a chance to answer him. Cyndaquil and I looked over to Trever and Mareep, who were approaching her. Trever rubbed his hands together, preparing himself. \"Hi, I'm-\" \"Go away.\" So moved away to a different location. He turned back to me, giving me a hand signal that said \"I got this.\" He wen to her one more time. \"Listen, I-\" \"Tyrogue, use fake out.\" Out of nowhere, a Tyrogue came out and striked Trever in the chest. The wild pokemon she was sketching fled, and pointed her anger at Trever. \"Look what you did!\" \"I-I-I didn't mean to-\" \"Of course you didn't. What do you want?\" \"I just wanted to ask if you'd like to join our group.\" \"Our?\" Trever pointed to me, as I was too stunned to make a move. I made a stumbling wave to her. \"Yeah...No.\" \"But-\" Tyrogue, use-\" \"No, no! I'll leave.\" They were walking back to the rock, terrified of what just happened. \"Your turn.\" \"What?!\" He pushed me down the hill, towards the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made the first mistake by bumping into her. \"Watch where your going!\" \"Sorry.\" I spoke so softly, not even I could hear myself. \"What's wrong with you? Can't you talk?\" I swallowed my pride, and cleared my throat. \"My name's Shank.\" \"Great. Why do I care?\" I was getting nervous that I was next to get jabbed in the chest. \"Um, what's your name?\" \"It's Milena. What do you want?\" \"I just wanted to ask-\" She let out an annoyed sigh. \"Look, I already told your friend that I'm not joining your group.\" \"Why not?\" I started to sound desperate. \"I go alone. I don't need a group.\" \"But a trainer always has to go with friends.\" \"Who ever said I was a trainer?\" \"Your not a trainer?\" \"I'm a breeder.\" \"That's cool.\" \"Yeah. So why don't you and your friend just leave route 30, and continue on your big journey?\" I was ready to walk away, but I realized I wasn't going to give up. \"Spend the night with us.\" She gave me a baffled look. \"Excuse me?\" \"I mean, just spend one day with us. If you don't like us by the next day, we'll leave.\" She gave my deal some thought. \"I like you, shy kid.\" I started to blush. \"Not like that.\" My blush faded. \"So, do we have a deal?\" I let out my hand for a handshake. \"Sure.\" \"And by the way, this is my buddy, Cyndaquil.\" I showed Cyndaquil to Milena, who seemed satisfied to see her. \"And this is my buddy, Tyrogue.\"  Tyrogue stepped out behind her, getting close to Cyndaquil. He gave Cyndaquil a friendly punch. \"They seems to like him.\" \"They sure do. Let's go up this hill.\" We both went up to where Trever and Mareep were. \"So?\" \"She going to hang with us for a day, then she'll see whether she wants to stay or not.\" \"Mmm-hmm?\" She wanted some attention. \"Aren't you going to introduce me?\" \"Oh,Yeah. Trever, Milena. Milena, Trever. Tyrogue, Mareep. Mareep,Tyrogue.\" We all greeted. \"Now let's get ready for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all gathered around a fire, warming up from the cold night. We all enjoyed some melted smores. Then Me and Trever wanted to ask some questions from Milena. \"So where are you from, Milena?\" \"Um. Let's just say I live near Blackthorn city.\" \"That far?\" \"Why is it such a surprise?\" \"Well, it's just that it's so far.\" \"Well I just like to travel.\" \"Ok.\" I wanted to know something. \"So why did you become a breeder?\" \"Because instead of just catching pokemon, I just want to study them, get to know them much better.\" \"But you can do the same while being a trainer.\" \"You got a point there, Shank. So, tell me.\" \"What?\" \"Why did you want to become a trainer?\" \"That's easy. I want to be the best of the best. I'm trying to get myself eight badges to enter the Johto League.\" \"Are you doing the same, Trever?\" \"Of course. I want to challenge my pal.\" \"That's cool.\" We each burned our smores while talking, and laughed about it. \"So what education did you guys get?\" \"We came from Pokebrains Academy.\" \"Never heard of it. I heard of Brawlfist, though.\" \"Those are our rivals.\" \"Sounds fun, then.\" \"What school are you from, Milena?\" After that, she just went silent. \"What's wrong?\" \"I'm just getting sleepy. Let's get to bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put out the fire, and we all snuggled into our sleeping bags. Trever was out as a light, but me and Milena were still awake. \"I thought you said you were tired.\" \"Well it takes some people a while to get into the sleeping zone.\" \"Sorry.\" \"It's ok, dude. You need to clam down whenever I get my sarcasim out.\" \"Ok, well, good night.\" \"Until tomorrow, Shank.\" I closed my eyes. My dream was a kind of a doozy. I was imagining me and Milena together, holding hands and walking down a long path. We looked totally in love. I a blink of an eye, I was in a tuxedo, and she was suddenly in a white gown. It looked like we were getting married. She was coming close to my face, about to kiss. I didn't want to look strange, so I copied her reactions. As we were about to kiss, I woke up in the middle of the night. I looked around to see a horrible sight. I quickly woke up Trever. \"Trever, wake up, dude!\" \"Huh? What happened?\" \"Dude, our bags are gone!\" \"No way! Our pokemon are in them.\" \"That's not all.\" \"What?\" \"Milena's gone too.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I got to recreate another fire, without Cyndaquil's help, to put some light in our situation. \"I wonder if she's okay.\" Trever looked at me stupidly again. \"What are you talking about? She's the one who took our bags and our pokemon.\" \"She must have gotten kidnapped..\" \"Are you even listening to me? She is the kidnapper!\" \"How can you be so-\" \"Sure? She disappeared along with our stuff. Any more evidence you want?\" \"Ok. Calm down.\" \"How can I?! Mareep has been stolen by that thief!\" \"Well, she couldn't have gotten far.\" \"How do you know? Did you see her do it and just let her pass by?\" \"No. But look.\" I pointed to the ground, where the footprints of Milena were fresh. \"See?\" \"I see it. But-\" \"But what?\" \"She walked deep into the forest. Who knows what kind of pokemon are there?\" \"Before you were calling her a thief. Now your caring?\" \"Hey. She's hot. And I can always forgive a hot chick.\" \"Ok. So can we start to look for her?\" \"Sure, but how are we going to survive wihtout our pokemon?\" \"We'll just be cautious.\" \"OK. Let's find Milena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were walking around in circles in these giant trees. We had no flashlights, so we couldn't see a thing but pitch black. We didn't have any food, so we got hungry just thinking about it. Trever was now in the level of complaining. \"Dude, she's long gone.\" \"Don't be so negative, Trever.\" \"Well, do you see her anywhere?\" We kept looking around in the dark, trying to located Milena. Then I saw a spherical head in the distance, laying down. \"Trever, look.\" I pointed to the head, and we both apprached it quietly. \"We got you now!\" We both jumped near the head, which appeared to be just a wandering Hoothoot. \"Uh-Oh.\" The pokemon pecked at both our heads with extreme force. \"Ouch! Were! Ouch! Sorry! Ouch!\" Its been going on for at least five minutes, until the Hoothoot called in more of its buddies to join in the fun. \"This isn't going to be fun.\" The group of Hoothoot kept going for another five minutes until they finally decided to fled. We got up to our feet, wobbling from all the pecking we just got on our heads. \"Look!\" I pointed over to a tree, with a human-shape person stuck to it. \"If that's a pokemon-\" \"Look closer.\" We both took a closer glance, to reveal a Milena webbed to a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe kept coming in close to our thief, who wasn't able to move while being webbed to an old, grand tree. \"Well, well, well.\" She gave us an annoyed look. \"Look, let me just say-\" \"That your the thief? We know!\" Trever's voice got louder. Milena began to worry. \"Will you be quiet? Do you even know where we are?\" \"I don't care! Where's Mareep?!\" \"Shh!\" If you quiet down, I'll tell you.\" \"No! I won't be quiet till I get-\" \"Ok! Fine! Your bags are over there.\" She nudged her head over to her left, showinf our bags near another tree. \"Hold on, Mareep!\" Trever left to retrieve our bags, and left me with Milena. \"Why'd you do it?\" \"It isn't how it looks like, I can tell you that.\" \"Well your not going anywhere for now, so start talking.\" It took her ten minutes until she finally replied. \"I heard poachers.\" \"Are you-\" \"I knew poachers would probably try to go into your bags ad steal your pokemon, so I took your bags and hid them into the forest until the poachers left.\" \"I don't know. If that's true, then how'd you get stuck here?\" \"Look up.\" I took a glance up the tree, where Kakunas and Weedles were sleeping. \"Oh, man. Let me help you out.\" \"Thanks. Shank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to cut the web off of Milena, but it was just too stable. \"Just leave me here. I'll get out eventually.\" \"No one gets left behind.\" I eventually got the web off her. \"See?\" \"Wow. Inner strenght. Nice.\" Trever finally came back, with Mareep by his side. \"Here's Cyndaquil, Shank.\" He handed me my pokeball. He turned over to the free Milena. \"You let her go? She's the thief!\" \"Will you be quiet?\" \"I want some answers, and I want them now!\" He punched the tree so harshly. \"Now you've done it.\" \"Trever, do you know what you just did?\" \"What?\" Then one Kakuna fell out of the tree. \"Oh.\" Then three more fell. Then fifteen more. It wasn't a matter of time till a bunch of Kakunas were down in the ground. \"Whew. For a minute, I thought they we going to-\" Then All at once, the Kakuna's were flashing white. \"Evolve. Let's run.\" We started to run away from the many evolutions of Beedrills coming at us. They were attacking the three of us with many twineedles. \"Let's use our pokemon!\" \"Good idea.\" I took out Cyndaquil to come and join the chase. We all turned around and shouted out our attacks. \"Cyndauil, use ember!\" \"Mareep, thundershock!\" Tyrogue, use Fake out!\" All our attacks failed to hit one of the raging beedrills. We kept running until we made it out of the forest. \"How are we ever going to lose them?!\" I looked over to the nearby lake. \"Anybody up for a swim?\" We all jumped in, feeling our bodies freezing. We hid below, out of sight from the Beedrills. From an underwater point of view, I saw the Beedrills trying to search for us, then leaving back into the forest. We popped our heads out of the freezing water. \"Well. That was fun.\" Me and Trever turned to Milena, who was giggling. Then We joined her and started laughing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already sunrise, and we were packing our stuff to continue our traveling. Milena was out in the field, sketching some Hoppips. I walked over to her. \"You like to sketch, don't you?\" \"Well if I didn't, I wouldn't be doing it.\" I felt a little dumb for asking. \"So we're just about to head out.\" \"That's cool. Have a fun journey.\" \"Shank!\" I looked over to Trever, who was already packed to walk. \"Milena.\" She gave her pencil a rest and turn toward me. \"Yes?\" I gave a big sigh. \"I want you to come with us.\" \"No.\" \"Why not? Didn't you have fun?\" She started to stand from the rock. \"That was the most wildest night I've had since, like, ever.\" \"It was. But wasn't that our deal?\" \"Yeah. But I don't think your friend likes me that much. It wouldn't be right to go around the region with someone who hates you.\" \"Hold on.\" I called trever over. \"What's up? We should be gone already.\" \"Tell her you forgive her.\" \"Why?\" \"Because she took our pokemon for right reasons.\" \"Yeah, so she can-\" \"Poachers were out last night. She protected our pokemon by taking them into the forest, thus hiding them from any poachers.\" \"I don't know.\" \"Come on.\" Trever scratched his head to think about what he should do. \"Fine. But I'm going to keep an eye on you.\" Milena had a frown on her face, which made Trever feel bad. He made it up by putting his hand out. \"Welcome to the team, Melina.\" Her frown faded, replaced with a smile. \"Thanks.\" \"Now that we made up, let's get going.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"To Violet city. I'm going to get my first gym badge.\" \"You better watch out.\" \"Why?\" \"The gym leader, Falkner, specializes with flying-types. He's well skilled with air attacks.\" I looked over to Cyndaquil, knowing there was nothing to worry about. \"I can take him. Now let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(After trying to prove to Milena their worth it, Shank and Trever finally got her to become a group memeber of their team. Now the trio heroes are continuing their way to Violet city, where Shank will face of Falkner and win his first Gym Badge.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know my way around these parks.\" \"How would you know? Your a girl!\" \"Exactly, peabrains. Now were going left!\" \"No! Right's the way to go. It seems safer.\" \"There's piles of grass over that area, thus meaning many pokemon.\" \"Your just scared.\" \"No I'm not!\" \"They why don't we step in?\" Trever pointed to the grass, but Milena slapped it away. \"I'm not going because it right way's left!\" \"It's right!\" \"Left!\" \"Right!\" \"Left!\" \"Ri-\" \"Enough! Both of you!\" I was finally taking charge. \"We're going to settle this an easy way.\" \"Like what? Coin toss?\" \"Yes...\" She groaned. \"I'm telling you guys, it's left!\" \"Calm down. Everyone gets a turn. Let's just see who's turn it is to decide.\" I flipped the bronze coin into the air. \"I'll call-\" \"Heads!\" Trever was fast at picking. \"Fine. Tails.\" It took a while for it to land, but I can already feel the tension between the two. It fell back into my palm. I looked closely to see who was victorious. \"Heads.\" \"Yes! Follow me to the RIGHT path.\" Milena looked quite annoyed. I had a stong feeling we were going the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were wondering around in the many patches of grass, hoping to get out without injuring ourselves. \"Trever, maybe we should turn back, and go the left path.\" \"What? Why? I can feel the exit close by! Just a little farther.\" \"Give it up, Trever. There's nothing here. Your just getting us lost.\" \"No I'm not! We're almost the-\" Then a squawk screeched out of nowhere. \"What was that?\" I looked down, by Trever's sneakers. \"Trever! Look!\" He looked down, to see him stepping on a pidgy's tail. \"Oh! Sorry.\" He started to back up, as the pidgy kept coming closer. \"I didn't mean to-\" Another squawk was yelled. He looked by his feet once more, only to see him stepping on two more pidgys. \"Oh, this is isn't good.\" I tried to stay calm. \"Ok. Let's just retrace our steps..\" I looked back to see a line of pidgys blocking our way out. We were now surrounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were back against each other, watching as the angered pidgys came closer at us, ready to give us our punishment. \"Maybe it's a good time to use our pokemon.\" \"Good thinking, Shank.\" Trever was too afraid to notice what we were planning. \"Trever!\" \"Huh?\" \"Focus. And bring out Mareep. We're going to fight them off.\" \"Ok.\" We called our pokemon, who seemed tired until they saw the swarm of pidgys. \"All right, guy. Let's fight!\" We call out their regular attacks. Cyndaquil put some on fire, Mareep shocked them, and Tyrogue kept faking out of them. Eventually, the pidgys fled, and we were free from the torment. \"This is your fault, Trever!\" \"How's it my fau-\" \"If we went the left path, none of this would have happened!\" I stepped in, ending the feud. \"Well, at least no one got hurt.\" \"We would've been if it wasn't for my clever brain.\" \"A brain full of baloney!\" \"You know what?\" Then they kept on bickering. I just couldn't find a way to make them stop, until I looked beyond them. I walk over to the path Trever was trying to lead. \"Guys.\" \"You Blond-headed brat!\" \"Guys..\" \"You oversized idiot\" \"Guys...\" \"You, empty-minded, no-good, useless, lo-\"<br>\r\n \"Guys!\" \"What?!\" \"Look!\" I pointed over to the path. We took another step closer, to what was near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon us, we saw an ordinary house. No grass was surrounding it either, meaning someone was living there. \"Who would live somewhere out here, all alone?\" \"I don;t know. But they might have some food.\" Me and Milena looked at Trever. \"Really?\" \"What? I'm hungry.\" There was only one way to find out. We marched over to the front door. I knocked a couple of times and waited. No answer. I tried another set of knocks. No answer. \"Maybe their not home?\" \"Well, let's just check.\" Trever grabbed the knob, constantly shaking it around. \"Trever, stop! It's obvious that no ones in-\" Then the door whooshed open. It was barely dark inside. \"They are home.\" I took the first step in, and a strange man popped out. \"Hello!\" \"Ahh!\" I fell backwards, taking my friends along with me. \"Who are you young lads?\" \"Hi. I'm Shank, and they are Trever and Milena.\" \"Well, what a pleasure to meet you all.\" \"I'm sorry, but who are you?\" \"And do you got food?\" \"Trever!\" \"Sorry.\" The man chuckled a little. \"I see your friend is quite hungry. Please, come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, it looked like a total wreck. \"I guess your not very organized, are you?\" \"Not much, laddy. Studying pokemon is quite a hobby for me, and a very messy one indeed.\" He chuckled some more. \"I almost forgot. What's your name again?\" \"They call me Mr.Pokemon.\" \"Why?\" Trever stared while chowing on a frozen sandwich. \"I don't really no why, laddies. They just do. Funny name, indeed.\" He kept chuckling. \"So what do you study?\" \"Mainly about pokemon, of course.\" He laughed. Trever laughed with him near the refrigirator. \"What some good laughs. But laughter won't help my problem.\" I was dumfounded. \"What problem?\" \"It's nothing, really.\" \"Well, we got nothing better to do. We'll help. So what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I got a B, but it was a high B.\" \"Well, now! What a glorious day!

They always come in my home and trash the place.\" \"Why don't we look after the place for you?\" \"No, that wouldn't be right. What if anything happens to you? It'll be in my hands.\" \"Are you kidding? We just took on a swarm of pidgys before we came here. I'm sure we can take care of a few more.\" \"Excellent! Now follow me to the back. I want to show you youngsters something.\" \"Sure. Trever, we'll be back.\" \"I'll be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Pokemon led Milena and I into a back room, with boxes stacked on top of each other. In front of us, there was a podium, what a sphereical figure inside a glass box. \"This is the pokemon egg I found. Lovely, isn't it?\" It had a flarey red shell around it. \"I wonder what it could be?\" \"I have no idea, me lady. But this is what I'm bringing over to Professor Elm. I bet he could figure out what this pokemon is.\" \"So while your off taking that to him, we'll be here taking care of the house?\" \"Exactly.\" \"We'll you got nothing to worry about.\" \"Ok, but just in case..\" He pulled out a whistle from his shirt pocket. \"Use this only for emergencies.\" \"Ok. Sure.\" \"Splendid! Now help me bring this back to the main room. Me and Milena each grabbed a side, and steadily took it back to the main room. We set it down carefully on the couch. \"What's that?\" Trever asked while messing around with the computer's wires. \"It's a pokemon egg.\" \"Cool. Who's it for?\" \"It's not for us. Its being taken to Professor Elm. Mr. Pokemon is going to deliver it, while we stay here and take care of the house.\" \"Even cooler!\" \"Yes. Well, I'm off. Here are the keys.\" Mr. Pokemon handed me the keys to the house. \"I'll be back as soon as I can.\" He close the door behind him and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrever was still trying to get Mr. Pokemon's laptop to work, while Me and Milena were relaxing on the couch, watching some tv. \"Are you almost done with that, Trever?\" \"Not yet. I'm still trying to figure out what's wrong with it. It could be a while.\" \"All right.\" Milena got up from her seat. \"Hey, I'm going to check if there's some snacks. Be right back.\" \"Okay.\" She headed off into the kitchen. \"Hey, Shank, get over here and hold this wire in place.\" \"Sure.\" I walked over, seeing Trever tangled in his own mess. \"I think your not going to fix it.\" \"Come on. Look at all this! I'm almost finished, anyways.\" \"If you say so.\" Milena came back with two bags of chips. \"You know, I could get used to this.\" \"Right on, girl!\" There were over their heads. \"Remember guys this is only temporary.\" \"Relax, Shank.\" \"Yeah, dude.\" \"All right, all right. Let's take a break. We all headed over to the couch, sipping on some lemonade, grabbing a handful of chips. \"What do you think the pokemon inside that egg could be?\" \"I don't know, but I want it.\" \"Trever!\" \"What? I can raise a pokemon.\" \"Really?\" \"Quiet, Milena!\" \"Don't tell me to quiet down. I'm saying the truth.\" \"I bet you can't take care of a baby pokemon.\" \"That's it!\" Then they started to argue again. \"Man.\" I tried to find something to stpo them from bickering, but there was nothing. I took another glance at the window. I broke them up. \"What'd you do that for?\" \"Yeah, I was just about to show him a piece of my fist.\" \"Why you-\" \"Guys!\" \"Look.\" I pointed at the three pidgys chilling at the window. \"Uh-oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long till we were getting surrounded again. Pidgy by Pidgy, they came through the window, probably wanting a rematch. The last to come in terrified us all, as it was a Pidgeotto. \"That must be the leader.\" \"You think?\" They just stood there, like we had dangerous weapons in out hands. \"What should we do?\" I looked over to the door. Blocked. I took a peek at the back door. Blocked. Even the window was guarded. \"Let's just did what we did last time.\" \"Fight?\" \"Exactly. Come on out, Cyndaquil!\" \"You too, Mareep!\" \"You as well, Tyrogue!\" All three of our pokemon looked rested. \"Cyndaquil!\" \"Mareep!\" \"Tyrogue!\" \"Let's fight!\" I got Cyndaquil to use ember on them, but only a few got hit. The rest just dodged and tackled Cyndaquil. I looked over to Milena. She was using fake out, but not even a single hit. Tyrogue was tackled as well. \"Don't worry, guys! I'll handle this. Mareep, use thundershock!\" A line of electricity came at a Pidgy, but it hit it away, straight for the laptop. \"Not my hard work!\" As the thundershock hit the machine, the laptop turned on. \"You got 62 messages.\" \"Sweet! I told I could- oopff!\" Trever was tackled instead of Mareep. We were back against each other once more, reliving what happened earlier today. \"Looks like we're toast.\" I remember something. I searched my pocket, pulling out the whistle. \"Shank, is that the whistle?\" \"Yup.\" \"Well...what are you waiting for?! Winter? Blow it already!\" \"Ok!\" I blew the whistle real hard, and a screeching sound came out. Now we just hoped it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were just a few seconds from being attacked. \"That whistle was useless!\" \"Clam down, Trever! Just give it some time.\" That's what I hoped for. Now Pidgys were coming at us. \"Cyndaquil, use ember!\" When one was knocked down, more came. It wasn't long till we were being pecked rapidly. \"We're doomed!\" Then out of nowhere, a pokemon cam flying through the window. We thought it was another menacing Pidgy, but they weren't green. It was a graceful Xatu. \"The whistle worked!\" \"You were just doubting it a second ago!\" \"I know. But now..\" Xatu raised its wings high, \"Xatu!\" and a flash of light covered everything. I opened my eyes to see what was going on. \"Guys, I think that was confuse ray.\" \"Why do you say that, Shank?\" \"Just look.\" We all looked at the Pidgys, suddenly leaving the house. \"If they werem't confused, they wouldn't be leaving.\" I walked up to Xatu, but it seems like I startled it, becauseone step I took, and it just flew out the window. Just as it left, the door opened. \"Hello, laddies! What did I miss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat Mr. Pokemon down and told him everything. \"I knew Xatu could help out. Its always there for me, even when I'm not home.\" \"Is it a wild pokemon?\" \"Yes, it is. But I don't feel its right to catch it.\" \"I understand. So where's the egg?\" \"I successfully brought it to him. He's going to be watching over it.\" \"That's good.\" \"He also wanted me to ask how's your pokedex coming?\" \"Huh?\" Mr. Pokemon looked at me with a stern face. \"I thought so.\" \"What?\" \"Shank, you were given the pokedex to help Professor Elm in his research, by going around, checking pokemon. Why don't you try it out?\" \"Sure.\" I turned over to Cyndaquil. \"Cyndauil, the Fire-Mouse Pokemon. It has a timid nature, and if startled, the flames on its back burn more vigorously.\" \"Cool!\" You see? Amazing, isn't it?\" \"True.\" \"Now, forhelping me, I'm going to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led us out of his house. \"You want to get to Violet city, right?\" \"Yeah, but I'm afraid of going through there pokemon again.\" Mr. Pokemon chuckled. \"Not to worry.\" He led us to two short trees. \"He brought out a <br>\r\nHeracross. \"Use cut!\" Heracross sliced a path for us. \"Wow!\" \"This should lead you on your way.\" \"Thanks, Mr. Pokemon.\" \"Just remember to use that pokedex more frequently.\" \"I will. Let's go guys.\" \"Right on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(After meeting such a jolly and intelligent man, Shank and friends said farwell to Mr. Pokemon, and continued on their way to Violet city, where Shank was hoping on getting his first badge!)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(In our previous episode, our heroes were watching over the house of the fantastic Mr.Pokemon. With conquring the swarm of pidgys, the gang successfully completed their deed. Now with a the help of a quick shortcut, our heroes are in route 31, close to their destination of Violet city. What kind of exciting day might they have in store ofr today?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were relaxing near a clear, crystal lake. Trever was training with Mareep near the campsite, Milena was checking her supplies over and over again, and I was out in a patch of grass, using my pokedex on the pokemon passing by. A hoppip was skipping along, so I pointed my pokedex at it. \"Hoppip, the cottonweed pokemon. It drifts with the wind. When gathered in fields and mountains, spring is on the way.\" \"Awsome!\" A caterpic was crawling by my side. \"Caterpie, the worm pokemon. It uses the stench from its antennas to keep enemies away.\" \"I did not know that!\" Milena was walking towards me. \"Ok, Shank. I think it's time to go.\" I ignored her, and saw a Ledyba buzz around. \"Ledaby, the five-star pokemon. It can-\" Milena snatched my pokedex away. \"Hey!\" \"Let's go!\" \"Why the rush?\" \"Ugh.\" Sha turned around, probably thinking of a way to persuade me into going. Then she turned back, with a wide smirk of her face. \"Hey Shank,\" Her voice was flirty, \"If we keep going, there would be even more pokemon to find..\" \"Can I at least find one more?\" \"Fine. Just hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was scavenging for a pokemon I haven't seen yet. I looked behind me to see Milena, scowling while I'm searching. I came close near this enormous cave. Near the entrance, I saw a cluster of geodudes gathering small rocks. \"I'll just make a record of these geodudes.\" I brought out my pokedex, which got the attention of a geodude. \" Gedude, the rock pokemon. When sleeping, it looks just like a normal rock. Carelessly stepping on it would cause it to swing its fists angrily.\" \"Cool!\" \"Shank look out!\" I didn't know what she was talking about until I looked up. In a blink, I was blasted by a heavy rock. I looked in the distance to see my pokedex shrouded in the grass, and a goedude coming close. It snatched my pokedex, carrying it back into the cave. In two minutes flats, the goedudes were gone, along with my pokedex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back to the campsite, grabbing my backpack to venture into the cave. \"Where do you think your going?\" \"To get back my device. I promised Profeesor Elm and Mr. Pokemon I would record the pokemon I would encounter.\" \"What's going on over here?\" Trever must have finished training with Mareep.\" \"Shank over here lost his pokedex to a geodude. Now he wants to go and get it back.\" \"What?\" Trever went over to his bag. \"What are we waiting for? Let's go get it!\" \"Woah! You want to go too? What's with you too? It's just a pokedex. What's the deal?\" \"You don't understand. I'm trying to become a responsible trainer. How am I suppose to prove that if I keep losing stuff?\" Milena turend over to Trever. \"And you?\" \"I just want to have some fun.\" \"Ok.\" \"Ok what?\" \"We'll go find that pokedex, but as soon as we get out, we're moving on. Deal?\" \"Fine.\" \"Ok. Let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought out Cyndaquil to accompany me. I had a feeling he was going to become handy. The three of us stood at the entrance, gazing into how dark and gloomy things looked inside. \"We'll,\" I gulped a little, \"Let's get going.\" \"Hold it!\" We all turned around to see a hitchhiker in our view. \"Don't you kids go in there!\" \"Why?\" \"Just don't! You kids don't have any reason to go in!\" \"I'm sorry, but its an emergency.\" \"If your not going to listen to me, then let's battle for the decision!\" \"What?\" \"You, kid! Let's rumble!\" He pointed at me like I was a killer. \"Fine!\" \"Shank, are you sure?\" \"Of course I am.\" \"Let's go!\" \"Ok. Come on, Cyndaquil!\" Cyndaquil looked pumped up. The hiker brought out a powerful graveler. \"Use rock throw!\" It picked up a massive rock and threw it towards Cyndaquil. \"Dodge and use ember.\" Cyndaquil moved out of the way and blasted flames at it, but it seemed nothing happened. \"This is bad.\" \"Why?\" \"Fire is weak against ground.\" \"What?!\" \"Rock throw!\" \"Dodge, Cyndaquil!\" It dodged. \"I can't keep this up!\" Well ,you better think quick!\" I thought of a great stradegy. \"Cyndaquil, smokescreen!\" A gas of smoke flooded the battle. Now use quick attack as much as you can!\" Then Cyndaquil kept attacking Graveler super fast, until it finally knocked out. \"Graveler!\" \"Shank, how did-\" \"No time. Let's get going!\" We ran into the cave, leaving the Hiker behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were now deep in the cave, trying to find out where the geodudes could be. \"Shank, how did Cyndaquil learn quick attack?\" \"The pokedex said it already knew it could do that.\" \"Oh.\" See what the pokedex can tell you?\" \"Whatever. Let's just find the stupid thing.\" I looked around, thinking I found it. \"Let's check here.\" I turned to Trever. \"What makes you think its there?\" \"I have a hunch.\" \"It's better than anything.\" We checked inside a small portion of the cave. \"I can't see a thing!\" \"I got it. Cyndaquil, use your flames.\" \"Cyndaquil!\" Cyndaquil started the flames on its back. As it gave us some light we saw a group of Zubats. \"Uh...\" They looked mad at us. \"Let's run!\" We ran out of thehole, seeing the Zubats behind us. We quickly hid behind a rocky wall, watching the Zubats flying away. \"We'll never find the geodude.\" \"Shank.\" \"Yeah, I know. You were right.\" \"No...look.\" I looked around. A vast of geodudes were helping piling a mountain of rocks. On top, I saw my pokedex on top. \"What's it doing there?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My pokedex was just laying there, at the top of a bunch of rocks. The community of geodudes were glaring at us, thinking what we were doing there. \"Well, what now, Shank?\" \"Just give me a second to get my pokedex, and we'll be out of here.\" \"I don't think-\" But I was already gone before Milena could warn me. I raced towards my device, but was blocked by the wall of angered geodudes, looking for a fight. I backed up to my group, and felt surrounded by the cluster of pokemon. We were about to be pelted by gigantic rocks, until Cyndaquil stepped up to the plate, talking his way out of this. \"Cyndauil! Cynda, Cynda! Cyndaquil, Cynda.\" I had no idea what my companion just said, but I hoped it got us out of being outcasts. The geodudes just floated there, with the boulders still attached to their rough hands. In a matter of seconds, the boulders were dropped. A geodude much larger than the other came towards us. \"I think that's the leader..\" I thought at first it was going to fist-punch me when it raised its hand, but it was actually waiting for a handshake. \"Geodude.\" I shook its hand firmly. \"GEODUDE!\" It screeched so loud, causing the others to cheer. I turned to Cyndaquil. \"Can you be my translator?\" \"Cynda!\" \"Great! Now tell them that red thing in the top of their pile is something of mine.\" Cyndaquil walked over to the leader. \"Cyndaquil, Cynda Cynda.\" He pointed to the pokedex. \"Geodude, Geo.\" The Geodude then turned away towards the pile. Cyndaquil nudged his head, signaling us to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Geodude stopped us right at the base of the pile. The geodude started rubbing its rocky palms on the rocks. Cyndaquil was doing the same. \"I think they want us to do it too, Shank.\" \"I'm not doing it!\" \"No one asked you, Trever!\" \"Calm down, guys!\" We(well me and Milena) placed our hands on the rocks, feeling something odd. \"These rocks are wet.\" I was still wondering all these clues, and Milena just jumped to the conclusion. \"I think I know whats going on.\" \"Please tell me, bacause I got no idea.\" She sighed. \"Don't you get it? Behind these rocks is a giant pool of watering, waiting to crash!\" I turned to Cyndaquil and the cheif. \"Is this true?\" They both nodded. I looked back into the community. So many young geodudes, in the risk of being sucked into their one greatest weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to help out. So did Milena. It took us a while to convince Trever, but we needed all the help there was. Milena got Tyrogue to break down some rocks, alongside the Chief Geodude, from the wall, while Cyndaquil and Mareep and most of the Geodude community were carrying it over to the pile. It took some patience and a lot of useful time, and sooner or later, we finally got it to look good enough for a King's barrier! I grabbed the last rock. \"This should hold everything in place.\" I inserted it carefully into a wedged spot. \"GEODUDE!\" The geodudes looked estatic, having much confidence in them than ever before. \"That should hold it.\" \"Yeah..\" \"What's the matter, Shank?\" \"I-\" \"Whoo!\" We turned towards Trever's attention, watching him being carried in a wave by Geodudes. I turned back to Milena. \"I need my pokedex back.\" \"Why?\" \"I promised the Professor and Mr. Pokemon I would.\" \"But look,\" She pointed me at the Geodudes, cheering and feeling refreshed, \"Don't you it be much better here? Protecting these helpless Geodudes?\" \"I guess so.\" Then a mega force was placed on the pile. My pokedex fell from above, and I successfully caught it. \"Well ,that solves that.\" \"What's happeing?\" \"What is happening?\" We looked at the rocks, surprisenly being blasted. Some rocks were started to fall off. Leaks of water were happening. \"Come on, Milena.\" \"What?! Where?\" \"I think I have an idea what's happening.\" I looked for Trever, who was hiding with a bunch of kid Geodude. \"Huh?\" \"Come on. I'm pretty sure I'm going to need you and your pokemon.\" \"Um. Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe raced back outside of the cave. \"Shank, we don't have time for this. Some Geodudes are going to get hurt if that barrier bursts.\" \"Yeah. Thoes kids need me.\" \"Where is it?\" I was actually listening to the things they kept blabbering about, but I was going to find the problem. \"There!\" \"What?\" I pointed to the side of the cave. \"So?\" \"Follow me.\" I led my pals alongside the cave wall, finding a unconvienent hole. \"Let's look in here.\" We took a simple peek, and wasn't so much surprised of what we found. There again was the annoying Hiker, having his Croconaw blasting water gun at the rocks. \"Keep it up, Croconaw! Soon, thoes Geodudes will be mine, and for thoes wretched kids,\" We all looked at each other, \"I warned them, so I wouldn't be surprised if they drowned.\" He gave out a evil laugh, as Croconaw kept pumping water. \"Soon, the Geodudes will be hurt! We have to stop him!\" \"Your right.\" I stepped out into the open, grabbed a free pebble, and threw it at the Hiker. \"Who did-?!\" He looked at me. \"Well, if it isn't the Snot-nose runt? Looks like your too late. Soon, These rocks will collapse, and thoes geodudes will be too weak to fight once I catch them.\" \"Cyndaquil!\" Cyndaquil popped up to my side. \"That's not going to stop me, because in just a few-\" \"Thundershock!\" Croconaw was zapped by a striking wave. I looked over at Trever, pointing for command. \"Why you little punk!\" \"Sweet, Trever.\" \"Um, thanks!\" \"That's it! You guys are going down!\" He brought out his Graveler from last time. \"Time to double the battle!\" \"Shank!\" Trever popped up by my side. \"Let's double battle.\" \"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyndaquil and Mareep were standing side by side against Crocanaw and Graveler. \"Graveler, rock throw on Cyndaquil! Croconaw, Bite on Mareep!\" They came fast on us. \"Cyndaquil, dodge!\" \"You too, Mareep!\" They dodged without a scratch on them. \"Now smokescreen!\" The scenery went dark. \"Shank?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I can't find Mareep.\" \"Uh-oh. Just hang on. Cyndaquil, Quick attack on Graveler!\" \"Oh, no! Not again! Croconaw, use water gun!\" Cyndaquil came jumping towards Graveler, not knowing there was Croconaw waiting for the attack. He was blasted away, and the smokescreen faded. Mareep was just standing there, worrying about Cyndaquil \"Graveler, Rock throw! Croconaw, water gun!\" The two came at us again. \"Mareep, thunder wave!\" Mareep shot two static waves, striking the two pokemon down their whole nervous system. \"No! Their paralyzed!\" \"Yes!\" Cyndaquil got up, looking fully healed. \"Thanks, Trever.\" \"No problem, dude.\" We turned back to the immobilized pokemon. \"Cyndaquil, Quick attack!\" \"Mareep, thundershock!\" It was our turn to attack, knocking out our opponents in one hit. The Hiker was too embarrased to say anything, so he called back his pokemon, and ran. \"We did it!\" Milena showed up. \"Where have you been?\" \"Taking care of the Geodudes. Their ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went back into the cave, seeing the group of Geodudes safe and sound. \"GEODUDE!\" I still needed to get used to that. The chief stood before us. It gave us all a rock. \"Um. Thank you?\" One of the little Geodude came before me, handing me a spray. \"Cool! A potion!\" The Geodudes smiled. \"Let's get going.\" We walked out of the cave, looking back at the bunch of Geodudes that lived there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Once again helping out a group of pokemon, Shank, Trever, and Milena were on the road again to Violet city, Hoping to battle the gym leader.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
