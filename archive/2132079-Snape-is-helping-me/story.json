Remember how we proved Winky\u2019s innocence, that night in the forest when Cedric\u2019s Dad was accusing her of casting the dark mark?\u201d<br>\r\nHarry gaped.

It was hazy at first, and then became clearer.<br>\r\nHarry stared.<br>\r\nHe was staring in to a face he hated. A face with greasy, black hair.<br>\r\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Ron\u2019s impatient voice brought him back. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there with your mouth open! Here!\u201d<br>\r\nRon snatched the omnioculars from Harry. He looked through them and lowered them from his eyes very, very slowly.<br>\r\nHe and Harry gazed at each other, the omniculars hanging limply in Ron\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n\u201cSnape?\u201d the mouthed, together. \u201cSnape?\u201d</b></font></span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
