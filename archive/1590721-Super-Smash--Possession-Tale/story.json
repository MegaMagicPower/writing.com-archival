You go into a house and see a beautiful girl with long, gold hair and pointy ears (Pikachu) currently sleeping in her bed, and after searching through the house, you see a cute girl with a small chest who is obviously her younger sister by a few years (Pichu) who is awake and going down the stairs to go outside and play, she is wearing a yellow shirt and a black skirt with yellow shorts underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'd love to become one of them.' You think. 'but I might be caught by the other one for not acting like the one I possess.' With that thought in mind you you move on. The next house you come to has a beautiful blue haired girl, who you met yesterday as you were finishing up moving in, who told you her name is Krystal, she is the girlfriend of Fox, who is the local track team star, she is currently putting on a blue jumpsuit, and she has a staff on a shelf. You consider possessing her as well, but maybe you should possess someone else.</span></div></div>",

Reina Rhodes, a 39 year old single mother, she used to love to party and got knocked up by some random stranger at a bar she was 21 years old. You were the outcome.

Disrobing you step into the shower and turn on the water. Feels good to wash off the memory of all the old sins and welcome in the new. As you reach for some shampoo you hear a Bang! as the bathroom door is ripped open, by some figure. Turning towards the door, you grab the shampoo bottle in defense. The figure advanced towards you arms hovering at it's sides. It damn near lunged for the shower door and slid it backwards, before a high pitched scream pierced the air. You fell down, shielding your breasts and legs, from the assailant wondering how this happened. The figure jumped backwards and turned on the light. Filling the room with bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I had no idea you were taking a shower in there... although I guess it makes sense.. seeing as the water was running..

She took a few steps back and put her hands in her hair, pushing it upwards. \"Why are you sitting like that? Oh my... did you think I was going to hurt you? She laughed and reached a hand down to help you up. Reaching up a bit wearily, you grab her hand and stand up, letting your hands drop to the side. She took a few steps back and gasped a bit audibly. \"Wow! You look so pretty! Are you like... a model or something... wait no.. I guess not.. since you're in school with me. Heehee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea.. um. Peach? Could you.. hand me a towel? They're on that rack... over there, thanks.\" You snatch the towel from her and wrap it around your body, slowly calming down. You had some questions though, but than again... this girl did interrupt you in the shower, and since she saw you naked.. she had an obligation to fulfill. Looking at her as she turned around to view your bathroom, you glance down at her booty shorts and think for a hot second. </span></div></div>",

It felt like she was inside of me!\" The clone stepped forward and sat next to the prone Peach. \"Thank god you're pretty peach.. it's your best quality.\" Peach lit up like a star and smiled. \"Thanks, Clone! I am feeling extra pretty today. You know it's portion control and plenty of water... and Mario said it ha-mmm.\" The Clone swooped in on the pretty girl and locked lips with her. She moved her tongue with a skill Peach had never known and she made sure to keep Peach quiet long enough to warm her up. Pulling away from her original she took Peach's hand in her own and held it over her belt, hoping she'd take the hint and pull off her damn clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to call you Keen.. Clone. No not Keen Clone.. just Keen!\" The newly dubbed Keen smiled and began unbuckling Peach's belt and slowly moved down to remove her skirt. \"I love that name.. and I love you too.\" Keen moved Peach's skirt down to her ankles and moved in on the cute mushroom panties she had on. Peach just leaned back and rested her soft hands on Keen's blonde mane. \"Ahh you suck at this Kee- Oh my god!\" Keen tangled her fingers in Peach's slit and nipped at her stomach and then her 'lips' in response to the teasing. Pulling herself up she kissed Peach on her neck and smiled, enjoying the double dip of flavor. \"Sorry, let me try harder.\" Keen wriggled against her, slipping a leg between Peach's. God, this was the best first birthday ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled Peach's shirt off and brought her hands to Peach's bra. \"Lets-a go.\" Unhooking the bra in a mere moment she crouched down on the bed and put her mouth around Peach's chest, using her free hand to keep Peach satisfied between her legs. Before peach could even reply to the stimulus her phone started going off. Groaning and with extreme dislike she got off the bed and dug through the pile of her clothes before pulling out the flower monogrammed cell phone. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~The Present! ~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach! How are you. You sound out of breath..\" You just laughed and held your head in your hands as the thoughts of Peach and her clone pleasuring each other into a tizzy reared it's head. \"No Yeah have fun with what you're doing but I need to ask you a favor... let me borrow your form for a bit? I have some herps that need extreme derping.\" You listened to the intermittent slew of words, moans and laughter for a few seconds before your eyes lit up. \"You're the best, Princess. Later.\" Closing the phone you let a wave of energy wash over your form replacing it with a Peach's. Fluffing up and moving some of your blonde hair out of your newly formed face, you strode into the park with a new confidence and a growing sense of excitement. Brand new town to enjoy... and oh my god some of these girls! Not a homely one in the bunch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach!\" Jumping slightly at hearing your new name being called you turned towards the voice to find something interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
