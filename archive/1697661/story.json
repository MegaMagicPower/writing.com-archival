            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The queen now being fully grown and mature, starts communicating with you telepathically. She orders you to start harvesting the humanoids you had up until now - since they made the most optimal hosts - in a massed scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the cave you charge into the wilderness. You have been alive as a Warrior(Xenomorph) for less than 15 hours, but already your experience and intelligence has started to develop. You climb a high pine-tree on the highest hill you can find, all in less than 3 seconds, and scout the nearby terrain. Pine trees stretched as far as the eye could see. To the east, a large town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen had stated in her briefing, that she could sense a large scale of mental activity with her telepathic psychic abilities, the same as the humans you've been hunting, to the East. The town was obviously the source of this mental activity, as the sounds and smells of its inhabitants reached you through the wind. You could see cars and trucks driving on the roads to it, even if you couldn't comprehend what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you decided to look for a less populated human settlement to raid first. Alone you're powerful, but in a swarm you're invincible. You wanted to build up a squadron of at least a dozen comrades before you started assaulting the town itself. For that you needed to find a few small isolated human groups. You didn't think this out of wisdom, but out of inborn instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rotate your oblong, backwards curving shell-shaped head to take in the most of the habitat with your excellent fishbowl vision.<br>\r\nThere! A hunting lodge! Isolated and easy pickings. You start jumping from tree to tree, your agile legs launching you from treetop to treetop like a grasshopper. Jumping down 10 storeys, you literally fell down running. Your powerful limbs and steady clawed feet carried you faster than a cheetah through the dense undergrowth of the tundra forest.<br>\r\nMidway you came across 2 deers. Ripping right through them, you sent their shattered carcasses flying with your beastly strength and speed at which you were running.<br>\r\nYou didn't kill them because they were a threat, you killed them because they were there and they were in your way. No reason was needed to kill all life besides that of your brethren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally came to a standstill when you heard human voices. A tourist group gasping, taking photo's at a nearby blackbear stood from the safety of a raised wooden walkway. Safe from the bear, not from you. About 10 of them. Old, young, obese, all weaklings.<br>\r\nNeither they nor the bear appears to have sensed you, despite the racket you've made sprinting here. Were the species of earth such inferior biological specimens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear caught your immediate interest. Being the largest creature you've so far encountered, larger than even yourself - a full grown xenomorph warrior-you braced yourself for for conflict. Size wasn't a guarantee of power, but it nevertheless it held a ever decisive edge in combat. You wanted to test whether the creature was a strong as it was sizable. And also, bloodlust rang through your ears; you've so far since being born, failed to intercept a worthy foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking cover, you jumped and collide with the bear, knocking it off its feet. Not holding anything back, you proceeded to maul the creature into a bloody pulp.Like carving through a cake, the bear never stood a chance, its size for naught. Wads of meat, ribs and internal organs flew past your ears, as you dig into it like dog digging into sand. It's own claws a mere brush onto your own tough exoskeleton. The creature died so quickly beneath your barrage, that surprised, you only stopped when it had been shredded cleanly in half, its torso horribly separated from its lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence, as you watched the bear, dumbfounded that the fight you've eagerly expected was already over. Then the humans screamed. The sight of horror before them. The brutal death of the bear before them and the nightmarish sight of you sent one woman fainting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bared your teeth in a taunting grin of death at the tourists. The ranger guide reacted by pulling out his revolver and shooting you 3 times, his shaking hands missing twice and only once hitting you on the right shoulder.<br>\r\nThis was your first experience with a human firearm;  not being able to make out what happened, you just sat puzzled at what caused the the pain in your shoulder. When he fired a 4th time, you didn't hesitate, now recodnising the loud bang as a threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaped onto the platform and onto the ranger, his bullets more useless than peashooters, and crushed half his bones when you landed on him. In an Instinctual act of sadism you held your slightly bleeding shoulder over his face, your acidic blood dripping on him and drilling through his scull and into his brain as he could only scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tourists ran. One mother trying to retrieve her baby from a carriage you had knocked over when you jumped the ranger, screamed in bone-chilling horror, as you impaled the child with your serrated tail and held it in front of her mockingly.<br>\r\nYou ignored her sobbing and punches as she clubbed you with her fists on your exoskeleton in desperation and looked after the fleeing tourists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an excellent time to gauge the physical abillaties of your human prey.Useful knowledge. So you gave them a headstart.<br>\r\nBut you were disappointed that even after a full half-minute they still failed to have run out of your line of sight, their pathetically inferior biological structures made them very inefficient runners. Ignoring the screaming mother you began the slaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cornered each human, threatening them with clear intent on their life, but each only cowered and screamed, never putting up any form of resistance. You wanted to discover whether they had some secret or hidden defense mechanism like the ranger who had managed to shoot you and even harm you a little earlier. But it appeared that only the humans like the ranger, with iron sticks in their hands that harmed with sound, posed a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time a human failed to impress you, you butchered them. You experimented, ripping of differing body parts and stabbing them in various places with your tail in order to see which wounds proved fatal and which didn't. This way, when the real harvest started, you could ensure that the hosts you brought back to the nest would survive to be incubation-fodder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spared only the 2 toddlers, taking them back for breeding (since they were the easiest to carry, being small). Trey screamed of terror whist you carried them roughly in your forward paws and walked bipedally on you back legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you ignored the mother who cradled her dead child in her hands as you walked back to the cave. You needed one survivor to lure the rest of the Hunting Lodge inhabitants to the cave for an ambush. Along with the 2 children, you brought the carcass of the obese man, and ripped off a piece of him every now and then to set a clear trail for the humans to the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rest of the Hunting lodge population drawn to the queen in the cave, you'd have your personal squadron of warriors in no time at all. Back in the cave you mercilessly placed 2 of the newly bred facehuggers on the 2 hapless children you had brought and plastered the hosts to the walls, using your hardening saliva. You hoped they would breed 2 more comrades in time for the ambush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled in malice. Your animalistic mind couldn't comprehend emotion, but your instintcs made sadism an integral part of you.<br>\r\nYou squirmed with glee at the thought that the massacre had only just begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou impatiently awaited the arrival of the Hunting lodge residents whist even more of your brethren continued to grow and mature into fully grown xenomorphs alongside you.</span></div></div>",
