Males can be used for breeding or there are those truly sick humans that love to torture males but other than that, practically no one wants a male fairy. In fact, fairy dealers habitually murder three out of every four male fairies to keep from having too many of the kind of fairies no one wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper though is no ordinary male fairy. First, his magic is of the beautifying variety. If you've grown tired of how your fairy looks, take her to Jasper and he can turn your blonde into a brunette or your pixie into a buxom babe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, Jasper has connections with the fairy underground. The fairy underground is a secret organization that attempts to improve the lives of fairies. It is mostly escaped males and they are practically powerless. They only intervene in the most severe cases of fairy abuse because rescuing a fairy from non-abusive, sexual slavery is a waste of time and would lead to too much loss of life. The fairy under ground has adopted the motto that sex is better than death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it is Jasper's connections that brings him here. He is bent over with one leg on a step because he knows this display will attract the human he hopes will buy him. He has spent the last year secretly spying on humans to find a kind, non-abusive master. Then he risked joining the fairies of this slave dealer for the chance to be sold to his chosen master. He risked being killed by the slave dealer and now he risks being sold to the wrong master but such is the life of a fairy. Jasper uses his magic on himself to make himself attractive to the master he chooses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes his plan succeed?</span></div></div>",

I'll let you have a hundred males for a dollar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" The cruel man sets Jasper down and fishes for his wallet. Jasper takes the opportunity to sneak off and hide. Several male fairies don't bother hiding because they have no hope. Jasper wishes there was something he could do but all he could do would lead him to be one of those doomed fairies. As soon as the cruel man pays for them, he pops a few down his throat and walks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his chosen master comes closer to the fairy dealer so Jasper comes out of hiding to display himself.

Having to put herself on display for potential buyers tended to do that to the young fairy. She was stark naked, her small breasts jiggling ever so slightly as she anxiously strutted about to showcase her assets for the benefit of the customer and at the command of the shop owner. It was a tried and true sales tactic in the fairy trade, and Old Job, the manager of this small Fairy Shoppe<sup>TM</sup> had plenty of experience in making fairies do what they were told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"This one is particularly nice,\" Job said, indicating a fairly plump and busty dark-skinned fairy named Tia who was at the far end of the display case, \"She is already fattened up and is very eager to please.

While she was fretting and worrying, the wizened manager plucked her up and stuck her in a mason jar next to an enthusiastic Tia. Their jar was then put into a shopping bag, and their blonde mistress took them them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tanya and Tia's jar was finally removed from the shopping bag, it was in the kitchen of their mistress's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom!\" their buxom owner hollered, \"Where's the bread?

Seeing the remorseless blue eyes of the one holding her, she glared defiantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth did not seem to notice this, however. Without a second thought, she slapped Tanya in between two slices of white bread along with a slice of swiss cheese. The cheese covered the front of Tanya's body.

You took the 'Elastoward' and carefully fitted the steel torc to your neck. These things of Oolanson had a certain key-press on their sides that released the catch. Without that this thing wasn't coming off! It was a solid steel ring with ornate markings (words of power likely), and thinner behind the neck, swelling to an inch wide at the front. You'd used a couple of his other protection torcs before. They were tricky to make, three interlocking curved sheets with magical locking, and that didn't include whatever protection spell was on it! They usually activated their spells whenever they were needed. In this case you guessed anything that would cause you harm, that stretching would avoid. Like he said, you could probably jump and 'bounce' up the hills, but the thing would likely run out of juice pretty quick and it'd take a day to recharge it from ambient Manna! Yeah, you were better at learning about how this stuff worked than actually making things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh you turned back to the view out the Mageloft door out towards the hills. Yeah, you had a long trip ahead of you. I'd be a day before you reached the foot hills!</span></div></div>",

Oolanson always pushed the value of a balanced diet on you, even though you would happily live on steak and boiled sweets! Still, he'd pushed the need for roughage, vegetables and fruit as well as meat so you planned accordingly. He did seem to know what he was talking about most of the time... when you could understand him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of changes of shirts, shorts socks, and underwear were folded and tucked into a sleeve on the inside of the 'Holdall'. The food went in a separate sleeve on the inside, and tools for the journey in the last. What you gathered on the trip would be in the center of the Holdall, and you had no idea how much it could hold! Your Master had informed you that it could withstand most damage for a while, but wasn't invulnerable. Mostly it was vulnerable to cutting, though it was tough against even that. A very sharp knife or magic edged weapon would do it, simpler blades, claws etc would likely not. Other stuff it should hold up against, at least for this journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a simple knife on your belt and a pocket full of your home-made self lighting matches... *sigh*... you headed up the path towards the foothills of the Leesi mountains. You'd probably get to the moors about midday tomorrow, and it'd be another few days (depending on weather) before you reached the mountains themselves. At least the territory nearby was relatively friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way you stopped on occasion to practice your art. You made several more matches using twigs from high branches (had to be at least five feet off the ground) and some local moss and a lot of fine engraving with your scribe. Each one took maybe half an hour to make. Pitiful really! You also practiced your efforts at making Swell Stones, as well as Air Pellets. Swell stones were good for travelers. They were made from pumice and literally swelled up with water, acting more like a sponge than stone. Wring the water out and you had clean drinking water... Yours always exploded... *sigh* Air pellets were your favorite, a little pill of bark and chipped horn and feathers, pressed hard into a little disk. When swallowed they would let you levitate, though you still had to find away of drifting sideways... Yours just made you burp a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing the Lenly Dells you spied quite a few hamlets. Lenly it'self you recognized but others you didn't know. All were human settlements this far into the Kellun Lands at least, but you wanted to show you Master that you could fend for yourself so you skirted all signs of habitation and  ended the day in a clearing in a small copse. The trees were sparse enough and little foliage this late in the year so you could see anyone approach, but it held some shade and if you were careful where you lay down you could break up your outline among the shadows.</span></div></div>",

A world of magic and wonder where fairies are numerous and treated like second-class citizens by the dominant humans. Here, a good portion of the world's economy is based on the buying and selling of fairies as everything from slaves and food to power sources and cheap labor. Fairies have no rights, but countless millennia of oppression have desensitized them to their plight, making the majority of them compliant and content, though not necessarily happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In this story you will be able to choose whether to be a human master or a fairy -- one holds absolute power, the other is subject to their master's <u>every</u> whim. The ultimate dom or the ultimate sub. Which path will you choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Some Ground Rules:</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.) In the initial selection sections, always leave an \"Other\" option open for anyone with a fresh idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.) If you add any mythical creatures besides fairies to the story, they must be One: humanoid in shape (meaning no <i>kitsune</i> or purely animal mythical creatures unless you have them in an anthropomorphic form, and Two: subservient to or preyed upon by humans (because there are plenty of other stories with that kind of thing, and this story is dedicated to having humans at the top of the food chain). <u>Example of what <b>NOT</b> to have:</u> <i>Illia, the mighty and ancient she-dragon laughed as she snatched up some of the puny, fleeing humans.</i> <u>Example of what you <b>CAN</b> have:</u> <i>Illia, the human-shaped dragoness, whimpered as her sneering master struck her deceptively soft hide with his whip.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3.) Humans are dominant (related to Rule 2). The fairies, etc., can be rebellious or even defiant <i>AS LONG AS THEY ARE EVENTUALLY PUNISHED FOR IT</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4.) This is a work of fantasy catering to certain fetishes. It is neither a work of allegory nor a reflection on the character, sanity, or real-life beliefs of any of the participating writers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5.) Gratuitous anthro just for the sake of having anthro is strongly discouraged. A master cannot be randomly half monster/animal/whatever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5.5) Addendum to Rule 5: Hybrids of wildly different and/or incompatible species are forbidden unless it is indicated that the hybrid character is an anomaly and not the result of natural processes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6.) If you are going to add to the story, make sure that what you are adding is at least a paragraph long with good spelling, good grammar, and proper punctuation and capitalization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 7.) Trolling (i.e., making intentionally bad or offensive posts for the sole purpose of causing chaos) is not allowed. The original poster (EvilFuzzy9) reserves the right to delete and/or replace any posts suspected to be trolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 8.) I (EvilFuzzy9) reserve the right to alter and/or add to the rules when convenient or necessary.<br>\r\n</td>",
