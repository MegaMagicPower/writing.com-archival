While the 45 year old man had been an athlete in his youth, the fellow's appetites had led to him carrying a little over 280 pounds on his 6 foot tall frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly dropped his lunch as he adjusted his glasses and quickened his pace. A little self-conscious about his weight, he promised himself that he'd start a diet tomorrow, regretting his decision to start the day off with the cream-filled doughnut in his other hand. He tried not to think about the fact that he had made the same resolution the day before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he wasn't pleased with folks comparing him to the late great John Candy, he just never seemed to be able to summon up enough willpower to fight the good fight in regards to battling his expanding waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Matt had been scheduled to work at 9:00 A.M., it was closer to 9:30 now. Fortunately, his fellow managers had gotten used to his chronic lateness. They all joked about how it was impossible to stay annoyed at \"the Big Guy\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding through the automatic doors, he nearly dropped his bag again as he gave a wave to Izzy Bailey, a petite, pale, pretty little 19 year old red-head who was manning the store's cash register. \"Yo, Red!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green eyed little beauty giggled. \"Nice of you to join us, Mr. Porter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. I got stopped by a train!\" He answered with his standard excuse for being late and Izzy rolled her eyes and laughed when he said it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned left and headed into the open door of the Manager's office. Inside, seated at his desk was Jason Barnet. Also sporting glasses, Jason was close to Matt's age at 43. But, he was fairly thin. He kept his head clean-shaven, and was a bit shorter than Matt, standing at 5 foot 10 or so. \"Ahh, the prodigal manger has arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Red already gave me a hard time.\" Matt sat his lunch down on the top of a filing cabinet, tossed the pens onto his desk, and proceeded to take a big bite of his doughnut as he sat down in front of his computer monitor in order to catch up on corporate's emails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled as a little cream-filling squired out onto Matt's face. \"I see the diet is going about as well as usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gave him a snarl. \"Don't you have kitty litter to stock or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed again as he grabbed Matt's packed lunch. \"Yeah, among other things. I'll drop your lunch off back in the break room fridge. Maybe if it's on the other side of the store you'll actually have it left for later in the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sat his doughnut down and tossed a roll of tape at Jason playfully as the other manager left the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a morning like so many others, for all concerned. Little did they know, that things were about to get much more unusual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What is about to befall the gallant crew of the Columbus Ohio PetZaar?!?!)</span></div></div>",

Half-expecting it to be his wife sending him an update on her dinner plans for the evening, he sat his coffee down and picked it up to discover that it was from Jason, on the other side of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heads up big guy. One of your favorite regulars is in the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiled broadly as he wiped the cream-filling off of his face with a napkin. While he loved his wife of 20 years Shelly dearly, and was devoted to his teenage son and daughter, Matt was a bit of a horn-dog when it came to \"checking out\" particularly attractive pet-parent customers from afar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike he always said to Jason, \"I'm married, not dead!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The Mermaid?!?! Hot Damn!!\" Matt scrambled out of his chair, pulled his pants up and headed out onto the sales-floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mermaid was one of his favorites. In regularly, about every two weeks or so, the young woman was a keen aquarium enthusiast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had given her her nickname due to her distinctive fashion sense. A very, very pretty young woman in her mid-20s, she seemed to be just as devoted to ocean-themed fashion and accessories as she was to aquaculture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt towered over her, what with her being only 5 foot 3 or so. He didn't know if it was because she was self-concious because of her height, or if she just liked how she looked in them, but she was ALWAYS strutting around the store in towering high heeled shoes or boots. Matt listened for the tell-tale clicking of her foot-falls as he sought her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grinned as he rounded a corner and spotted her down an aisle from behind. Her hair was pulled back in a pony-tail, and was dyed a shaded of teal-blue. She was wearing a tight, thin, long-sleeved, black shirt. Her firm, incredibly enticing little behind was sheathed in a metallic, blue-green, fish-scale-patterned pair of painted on leggings that clung to every curve of her fantastic lower body and wonderful legs. Each step resulted in a tell-tale click, as the souls of her black, high-heeled ankle-boots made contact with the tiled floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it the \"queen of the sea\" is getting more goodies for her swimming subjects?\" Matt chuckled as he walked down the aisle toward the beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, the beautiful young Asian-American woman flashed him a winning smile as her teal-blue glossed lips parted, a seashell-shaped purse swinging around behind her on it's strap as she spun to face him. Matt tried not to stare too long at her impressive chest, pushing outward on the thin material of her black top, a stylized sequined wave-pattern flashing across it. \"Hi Mr. Porter!\" she giggled girlishly. \"Yeah, the fishies need their num-nums!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't have the fishies do without their num-nums, can we?\" he laughed, as he did his best not to be too obvious with his leering, his eyes traveling up the length of her perfectly sculpted legs from the tops of her boot shafts to the lower hem of her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's gotta be a runner...</i> he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you need any help, you just give me a holler, little lady!\" he gave her a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you're always so sweet! I should be okay.\" she giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning on her towering boot heels, she strode off toward the fish food aisle, as Matt admired the sight of her clicking along on her way from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back up front to the cash register, Matt made small talk with Izzy as he waited for The Mermaid to inevitably head that way. Sure enough, 10 minutes or so later, the ocean-themed little lovely strode up to the registers with an assortment of fish foods and frozen treats for her aquatic charges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find everything okay?\" Izzy asked as she started scanning the Mermaid's products. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's in here so often, she probably knows where everything is better than you do, Izzy!\" Matt offered, as the two young women laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Izzy informed her of the total, Matt stepped in. \"That won't do. How about a 20% discount?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy leaned back and gave Matt a surprised look. He NEVER handed out discounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!? That'd be great! You're not going to get in trouble for that, are you?\" the Mermaid asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt guffawed. \"Trouble?!? I run this place. Besides, corporate is very understanding about the need to keep our dependable regulars happy.\" He gave her a wink as he typed in the override on the register. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so sweet! I wish I had something to give you in return!\" the mermaid smiled broadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just having you in here brightening our day is more than enough. Give the fishies my regards!\" Matt gave her a wave and headed over to the office door as Izzy finished checking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the entrance to his office, Matt gave the Mermaid one last, head to toe admiring look as he watched her gather up her purchases, tell Izzy goodbye and clicked out the front doors into the parking lot on her booted little feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the building and went out of his sight, Matt turned to head into his office. He took one step when suddenly, an utterly alien, bewildering sensation washed over him! Frozen in mid-stride, his stomach did flip-flops as a weird, cramping, warm sensation flared up within his large belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation grew and changed, going from a cramping feeling to a strange, tingling, electric warmth that began somewhere deep within him until it flared out and enveloped the whole of his body. Simultaneously, a white-blue light washed away his vision, as he was momentarily blinded. For two or three whole seconds, all Matt saw was that white-blue emptiness, and he lost all awareness of himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as quickly as it had happened, the electric sensation faded. As it did, he regained feeling, and his vision began to return. As his foot finally fell to the floor, he heard a surprising click. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining his awareness, with his sight fully returned, he looked down to see a bewildering sight. Where his broad, khaki-clad, blue-sneakered feet should have been, he now found himself standing in a pair of black, high-heeled ankle boots just like the Mermaid had been wearing!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but his legs were clad in fish-scale-patterned, teal-blue leggings just like hers as well!!! \"What in the F...\" he whispered in shock, his words trailing off as he began to realize that he wasn't just inexplicably cross-dressing now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legs clad in those skin-tight, shiny leggings were just as supple, sculpted, and daintily lovely as the Mermaid's had been!!! And those booted feet were just as small as hers!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt those legs and feet as if they were his own, but they felt utterly foreign to him!!! He leaned forward to inspect them, and as he did so, a pair of large, bra-supported breasts strained against a black, silver-sequined wave decorated long-sleeved black blouse. His hands snapped to them, feeling their round, firm but yielding contours and confirming their reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he noticed the hands he was gripping his new-found breasts with were not his own as well! Thin, delicate fingers with expertly manicured teal-blue painted nails had replaced his big, manly manipulators. He teetered on his now high-heeled, booted feet, unfamiliar with the center of gravity and sensations of the much smaller, radically different frame he now found himself staring down at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-this can't be happening...\" he whispered in an awed, terrified tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the office at a mirror on the far wall, he saw his baffled, wide-eyed face sitting atop the small, lovely body of the Mermaid!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly walking toward the reflection, his mouth wide open in shock, he saw his own all-too familiar noggin sitting atop the thin, graceful neck of the beautiful young woman he'd been ogling mere minutes before. Cupping one of her breasts with one hand, his other reached up and felt a thin, soft, bright green choker separating his cranium from her former body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choker felt strange, warm, and foam like. It was thin, perhaps only a half an inch in width. Looking at his surprised face, he realized that his big, male head SHOULD have looked even more out of proportion with her slight, girlish frame. But, his dome seemed to be perfectly proportioned with her anatomy, having lost several hat-sizes when whatever had befallen him had occurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...how...\" He was confused, but realized that when he spoke, his voice still sounded like his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis composure and thinking clearing as the initial shock and horror wore off, Matt suddenly spun around, nearly tripping on his new heels as he scampered out of the office. Was she still in the lot?!?! Would the woman who's body he now had have his own?!?!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Boot heels clicking, Matt rushed out of his office and toward the cash register. \"Is she still out there?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy looked out the front doors toward the lot. \"She's pulling out right now, why? Did you change your mind on the discount?\" she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nearly fell as he trotted over to the doors until they slid open. \"Wait!!!\" He could see her pulling out, squinting, he could make our her pretty, smiling head sitting atop his big, burly, PetZaar polo-shirted upper body as she drove out of the lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't she see?!?! Doesn't she feel it?!?!\" he was completely baffled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what, Mr. Porter?\" Izzy asked as she walked out from behind the cash register and looked him in the eyes, concern now on her face. \"You seem upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course I'm upset!!! Can't you see....THIS?!?!\" He used his new, lithe arms and hands to gesture toward the much smaller body he now found himself shackled with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he had formerly towered over Izzy, now they were standing eye to eye, even with the benefit of his new high heeled soles. \"What, did you forget your uniform shirt? I think I have an extra one in my locker that should fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was dumbstruck. His small new shoulders slumped as his head cocked. \"Izzy, I-I have boobs now? Can't you see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy blushed, and suddenly looked annoyed. Bringing her arms close in to cover up her own flat chest, she turned and headed back to her register. \"If that's a joke about how even a guy like you has a better rack than me, a girl, it's not very funny, Mr. Porter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was utterly baffled. Somehow, his body had been swapped with the lovely \"Mermaid's,\" and neither she, nor Izzy had appeared to have noticed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter standing there for a few awkward minutes across from the now-silent, apparently offended Izzy, he decided to head to the back of the store and find Jason. Surely, he would see something was amiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing groups of shopping customers, he couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed, wearing such a girly ensemble, despite the fact that he now had the anatomy to suit it. But, that humiliation evaporated as no one seemed to pay any attention to him, just giving him passing glances and the occasional nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, he rounded the corner to find Jason loading kitty litter buckets onto display shelving. \"Hey boss-man. Did you see your favorite eye-candy?\" the other manager chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding, right?!?!\" Matt stopped, and gestured at his new body once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you finally figured out that she's got a bit of a gut on her? I've never understood why you fancied that one. She's built like a retired NFL linebacker.\" Jason laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason...for Christ's sake...can't you see that something's happened to me?!?! I-I have the Mermaid's body!!!\" Matt was feeling desperate. He rushed to the other man and grabbed his shoulders and shook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt...what are you talking about? I mean, despite being a dude you have a body most chicks would kill for, but you always have? Are you feeling okay?\" Jason was now sounding concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's small new shoulder's slumped yet again as he let go of the grip he had on Jason. \"I-I don't know.\" Turning around, he walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you take a breather in the office. Try to shake this off. I'll mind the store!\" Jason shouted after him. Watching his boss and friend walk away, he couldn't help but admire Matt's new leggings-clad, taught little derriere. \"Damn, I'll bet the Mermaid WOULD love to have a caboose like that...\" he whispered and chuckled as he went back to loading litter. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shuffling along in a daze, boot heels clicking, Matt headed back up front to his office, shutting the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at himself in the mirror again, still not believing what had befallen him. His familiar, albeit slightly down-sized visage gazed back at him from atop \"The Mermaid's\" much more dainty form. \"The Mermaid. I should have asked her what her name was...\" he mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the strange, thin green choker around his small new neck. He couldn't find any edge or separation no matter how much he probed it with his painted nails. It was fused to his, and her, flesh...joining them quite securely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, could see his borrowed breasts moving beneath the fabric of a shirt that wasn't his. Looking down at the mermaid-scale leggings he could make out the faintest hint of a camel-toe. He felt her body as if it were his own, every movement, every jiggle, the fabric of her garments against her smooth skin, the strange void between her thighs, the sway of her hips...he shuddered and flopped down into his chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chair? It didn't feel the same. It always felt a little cramped when he lowered his big, beefy self into it. Now, it felt enormous, with his cute new little fanny taking up much less acreage of it's surface. He sat there for a bit, just taking it all in and considering his options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he head to an Emergency Room? The police? If Izzy and Jason, two people who knew him and saw him every day didn't realize anything was out of sorts, why would strangers? He'd just end up coming off as a lunatic. Jason was already looking at him like a nut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning the chair towards the desk, he lifted his new right ankle put up, propping it's tall heel up on his desk. \"Definitely wasn't limber enough to do that before...\" he mumbled, as he tugged at the material covering that leg, pulling it up to expose the soft warm skin beneath. Goosebumps formed on it in the AC cooled air of the room, and he confirmed that the seahorse he had seen the last time \"The Mermaid\" had been in while wearing shorts was there. It was definitely her leg...definitely her body...and now...for some unknown reason...through unknown means, it was his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the legging material back down into the boot and lowered it to the floor. \"What in the Hell am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up his smartphone from the desk, he quickly did a 'Net search for people having their heads switched or transplanted. The only results he got were weird, fetishistic stories and photo-shopped nonsense. Not that he expected anything else. There was no way what he was experiencing was something he could research. The laws of physics, nature, biology, Hell, reality itself were being violated. HE and that poor girl were being violated. But to what end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself wondering about his wife and children. Would they be like Izzy and Jason? How could they not see what had happened to him? He'd been married to Shelly for 20 years...known his kids all their lives...they had to remember him as he was supposed to be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of them, he glance over at a framed, family portrait he kept on his desk. \"My God...\" he gasped. While his chubby, middle aged wife, teenage son and daughter looked as they had always had in the photo, posed and dressed up in their Sunday best, his smiling face now sat atop \"the Mermaid's\" hot little body, wearing a dressy, navy blue dress covered with little white seashell designs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the actual fuck?!?!?\" He clearly remembered sitting down and posing for the photo...wearing his church suit...worrying that he looked a bit too enormous...fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up his phone again, he scrolled through his stored photo album. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a photo that originally showed him posing with his church softball team, clad in a big jersey and baggy shorts, his ball-cap clad smiling face now sat atop his lovely new body, wearing a pair of tiny pink, white trimmed gym shorts, and a jersey tied off high to expose his new tight, enticing little belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a photo of him and his daughter standing in front of the castle at Disney World from a vacation a couple of years ago, his still smiling face sat atop \"The Mermaid's\" increasingly familiar body, wearing white high-heeled ankle boots, a pair of purple mermaid-scaled leggings like he was sporting now, and a branded \"Little Mermaid\" t-shirt that was waaaaay too tight. He and his daughter were wearing matching mouse-ear caps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn yet another photo, one showing him and his son on a fishing trip to Canada, the pair still stood smiling and giving a thumbs while standing on the boat dock, but now, his grinning, fishing-cap topped, oblivious noggin sat atop \"The Mermaid's\" body wearing an incredibly tiny baby blue bikini while standing in a pair of pink wellie boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the phone photo album. Not wanting to see any more. It was like his whole passed was being taken from him...changed...perverted. How did aging work out?!? He was 45, damn it!!! Not only was he perched atop a woman half his age, but she appeared to constantly be that age in photos from years ago?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing the phone angrily on the desk. He noticed that the young woman's seashell shaped purse was sitting there as well. \"Maybe her ID is in there?!?! I can track her down...surely she knows somethings wrong now...or maybe she knows what's causing this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a dark green wallet decorated with a repeating pattern featuring white starfish, he pulled a drivers license out with his delicate new fingers. To his bewilderment, his face, topping her body, sat staring back at him. \"Matt Porter...5 foot 3...110 pounds...male?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat the wallet and license down on his desk, and slumped back into his chair. \"None of this makes any damn sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

No...yeah...look...I-I'm not feeling well.\" Matt answered breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to head home? We're okay if you want to call it a day early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of facing his wife and kids like this, even if they didn't see anything wrong with the situation, made Matt's new stomach develop butterflies. He looked down and shook his head no. \"I'm okay...I'll...I'll catch up on some paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool boss-man. Look, you'd better throw on a uniform shirt though. You know how the District Manager doesn't like it when we're not official.\" Jason tossed a small blue PetZaar polo shirt onto the desk. \"I snagged one of Izzy's extras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason walked over to the file cabinet and pulled an extra name-tag out. \"Don't forget your Manager Matt tag too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt closed his eyes and nodded his head. Jason left, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Matt slid the woman who's body he'd been trapped with's black shirt off. He looked at himself in the mirror, seeing the lovely, bra-clad upper body of her on full display. \"Nice rack. Not the perspective I'd care to look at it from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid the polo Jason had brought him. Izzy's tiny uniform shirt was BARELY up to the task of covering his big borrowed tits, the fabric hugging ever curve and contour of them. They pulled the fabric of the shirt up, giving enticing glimpses of his new fetching little belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he put the name-tag on. He stared at himself in the mirror, a shell-shocked expression on his face for what felt like an eternity. He was shaken from his mute contemplation when...</span></div></div>",

It felt weird...oddly centered...inward...but it was the unmistakable urge and need to take a piss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" He gritted his teeth and stomped angrily from the office all the way back to the men's room, a single occupancy affair near the break-room. He'd purposefully avoided thinking about, let alone looking at his new nether-regions, and now he had no choice but to deal with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking the door behind him, he slid his new body's leggings down to his knees, finding that \"the Mermaid\" apparently had gone commando today, with no panties in sight. \"No wonder she has a camel-toe. Kinda slutty.\" he grumbled as he planted her broad little butt onto the toilet seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there for a moment..unsure if he should release himself...and if he were doing it correctly. But, as the need to piss grew, he finally gave in, letting loose with the expected waterworks below him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like riding a bike.\" he muttered. Although, he had to admit, it felt quite different from his usual potty visits. \"Riding a bike side-saddle...Jesus...\" he sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that he was empty, he wiped up and sat back down. As much as he hadn't wanted to deal with it, now that he was stuck looking at it, he couldn't help but give his new equipment a closer inspection. He ran one of her painted-nail-festooned hands down her tight little belly, towards her shaven, pert little snatch. \"Oh to be young again...\" he whispered, before laughing sadly, \"...of course, now that I think about it I technically am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd seen pussy before, of course. He was a married man, and he'd had an active social life before that. BUT, he'd dealt with the same vagina for 20 years. AND, he'd never looked at one from this angle before, nor had he felt the sensations that came along with being the one that had it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, at first, both because he was embarrassed AND he felt like he was dealing with someone else's real-estate (as it were), he probed it's outer edges gently. But, as he grew a little more bold, he found that he was liking the sensations that came along with a deeper, slightly more forceful exploration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but moan as he increased both the depth and speed of his probing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ecstasy was cut short however when someone began pounding heavily on the door. \"Hey!! I gotta go!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped, equal parts terrified and embarrassed as he teetered up off of the toilet on his high heeled boots. \"Uh!!! Yo!!! Occupied!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta go!!!\" an insistent, impatient voice growled through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hurrying...I'm hurrying...son of a...\" Matt grumbled as he pulled his new leggins up over his moist, unfulfilled new sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, an customer, an old man impatiently shoved him aside and slammed the door behind him. \"I hope you didn't stink it up in there.\" he growled at Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed, shaking his head as he did his best to recover after his near-orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe... </span></div></div>",

A tall, pretty caramel skinned, Hispanic-American woman with a thick, long mane of dark hair, she spun around and flashed Matt a grin. A couple hears older than Matt, she was a little self-conscious about her aging, AND her slightly oversized rear-end. Still, she was pretty for a lady pushing 50, and Matt had always thought she was probably a hot little tamale in her youth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up big guy. Jason said you were feeling out of sorts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the added height of his new heels, Matt was looking up at Sue and Jason both. Disconcerting, as he'd always towered over all of his co-workers previously. \"Yeah. I...I might be catching a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you ate too many doughnuts this morning?\" Sue laughed, as she playfully slugged Matt in the shoulder, causing the now small-lady-bodied general manager to stagger and teeter on his heels. Sue quickly caught and steadied him, more than strong enough to keep his small new body aloft. \"Careful. You and your high heels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grimaced. \"Yeah...me and my high heels. Look, I think I'm going to call it a day. Will you guys be able to run the show without me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Sue smiled at each other. \"Geez, how helpless do you think we are?\" Sue laughed. \"No worries. You go take a load off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Jason...could you walk with me up to the office...I have to go over a thing or two with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair walked, Matt whispered to his friend. \"Look. I can't really explain it, but if \"The Mermaid\" comes in, could you ask her what her name is? Kinda find out about her for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked uncomfortable. \"Uhhhh...look, Matt...I don't know how I feel about that. I mean, I know and like your wife and all and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook his head forcefully. \"No...no! I'm not trying to hook up...err...I just...uh...there's a young guy at church who I think would get along with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason brightened up upon hearing Matt's lie. \"Oh! Sure dude! Now worries. I'll play detective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. It means a lot. I think her and this young man might get along. I...I'll see ya later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpent and not really knowing what he would do next, Matt gathered up his things and headed out to his car, his heels clicking with each step on the pavement of the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing into his car, he found that he had to slide the seat waaaaay up to reach the pedals. Looking up at the rear-view mirror, he found that his Cleveland Browns air freshener had been replaced with a girly looking mermaid one. </span></div></div>",

He was incredibly apprehensive about heading home to his family while in his current condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there with his head pressed up against his steering wheel and groaned. He tried not to think about the breasts he had found him saddled with pressing against the wheel as well.  He played out the possible scenarios he was about to experience in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought it was probably most likely that his wife and kids would be just like everyone else, and wouldn't see anything unusual with his predicament. He didn't take a lot of comfort in that. He already felt like a madman, with no one seeming to understand what had been done to him. \"Am I actually delusional?!?! Is this some kind of hallucination?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back, and grabbed his tits with his small new hands. They certainly felt real enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him hoped that his family would see what had befallen him, and understand how wrong it was, though he didn't relish the thought of that as well. Would they still treat him like their husband and father?!?! Hell, the bulk of him was an entirely different person. Would Shelly still...love him...want him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it!!!\" Matt slammed both of his tiny new fists into the steering wheel in a helpless rage, jumping when he inadvertently triggered the car's horn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it.\" he whispered to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing phone vibrate and chime, he retrieved it from his new purse with his new dainty hands. His wife had sent him a text message asking if he was running late, and informing him that dinner was ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned, Matt sighed, turned the key, and headed home. </span></div></div>",

Where usually, he'd have been all over Matt, sniffing and nuzzling for attention and praise, now, he seemed cautiously friendly and a little confused. \"It's me boy, do you recognize me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog let Matt pet him on the head, but kept a bit of distance. \"Man, you seem a lot bigger to me, boy. Of course, I probably seem quite a bit smaller to you.\" The dog proceeded to sniff and prod Matt's new body with his nose, lingering on his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncomfortable both with the foreign sensation his pooches nose were stirring in his new nether-regions, AND with being reminded of the absence therein, Matt pushed the dog away with his new hands. \"Alright...alright. That's enough. Yeah...it's new to me too, ya big furry doofus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping up into the house from the garage into the kitchen, Matt nervously walked inside, his ankle-boots heels clicking on the tiled floor. He leaned forward with a sheepish, worried smile on his face, holding the purse strap with both his hands. He could see his wife, facing the counter, putting the finishing touches on supper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA real hottie in her youth, Shelly had put on a few extra pounds over the years. BUT, she was still cute as a button. Her extra weight sat well on her, giving her curves to spare. She kept her blond hair cut short, framing her face with what she called a \"Mom-er-rific Bob.\" She wore a pair of dark framed glasses, and had tastefully applied makeup on. She was wearing a checkered bib-overall shorts dealie, with a white turtleneck beneath it. Her legs were clad in dark pantyhose, a pair of low-heeled black zip-up knee boots on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt cleared his throat. \"Uh...I'm home...I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife turned and looked at him. \"Well, well, well, Papa Bear finally made it home.\" She smiled, but her brow furrowed and her nose wrinkled with slight annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...sorry...it's been a heck of a day...\" he stood their, holding his breath...letting Shelly look him over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled reassuringly. \"Well, you made it home. I made Lil Smokies and cornbread! Though I'm sure you'll only manage to eat a few bites. My Papa Bear eats like a bird. Thank goodness your Son's appetite is up to the challenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed and closed his eyes. She didn't see. Everything seemed hunky dory to her. Her husband's head had been downsized and transposed onto some poor young Asian-American girl's body and Shelly seemed entirely unaware of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt thought about what she'd said. \"Eat like a bird? I'm always down for 3 or 4 helpings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly looked at him with a skeptical smile on her face. \"Since when? Not that I'm not envious. I wish I had your self control...you and your adorable little belly. I swear Matt, you haven't put on a pound in the 20 years since our first date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tossed the purse onto a countertop. \"Our first date. I was a man on our first date...I was a man over the past 20 years...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly looked at him and cocked her head. \"Yep. My man. Just like your my man now and always will be. Are you feeling insecure about being a little petite again, Papa Bear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was incredulous. <i>Insecure about being petite?!?! I've spent the last ten years trying to lose weight!!!</i> \"I don't seem different to you this evening, Shelly?!?! Something doesn't seem...\"off?!?!?\" he grabbed his new boobs and jostled them for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly walked over toward him with a look of concern on her face. \"Sweetie, you look fine. But you're sounding weird. Is everything okay?\" She pressed her own chest against his, reaching behind Matt to grab his legging-clad little ass with her hands, pulling him into an embrace as she looked him in they eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had always towered over his wife, with his big, beefy frame overwhelming her when they were together, making him feel as if he were enveloping her in his bear hug of am embrace. Now, she was doing the enveloping. He was actually a couple of inches shorter than her, even with the heels. Shelly pulled him into her bosom, smashing his own, only slightly smaller tits into hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt really, really strange. Wrong...foreign...alien. But, also undeniably warm...comforting...and a little thrilling. Matt could feel the space between his new thighs react. His borrowed body was getting aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little creeped out, and more than a little embarrassed, Matt pushed his wife away. \"I-I'm fine dear. It was just a rough day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure Papa Bear? You're worrying me.\" Shelly asked. \"Are you up for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt couldn't look at her, turning his head as he walked out of the kitchen. \"I don't know. I-I'm not really hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading into the living room, Matt ran into...</span></div></div>",

Her long blond tresses were pulled back in a messy bun, and the thin, fit, nubile young thing had slipped into a comfy pair of purple booty-shorts and a little pink tank top for the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting her homework tablet down, she hoped up onto her lovely, long, tan lets and scampered over to Matt. Her blue eyes twinkled as she smiled and sang, \"Hello Daddy!!!\" before giving him a hug and kissing him on the cheek. Matt was taken aback by how he was now about the same height as his lovely little girl, though he was more than a little curvier than her runner's build. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back out of her hug, she looked her Father up and down with a quizzical, appraising look. For a moment, Matt held his breath, hoping against hope that his daughter was registering what had befallen him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my legs looked as fabulous as yours do in tights. I always end up looking like I'm riding around on a chicken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's heart sank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo...I love those cute little boots though!!! Are those new?!?!\" her eyes lit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're new to me.\" Matt stumbled over and flopped down in his recliner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I borrow them Saturday?!?! The girls and I are going to a movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't see anything odd about borrowing boots from your Father?\" Matt was beside himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie laughed. \"We've been close enough in size to share outfits for a years, Daddy. Besides, you have much cuter taste than Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt waved his hand derisively at his feet. \"Sure. Fine. Take them. I don't care if I never see another pair of high heeled nonsense again in my entire life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie snorted with laughter. \"Yeah. Sure. Daddy's going to stop wearing heels. Is the Sun going to rise in the West tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wear heels a lot?\" Matt sat up, bewildered but curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh!!! All the time!!! Mamma says it's cause you're self-conscious about your height. Papa Bear feels tiny. But I think it's because you know how fantastic it makes your legs and ass look.\" Sadie gave him a wink as she sat down and picked her tablet back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm setting the table. We'll eat in 10 minutes. Matt dear, change your clothes and wash up. I think getting some food in that little belly of yours will help you mood.\" </span></div></div>",

A much younger, FEMALE person at that!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, to add insult to injury, his daughter was none the wiser as well. The scope of it all was totally overwhelming. His physical being, his very person-hood and identity had been swapped with someone else, and reality, or, everyone other than his' perception of it had been changed as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of this makes any damned sense?!?!\" Matt snarled as he walked down the hallway to his and Shelly's master bedroom. Heading in to the room, Matt's mouth dropped in slack-jawed awe as he became aware that it had changed from what he remembered it being like that morning...and for years before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly more muted, subtle decor was now almost totally femme. The former beige color of the walls was now a shade of pink, with small sea-life design flourishes including stenciled sea-horses, starfish, and even a cute little octopus or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed, still king-sized, was now an enormous circular affair with various aquatic and nautical design choices. \"Some I'm stuck with her body, AND, her dopey, girly-girl mermaid-princess crap too?!?! Shelly puts up with this?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Shelly's makeup table was still as it should be, Matt could see that his cool oak chest of drawers had been replaced with a art nouveau, aquamarine affair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the master bathroom, he could see that it was replete with sea-life design elements as well, with incredibly feminine details. Worse, there was clear evidence that two women, or at least two women's' bodies, were in residence. There were multiple types of perfume, body shaving accoutrements, loufahs and body-washes, and feminine hygiene products. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis old toothbrush, razor, Old Spice deodorant, and so on and so forth were gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the bathroom, he headed toward the large walk-in closet he and Shelly shared. To his horror, all of his jerseys, work polo-shirts, khakis, gym shorts, sneakers, and the like had disappeared as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their place, where hung and folded, a massive amount of VERY girly fashion items. Leggings out the wazoo, both Mermaid themed and solid shiny, tights and hosiery, teeny tiny skirts, blouses, tops, sweaters. All them sized for his small new womanly body, and seemingly focused on showing off and flaunting said body's assets. Most of them were just as mermaid, sea-life, and ocean-themed as the rest of the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoes were a whole other problem. Thigh high, knee high, mid-calf, and ankle boots, all of them with ridiculously high heels were in abundance. Pumps and stilettos abounded.  Many of them had oceanic design elements as well, and the variety of styles and colors put the rainbow to shame. There were a couple of simple, though still girly sneakers and such, but they were incredibly outnumbered by the mountain of carefully arrayed high-heeled footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had always thought Shelly had waaaay too many clothes and shoes, and now, by God, he apparently had ten times the amount she had amassed!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be damned if I wear any of this shit.\" Matt grumbled. Scanning the stuff on hangers, and pulling and rifling through drawers, he was disappointed to find nothing baggy, muted, or less ultra-femme. \"Where are my damned Browns sweats?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found a few Cleveland Browns and Indians themed items...jerseys, t-shirts, shorts, and the like, but all of them were just as tiny, tight, and figure hugging as the rest of his new wardrobe. \"So...I'm a slut? Is this how she dressed...is was all of her clothing like this?\" Matt grumbled, as he remembered that the reason he had Jason keep an eye out for her regular store visits was due to her provocative dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeling out of his clothes, and kicking the damned high heeled ankle boots that had tormented him for the bulk of the day (and caught Sadie's eye), Matt tried to find something more comfortable to wear. The best he could do was slip into a thin, too-tight (to his mind) white tank top, a pair of simple, but too-small (again, to his mind) panties, and a pair of aquamarine booty shorts. He opted to go barefoot, though his tiny, girlish feet tipped with expertly pedicured toenails painted the same shade of green as his new fingernails weren't much of an improvement (yet gain, to his mind).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the bathroom, he couldn't help but gaze in disbelief at his reflection yet again. From the weird green choker down, he saw a body he'd have sold his soul to get a good look at. Her large, yet perky breasts pushing against the white tank's restraint, her broad, round little hips looking fantastic in the little aquamarine shorts....her smooth shoulders, arms, thighs, and calves enough to make any heterosexual man worth his salt drool like a cartoon wolf spotting a 'toon sheep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, there was no denying the incongruity of the head perched atop that small, girlish neck and green choker. While in proportion to the much smaller body, his noggin was unmistakably his own. Unmistakably MALE. He'd lost several hat sizes with the downsizing, and his double chin was gone thanks to the choker, but he still had his chubby cheeks, thick glasses, and simply styled \"Joe-Schmo\" hair. He was even starting to have a visible 5 o'clock shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disparity of skin tones was pretty damned obvious as well. His body had a lovely, smooth, Asian-lovely glow, while his more modestly altered and seemingly original head had the ruddy, imperfect complexion of the average White/Anglo American Doofus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the Hell is it possible that this happened, AND, how is it possible that I'm the only one that sees how fucking wrong it is?!?! Am I going crazy?!?!\" Matt was at his wit's end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without realized he was doing so, Matt slipped his dainty new feet into a pair of \"Little Mermaid\" branded fuzzy slippers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngrily stomping downstairs, he tried not to dwell too much on the sensations he was feeling. The cool air on his smooth exposed legs and arms, the feel of the little shorts swishing across his taught little bottom with each footfall-induced sway of his new hips, the feel of his tank-top clad tits swaying back and forth with each movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awful thing was, that while it all felt foreign and wrong, it also felt kinda pleasurable and invigorating on some level. He was now decades older, much more fit, and had the kind of body his libido had made him seek out like a missile since puberty had claimed him in his teens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that he could feel that deep, inner feeling of arousal starting to flare up again only reminded him that his dick was gone, was now the apparent property of someone else...was lost. \"Fuck this.\" he snarled, under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supper's ready you two!\" Shelly chirped as Matt stepped down into the living room as she poked her head out of the kitchen. \"Zack just texted, he's running late after football practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hungry. I'll eat later. I'll be downstairs...I-I want to be alone for a little bit. I have some work crap to take care of.\" He said he stomped down the hall on his lovely new legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife and daughter exchanged concerned looks as they watched him walk away, before they headed into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind him, and flipping the light-switch on, Matt headed down into what SHOULD have been his familiar, personal sanctuary...his man-cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the room, he was disturbed to find that just like his bedroom, it had been altered over the course of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still some touches he remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome Cleveland Browns and Indians posters, framed sports cards, bobble-heads and the like, were still to be found, though not as numerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a little row of statues and figurines depicting the restaurant mascot \"Big Boy,\" owing to the fact that Matt's friends and Family always thought the rotund was his doppelganger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still several of the large Lego Star Wars sets that he and his son had assembled over the years prominently placed around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big fan of professional wrestling, Matt's signed poster \"wall of fame\" was still in existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUT, there were also changes, much that had not been there before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were 3 large, elaborate aquariums on display, with an assortment of fish and sea life thriving within them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were dozens and dozens of small, delicate porcelain figurines depicting adorable little girly mermaids cavorting with one another and cute little cartoony looking sea-creatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color scheme of the walls and carpet were radically different. The previous, more masculine hues had been replaced with pastel shades of pink, sea-foam green, aquamarine, and lavender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis big comfy easy chairs and the gaming/TV viewing couch had been replaced with loveseats with a giant clam motif, and a big light green sectional sofa festooned with mermaid themed, lacy pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt walked around in a daze, looking over all of the alterations and additions. The room that had once been a shrine to his tastes, interests, and passions, was now about 20% Matt Porter,  and 80% what he could only imagine would have done \"the Mermaid\" proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed without actually finding it humorous. \"That's probably about the right proportion, cause I'm mostly her now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt fell back into one of the big clam-shell loveseats, and looked down at the tits rising and falling with each breath he took, the small, delicate hands, and the equally foreign legs from his bewildering position atop his new body. It was overwhelming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to weep.</span></div></div>",

Grabbing a hand full of tissues from a box on an end table in his now-daintified \"man-cave,\" he dried his eyes and did his best to reign in his emotions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus. Less than a day as a chick and I'm already a sobbing wreck.\" He laughed halfheartedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really knowing what else to do, you turned on the large wall-mounted television and flipped it to his preferred sports channel. He just wanted to do something regular...something expected...something he was familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only half paid attention to the hosts' discourse on Football season developments, as he replayed the days events in his mind. Why was this happening?!?! HOW was this happening?!?! For that matter, was it actually happening, or was it some kind of hallucination?!?! He sure as Hell seemed to be the only one aware of anything being wrong!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 20 minutes or so later, his pretty, perky daughter Sadie bounded down the stairs and into room. Her blond tresses still piled back in a messy, off-center bun, she was still clad in her tiny purple booty shorts and pink tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you missed dinner while were mopping around down here. But you are NOT permitted to skip our Yoga session!\" she chirped as she walked over to a storage cabinet, pulled out a large mat, and unrolled it onto the floor before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoga?!?! What do I now about Yoga?!?!\" Matt didn't even like bending to tie his shoe-laces, and certainly had never contemplated participating in Yoga before in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly Daddy, you're the one who got me into it!\" Sadie smiled as she went into a faux gruff, half-assed manly voiced impersonation of Matt, \"Staying lithe, limber, and graceful doesn't just happen, young lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt sick to his stomach. \"I-I'm not feeling up to anything like that sweetie...it's been a rough day and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie pouted, her preferred and always-successful tactic when attempting to cajole her Father into doing what she wanted. \"But Daddy, we never, ever, ever miss Daddy/Daughter Yoga!!!\" she scampered over to him and dropped down to her knees, putting her hands on his smooth, bare thighs and looking at him with pleading puppy-dog eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt wanted to tell her no. But, found himself unable too. While he had always had a hard time telling his little girl \"no\" before, this was something more profound, more irresistible. His lips parted as he tried to will himself to refuse her request, but found himself unable to speak. He sat there for a moment, confused, mouth wide, almost frozen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally did manage to answer, he uttered the words, \"Okay...okay. Daddy/Daughter Yoga it is,\" in an almost defeated tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;What?!?! I don't want to do this!!!! Why did I say that?!?! No, why am I going along with this, damn it?!?!&gt; Matt screamed inside his mind as his body acquiesced to Sadie's demand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!!!\" Sadie giggled, as she stood up, and led her dazed, confused Father over to the Yoga mat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPositioning herself directly in front of Matt, facing him. Sadie took his hands and began to go through a routine of mirror-image stretches, and poses. Hands linked, the pair stood, crouched, kneeled, and sat across from each other, as they bent forward, backward, and from side to side in what seemed like a set-routine, albeit a set-routine Matt had no conscious recollection off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept trying to will himself to stop, to break off the session and tell his daughter he didn't feel up to it, but it was as if his willpower were being drained. His new body just followed his daughter's lead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience itself was utterly foreign and weird. It was strange to be so near to Sadie, and now dwarf her with his former bulk. They were very nearly the same size now, albeit with his having a bit more in the curves department. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStranger still, was finding himself able to engage in the contortions, stretches, and maneuvers she was subjecting them to! Matt's new limbs and body were moving in ways he would have NEVER dreamed of with the one he'd lived the previous 45 years of his life with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile being so limber, fit, and downright graceful felt wrong, it also felt undeniably GOOD. Pleasurable even. Matt drew no comfort in that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after half an hour, Sadie brought their routine to an end. Packing up the mat, she kissed Matt on the cheek. \"Thank you Daddy! You're the best Yoga buddy EVER!\" and proceeded to trot back up stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stood their, new breasts heaving as he caught his breath, and looked down at his stunning new body in equal parts awe and confusion. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt had barely caught his breath, when he heard the loud, clomping sound of his 18 year old Son, Zack coming down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Papa Bear!\" the young man smirked as he trotted over and leapt over the back of the couch, a can of pop and bag of chips in his hands as he flopped onto the sofa, his eyes glued on the sports channel's scrolling score feed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not used to his new perspective, Matt marveled at now much bigger his Son looked to him now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Sadie where the youthful clone of her Mother, Zack was a time-displaced young counterpart to Matt. Tall and broad shouldered, the young man was blessed with a good metabolism (\"Enjoy it while it lasts, kid!\" as Matt always used to say). He ate like a horse, but didn't have an inch of fat on him. His football conditioning had given him a muscular, toned, quintessentially masculine body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had Matt's facial features, albeit without the age-lines and chubby cheeks, with a ready, winning-smile and a mop of tussled brown hair atop his head. The young man was in his preferred lounge-ware, sporting an old Browns shirt and baggy basketball shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt cleared his throat, hoping against hope that Zack would notice something was wrong if he engaged him in conversation. \"Hey kid. H-how was practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same old, same old. Coach is thinking about moving me from the line to a linebacker position though. That might be cool.\" Zack tossed some chips in his mouth and looked directly to Matt, showing no surprised when his eyes fell upon him. \"How about you? Mom said you didn't have any dinner? Shitty day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's small new shoulders sunk, he walked over to one of the clam-shell chairs in defeat, flopping down himself. \"You could say that. It's been a rough one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's over now.\" Zack laughed, setting his pop and chips on the coffee table. \"So stop being a whiny little bitch, Papa Bear!\" the kid laughed, slipping into their familiar banter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny you should say that...\" Matt rolled his eyes, and laughed sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling sorry for yourself? You're only allowed to do that if you pin me! It's wrestling time, Papa Bear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile some Father/Son tussling would have been nothing unusual, doing so in his current state was NOT something Matt was up for!!! \"Whoah there, kid! I appreciate your trying to cheer me up but I'm not really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sunk into the chair, holding green-fingernail tipped hands up as he tried to wave Zack off, to no avail. With the extended reach that came from being nearly a foot taller than him, AND, having 70 or 80 pounds more muscle and mass to his benefit, Zack easily manhandled Matt's small new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brawny, chiseled young man brushed Matt's attempts to push him away aside, scooping Matt up in his arms! \"Damn it, Zack, I'm not kidding! I don't want to...\" Matt protested, trying to kick and push his way out of his son's grip with his smooth new femme arms and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, no whiny little bitch stuff, Papa Bear! I think you need to laugh!!!\" Dropping Matt's feet to the ground, Zack put his hands in his father's armpits, holding him just enough off the ground to prevent him from fleeing, and keeping him under control as he started to tickle his helpless Father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Matt began to giggle. He'd been ticklish before, but his new body seemed to be even more sensitive to such sensations!!!\" \"Hahahahahahaha...damn it...hahahahahaha...Zack...I can't....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair roughhoused until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt found himself out of breath, both from his fruitless struggles to get Zack to let him go, and from the enforced extended laughing the boy's tickling him was subjecting him too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Zack was having a ball. \"Geez, Papa Bear, normally you put up more of a fight! This is easy! Are you wore out or something?!?\" Zack's ticking hands strayed, brushing the bottom of Matt's heaving new tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed as he reacted to the inadvertent attention his breasts were receiving. \"Hahahahahaha...you little shit...hahahahahahah...Zack...for the love of...\" he flailed about, trying to get his son to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResponding to his Father's more desperate struggling, Zack pulled him toward him in a tighter grip, bringing Matt's tight, broad little fanny into direct contact with his own lower body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnveloped his his Son's bear-hug of a muscular grip, Matt's eyes went wide with horror. He could feel Zack's dick hardening as it pushed through the fabric of his, and his son's shorts that separated them. Worse, he could feel the telltale moist, tingling sensation of his new female naughty bits' arousal as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicked, Matt managed to swing one of his balled up fists backward, smacking his Son in the balls. \"Oooff!!!\" Zack let go, falling to a knee in pain. \"Shit!!! That hurt!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned to face him, struggling to regain his breath as he tugged at his shorts and shirt and tried to regain his composure and reign his body's arousal in. \"Uhhhh...sorry kid...my hand slipped...uhh...are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack laughed as he stood up. \"Sore, but educated. I'm going to have to keep my eye on you, Papa Bear. That's the first time you've gone below the belt during a wrestling match!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt couldn't help but laugh. \"Age and guile. I have to make up for the fact that you out-muscle me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack laughed and stumbled over to the couch. \"I've out-muscled you since I was ten or eleven, pop!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt took a seat as well, as he pondered the boys words. In this new state of reality, did Zack remember rough-housing with him with his current, 20-something year old female Asian-American body while growing up?!?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt calmed down, watching Zack warily. He was disturbed at his body's arousal, but almost as much so by his Son's equally sexual response. Zack showed no sign of embarrassment or realization that his body had been going into lust-mode over his Dad, albeit his Dad with some hot young woman's body from the neck down. Was he not aware of it, or that that might be inappropriate?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over at the end table beside his clam-shell shaped seat, Matt could see an old framed portrait of him and Zack. Taken back when his Son was 10 or 11, the photo had used to depict the pair on a Cub-Scout outing, when Matt had been Zack's troop's Scout Master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFormerly, it had shown young Zack in his uniform arm and arm with his big, overweight, smiling \"Papa Bear\" in his own Scout Master's uniform. Now it looked much different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile young Zack looked as he did before, now Matt's smiling face sat atop his new gorgeous young womanly body, dressed in a much smaller, tighter, and risque version of that uniform. The blue uniform consisted of short-shorts, his badged, button-up uniform shirt cinched in and tied above the waist to show off his sleek little midriff, a kerchief around his graceful neck. His arm still around his boy, the Matt in the photo stood in a pair of high-heeled, slutty timberland hiking boots with white socks peeking out the tops of the shafts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt picked up the framed photo in his delicate hands, his eyes wide. \"I can't believe the troop's parents let me take them on trips dressed like that...\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite his current \"squatters rights\" in regards to his new body, it still felt creepy bringing someone else, or at least most of someone else, into his marriage bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack hung out with him, watching television and doing his best to cheer him up with witty banter, before the young man finally headed upstairs to his room for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a seahorse patterned throw blanket and wrapping it around his nubile new body, Matt laid down on the couch. He tossed and turned a bit, his mind racing as he replayed the days events and tried to understand how and why what had happened to him had come to be, but he remained lost and confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in the wee small hours of the morning, Matt drifted off to sleep, exhausted and emotionally drained by his ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he didn't sleep well, being plagued with dreams wherein old high-school bullies and ex-girlfriends laughed and mocked at him for the loss of his manhood and the like, he did sleep long. Tossing and turning for most of it, he slept until a bit after 10 o'clock the next morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, he cursed himself for not setting his alarm. He ran upstairs, knowing the house would be empty, what with the kids having surely headed off to school by then, and his wife having just as certainly headed off to her own job an hour or two earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't due in to PetZaar until 11, being scheduled for a mid-shift that day, BUT, that didn't leave him much time to get ready and make his journey in. \"Whole new me, and I'm STILL gonna be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd briefly considered calling off that day, even wondering if he wanted to face his workplace in his current state despite no one knowing anything was the matter, BUT, he still had bills to pay, and two children who would be going to college in the all-too-near future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, he was desperate for answers, and his only lead now was tracking down and interrogating the young woman who's body he now sported. What with her biweekly, and sometimes weekly sojourns to the store, being there was his best chance at getting an explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt ran upstairs, and then upstairs again, until he jogged into he and his wife's altered bedroom. Stripping off his shirt and shorts, and sliding the panties off, he tossed his clothes into a hamper and quickly brushed his teeth. Splashing some water on his face, he snagged some deodorant, scented with a fragrance called \"Tidepool Mist,\" and headed to his wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe TRIED to go with something simple. Something more subdued and less girly than the outfit the body he'd been trapped with had started off with, but the selection was limited. On top of that, he seemed to be having problems maintaining his willpower and ability to act again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to retrieve some simple, panties, a pair of his wife's with more material and a looser fit. BUT, all he could do was pick them up. When he tried to put them on, he found his body unwilling to budge...just sitting there, frozen...as if it were in a half-awake, dazed state. His mind was conscious, his thoughts were his own, but when he tried to put on Shelly's baggy \"granny panties,\" some kind of override kicked in and prevented him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he slid on a pair of pearl-patterned, VERY tight little briefs...a sexy little number that seemed to be from Victoria's Secret. He gritted his teeth as he acquiesced to his body's unspoken demands. He was so pissed and focused on grumbling to himself about being forced to don the panties, that he didn't notice when his body, almost with a mind of it's own, slid a matching bra on, lifting and supporting his large new breasts and putting them into a good display position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the fuck is going on...\" he whispered to himself. He dug through his wife's drawers again, hoping to find a baggy pair of sweats or something more figure-concealing, but once again, his hands just wouldn't allow him to don anything like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at a clock on the wall and seeing that he was running out of time, he gave in and started looking through \"his\" clothing. He passed on the skirts, and didn't like how tight and high-cut any of \"his\" shorts were, so he settled on pants. Unfortunately, all of those were incredibly tight and figure hugging as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the clock racing, he gave in and slid a pair of shiny, skin-tight leggings on similar to the ones he had worn the day before. This time, they weren't patterned, having a deep blue color. Once again, the leggings clung to every curve, really accentuating his remarkably enticing legs, tush and crotch. It felt like something was hugging every square inch of his new lower body. He wasn't at all comfortable with how pleasurable it felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a navy blue PetZaar uniform polo-shirt, sliding it on. He missed his original body's big, baggy, XXL one. All of those in his closet were small, and seemed to be tailored to show off his curves and narrow waist to best effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footwear was the final insult. He desperately tried to put on a pair of sneakers, one of those that were clearly his new body's, but he just couldn't force himself. He picked them up, sat down, and gritted his teeth and groaned as he concentrated on forcing his unfamiliar body to bend to his will, but he just wasn't able to do it. \"Come on...there your damn shoes, you little bitch!!!\" he shouted at his errant form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with little to no time left, he gave in and put on the first pair of shoes he found himself able to don. A pair of ridiculous, front-zip, stiletto heeled white ankle boots. Matt chided himself for all the times he had said, \"I just can't resist a girl in heels!\" throughout his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting his lunch, grabbing his purse and smartphone, he clicked along the driveway toward his car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bearded, burly, truck-driver neighbor Jesse, taking his garbage out to the curb yelled to him. \"Good morning Porter!\" he chuckled, \"Running late again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why break my streak?\" Matt smiled sadly as he waved to him as he scampered to his auto and opened the driver's side door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse smiled, and waved back and whispered to himself. \"I'm not a homo, but damned if that Porter doesn't have a hot little body. Lord have mercy...\" he licked his lips as he enjoyed the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to spare, Matt reversed his car, squealed his tires, and started the drive to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His sea-shell shaped purse bounced with every step, smacking his cute little derriere with the same rhythm of his gait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe passed an old lady who appeared to be taking her dog home after a visit to PetZaar's grooming salon. Her face wrinkled as she looked at Matt. She looked like she'd tasted something sour, her disapproval of his attire evident with her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's steps came to a halt as he saw her reaction. &lt;Was she seeing what was wrong?!?! Does she think I look like a cross-dresser or transsexual or something?!?!&gt; he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning ma'am!\" he smiled, trying to provoke and gauge her reaction. Her poodle rushed over to Matt, wagging it's tail as he bent down to pet it with his green-nailed hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough I suppose. It's not my place to say, but the expression \"if you've got it, flaunt it,\" isn't really good advice. Even attractive people would do well to leave a little bit to the imagination, young man! Come on, Tigger!\" she pulled the leash and continued with her pooch toward her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stood there dumbstruck for a bit. \"Well, she thinks I'm a man...a flashy, slightly slutty man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading through the front door, Matt was greeted by the cute little red-headed cashier Izzy once again. \"Hello big guy! Wow, only 10 minutes late?!?! Are you turning over a new leaf?!?!\" she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that, Red. You could say that.\" Matt attempted to give her a smile as he strode past and headed towards his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering, he could see that Joey Schultz, a freckled, rail-thin, awkward-but-enduring 20 year old who worked in the aquarium supply section was fiddling with a pricing gun inside. \"Yo Joe.\" Matt greeted him absentmindedly, a child of the 80s, he thought it was funny to give the kid a GI Joe kinda shout-out when he bumped into him, despite Joey being too young to get the reference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!!! Hey there!\" Joey spun around, accidentally dropping the gun. Apparently spooked by Matt's arrival, he scrambled to pick it up, as he rose, Matt could see his jaw go slack and his eyes go wide as they tracked up Matt's body, running from his white boots, up his blue painted-on leggings, over his figure-hugging uniform polo, until finally falling on his face. \"You're looking good today, Mr. Porter...I mean...you're looking well...healthy...um...fit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt cocked his head and smirked. \"You okay there, Joe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sorry. Uh, I gotta go price the Hermit Crab stuff.\" Trying not to look at Matt, he rushed out of the office and out into the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tossed his purse on the desk. Jason walked in with a grin on his face. \"Poor Joey.\" The thin, bald and bespectacled manager walked in, his coffee in one hand, and another he head prepared for Matt, just like usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's even jumpier than normal.\" Matt responded as he took his coffee and had a big sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason closed the office door behind him. \"Ahh, you know how it is Matt. You have an effect on the young ones. Make 'em question their sexual orientation and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt choked a little on his hot beverage, nearly spitting it out with surprise. \"I beg your pardon?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed as he leaned against a file cabinet and finished a sip of his own coffee. \"Come on Big Guy, you've GOT to be aware of the effect you have on these kids? I mean, you dress to impress...not that I'm complaining.\" Jason gave him a wink and smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stumbled back, settling into his chair a little ungracefully. He was used to having a easy-going, mildly sarcastic, but honest relationship with his fellow manager, but this was just downright weird. \"Thanks...I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging the subject with no acknowledgment of any awkwardness that he was aware off, Jason said, \"Cool. Well, I'll leave you to your e-mails and such. I'm going to go price audit the canned cat food. We've been having some discrepancies at the register this morning and I want to get it sorted out. Holler if ya need me, Big Guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stepped out, closing the door behind him as he left Matt sitting in his now oversized task chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was odd to be able to see a lap, what with his big beer gut usually obscuring the view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt laughed. \"I suppose you could say this is a final victory in my years-long battle against my expanding waistline...\" he muttered to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling fidgety, nervous, and unsure as to what to do, Matt immediately decided to go out and look over his store. For one thing, it would feel like a \"business as usual\" activity, and he was craving the usual and expected at this point. For another, he was hoping against hope that the Mermaid, and his missing rightful body would make an appearance today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting his name tag, he tottered up and out of his chair on his new high heels and headed out onto the sales-floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he headed over to the registers. Free of customers, Izzy's green eyes lit up as she smiled and Matt and scampered over to meet him. Matt had always found the trim young red-head pretty, but she was close enough to his daughter in age and build that he'd felt more paternal than lustful toward her. Where he had towered over her before, he was now staring face to face with here, even with the benefit of his heeled boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have we been very busy today, Red?\" Matt asked as he looked around, noting the absence of \"pet-parents\" shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical Wednesday morning so far. I'm sure it'll pick up this afternoon.\" Izzy's eyes went wide as she squealed with delight. \"Oh Mr. Porter, your nails!!! They're perfect!!!\" She grabbed Matt's delicate little mitts and inspected his expertly manicured and painted nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held one of her own hands up next to Matt's right. Her nails were in a much sorrier state, with cracked edges, chipped paint, and sorry looking cuticles. \"Ringing register does a number on mine. I don't know how you manage to keep yours looking so fabulous with all that you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked uncomfortable. \"Yeah. I don't know either.\" Changing the subject, he looked Izzy in the eyes, \"Hey Red, remember that shopper that was in here yesterday, with the dyed teal-green or bluish hair? The pretty Asian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy cocked her head while pondering his question. \"Oh yeah! She WAS pretty! It's a shame a gorgeous girl like that seems to have let herself go. She's built like a bulldozer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grimaced. \"Yeah, yeah. I'm sure she's working on it. Look, I have a...uh...special offer from corporate I think I can give her. If she pops in anytime soon, get a hold of me and have her wait so that I can give it to her, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy noticed a pet-parent heading to the register with a dog bowl to purchase and rushed over to check her out. \"Sure thing, Mr. Porter! I'll keep my eyes peeled for her!\" she called behind her before turning her attention to the bowl lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Okay, so now I have Jason and Izzy both keeping an eagle eye out for her.&gt; Matt smiled, before turning to head deeper into the store, his ankle boots clicking and hips swaying with each determined step. He didn't notice a young couple looking over doggy sweaters as he passed, the young man smiling as he admired Matt's delightfully enticing little shiny tush marching by. His girlfriend smacked in with jealous annoyance, causing him to flinch and apologize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up and down the aisle, pleased that everything was looking relatively clean and organized. He had an easygoing managerial style, but he still liked to run a tight ship. As he turned to head down the cat toy aisle, frequently a problem area with it's small, colorful, and easily messed up layout, he...</span></div></div>",

In his sixties, the distinguished looking black gentleman's hair and neatly trimmed beard where snowy white. A retiree, he worked part-time at PetZaar, for extra spending money AND for the employee discount. Lamont had 3 cats in his condo that he had to keep supplied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sky and the little birdies.\" Matt replied, with his regular answer to Lamont's equally regular question. \"How's it going?\" he asked, as he walked down the aisle. He noted that Lamont was now taller than him as well. It was odd to go from being the tallest one in the store, to one of the most petite. Granted, that was one of the lesser oddities he was experiencing at the moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, not bad. Just looking over some of these new cat toys. Seeing if any look like something the Supremes would like.\" the older man answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt chuckled at the mention of Lamont's 3 spoiled house-cats. \"You'd think they'd be stocked up by now. I swear Lamont, you give us back half of your paycheck with all of the baubles you buy for the ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont laughed, and looked Matt up and down. \"I could say the same thing about you boss-man, when it comes to heels and boots and such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked down at the pointed toes of his white stiletto ankle boots. \"Uh, yeah. We've both got a problem, I guess...\" his voice trailed off as he remembered his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont's face grew concerned. \"You okay boss-man. You look like someone pissed in your Cheerios all the sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook it off. \"Ahhh. Never mind me Lamont. I've just got a lot going on. I'd better head back to the office. Catch up on my e-mails and such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like about the retired life. No worries. All I have to be concerned with are whether the Supremes like their cat food and keeping up with the gossip my morning coffee buddies got on their lips at McDonald's every morning. Just keep in mind one of these days you'll be living the easy as pie retired life as well, boss-man.\" Lamont gave him a wink and headed off into the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed. &lt;The retired life? What kind of golf swing would he have with this body?&gt; He shuddered, as he considered the possibility that he'd still have this woman's body 20 or 30 years from now. Shaking off that dreadful thought, he fled to his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he clicked into the room, Matt heard the telltale whine of his phone ringing in the sea-shell purse. Pulling it out, he could see that it was a message from...</span></div></div>",

I mean, the Cougar ain't bad either, big guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned to look down the aisle in the directly Jason was looking, albeit without his enthusiasm. While normally, he'd have been pleased as punch to take in the sight of the woman heading in their direction, his current predicament and the fact that the last time he oogled a woman he ended up switching bodies with her from the neck down robbed him of his usual excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"Cougar,\" as they had nicknamed her, clicked towards them on heels of her own. Closer to Matt's original body's age, in her early 40s, the Cougar was one Brandy Adams. A mane of long, thick. blonde hair wreathed her beautiful, expertly make-up embellished face. Her no-doubt artificially enhances breasts, far larger than Matt's new ones, strained at the fabric of a low-cut white and pink sweater. Below her narrow waist, she wore a pair of incredibly tight white capris pants, her small feet clad in a pair of pink, peep-toe high heel pumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practically sashayed as she walked towards them, several bracelets on her wrists banging into one another to create a delicate chime-like-sound effect. A designer purse was slung over her shoulder, a tiny, diamond-collared chihuahua slung under her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the Mermaid, Matt knew a bit about Brandy, as he and the girls in the salon had gotten to know her over the years. She regularly brought her tiny pooch Sprinkles in to be groomed, and was always up for chit-chat. A gold-digger with a heart of gold, she'd married a much older man years ago and had been living the life of an adored trophy-wife ever since. While Matt never confirmed it, the ladies in the doggy-salon had told him that she had been an in-demand exotic dancer in her youth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello-hello, you dashing PetZaar gentlemen, you! Say hi, Sprinkles!\" Brandy gestured towards them with the tiny dog, causing it to bark at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afternoon Ma'am. I take it Sprinkles is due for a day of beauty?\" Jason smiled broadly at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overdue! Hims is a stinky little gopher, isn't hims!?!?\" she snuggled and cooed over her little dog. Stopping, she looked over Matt. \"OOoooooo...Mr. Porter, where DID you get those boots?!?! I love, love, love them!!!\" She bent down and looked Matt's new girly footwear over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed. \"I can't recall, Mrs. Adams.\" He managed a weak grin. \"It's nice to see you and Sprinkles again. I'm sure the groomers will be happy to see you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or they'll at least be happy to see the tip, eh?\" She smiled at the two men. \"Seriously Mathew. I adore those boots. You and I are going to have to go shopping sometime! You have a divine eye for style. We simply MUST make a day of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gave Matt an \"attaboy\" elbow to his side, nearly knocking Matt off of his feet due to his smaller size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let me get my little man to his appointment. I'm sure I'll see you two when I come back to pick him ups! Toodles!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason and Matt watched her totter away on her pink heels, her hips swaying back and forth with each clicking footfall. Jason hummed under his breat. \"Hmm...mmm...mhhh.mmm...she sure is something else. Old Mr. Adams is a lucky man. I hope he's still got the wherewithal to enjoy it, heh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt wished he still had the wherewithal to enjoy the view as the Cougar walked away, but his ability to appreciate things was null and void. \"Yeah. She's great. Look, keep an eye out for the Mermaid, dude. I...I'm going back to my office. I'm going to catch up on some paperwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt slunk back to his office. A few minutes later, Jason sent him another text. \"She dropped the pooch off and is splitting till they're done. Are you up for watching her leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tapped out a simple but insistent \"NO.\" in reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned his attention to his computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost 15 minutes of scrolling and replying, his electronic tedium was brought to a startling end. His office door flew open, and the gorgeous, stacked, bombshell body of the Cougar, Brandy Adams, came clicking in on her pink heels, her big breasts swaying beneath her sweater. But, rather than her blonde, milf-tastic head, someone else's terrified noggin was affixed to the top of her neck!!!!</span></div></div>",

His lips quivered. \"Boss-man...I...I...how...why...\" his words rand together as he stuttered. While his original body had only stood an inch or two taller than Brandy's 5 foot 7 or so height, his cranium had been shrunk every so slightly to put it in proportion with it's new body's dimensions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt could see the same strange, thin green choker or band separating Brandy's warm, white-lady flesh from the far darker shade that Lamont's head was. Reflexively, Matt reached up and felt the band joining him to his new body as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Lamont, not you too!\" Matt climbed to his feet. He still stood a inch or three shorter than Lamont's new height, but they were a lot closer now. \"Is she still here?!?!?\" Matt rushed past a shell-shocked Lamont and ran out into the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly stumbling on his stiletto heels, he came to a stop near the front door, while scanning the lot. \"Izzy!!! Did Mrs. Adams leave yet?!?! Is she still in the salon?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy looked confused and flustered by Matt's excitement an near-panic. \"No...she...she left 10 minutes ago or so. Said she'd be back for Sprinkles in an hour or two. Is everything okay, Mr. Porter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, but I'm working on that. Give me a shout out the second she comes back. The second! Got it?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly shook her head yes as Matt spun on his heels and rushed back to the office and Lamont. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the cleavage he'd been saddled with Lamont's eyes fluttered as if he were feeling faint. \"It's gotta be a dream...a God-damned nightmare...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lamont, tell me exactly what happened!\" Matt rushed over and took the old man's new white hands in his own, helping him sit down in the task chair before shutting the office door for some privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont seemed to be looking at something on an imaginary horizon as he spoke. \"I-I was sweeping the main aisle. Happened to notice Mrs. Adams leaving the salon, gave her a wave. Then, you know, I took in the view. Woman's a God damned vision of loveliness and all, you know!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded, with a look of concern on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyway, I went back to sweeping. Made a few passes with the broom, and realized that I had to take a leak. So, I sat the broom aside, and headed to the little boy's room. I was washing my hands after doing my business, when suddenly, this bright, green light blinded me. I nearly puked, and for a second or two lost all the feeling in my arms, legs, everything. When the light fade, I could feel again, but everything felt...wrong. I looked in the mirror over the sink and damned if I didn't see what you see now, my damn head plastered to the top of this here body!!!\" Lamont's voice cracked as he finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking straight at Matt, Lamont leaned toward him, giving Matt a view of his new canyon of cleavage. \"Even weirder than that, I realized that when I saw you earlier today, when we talked in the cat toy aisle, you had someone else's body too!!! I didn't recognize it at the time, but after I saw myself, it was like I suddenly put two and two together!!!\" Lamont gestured towards the door. \"Boy, what in the HELL is going on!?!?! I ran up front to try and find this here lady, and no one batted an eye. I asked Izzy where she was and she just smiled and said he'd already gone. Didn't even acknowledge the fact that my old black head is on some white lady's body!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook his head. \"I wish I knew Lamont.\" Matt proceeded to tell Lamont about his experience the day before, filling him in on how no one seemed to recognize or understand what had happened except for him. He even filled him in on how his family had acted as if everything were same old same old. He told him about the way the past and reality had been rewritten, even showed him the framed family portrait featuring his new girlish body on the desk as further evidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont leaned back, looking at his empty hands, hands that were not his own, watching his big new sweater puppies heave and rise with each breath he took. \"So you haven't seen your body's former owner since it happened? You'd think if she knew what was going on she'd be here making a stink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got Jason and Izzy keeping an eye out for her.\" Matt took a step or two closer. \"But, in the meantime, we'll see if Mrs. Adams has any clues! She'll be back in an hour or two for Sprinkles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont looked hopeful. \"Hey, if me looking a bit too closely at her caused all this ruckus, maybe if I look at her again, it'll switch us back?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Lamont. Hopefully!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont glanced down, tentatively grabbing his big new tits with his new lady-hands, causing the bracelets to clink and clatter. \"Damn, little Miss has got a damn fine rack.\" He looked up at Matt. \"Your donor got some quality curves too, boss-man.\" and gave Matt a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the oddity of it all, Matt couldn't help but laugh. \"Yeah, but I don't know about you Lamont, but I preferred taking a look at these two from a bit farther away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the God's honest truth, boss-man. The God's honest truth.\" </span></div></div>",

We're fine. Lamont just had some personal life developments pop up,\" Lamont cackled, interrupting Matt's explanation. Clearing his throat, he continued, \"And was dealing with some customer service...issues. Nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, nothing seems out of sorts about the boss-man and I? Like, an unusual choice of wardrobe or some...uh...abnormalities?\" Lamont was incredulous as to how no one but Matt seemed to notice that their heads had been transplanted atop two women's bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason walked in, and looked back and forth between the two. \"Not really. I mean, you should be wearing a uniform shirt, Lamont, but other than that I haven't a clue as to what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus fucking Christ in a taco...\" Lamont growled under his breath as he shook his head and closed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt raised his hands to reassure Jason. \"It-it's okay Jason. Lamont's just a little upset about his personal life issues. I hate to impose, but could you mind the store while I deal with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked concerned, but gave him an affirmative nod before turning and leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is just great. So no one sees how fucked up this all is?!?!\" Lamont waved at his and Matt's bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. BUT, I hate to say it, but part of me is glad we're in the same boat. I was beginning to think I was hallucinating or going crazy. But if you see it too, if it's happened to you as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont nodded. \"It's real. It's not your imagination. I get that. But what in the Hell caused it?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook his head. \"I have no idea. The only commonality I can think of is that both incidents happened here at the store, and after you and I were checking out the ladies in question. I was drooling over this little lady, \" he waved his small hands at his compact, sexy body, \" and you were taking a gander at Mrs. Adams right beforehand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're being punished for having wandering eyes? But why make it so no one but us realizes the results? Why do that to the girls if this is like \"defending their honor\" or some shit?!?!\" Lamont was perplexed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no clue. I never said any of it made sense. I only know the sequence of events.\" Matt answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!!!\" Lamont's eyes went wide with surprise as he spotted something on the wall behind Matt. He climbed up onto Mrs. Adam's pink heels and slowly walked toward it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt backed up and turned to look in the same direction. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big picture from last Christmas!!!\" Lamont whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair looked at a large framed photograph. Matt had had it blown up after Jason had taken it last Christmas season at the store. It had been during a weekend even when they had had a Santa Clause in so that pet-parents could bring their pets in to have their photos taken with Santa. It was dumb, but super popular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture was goofy before, with Lamont and Matt both sitting on the Santa's knee. Matt could remember the man complaining that he wasn't up to supporting the bulky Manager's weight. But now, it looked quite a bit different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Lamont were both still sitting on the Santa's knee,but now both of them had their new, womanly bodies plastered beneath their noggins. Their smiling heads were wearing little Santa hats, while their bodies were wearing sexy little Mrs. Clause dresses, the hem cut high to show off their legs, the fur-trimmed tops cut low to put their respective racks on display. Matt's petite but curvy \"Mermaid\" legs were shot in kinky little fur-topped high heel knee boots, while Lamont's long lovely legs were clad in shiny black thigh high stiletto footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Lamont's, formerly Mrs. Adam's, nipples had slipped loose and was visible, while Matt's dress was hiked up enough to give the camera a view of white and red stripped candy-cane style panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I only half-believed you about the past alteration shit. This is messed up.\" Lamont looked at Matt, who shook his head in the affirmative. </span></div></div>",

Looking down...seeing someone else...that someone else moving how I want her too...feeling that someone else...\" Lamont hopped a little, purposefully causing Mrs. Adams's enormous bosom to jiggle beneath her sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's like a weird dream. Doesn't seem real, but feels is.\" Matt looked down at the Mermaid's blue leggings clad thighs. \"Dream or nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont squatted down, performing a deep knee bend maneuver. Mrs. Adams's capris grew even tighter, showing off every nook and cranny as he easily maintained balance on her pink heels. \"Wow! The lady is limber! You think she really was a stripper? A dancer and all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt laughed. \"Wouldn't surprise me. Though I think here husband's money means her dancing days are behind her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice not having to deal with arthritis.\" Lamont stood back up, running Mrs. Adams's hands over her body as he continued to get the \"lay of the land.\" \"I think this would be more fun if I had my dick. Still, it's a nice view.\" Lamont looked over at Matt, cocking his head. \"You still like ladies? Even with your technically being one now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt fidgeted uncomfortably. \"I-I haven't really thought about...I mean...I have bigger problems than...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont didn't let up with the questioning. \"You went home right? Did the wife still do it for you? Did you make an evening of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt wasn't at all comfortable with the turn in the conversation. \"No. I...it didn't feel right...you know...Shelly doesn't even know this girl and...\" he stuttered, not really wanting to dwell on the sexual sensations he'd experienced after his transposition. ESPECIALLY, the stirrings he had felt in the presence of his own son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it feels weird to me. This is kinda hot, looking over this lady's body, feeling it, making it move around. And your hot little ass is right up my alley too, BUT, it feels different. Like something's missing.\" Lamont laughed. \"I suppose that would be my cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt couldn't help but laugh as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two \"men's\" chuckling subsided, Izzy's pretty little head poked through the door. \"Uhh...Matt? Mrs. Adam's just walked in, she's heading back to the salon to pick up Sprinkles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt climbed up onto his white ankle booted feet as he and Lamont quickly clicked out of the office in search of \"The Cougar.\"</span></div></div>",

We've got see if she's aware of what's going on as well, and we don't want to make a scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont couldn't help but laugh as he looked down at his heaving, sweater-straining chest swinging from side to side with each of his hip-swaying strides, and over at Matt's gorgeous little body moving with it's own beguiling feminine grace. \"We're already making a Hell of a scene, boss-man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the aisle before them, they could make off the figure of Mrs. Adam emerging from the doggy-spa. Or, rather, the figure of Lamont's elderly male body, with Sprinkles under one of it's arms, the blonde-maned, beautiful noggin of Brandy Adams perched atop it's shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. That's me, alright.\" Despite expecting the sight, Lamont and Matt were still shocked by the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt called out. \"Uh, hello there Mrs. Adams. Back I see.\" I looked over at Lamont, then back to her. \"I assume you're pleased with...ah...everything...?\" he asked diplomatically. In all honesty, he was hoping she'd react with anger, indignation, or frustration, that she would shoe some reaction or knowledge of having had her bountiful, bodacious body with the old black MALE body of Lamont. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, she didn't. \"Oh yes!!! The girls did a FABULOUS job on my little man,\" she held the little dog up and kissed it's head, \"hims looks so handsome, doesn't hims?!?!?\" she cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you playing at woman, you're wearing my damned uniform shirt and name-tag! Did you do this?!?!\" Lamont sounded quite pissed. Matt reached to him, trying to calm him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Adams took a step back, surprised by the old man's verbal barrage. \"I beg your pardon? This is MY shirt...I can't recall for sure when I got it, but I've always thought wearing it here was a silly little joke, what with the staff's own attire.\" Looking down, she jumped a little in surprise when she did, in fact, see Lamont's name-tag pinned to her now flat, male chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! do have your tag though, don't I? I must have found it lying around and pinned it on to remind myself to return it.\" Separating the tag from it's magnetic backboard, she handed it to Lamont...an impressive feat considering that she did it while juggling her tiny pooch from one arm to the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont looked in bewilderment as one of his wrinkled, black, male hands held the name-tag out to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont blinked, shook his head, and smacked the badge out of his former hand with his soft, pink-nailed new one, stomping off on his equally new pink heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Earth?!?!?\" Mrs. Adam's was aghast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt scampered over to her and took her hand in a conciliatory effort. \"I'm so, very, very sorry Mrs. Adams! Lamont is one of our long-term, most dependable employees. He's just...uh...he's not feeling himself today. I'm sure you can see why? Didn't you notice anything unusual about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing that would explain that kind of rudeness! I'm sorry he's feeling unwell, but I hope you get him straightened out before the next time I bring Sprinkles in!\" Mrs. Adams turned, tucking her little dog under one of Lamont's arms and headed toward the front to check out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHobbling a bit as she did, Matt could hear her mumble, \"I never...ow...uh...my knees are killing me. The arthritis is really acting up today, Sprinkles...\" under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetrieving the name-tag, he went to find, and hopefully calm down, Lamont. </span></div></div>",

The pair alternated between lounging in Matt's chair, and pacing back and forth, neither of which helped them take their minds off their current predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever was pacing, found themselves having to contend with the sensations movement kindled in them. The sway of wide new hips, the fabric of tighter clothing cinching and brushing over soft new flesh. The rhythmic bouncing of tits that were putting the structural integrity of the ladies' bras to the test. The odd feeling of absence...a void...between delicious new thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whichever of them wasn't pacing, was seated and forced to deal with the feelings that position caused. A broad new tush beneath them, breasts pushed forward by the chair's lumbar support, not knowing whether they should cross their legs, or keep their knees together, and what positioning wouldn't cause them to mildly tease their new pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the clicking heels?!?! They echoed in the room with each stride. Matt found the sound torturous. A \"shoe guy,\" he'd previously absolutely adored that sound. His ears would prick up at the mere hint of it, sending him out on a girl-watching mission whenever, and where-ever he encountered it. It wasn't nearly as enthralling, now that he was stuck traipsing around in a pair of stilettos himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt googled search terms pertaining to their predicament, and just like before, came up completely empty-handed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFINALLY, after an hour or so, Lamont had had enough. \"Look boss-man, I-I need a drink. I gotta get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt let out a defeated sigh and rubbed his temples with lithe new fingers. \"I don't blame you. This standing around waiting for something that may or may not happen is maddening.\" Matt stood up on his white ankle-booted borrowed feet, and retrieved his sea-shell purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what. I'm up for one too. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter filling Jason in on their plans to leave, telling him that he was taking Lamont out to let the other, clearly upset man regain his bearings and composure, Matt and Lamont headed out into the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamont, his elderly black male head perched atop the Milf-tacular former body of Mrs. Brandy Adams, her curves magnificently displayed in her tight, pink and white striped sweater and derriere-hugging white capris pants, and Matt in his tight new uniform polo, blue painted-on leggings, and white \"hooker boots,\" strutted out to Matt's car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably for the best that the pair didn't notice a trio of teenage boys ogling their new assets, giggling amongst themselves, and snapping pictures of the two \"men\" with their smartphones. </span></div></div>",

I mean, I can understand why you would, but considering our current, \"situation,\" are you really in the mood for this kind of scenery?\" Matt was perplexed by Lamont's choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair strolled into \"Torpedoes Bar and Grill.\" A kitschy place, it was decorated with various nautical flourishes, featuring antique, or at least antique appearing, naval and fishing accents and touches. There were a lot of ship's bells, fishing bric-a-brac, buoys, life-preservers, netting, and model ships. None of that bothered, Matt, even considering his new body's proclivity toward mermaid aesthetics. No, what bothered Matt was the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorpedoes claim to fame was that it's staff was, for the most part, young, pretty, top-heavy women dressed in kinky little uniforms. The girls pranced about on blue, white-trimmed little mary-jane high heels, their legs clad in tall white socks with blue anchor designs facing outward. Their legs were on full display, with all of them having squeezed their tempting little tushes into identical pairs of red, brass-buttoned little sailor-shorts. Each girl wore a top that looked like a cliched sailor's uniform shirt, the same blue as the shoes, with white trim and a square of cloth dancing about behind them. The tops were cut to show their bouncing assets off to full effect. Completing the look, each girl wore a little white sailor's cap tilted on their head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile normally, Matt would have been all for the viewing opportunity, the fact that he now had his head unwillingly perched atop a body just as beguiling and girly as the waitresses, was preventing him from enjoying the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the mood for a drink, period, boss-man. And this is where I typically down a few. Besides, the girls know how to make a man feel like a man, and I sure as Hell need that right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls trotted over and gave Lamont a big smile. \"Mr. Hanford!!! A day-time visit?!?! How did we get so lucky!!!\" the pretty little blonde, her long tresses tied off in a pair of twin pony-tails giggled and rushed over to hug Lamont, pushing her now-smaller, though still respectable tits into Lamont's new sweater-puppies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just couldn't stay away, lil Miss!\" Lamont smiled, apparently able to ignore the foreign sensation of breast to breast contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bar, booth, or table, sweetie?\" She chirped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...both please.\" Lamont looked at Matt, giving the younger former-man a nod to confirm that he'd want a little more privacy as well. Matt quickly nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the bar? Is your guest shy?\" she smiled at Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. He's my boss, and we just don't want our shop-talk to distract anyone else from their Torpedoes experience.\" Lamont answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner with the boss! Well, we'll have to be extra attentive to you today then! We all just adore Mr. Hanford! Maybe we can get him a raise if we show you a super-duper time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress led the pair through the room, Lamont smiling as he kept his eyes locked on her cute, bouncy little red-shorts clad ass. Matt couldn't help but star as he followed as well, though the odd, deep, alien moistness of his arousal made him just as uncomfortable as he was excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, watching other, nubile, young uniformed women mince about on their blue heels, flirting and serving in order to increase their tips, no doubt. It was definitely his kind of place, one he'd have enjoyed taking his son too. But, having a body that would have done well on the tips-front itself was ruining his enjoyment of the ambience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt continued to follow Lamont and the waitress, his attention to the sights surrounding them and not on the path of their journey, he was startled when he ran smack dab into a handsome young man in a business suit. He gasped, nearly tripping on his ankle-booted feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the man he'd run into reacted quickly, grabbing him and keeping him aloft, his young, muscled arms almost embracing him. Matt was shocked, both by the quick near-fall, and by the recovery. \"Careful there, sir!\" the young man smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt could feel the strange, deep arousal in his new nether-regions again. His cheeks blushed, as he tried to regain his composure. \"I'm sorry! I wasn't watching!\" He tried to break the young man's embrace, but his petite new frame wasn't up to the task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I wasn't paying attention either. Understandable in a place like this, what with so many attention-grabbers.\" the young man laughed. Looking down at Matt, he smiled even more broadly. \"Although, I have to say, you're probably used to being the attention-grabber yourself, sir.\" he winked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...thanks...I think...uh...\" Matt stammered, struggling to find words as he tried to reign in his new body's reaction to being so close to the young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

Would his clothing even fit now? Immediately his mind went to no. Beyond the obvious height difference he and the Mermaid were completely different body shapes; his shirts would probably be nightgowns now! Was he going to have to buy a completely new wardrobe? Just imagining having to shop for women's clothes while people still saw him as a man raised all kinds of questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy? Did you hear mom?\" Sadie looked at him quizzically. \"You should go change! Don't want to get your top all dirty, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... No?\" Matt couldn't care less about the top, although if it was the only one that fit him anymore maybe he should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and you can leave those boots outside my room if you want! I'll grab them later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely paying any mind to the conversation Matt nodded once, dreading what he might find in his bedroom. <i>Nothing to do but go up and look, I suppose.</i> He couldn't well live in the single outfit he now had on after all, not if this fiasco lasted longer than a day. Turning his new svelte form towards the stairs he started up them, cresting the second step before he grabbed the banister, grimacing as he swayed in place. An all too familiar sensation washed over him and he held his stomach with his other hand. Warmth flooded his body and his attempts to call out to his family were met with silence as blinding light engulfed his vision once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before there was a momentary sensation of nothingness. He had been transported into a white void; sight failed him, as did sound, touch. All five senses were rendered invalid. Then all at once they returned back to him, hitting him like a brick wall. Even before he looked down to inspect himself he knew exactly where he'd ended up and it horrified him. Setting aside the tablet in his hands he blanched, looking down at the slim digits and groaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to look. Matt swallowed hard and forced himself to anyways, eyes widening as his daughter circled around the couch towards him. The Mermaid's body, clad in the outfit she'd worn that morning, left him straining to keep his eyes off her figure. With his daughter attached now it was all kinds of wrong! His stomach flipped and this time it had nothing to do with an impending surge of whatever power had swapped him. His cheeks flushed and he held back, barely, handing the tablet to Sadie and looking down at himself aghast as she plopped beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute top! Though you should probably go change!\" His daughter giggled, flicking through tabs on her tablet and folding one of the Mermaid's long legs over the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Uh...\" Matt stood, lifting his hands to check himself before dropping them at his sides. With a defeated sigh he nodded, retracing his steps back towards the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Sadie and the Mermaid were roughly the same height his daughter's legs were leaner and longer, giving him a lengthier stride. Nothing like his gait before. As he started up the stairs he became acutely aware of all of his new body's nuances, and worse still, how it wore the clothing Sadie had put on. His booty shorts rode up his butt and hugged his thighs, leaving his long legs exposed to the cool air. His chest - Sadie's chest - bounced a bit in her tank top; his daughter wasn't the bustiest of women but she wasn't flat either. <i>God, why am I even thinking about that?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the steps Matt looked down at himself and shuddered. His daughter's form, barely dressed, greeted him. Her breasts jutting out from his chest, her flat stomach rising and falling with his increasingly nervous breathing. He reached back and tried to pluck his shorts from his ass, blushing and grimacing as he felt them tighten in the front as a result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can today get any worse...?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What was even happening anymore? Randomly exchanging bodies - or was it heads? Semantics aside the event of trading with The Mermaid had left him befuddled and not the least bit panicked. That had been a stranger's body though; his briefly lived escapade in the bathroom at work had been something he'd never experienced, well, ever. A vagina wasn't alien to him but having one most certainly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's hand, or rather, Sadie's hand grabbed the doorknob to his bedroom and he closed his eyes, gritting his teeth as he reached down and dug his shorts out of his ass crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExploring with a stranger's body was one thing but his daughters? There was no way Matt could ever bring himself to do that. Opening the door to his bedroom he breathed a small sigh of relief seeing little had changed. His and his wife's bed was the same, albeit the comforter was now a lavender instead of a navy blue. Not to mention the six or so extra pillows they now owned. Navigating his way inside he shut the door and leaned against it while younger, decidedly feminine hands rubbed exhaustion from his face. A cursory glance showed nothing of significance had changed but he suspected that wasn't going to last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another glance down at Sadie's body he shivered, tugging at her pink tank top. \"My clothes are never going to fit now...\" As if clothing was the biggest problem he was facing! Dejected, he shrugged his dainty shoulders and padded over to their dresser. Maybe just a sports jersey and some slacks? They would be too big but they would be comfortable and cover everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hope died the second he opened the dresser. At first he'd assumed he'd opened his wife's shirt by mistake until he looked on top of it. A plaque for his shop, pictures he'd taken on various family trips, and a few knickknacks here and there; this was his dresser. Which meant the panties, ankle socks, and bras staring at him now were his as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me!\" Blanching, he threw open the next drawer, then the next, heart sinking as he stepped back and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's all Sadie's! Why do I have her clothes?\"</i> In place of his polo shirts he now had tube tops, camisoles, fitted tees - many of which would be v-necks if memory served - and other borderline revealing garments. Leggings, shorts, and jeans replaced his usual khakis and slacks. Beside himself Matt dropped onto the foot of his bed and put his head in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some twisted logic it made sense. He had Sadie's body now so why wouldn't he have the clothing to dress it? Whatever cosmic entity doing this to him was prudent enough to give him the proper clothing, although he couldn't decide if that was a blessing or a curse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother glance downward and he saw Sadie's cleavage staring back up at him. His for all intents and purposes now, he supposed. Dropping his hands into his lap he tapped a delicate finger on one thigh, took a deep breath, and shook his head in frustration. His daughter's clothing notwithstanding that didn't change the biggest issue here; he needed to strip down to change. Sure, he'd seen his daughter naked before plenty of times, for most of her life really, but seeing it from this point of view was different. Wrong even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled and Matt glanced at his bedroom door, chewing on his lower lip anxiously. \"They won't actually care whether I change or not... So why bother?\"</span></div></div>",

I'm creating this setting with that sort of thing in mind, but am setting absolutely no limitations on where anyone goes with this. If you decide to play around with my characters, feel free to do whatever you want, or even introduce your own. Let your fetish-freak-flag fly high. ;) )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur tale begins in Columbus, Ohio, at a pet-store called PetZaar. Part of a large, corporate chain, the company's name is a playful combination of Pet and Bazaar, with a nod to it's mercantile nature. The location is popular with shoppers looking to spoil their fur-babies, feathered friends, scaled buddies, and swimming charges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employees are segregated amongst 3 strata. The management staff, consisting of older, more adult full-time employees...the cashiers and floor staff who are younger part-timers, and the mostly female staff of the attached dog grooming salon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe managers and floor staff wear uniforms consisting of blue polo shirts emblazoned with the PetZaar logo on the right breast and across their back, and required tan khaki trousers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe groomers, owing to their salon's messier, wetter conditions due to bathing and grooming dogs, all wear grey smocks, loose water-resistant grey pants, and black slip on crocs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur tale begins on a slow Tuesday morning at the store. Unfortunately for the staff and customers, the relative calm and boredom of the day is about to be shattered when strange events begin to unfold.
