It has endured over three thousand years, its fortunes rising and falling and rising again countless times. In its time it has given the world some of its most noble heroes and roguish villains, but the one trait the Meades always share is their adaptability. In a world of constant change, it has served them well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are human, more or less. Nobody could accuse your ancestors of being selective about who or what they married into, and so your blood is more than a little green, your ears somewhat elven, but by most outward appearances you are human. More importantly, somewhere along the family line however, magic found its way into your blood. You have the Gift, and the power of sorcery no less, giving you a natural aptitude and unbinding you from any single Order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour looks are modest with dark hair and a slim, athletic build (turning to grey and girth in your later years).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere in the long twisted adventure of life are you?</span></div></div>",

Class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstructor Valana's crimson eyes sweep over the class, stabbing at each student as if in a room-wide game of five-finger fillet.   As she glances at you, you feel a sudden pang of shame at not knowing the answer, and look away from her.  You can see that many of the other students are blushing, similarly afflicted.   Julia, the girl sitting next to you, shifts uncomfortably in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody?\" Valana's lips, painted the color of fresh blood, twist in a wry smile.  \"Well, it is only your first day, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always heard that instructors in demonology began to take on demonic characteristics as they traveled down the path, but your instructors seems quite human to you.  Except for the eyes and the hints of sharp canines you occasionally catch, she looks like an ordinary woman in early middle age.   Well--perhaps not entirely ordinary.  Her skin is quite smooth and youthful, belying the streak of grey in her hair, and her body is enough to make many of the wizard boys keep their textbooks strategically positioned in their laps--pleasantly voluptuous, with a stunning hourglass figure just on the cusp of chubbiness without quite tipping over.   Still, the demonic influence is subtle enough that if it wasn't for the red and black dress she's been poured into, you probably wouldn't notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit of a trick question,\" she continues.   \"By 'sex', I'm not talking about that oh-so-fun after hours exercise--rather, it's merely an archaic form of the number 'six'.   In Morlo's time--the age of sex--\"   She grinned.  \"--demon summoning was something of a crapshoot.  You never knew quite what you would get.  Apprentices would get ripped apart by archdemons.   Master wizards would end up conjuring imps in the heat of battle.  Morlo changed all that.   He discerned and enumerated the demon hierarchy we still use today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swings her pointer at a diagram on the chalkboard. The little implet imprisoned on the end squeaks as she smacks into the collection of radiating lines and circles face-first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six supreme archdemons--theoretical, these, no one has ever managed one--and six times six grand archdemons--only one was summoned once, and it took the entire Red College of Rhazinal, located in what is now Rhazinal Crater--and six time six times six archdemons--these you may summon one day, if you're very good--and so on.   By understanding this framework, we can predict what we're going to get, and escape any nasty surprises in favor of nasty expecteds.\" Without looking, she draws a quick chalk circle on the slate in front of her.   \"Now, let's try one ourselves.  A minor imp, if you please--though if you want to try for something more and let it knaw on your face a bit, be my guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost lazily, she snaps her fingers and another imp pops into existence in the middle of the circle.   Their appearances differ greatly from imp to imp--this one looks like an angry middle-aged baby with horns.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia raises her hand.  \"Miss!\" she says.  \"Once we have our imp, what do you want us to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I've seen it and confirmed you can do the spell, you may do whatever you want with it,\" Valana said cheerfully.  \"That's the wonderful thing about our School--the power it gives you over these delightful creatures is yours and yours alone to wield as you will.  Personally, I find them wonderfully crunchy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, a long tongue snakes out from her mouth and wraps around the imp, yanking it upwards.  She swallows the shrieking creature whole.  The illusion that she retains nearly all of her humanity is shattered as she smiles again, display that array of fangs.  Her chest convulses in a silent hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Julia look at each other, then down at the slate summoning boards in front of you, black and clean, the chalk in the chalk cubby just waiting to be used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to work together?\" she asks, pushing a strand of dark hair out of her face shyly.  \"I--I want to make sure I'm doing it right.\"</span></div></div>",

Once inside the soot-blackened, fortress walls, there isn't a classroom or a library in sight (any book would swiftly burn in the intense heat anyway). The interior is both a foundry and an open cast mine. Furnaces the size houses spew out torrents of liquid metal, while clockwork golems as big as oak trees pound massive hammers against weaponry and armour still white hot from casting, filling the vast space with a deafening clang. A cyclone of choking black smoke spirals upwards towards the five chimneys up above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this arrayed around an impossibly deep pit in the center. Huge buckets of glittering ore chunks, crystalline fragments, and gems are constantly being lifted from these depths by pivoting mechanical arms, which somehow manage to avoid the gantries crisscrossing the vast space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of first year students huddle together at the entrance, hands over their ears, choking for breath in the thick fumes, flinching in fear at each powerful blow from the golem metalworkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really makes you feel small, doesn't it?\" the wizard closest to you murmurs in wonder. Well... bellows in wonder. He's short and slight with bronze skin, copper coloured hair, and green eyes. \"My father owned a blacksmiths but this is something else altogether.\" He moves closer. \"Mind if I tag along with you? I don't want to get lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I know where I'm going?\" you shout back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, but you look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words are drowned out as one of the golems lays down its hammer, moving towards the group, its ponderous steps thudding. The group shrinks back. Just as it seems about to step on them, it sinks to one knee, the clockwork gears and cogs inside its torso rolling back to expose its heart, a human figure fitted neatly inside its breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can sense the power emanating from her. This must be the professor. She is naked and dripping with sweat from the heat. Her body displays the scars of chemical burns almost proudly. Her short, canary yellow hair is stuck to her head with sweat. Looking closer, you notice she has neither arms nor legs, her limbless torso connected seamless with the machinery that surrounds her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany Gold Order wizards are known to replace one or more of their body parts with prosthesis of their own creation, especially as the toll starts to corrupt them. This is the first time you've seen it in the flesh. She seems no worse for wear for her condition, flashing them all an ecstatic smile. \"New recruits! Awesome!\"</span></div></div>",

You feel her reach out with a whisper of her powers, and slender chains rattle down from on high, wrapping themselves around her torso like tendrils, gently lifting her free of the golem cockpit. The golem sags, its clockwork insides ceasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chains carry the professor towards a far smaller chassis that resembles a suit of plate armour molded to a feminine form, though with the upper chest cut away to allow her to be fitted easily inside. The chains slot her snugly into the armour and it hugs her closer, the arms and legs coming alive immediately. She flexes them as if they were her own, seemingly instantly at home inside her new body. The dexterous mechanical fingers buckle and tighten leather straps across her shoulders and breasts, securing herself inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help stare at the curious fusion of machine and woman as she steps closer to the group, her robotic hips and legs moving with a distinct female sway. She looks far too young to be a professor, barely out of her teens, though appearance means little regarding wizards. She could be centuries old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves to shake each new pupil's hand, her fingers cold and hard under yours. There is a strong, acrid, chemical smell about her. \"Hi there! Welcome! I'm Vanyra Sweetstone, your guide for today. It's my job to show you around and see you safe to your dormitory, alive and with all limbs attached. The College Foundry is a dangerous place, especially for first year students, but so long as you follow my rules, you shouldn't be being sent back home to your mother in a matchbox. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group nods nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Rule one! You do exactly as I say, when I say it. If I say duck, you duck. If I say run, you run. Rule two...\" A wicked smile curls her purple-stained lips and she points at the students' robes. \"The clothes, lose them.\" The students are silent, glancing at each other uncertainly, until she snaps, \"Have you forgotten the first rule already? I say strip, that means you <i>strip</i>. Now! You think robes are going to protect you if you trip and fall in a furnace? You think they'll do a thing if a crucible falls on your head. Rule two - no clothing to be worn inside the foundry at all times. Clothing is flammable. Clothing can snag in gears and get you ground into a pulp. The only thing that'll keep you alive are wits and wizardry, so off off off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is some sort of hazing ritual surely, you reason. They can't seriously expect you to do the entirety of your studies ... naked. Can they? Yet many of the students are already slipping out of their robes. Some more reluctantly than others, especially the boys who had been oggling Vanyra's perky breasts only a minute before. The bronze-skinned boy at your side barely needs any persuasion, stripping out of his clothes so fast you're certain he must have teleported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the number of clothed students starts to become a minority, you become aware of Professor Sweetstone's piercing gaze on you. Finally relenting, you pull the heavy robes over your head. Soon your underclothes join them on a pile on the foundry floor. Your face burns bright red as you stand naked, cupping your genitals with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now no, no need to be so coy. You're going to be seeing each other like this for the next seven years, so you might as well get used to it.\" Sweetstone flicks her wrist, and the mounds of clothing fly on invisible winds into the mouth of a furnace, incinerated in an instant. She squirms with delight inside her metal shell at the outraged looks on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the third and final rule...\"</span></div></div>",

As your flesh hardens and turns to cold stone, the torturous heat abates. The choking fumes no longer matter as your breathing ceases. Your nudity is sti embarrassing and you still cup your groin, though you feel slightly less phased now that you resemble a statue more than a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students are slipping into their alternate forms. There are quite a few irons, a bronze, what might be lead, even a girl made of silver. A few of them are staring at you, and the boy beside you hides a snort of amusement. \"Is that... granite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mate, you do know granite isn't a metal, right?\" he teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor looks at you with something resembling pity. \"Now now, Emmanuel, some of us aren't quite advanced as others. It's nothing to be ashamed of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not ashamed!\" you exclaim indignantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good for you,\" she says soothingly. \"Emmanuel, I notice you haven't changed yet. Why don't you go ahead and show the class what you can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't think you've ever seen anybody look quite so smug as he focuses his powers and his dark skin is enveloped beneath a wave of lustrous molten gold. His naked body shimmers golden-red in the light from the furnaces. The class takes a collective intake a breath, awed. Even Sweetstone is speachless. The Gold Order wizards' love for their namesake metal is legendary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to restrain herself, Sweetstone runs her trembling robotic hands over the young man, uttering \"remarkable. Truly remarkable. And so soft. So malleable.\" Her fingertips caress him lightly, as if afraid of tarnishing him. Emmanuel seems to relish the attention, especially as her fingers stroke down his stomach, heading towards his gilded ballsack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last moment, she seems to snap back to her senses and draws away from him, though reluctantly. The female half of the class eye him up lustfully. Any more wet and they'll start to rust. \"Really... rather beautiful,\" Sweetstone says breathlessly, absently twirling the steel wire of her hair around her finger, before finally regaining a little composure and announcing that the tour has begun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But stone is great too,\" Emmanuel whispers sarcastically, falling into line beside you. </span></div></div>",

It isn't some powerful arcanum they're protecting. It's just the fact that they're all stark bollock naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaked wizards stop to greet the naked initiates as Sweetstone guides them along the high gantries that thread through the foundry. There is far too much handshaking going on for your liking. The female students struggle and fail to meet the conflicting requirements of handshaking and concealing their nudity, which makes the male students even more determined to hide theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only person who seems at home with the situation is Emmanuel, who bathes in the'attention. A golden form is exceedingly rare - even Aurel, the Gold College magi, is incapable of adopting one - and regarded as evidence of prodigious talent and a great destiny. Even the veteran wizards are awed, the'men marvelling, the women idolising him, almost literally. The softness of his metal flesh means that he moves with a catlike fluidity and grace. Meanwhile your granite form resists every movement you try to make, forcing you to walk like an arthritic puppet.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shown the ore smashers and sifters, the furnaces, then follow a viaduct of liquid iron to where it is poured into clay molds. After that, the group ventures deeper to the quenching room, which is more of a subterranean lake than a room, where the cast items are dunked amid clouds of steam. Then it's back up to the fresh air and sunlight of the testing yard, where the newly forged armour, weaponry, and war machines are put through their paces. Even as they experimentally swing broadswords at each other, it is all done with an obstinate commitment to nudity.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is weird,\" you mutter to yourself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it. It's exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at Emmanuel. \"It's unsanitary is what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that come the artisans - the alchemists, the enchanters, the inscribers and the rune carvery. The astral refractory is a large, dimly lit dome studded with chunks of focusing crystals through which lance beams of concentrated light, collecting and distilling the properties of astral bodies to be placed into weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly empty right now of course,\" Sweetstone explains, her voice echoing around the dome. \"This area really comes alive during the night shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop posing like that,\" you snarl at Emmanuel, as he leans over the gantry railing, positioning himself and flexing his arse just so, so that a blinding beam of sunlight reflects off his glorious golden buttocks and into your face. You feel soiled.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, gang, follow me,\" calls Sweetstone. \"There's loads more to show you of the Foundry, but I'd prefer to give you a quick look at some of our deep mining operations, then show you to your dorms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads the group back through the foundry to the chasm that sits in the centre. It is several hundred feet wide and standing on the edge you see that it several miles deep, plunging vertically downwards. The bottom is a distant point of orange light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group piles into a wire cage hanging over the chasm, which begins to descend with a lurch. The heat 'and noise of the foundry gradually lessens as the wall of dripping stone slides past. The ring of picks echo from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of our mining is done by slaves,\"'Sweetstone explains as the cage descends past a side tunnel cut into the rocks in which a group of half-animal figures hack'at the rockface and load wheelbarrows of ore to be carried to the surface. \"They're easier to replace than golems. At this level, it's too cold for saluria, so we mostly use felini and canids. At the lowest levels, close to the lava,'we have to use draconians. They're the only things that'll survive down there.\"</span></div></div>",

The group disembarks, stooping to avoid banging their heads on the low, roughly hewn rock of the ceiling. As you move forward, reptilian anthros pass in the dimness, hacking at the walls with picks.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air down here is warmer than the frigid cold up above, though still on the wrong side of cool, worsened by the moist draught that whistles through the tunnel. The dripping walls are illuminated only by the ghostly, white-blue glow coming from the bodies of the lizardmen miners. The blue bioluminescence is\u00a0concentrated in stripes on the backs and sides of the creatures. They are naked except for loin clothes and the filth that encrusts their scales. The move sluggishly, watching the wizards with listless, defeated eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are our saluria,\" Sweetstone announces loudly to the group shuffling between the workers. \"Don't worry, they won't bite. We modulate the temperature down here, since they're cold blooded it keeps them all nice and compliant. In addition, we carefully control the temperature of the eggs to ensure the majority of each batch mature into strong, productive males.\u00a0The bioluminescence you can see is something we've succeeded in breeding into them over a considerable period of time. Aside from a few prisoner transfers from up above, most of the animals we keep down here are the product of generations of selective breeding. They're born, work, mate, and die down here, never to see the sun, which works really well at keeping them in check - if they know of no better life, they can't desire or demand anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunnel slopes downwards, twisting and splitting off as it follows the path of old, harvested seams of ore.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick test to see if a saluria is docile, by the way,\" Sweetstone says, seizing one of the slaves at random by the neck. She holds it tightly while her other hand grips its tail and gives it a hard wrench. The tail breaks away from its body cleanly and it\u00a0scurries away, whimpering, to find\u00a0a dark corner of the mine to curl up in. \"It's their flight response. When threatened, a docile saluria will simply abandon a limb in order to escape. If a limb doesn't come off when you pull it, that means their fight response is engaged, which is bad news and means we need to lower the temperature.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drops the wriggling segment of tail from her hand, wiping her fingers on the tunnel wall in distaste. \"Don't worry, they usually grow back,\" she laughs. \"Right, first year dorms are just down this tunnel. They're comfortable enough, barring the occasional\u00a0uprising. Now I know some of your voiced wanting to find a familiar before lessons start, so now's your opportunity! I'll give you a few minutes if any of you want to bag yourself a saluria. Take your pick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around at the pitiful creatures toiling away in the darkness. You'd be doing them a favour taking then as a familiar. Any life would be better than this.</span></div></div>",

Her bioiluminescence throbs with the strong beat of her heart, filling the tunnel with pulsating blue-white light. He looks strong, with thick bands of muscle from a life of hard labour straining to be contained within his sapphire scales. Despite his intimidating build, as you approach he drops his pick and shrinks back against the wall, sinking to his knees and sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touch him lightly on the forehead, uttering the incantation to begin the familiarisation spell. His body trembles and his limbs shake as the connection forms. Without consent or an understanding of what it happening, the bonding process can be rather traumatic, as his simple animal mind joins with your more evolved intellect. You try to push calming thoughts through the link to him. The psychic intrusion only serves to make it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his head, at least you can see why he is afraid of you. You're a being of solid granite, as though the rockface itself has come alive, sought him out for a lifetime of cracking open the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<i>Chill, I'm not a rock monster! I'm just a wizard!</i>] you think, trying to sooth him. Alas, the last word drowns his mind with such terrible fear that it forces you to sever the psychic connection. Your familiar cowers beneath you, shaking like a leaf, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith five quiet pops, the flight part of the silurian's fight-or-flight response kicks in supremely. His arms, legs and tail all disconnect at once. Your familiar drops to the tunnel floor as a torso and head, while the class erupts in howls of laughter. Their mockery echoes and resounds in the narrow space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice choice, loser!\"<br>\r\n\"Looks like your familiar dropped something, Rocky.\"<br>\r\n\"Half a familiar is better than none, Meade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... What the heck did you go and do that for?\" you moan, staring at your limbless familiar in horror. \"I was trying to help you.\" Even with the psychic link broken, the terror still comes off him in waves. His horrible, wormlike torso flexes and writhes as he tries to squirm away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit. You can't leave him like this. You're responsible for him now, at least until he can regenerate his lost parts. You crouch, making gentle noises of reassurance as you get close enough to slide your hands under the nubs of his shoulders, lifting him into your arms. His torso is muscular and heavy, and the air huffs out of you as you hold him close to your chest. The students laugh all the more, mocking you with kissing noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has your boyfriend been drinking, Meade? He's totally legless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough,\" Sweetstone chides them sharply. \"I said <i>enough</i>! Silence! I won't have you mocking your fellow student like that. Not here. It's far too structurally unsound. Your voices could bring the mine down on our heads. If you want to insult him, do it in the Grand Hall. The acoustics are excellent.\" She turns, striding off down the tunnel. \"Come along, children. The dormitories are just round the next bend. Lessons start tomorrow so I want you all to get a good night's sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling under the weight of your familiar, you follow the group as quickly as you can.</span></div></div>",

Still wracked by guilt, make your limbless familiar as comfortable as possible in the situation, swaddling him in blankets like a newborn and laying him at the foot of the bed. You don't sleep well that night. Every time you do, the psychic bond floods your dreams with the familiar's fearful thoughts, which startle you awake. Memories of cruel masters, and one in particular lying not far away. The poor thing has not had an easy life, his only interaction with wizards at the end of a lash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you fall wearily out of bed and trudge to your first lesson. It passes in a daze, barely registering, as you slump in the rear of the dank classroom, slipping in and out of sleep. You find your familiar exactly where you left him, wrapped in blankets at the foot of the bed. He watches you with wide, unblinking eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the mental link. [<i>Look, I'm not going to hurt you. I just want to help. I'm sorry I scared you so bad your body fell off.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[...]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<i>I think we got off on the wrong... foot.

Nice to meet you, Zax!</i>]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<i>How are you in my head</i>?] Zax asks angrily. [<i>Nobody is allowed in my head. Not even the masters are allowed in my head.</i>] <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try your best to explain the concept of the wizard-familiar relationship as best you can to a slave with no understanding of such concepts as psychic bridges and thaumaturgical pair bonding. He listens to it all, until he asks, [<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<i>I was trying to help. This life you live... you'll be happier by my side. You'll get to accompany me on adventures, be able to leave this place, walk up above in the sun-</i>]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<i>'Sun'?</i>]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. [<i>Yeah, the sun. Big, bright, hot thing in the sky?</i>] You send him a memory - of a lazy summer day beneath a clear sky and a hot golden sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lies! There is no such thing!!\" Zax shouts suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<i>Seriously. It's like a big ball of fire that hangs in the air.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar! Deceiver!\" Zax cries, retreating deep into his mind where you can't reach him. You realise that for a Silurian, a species that normally worships fire, that lives off heat, who has spent him entire life underground in temperatures only a few degrees above that which would put him into a stupor, the concepts of warmth and light are alien.</span></div></div>",

Occasionally you dive into his dreams and wallow in the potent euphoria of the dreams of a contented animal . With his mind now calmed, you find is easy to drift off yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake refreshed. Zax pines sorely as you rise from beneath the warm bedsheets, but he has faith that his god will return. In the break between morning and afternoon lectures, you return to your quarters to spoon feed your familiar a little food and give his limbless body a quick, hard fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess would not approve of this. The church of the Goddess generally frowns on recreational sex, expecting that sex should be functional and productive. Anything unlikely to produce healthy human offspring is regarded as sinful, so you guess gay anal with a lizard isn't high on their list of favourite things. It suprises you how little it bothers you - after all, you had been raised to be a Goddess-fearing man. Meh. The Goddess has no place in the Colleges of Magic. After evening lectures, you lie with Zax again, and he communes energetically with his new idol, taking it eagerly in both ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two days pass similarly. Zax demonstrates considerable improvements, both physically and mentally. The effect of your body heat on his cold-blooded metabolism is enough to bring him out of the artificially stunted state he has been kept in. His lost limbs begin to regrow, slowly at first but soon faster, while mentally he becomes more alert, his thoughts more coherent. His appetite improves, and not just for food. You wake on the third morning to find his scaley ass in your face, his head buried beneath the sheets as he sucks hungrily on your cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lie there, listening to the wet sounds of his forked tongue lapping at your shaft, you're suddenly startled by a loud knocking at the door...</span></div></div>",

There are deep bags under his eyes and his short, copper-and-green hair is tousled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't go on,\" he groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what can't?\" you ask innocently, your voice quavering as Zax continues to suck beneath the sheets, swallowing your penis whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" Emmanuel says, grabbing a corner of the blanket and whipping it away.

Yeah, right.\" he frowns in sudden suspicion. \"Wait, you're not one of those people, are you? An animal lover.\" He closes his eyes, focusing his powers, and in an instant he slips into his golden form, the sudden weight of his resplendent body pinning you to the bed, which creaks and groans. The metal of his skin ripples like liquid, coating him in a layer of scales. A serpent tail sprouts just above his buttocks, and his nose and mouth sprout into a silurian snout. \"How about thisss?\" he whispers, his forked tongue hissing between his lips.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess, you're picky. So it's the amputee thing, right? Fine.\"'He arms and legs flow into his torso and he falls to the bedsheets, a wriggling silurian torso. \"Happy now? Can we get started?

His limbs surge back into existence as he snaps back to his baseline, human body. A pair of small golden buds swell on his chest, growing to become modest but pert A-cups with small, hard nipples. His already slender form requires little alteration, remaining petite, though his waist slims and his hips and ass expand, not overly so, but enough to give a delightful curve to the swell of his buttocks. His face changes very little too, becoming a slightly more femme version of his already delicate, fey features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches down between his legs, gently cupping his liquid metal penis before pushing it up into his body with two fingers.

His mammoth mounds that glistened in their golden state were hanging just at the level of his navel.

You salivate at the thought reducing the state of your unsurpassable rival into working girl whose only duty is to service your cock at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?

It was so powerful that you even left a dent in it. \"Ow, what the--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut your whore mouth!\" You bark. This position of superiority, this power... it was intoxicating you. \"You do exactly as I say, slut, or I'll send you to the refinery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmmanuel whimpers. You can see the fear reflected in his eyes. You have total control over him. The thought alone makes you hard. You quickly jump onto the bed and thrusts your mighty penis into his vagina and proceed to rapidly come in and out. You can hear the soft sobs of Emmanuel, but you don't care. All that matters is that this snatch gets what it deserves. Before long, you are at your limit. You blow your load straight into the golden pussy, where it glistens from the refraction of light. Looking at this scene, you feel proud. Emmanuel is lying there, panting. You are sure that he has awoken to his masochistic tendencies. Suddenly, you have an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we have clarified the pecking order,\" you say. \"You are to revert back to the non-golden form of this body. You will stay this way until I impregnate you and you give birth to my child.

It does not even give as much as a yelp or roar as it suddenly crumbles to the ground with a splat. Guts spill out from its upper torso, the intestines and liver hanging out loosely \u2013 a sight that would cause any but the most seasoned veteran to vomit on sight \u2013 while the crimson blood is splattered all over the dead corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brixor, no!\" A man runs up straight to the dead body of the minotaur; shaking it, hugging it, vomiting from the atrocious odor fuming from it. \"Come back... come back to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the [Spiritual Rematerialization] spell would have kicked in, disintegrating the dead body on the spot as the spirit is recovered through the forged <i>Spiritual Link</i> between familiar and master \u2013 ready to be summoned after a short rest. Yet the cadaver remains unaltered on the ground. The reason to you is obvious as you flash a brief smile to yourself and flick your eyes over to the sword your trusty familiar is carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the legendary <i>Vorpal Blade</i>. Its ingredients rare, its forging tedious. It is a sword that is capable of wrenching the soul of any enemy it cuts or pierces out of their bodies, to be absorbed by the blade so that it may grow more powerful, and \u2013 by extension \u2013 yourself and your familiar. Legends speak of its true power being capable of opening dimensions and portals that lead to other worlds, as well as being able of slicing through the fabric of reality itself to ignore the defenses of the toughest armors and the strongest barriers. A pity that you cannot access it \u2013 though the black sword shimmers with countless silver lights of the souls of enemies it devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you'll pay for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think not.\" You say, motioning your head towards your salurian familiar. Jax has already become unrecognizable compared to the first time you bonded with him. The lizard has already reached a magnificent height, his head on par with the shoulders of the giant minotaur he just fought. Muscles now ripple throughout the entirety of the body, each flex causing his menacing arms and legs to resemble tree trunks. He has become ferocious, reminding you of the legendary crocodiles of Namaria that you have seen in picture books as a wee lad. But that biggest change has to be... <i>that</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it.\" You command him, as the stiffening erection of his manhood pulsates and throbs rapidly. The guy shirks away, scampering to get away from green monstrosity as it approaches. Futile. Your familiar easily snatches him by the leg and pins him to the ground, his manhood sliding against his tight anus. His cock is now unbelievably large; its entirety ribbed with spikes for pleasure. Lizardly pleasure; not human. It exudes a sense of warmth as it pulsates, a severe contrast to the coldness of the rest of the salurian's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his pleas, whimpers, and protests, Jax slowly applies forces and thrusts the boy's asshole. A scream resounds throughout the air, as his voice echos in accordance to each thrust the salurian performs. It looks downright horrifying, the boy's eyes wide open in fear as the thick salurian dick slides in and out of his tight little hole. Fortunately, it does not last long as the lizard's pent up semen explodes from his testicles, the force of it gushing forward, filling him to the brim  \u2013 causing his mouth to spew the odorful sperm. His stomach has blown up like a balloon, almost ready to burst from the pressurized geyser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles subtly, praying that the experience is now over. Yet what happens next is something that he does not expect as his body suddenly vaporizes in a bright white light, leaving behind nothing but a puddle of semen-vomit. That's it. He is now a part of your familiar, sealed eternally within his cock amongst countless other human souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this is a result of your familiar's desire. As he naturally evolved from your increased mana supply and experience in battle, his form took upon new characteristics and his body had obtained new abilities. One of those abilities was the ability to steal the soul of living organisms. By orgasming into them, the soul of those organisms would be forcefully wrenched away from their bodies and permanently sealed into the cock of the salurian familiar. How he obtained this ability \u2013 you don't know. But you suspect that it has something to do with his desire for warmth, and the souls of those entrapped into his cock would feed him \u2013 provide him warmth forever. You silently mourn for the poor soul whose destiny now was to simply sense his surroundings with the senses of a cock, fated to taste the vile semen every time as string passes through the manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go. We can't dally here for long. Thankfully, we ambushed a lone upperclassman, so it didn't take long, but if we are late for class, then Professor Sweetstone might figure that something's up and connect his disappearance to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour familiar wrinkles his nose \u2013 if lizards could wrinkle their noses \u2013 and guffaws at your statement, opening a telepathic channel with you. \"Master, do we really have to pretend to be weak any longer? I don't like the other familiars in class looking down at me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot! The entire faculty is scampering 'round due to the 'mysterious nature of the disappearances'. Some think it's a lich king, others a black magician. Can you imagine what they'll think if we suddenly pop up and show a level of power beyond all students? They already think that our growth is quite unnatural and surprising. You think I want them to launch an investigation and find out that <i>we</i> stole the sacred Vorpal Blade from the vaults?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour salurian familiar simply grumbles and nods in return, having nothing more to add. He understands your plight, but Jax has become quite individualistic these days \u2013 too individualistic you'd say. You think back to the days of when you first found him, the frightened salurian working in the mines in the cold, humid climate. Oh where have those days have gone. Back then, he was timid, and some would even say an adorable creature, following your every command. Now, an increase in strength means an increase in arrogance, as the muscular beast would promptly rebuke your advice. You will need to set him straight some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, shove that sword back up your ass!\" You command, as the salurian grunts and proceeds as you tell him to, slowing edging the sword inwards, trying to avoid cutting himself. This is also a special ability of your familiar, [Anal Storage]. As your familiar slayed more enemies with the Vorpal Blade, he had gained access to a dimensional storage ability through the mystic sword. It was a dimension capable of storing objects of any size. The only problem \u2013 it was located in his anal cavity, and thus only few things were able to fit in there. Thank god you stretched him out decently already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the classroom filled with the galloping, metallic bodies of your fellow classmates that you have become acquainted with over the year. A quick look around reveals that the teacher is absent for now. <i>Good.</i> You think, quickly and stealthily turning into your granite form. It too has evolved over the year, now looking less arthritic and clumsy, and more durable, fluid, and sleek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleek, that is the word, as a sudden touch on your shoulder brings on out of your stupor and causes your body to perform the most daring evasive maneuver as it spun around to face the intruder to your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Janie,\" a silver-colored girls greets you, waving her hand subtly. In fact, this girl \u2013 Layla is her name \u2013 <i>is</i> made of silver, one of the most purest and valuable components possible. You have no doubt that this girl would have been the prodigy \u2013 the hope of the academy \u2013 had it not been for Emmanuel's presence. Like a diamond outshining the presence of an emerald, so too was this girl outshone by him. Yet she still clings to you \u2013 a granatite \u2013 despite the flawless imperfection of her existence. And you have no doubt it's for one reason, and one reason only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you take me to see Em\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud bang interrupts her words as the door flings open, almost off its hinges, as the figure of Professor Sweetstone angrily storms into the room. You could tell she is not happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Another one!\" She mutters underneath her breath with vicious spite, before noticing all the gazes that turned towards her. She coughs dramatically. \"So class, looks like we will not be going to the foundry today or anywhere in the mines today! It's nothing too special, just\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did someone disappear again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is nothing too special.\" She continues, as the imprint on an iron body remains visible on the wall whilst the flattened student crawls back to his seat. \"Just maintenance. Anyways, today we will be doing...\"</span></div></div>",

Sweetstone pulls open the elevator door and hops out, ushering the class after her. The ring of picks grows louder as they descend the tunnel which opens into a cavern lined with rows of animalistic humanoids dressed in dirty scraps of fabric. It's quite a menagerie. Sweat pours down their fur as they swing their picks to a frenetic pace. The smaller, nimbler beasts chisel at gemstone lodged in the broken lumps of rock. A wizard task-mistress in armour of black iron observes distantly, making sure quotas are met and nothing is stolen by the covetous slaves. Whip in hand, he gives the group a cheery wave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetstone's voice rises above the clamor. \"Now I know some of you have voiced wanting to get a familiar, and I understand that the sooner you seal the pact with your animal, the sooner we can move on to trying out spells. However I would remind you that this is a decision not to be made on a whim. The soul bond you forge with your familiar may very well last the rest of your life, will in many ways decide the path your future takes. Do not enter it light- oh why do I even bother,\" she rolls her eyes as the female portion of her class gravitates towards the muscular canid males. A particularly robust specimen, seven feet tall with features like a wolf and fur stained pitch black with coal dust, pauses with his huge pick held half aloft as a gaggle of human girls gather around, pawing at his musclebound body. He gives a panicked whine at the sudden attention, shrinking back against the rockface. The students make soft cooing noises, redoubling their petting. Most of the male students go for the smaller slaves, the cat-like Felinis or Skaven girls, pulling them away from their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander away from the group, disgusted as scuffles break out over the prettier slaves. There are plenty of side-tunnels. You pick one at random. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beasts give mixed responses to your approach. Some bear their teeth, others make every effort to ignore you, focusing on the rockface as if by not looking at you, you won't be able to see them. A number of the canid women seem to be actively presenting themselves, hind quarters raised, tongues panting. While you have to admit that the muscular giantesses would make exceptional minions/guard dogs, they are quite intimidating. Unlike the other animals they show little fear of your status, their wolf whistles following you as you round a bend in the tunnel.</span></div></div>",

Her scales are iridescent green, her forked tongue clamped between her teeth in such concentration that she doesn't even register you approaching. She gives a satisfied huff of black smoke from her nostrils as she finally levers free a ruby the size of a tangerine. She admires it for a second, pops it between her lips and swallows, looking up with a smug grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lump catches in her throat as her eyes settle on you, mortal terror filling them.

It must be nearly ten feet tall. It's hooves thud heavily as it lumbers slowly around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you've all gone ahead and bonded to your creatures, just a word of warning about what you can expect over the next few days,\" Sweetstone says with the air of somebody revelling in dispensing bad news. \"So you're both going to be experiencing a few changes while the connection settles. I won't lie, it will be tough. You're going to be emotional. Tired. You might start thinking intrusive thoughts, remembering things that happened in your familiar's past, feeling phantom limbs, especially tails. This is normal. It passes. Girls, you're going to witness a certain amount of hair growth, hopefully not permanent, maybe some muscle growth too.<br>\r\nI recommend getting plenty of rest and drinking lots of fluids.

If you start thinking you're an enslaved beastman, contact your prefect as soon as possible. <br>\r\nAs for your familiars, if they're not of human-like intelligence now, after a few days they will be.

Remember the answers are 'serving the empire' and 'yes'.<br>\r\nAny questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room erupts as the students demand to know why they weren't informed of the side effects sooner.

Meridinia shouts a \"Follow me!\" as she runs along a narrow mountain path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving you no choice but to follow because of curiosity, you leap into action as you run after her. You run and run and run, but you can't seem to catch up to her and begin crying. This moment's lapse is enough for you to lose balance, and tumble off the path. As you fall, you can hear a distant \"No!\" as you see Meridinia's hand reaching out for you. Unfortunately, that hand is so distant as you feel you stomach punctured by a jagged rock. Your vision fades to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you open your eyes. You can feel a wet sensation on your skin, indicating that you were covered in sweat. You sit up to observe any changes that might have happened to you. The results were evident. You seem to have lost all your body hair and your skin color changed to Meridinia's color. Hair fluttered in front of your face as it seems that the length had increased from your short bowl cut. You could feel short horns poking from underneath it. You feel your hands over your breasts--- wait, breasts? You look down and examine them thoroughly, they seem to be the same shape and size as Meridinia's, though maybe a bit smaller. Your waist seemed to become thinner and your hips also expanded quite heavily, almost as prominent as Meridinia's. Same with your butt and... tail? Huh, so these must be the phantom limbs your professor spoke of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out the window and notice that it's the middle of the night. Strange, you thought it was day for a second, but the moon and stars are clearly shimmering in the sky. You look around, searching for any signs of Meridinia, as you notice her playing with her gems in the corner of the room. Suddenly, you salivate at the sight of the gems, and quickly jump out of bed, running up to the pile and grabbing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's mine--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtesting, Meridinia turns around and her face suddenly turns blank. She blinks a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly yells as she launches herself off her pile to hug you in an embrace, a strange behavior for a draganoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off! I'm your master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push her off yourself, with quite some difficulty, as you try to gain some distance. She just dumbly looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Why did you call me your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's just that... you look exactly like my little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so, I look--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze. What did she say? You look like her little sister? You take a brief glance over your entire body again. These... these were not phantom limbs! This was your true and genuine body! But... how? You weren't supposed to change this much! Not that she mentions it, you're also shorter than her as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... have a little sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she used to play with me a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... what happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can she Meridinia hesitate a bit, biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She died. Fell off the cliff. It was my fault too. I led her over a dangerous area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. That was exactly what happened in your dream! So, you were dreaming that you were her sister? But why? And why did you change? Suddenly, you decide to test something out. You breathe in deeply and rapidly breathe out. At first, the torrent of air that came out was simply that, but then you feel a funny feeling in the back of your throat, and suddenly some embers flew out, before quickly dissipating, confirming your suspicions. Meridinia looks at you with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that? I thought humans were supposed to be able to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, she didn't understand your predicament. You decide...</span></div></div>",

But then, you couldn't properly cover yourself in metal, so undoing a transformation through a binding would be well beyond your grasp! Besides.. Odds are that you'd get considered as a slave if you did nothing. You decide that the best thing to do is to seek help from Professor Sweetstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. Getting around the college without being seen would certainly not be easy.. Then Meridinia inquires, 'Are you alright?'. 'Ye-.. No.. Errr.. I..'. You sigh again, 'I don't know..'. 'What's the matter?' 'I need to speak to someone.'. 'But i can handle it, no..?'. 'Not really.. You wouldn't understand.'. 'What.. Are you pursued?'. 'No..!'. 'Don't leave me..'. 'What?'. What follows surprise you, given Meridinia suddenly hugs you, crying. You say, 'You know that i'm not your sister..'. 'You're not?'. 'No..'. Meridinia hugs you tighter, 'I don't want to lose you too.. Besides, what if your wound open up?'. 'W-wound?'. Instinctively, you peer down at the side of your chest and notices a scar. You sigh, yet again, 'Fine.. You win. You can follow me, but you say quiet for the time being, okay?'. She giggles, 'Sure thing, sis'!'. You grumble and get off your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that it was still night, the college is, thankfully, fairly calm. You head toward the foundry. But, on your way, you notice that a mage pass by. You grab Meridinia's hand and conceal yourself with her behind a wall, and place a hand onto her maw, muffing away some complains. She decides to bite your hand, forcing you to squelch down a scream of pain. Thankfully the mage didn't noticed you. You whisper, 'What was that for!?'. In answer, she growls. You facepalms, 'Follow me..'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't quite good at finding your way around, given you were still new. But, even then, you had a little trick that you could use. The mines and foundries are quite noisy, meaning you could easily find them just by hearing the sounds of the surroundings. Once there, you take a moment to get to know where Professor Sweetstone would be found. You decide to go to the astral refractory. But just before you step in, a chill goes through your spine as you hear a voice. You turn and notice it is Professor Sweetstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There you are!'. Chains comes out of Sweetstone's mechanical body, lashing toward you and Meridinia. Thank to your highlighted reflexes and Meridinia's, you both manage to dodge. Not wanting that to continue, you yell, 'Wait, no..! I'm Janus Aeduuard-kittlewell Maede..!'. The chains suddenly stops, retracting backward, but not fully, still ready to strike. It reassured you, but not Meridinia, which was shaking, right behind you. Professor Sweetstone speaks up, 'Prove it.'. You hurriedly say, 'R-right away..!'. You concentrate and successfully manage to cover your body in granite, feeling the familiar cold touch of the stone. You add, 'I-i came so i'd seek you.. I-i need help with a problem..'. Professor Sweetstone laughs, 'Oh. Silly you! If you hadn't moved from your room, maybe we wouldn't have came to this situation! Two abnormal astral powers had been spotted in the dormitories since recently. I also heard that two draconians were roaming around..'. You blush madly, 'W-we were that visible..?'. 'Right-O! And i suppose the problem is.. Your new body? Well.. Change your body to gold!'. You blink, 'But i can't..!'. 'Not my problem! Do!'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble, pretty sure that you were going to fail. But you hadn't the choice.. You calm down Meridinia, if only because feeling her shaking might break your concentration, then focus onto your body, mentally running the composition of gold in your mind. But as you were about to channel the transmutation, your mind inadvertly catch a phantom thought of the dragoness. As a result, you transmuted your skin into a well polished layer of.. Amethyst. As you peer down at your body to see if you were successful, you notice your blunder and meep, while professor Stonesweet smirks, 'May i know what skin i asked for?'. 'G-gold..'. 'And what it is?'. 'Amethyst..'. 'Just a question then. What is the skin of your familiar?'. You frown, 'Scales, no?'. 'Look again.'. You blink and peer at Meridinia. Her skin is glistering and shines under the light. You tentatively says, 'Gold..?'. Stonesweet pulls her chains fully, back into her body and move toward the draconian. She tries to back up, but you soothe her out with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Sweetstone starts by a visual check of Meridinia's skin, 'Interesting.'. Followed by touchs of her skin, 'Intriguing..'. Then, she gropes the draconian's pair of breasts, sending you a phantom feeling, causing you to cover your breasts while you look away, embarrassed. The professor comments, 'Lovely..'. You could even heard her tongue licking her own lips. You inquire from the professor, 'What about me..?'. 'First, i can't change your body back. And i don't know who could. Odds are that attempts would only strengthen the bond. Two, i'll willing ti take a few.. Exceptional actions. Including giving you both some clothings. And third.. I present to you our new recruit! Altho, i don't think i caught her name..'. You say, 'She's Meridinia, my.. Big sister..'. Sweetstone lets an 'Eh?', before she adds, 'Whatever suits you, as long as you make her behave properly. Oh. And don't worry about the others. I'll make sure they know about your.. Predicament. Now, if you will, you should head back to your room. Night isn't over yet.'. You nod, agreeing, before you feel that Meridinia hugs you again. 'Little sister!'. You huffs, and rub her head. 'Alright, sis.. Let's head back to our room, okay!'. 'Sure!'. Professor Sweetstone adds, 'Don't get in any trouble, ya will youngsters!?'. You say, 'S-sure!'. <br>\r\nBoth you and Meridinia heads back to your room, resting away for till it's day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get woken up as someone knocks at your room. You hmfs and idly lead to the entrance. You get offered the promised 'clothings'. Two awfully short gown made of steel, with gold finishings. You facepalm, given you hoped you could have some decency, to no avail, given they wouldn't cover you in any way.</span></div></div>",

Instantly you feel an intense pressure crushing down on you from all sides. You cry out, horrified that you've somehow fallen foul of the ore crusher, your screams mingling with the chorus of similar, dwindling screams coming from the other students. You are falling, desperately reaching out with your arms to break your fall yet unable to feel any of your limbs any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the blackened stone floor with an odd ringing noise that reverberates through your body. The already cavernous Foundry towers all around, a thousand times larger. The other students are gone, only Professor Sweetstone remains, a giantess miles high. You try to move your body, but it is utterly frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles. As you look around you, you notice that a handful of small, metal pieces of jewelry lie at her feet. \"Excellent! Believe me, this is for your own good. Now I can keep an eye on all of you at once.\" She kneels down, plucking one of the tiny silver items from the floor, holding it between finger and thumb as she scrutinies it. It glows briefly before guttering out. \"I'm afraid your magic won't work without your wand, Miss Lawson, which will be supplied to you only after I deem you ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unbuckles the leather strap compressing her breasts, freeing her nipple. The tiny, silver stud slides into the piercing in her right nipple. It flares brightly again, trying to summon enough magic to return to human form, but the spell sputters and dies. Without a wand to channel her power, the student is trapped in her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire class has been transformed into trinkets, you included! Many of the other items lying in the dirt seem to realise their position, as they too fizzle with aborted reversal spells. One by one, she gathers them up, fitting them into the many piercings on her body. Her ears are soon heavy with adornments, her nose and lips glittering with a dozen studs and rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she stands over you.

A simple five inch shaft of smooth rock, rounded at one end, two stony balls at the other. You're a dildo. \"I don't know which one you are, but today you're teacher's pet,\" she grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings you to her mouth and her hot lips seal around your cold stone tip, her wet tongue lapping at your briefly, making you shudder mentally with pleasure. Then with a business-like spit of saliva on you, she moves you lower, orientating you about her waiting snatch. It glistens, beads of sweat running down her torso in the heat of the foundry. Even here, her hair is a vivid canary-yellow, though shaved short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little ado beyond a short grunt of discomfort, she slides you home. Your body exults as her tight pink insides become your entire world, filling you with heavenly warmth. You hear the whir of her mechanical limbs, feel the clench of her muscles as she takes a step. Her voice reverberates through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, first rule of wizarding - a wizard without a human form can't channel a spell unless they have a focus, like a wand, so you may as well all stop trying to change back. You're my property until I decide otherwise, and that's only when the council agrees that you're more useful to us as a wizard than you are as a pretty trinket to be sold at market. So pay attention, listen when I'm casting, memorise what I tell you, and you might get your soft sweaty meat-forms back in.... oh, shall we say, six months?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pussy suddenly spasms and she gives a delighted gasp. \"Another thing for you to learn,\" she utters breathlessly. \"All this magic energy you guys are throwing around... it flows straight into me...

At parties, women would laughingly adorn it with their jewelry and clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then, it had been terrifying. Something about the spheres of amber inserted where the eyes had once been really creeped you out. Like they were watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a vivid memory to work from.

He stares at it thoughtfully in his palm and you stare right back up, reeling with disorientating in your chair now that your sight is divided. He holds the chunk of amber up to the light that streams through the high windows, examining it like a jeweler searching for an imperfection. With the tip of his little finger, he traces a burning emerald sigil across the the surface, which slowly fades and sinks into the depths of the gemstone. Finally, he resets the eye into your socket with a flourish, like a grandfather plucking a coin from behind the ear of a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmf. Passable. Very passable.

Indeed, as he begins to outline the lesson ahead, you realise that's exactly what he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you lucky, lucky people have all demonstrated sufficient skill with shapeshifting already to be fast-tracked straight to me, so for my lessons we won't be memorizing incantations or working on self-image construction and visualization. What we're going to be doing is a little thing I like to call \"role play\". Acquiring a form is the easy part. <i>Becoming</i> that form - by which I mean immersing yourself in the form, perfecting the physicality, mastering the mannerisms, learning the attitude and the language - these are the things you need to be practicing. Now, could you open your desks and take out the character sheets provided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside your desk, you find a piece of parchment. It has been divided into sections for race, gender and various statistics and attributes. At the same time, from within the lectern the teacher produces two wizard hats, their brims overflowing with little folded scraps of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each of you will be randomly assigned both a form and a personality. For the next two days, you are not allowed to leave these forms nor break character except during lessons. In this hat here I have your forms. In this one, your personalities. When I read out your details, write them in the character sheet provided. Oh, and if any of you are worried about feeling embarrassed at being made to play roles you wouldn't normally, don't worry...\" He flashes the students a wicked grin. \"As an added incentive, anyone found breaking character will be given ten lashes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A buzz of concerned whispering breaks out in the room. The lecturer raises his hands in apologetic surrender. \"I didn't make the rules, my darlings, that's just how it is. So, shall we begin? Eric Armstrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy on the second row raises his hand. The lecturer digs into one of the hats, flourishing a scrap of paper. \"Covetous,\" he declares, plucking a second slip from the other hat. \"Elf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Covetous Elf gives an audible sigh of relief and begins to fill in his character sheet. The lecturer moves on to the next student, finding Gregarious Goblin, and continues to proceed alphabetically. You wait with mounting nerves until he calls out your name.</span></div></div>",

We have to make do with what is most appropriate to the situation, what will allow us to stay alive and complete the mission, regardless of whether or not we like it. Do you know what a remora slug is?\" You shake your head. \"They are creatures used by the Orcs to clean themselves. They live in the folds of fat in the Orc's belly, feeding off dead skin and scraps of half-chewed food that falls from their mouths. When I was captured by Orcs, I had to live as a remora slug for <i>two weeks</i> until I found my chance to escape. Can you <i>imagine</i> what that was like? I am a <i>thespian</i>! Forced into the emotional range of a slug! It was a waking nightmare. But I did it because it was necessary. And you're telling me you can't spend two days as a wanton slut?

Just write timid wet nurse on your sheet, and see me after class. Both of you. Yes, that means you Meade. I saw you both talking back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour into your first lesson and already you were in trouble. Nathan becomes very quiet, obediently filling out <i>timid wet nurse</i> with his slow, childish handwriting, terrified that he might be expelled and returned to the life he had once had. When the names have all been read out and it is time for the class to take their forms, he is one of the first to volunteer. The class watches excitedly as the scrawny street kid loses his gawkiness, his rat-like face becoming that of a homely, young woman with mousy hair. His already slim limbs become a little thinner still as the fat is redistributed to where it is needed, filling out the front of his bodice into a pair of modest B-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock is not pleased. \"No no <i>no</i>! Snigguh, you're supposed to be a wet nurse for goodness sake! You've been pregnant for nine months, your body has been reshaped, your breasts swollen with tender new flesh to provide milk for not just your own infant child, but those of an entire orphanage! How do you expect to feed four hungry babes with those paltry teats? You are starving these poor children!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDutifully, Nathan focuses, growing his bust size by a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Larger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan hesitates but only for a moment. His breasts swell up through D to DD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nathan, I can barely see them from down here. Larger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan's face is red, but not from embarrassment, he is genuinely struggling. The rest of his body is dangerously thin, every last scrap of fat pumped into the mammaries which stand out absurdly on his emaciated body. His face screws up in pain as he makes a valiant leap to an F, and he slumps exhausted against the desk once it was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Lower the bodice a little and maybe the orphans will eat tonight,\" Peacock chuckles, raising laughter from the students. \"Meade, you're up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already have your form picked out, a barmaid you recall from home. When people were feeling polite, she was known as the town mule - everybody had given her a ride. She had been unwed and approaching middle age, her youthful looks long faded, with a plump bottom on broad hips and large, saggy breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou refuse to give him the satisfaction, and slip into her form without a complaint. Peacock examines you, his eyes probing here and there, trying to find fault. \"Mmm... needs more open sores.\" You add them in abundance, along with cracked lips and thinning hair, until you're the sort of poxy whore men wouldn't touch with a bargepole. Underneath the women's undergarments you keep your male equipment however, since you can think of no way Peacock might find out about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continue around the class, each student donning their assigned form and receiving a critique. Nathan remains slumped over, his breathing laboured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little tired is all,\" he whispers back weakly.</span></div></div>",

Students in the forms of cats, and dogs and birds sit in their seats like well-trained animals. The Confused Penguin keeps glancing worriedly at his neighbor, a hulking ogre, every time he shifts in his seat. One slip and he's penguin patte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work,\" Peacock applauds lightly as the last student slips into their new form. \"Also, in the interest of solidarity, I will be undergoing this exercise too.\" Picking the last two scraps of paper from the bottom of the two selection hats, he exclaims. \"Ah! Glamorous Elven King. The role I was born to play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room breaks into laughter, which melts away into awe as the teacher shrugs off his human form, growing taller, becoming long limbed yet muscular. A crown of white wood nestles in the mane of golden hair that seems to float around his head like a radiant halo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose wizards now in female forms seem to grow uneasy, the sight of the transformed teacher awakening something deep within them. It has no effect on you; you're suddenly very thankful for the male equipment you decided to keep between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So remember, once you're outside this room, the roleplay begins,\" Peacock reminds them. \"Class dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much stepping on toes, the students file out. With your arm round his shoulders you help Nathan, still weak, down from the benches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah yes, you two. Timid wet nurse, go wait outside. Wanton slut, I'll talk to you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you dislike the way he refuses to use your real names, you keep your mouth shut as Nathan steps outside, aware that you're on thin ice. One word to the magi and he can have you expelled. Or worse, killed. He finishes gathering his notes together before turning to you, \"Now, <i>slut</i>, you seem like a smart lad.\" He seats himself on one of the benches, patting the area beside him. You sit next to him. \"That was very astute of you earlier, when you said that I was rigging the draw. Did you figure out how I was doing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy. The pieces of paper were blank. You were just reading out what you wanted people to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, very good. Some of us are so sharp we could just cut ourselves,\" Peacock exclaims. He leans closer, for a moment his eyes seeming to glimmer like gemstones. \"A lad as bright as you deserves a reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down. In his lap is sat a box, brimming over with chocolate eclairs. You start to question where it came from, except they look so delicious your thoughts seem to slip away, retreating into the background. In the cente of the box sits the biggest eclair you've ever seen, dripping with chocolate, shining with thick sugar glaze. You lick your lips, suddenly ravenous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock sees you looking, his lips curling into a smile. \"Go ahead. Take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, you wrap your hands around the tasty treat. It is strangely warm, but a thought in your head tells you that it is freshly baked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to give you a tip,\" Peacock says as you bend down to take the end of the eclaire into your mouth, your head almost inside the box that sits on the teacher's lap. \"Around here there is such a thing as being too smart for your own good. Some teachers - not me, but some - don't like it when you start questioning them. Sometimes it is better to, ah, keep your head down, your lips closed, and just suck it up. Tell me, are you enjoying that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit salty, sir,\" you say honestly, suddenly not sure you want to be eating it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it isn't. It is the sweetest thing you've ever tasted.\" His eyes seem to glitter again. There is a pressure in your head. The chocolate melts in your mouth, the rich tastes spreading over your taste buds. You tuck in with gusto, taking more of it into your mouth, running your tongue over the sweet glaze again and again. Peacock seems happy at your enthusiasm, leaning back with a contented sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My intentions were pure of course. I made you the Wanton Slut to demonstrate to the other students that not all forms are desirable, and because I know you have the acting chops to take it. And you <i>can</i> take it. In fact you're taking it right now, you naughty naughty - uh, clever boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmphf,\" you mumble around the dessert filling your mouth. You really want to get to the cream filling. You can almost taste it. You know it will be divine. Eagerly you take the full length of it, wrapping your lips tight around the flaky pastry, sucking harder. Peacock gives a long, shuddering groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cream spurts into your mouth, hot and salty, and you gag on it. It doesn't taste nice at all. You want to spit it out but you can't, the eclair filling your mouth won't let you. Some of it dribbles down your chin and drips onto your plump, pillowy bosom. Peacock tuts disapprovingly. \"Tsk tsk, slut. That cream is heavenly, don't let it go to waste now. Gulp it down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's right, it tastes <i>fantastic</i>! You swallow, licking the drips from off your lips and chin. You're aware that he is watching you closely, and you feel a stab of shame at your manners as you clean yourself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything a growing boy needs, is it not? That will do for now. Be a dear and put that away for me.\" You slide the eclair back in its box, barely questioning the fact that it is oddly uneaten, and close the lid. Peacock straightens his doublet. \"Now, what do we say?\" he says with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. You may go. Oh! And send Timid Wet-nurse in while you're out there, will you? She looks positively <i>famished</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a buzzing in your head, you walk to the door, ushering Nathan in as you go.</span></div></div>",

His hair is ruffled, his bodice hanging loose from around one shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he say to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeade looks at him - or at least tries to; his eyes are glazed and unfocused. His brow furrows. \"I... I can't remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock reclines on the front bench, one arm draped over the back of the seat, when Nathan steps into the room. Between his crimson clothing and broad smile full of teeth, there is something of the fox about him. \"Come in, come in, my darling. Close the door, why don't you, you're letting the cold in. Sit here,\" he says, putting the bench beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan sits. Peacock stretches and shifts closer, his tall elven body seeming to loom over him. \"They tell me that you're an urchin boy. That must have been hard. I hope you're settling in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying it here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect you'd like to continue staying here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan feels a knot tighten in his stomach. \"Y-yes, Mr Peacock, sir. I don't want ever to go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, allow me to give you some advice,\" he says, placing his hand on the nurse's shoulder, his fingers pressed lightly against the pink skin beneath the frilly lace of the bodice. \"Stay away from Meade. He's what I like to call a bad egg. He lies. He tells stories. He brings trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus he's a sorcerer. He has no allegiance. In two years, he'll be away to another College and you'll never meet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two years... two years would make him the longest friend I ever had, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Well, anyway, it's your future. Just a little friendly advice,\" Peacocks relents with an airy shrug. \"Speaking of which, your breasts, are they lactating?\" Nathan stares wide-eyed, his face burning. \"I merely ask because you're supposed to be a wet nurse yet your dress is dry. I rather hoped it would be sodden by now. Don't think me crass but the rules do stipulate that the form be perfect, otherwise its five lashes, which I would hate to see. Allow me to help. You see, the trick is to simulate the stimulation of the infant. You should begin by massaging the breasts, as often as possible, to promote flow. Do it for me now please, so I can see you have it right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock savours the nervous awkwardness in the boy as he takes his swollen breasts in his hands and rubs them beneath the rough cloth. His large, dark, tender nipples stiffen, pushing out the fabric, and he blushes with shame, staring at the floor, the very picture of a Timid Wet Nurse. Peacock feels himself rising in his breeches, no longer able to hold himself back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps the problem isn't one of stimulation. Perhaps it is one of nutrition. May I ask if you're eating well? You look <i>very</i> thin, my poor boy. Are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starving, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a snake pouncing on prey, he leans closer, emerald eyes sparkling. \"In that case I must feed you.\" With one hand he reaches down to unbuckle the front of his trousers, freeing his turgid member from its confines. \"A sausage perhaps? Hot and juicy, fresh off the fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan backs away, glancing at the door, his hands falling to his sides. \"Actually, you know what, I think I'm not hungry,\" he says slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a moment ago you said you were starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well I lost my appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock's jaw tightens. His eyes seem to burn with dark green light. \"A lollipop then. A delicious-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry? I am offering these things to you and you insult me. Perhaps you would prefer going back to eating rat?\" Peacock sneers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegarding him with disgust, Nathan stands to leave. \"When I was homeless, I'd see men like you all the time. They thought they could make us do things because they were powerful and we weren't. But I didn't ever do anything they wanted, and I won't do what you want either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock rolls his eyes. \"What on earth are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm quarter goblin on my dad's side. I've got true sight. That means your glamour don't work on me. So you can put your dick away now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock startles to his feet, turning his body away from the student, fumbling desperately with the crotch of his trousers, spluttering explanations and excuses. Nathan steps closer to the door, light-headed, shaking, but resolute. \"You don't ever touch Meade again. And if you ever try that trick on me or anyone else -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do what!\" Peacock cackles. \"Nobody would ever believe you. I've taught here seventy years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But if they did they'd get a Light wizard in, and he'd tear your head apart getting to your memories. Then they'd lock you up forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock glowers at him, his once-beautiful face now ugly and menacing, his huge elven member still hanging half-limp from his trousers.</span></div></div>",

Nathan is transfixed, unable to look away, unable to move his legs that seem rooted to the floor.  Peacock chuckles, a deep, rich, rolling laugh that echoes around the empty room. The boy's resistance amuses him. It <i>excites</i> him. Unlike Wanton Slut, who succumbed to so little glamour with such ease, breaking him will be all the more satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little boy, you greatly underestimate the powers of an elven King.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<b>You have no memory of becoming a wizard. You only recall being a whore.</b>\" Peacock calmly croaks as his fingers explored the confines of Nathan's brain. Nathan desperately shivers, tears dripping from his eyes all the way down his chin, before dropping onto his large breasts with a patter. Nathan desperately clutches at his remaining memories, hoping to retain at least some semblance of himself. He hopes, he hopes, he hopes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan suddenly snaps his eyes open. As he looks down at his breasts, he noticed that the low-cut dress is slipping off. Hurriedly, he fixes it as he glances upwards and looks at his surroundings. He sees a wide room that is bare except for a weird man with long ears... and what seemed to be flaming eyes. Panicking, he wondered how he got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back, Nathan remembers his youth. As the only daughter of a poor family, she had to live on scraps of food each day, growing up malnourished all the time. This caused him to be quite a boyish girl in his youth, to the extent that he even referred to himself with masculine pronouns. His mother is a kind soul, and blessed him with love that he would not have received otherwise. His father... well, he didn't remember much of his father. In fact, he didn't remember him at all! It is fairly strange to Nathan. It seems like his father was there, present in his life, yet he cannot remember anything about him at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his childhood, he didn't have many friends. In fact, he didn't have any friends at all. For a girl, he was quite lonely. And the reason was evident, he was quite malnourished and poor. However, once he began to grow up, his breasts had begun to grow with him, resulting in massive mammaries. Despite his being malnourished, the result was that he was quite attractive, so he sold himself to a whorehouse to pay back his mother for everything she had done for him. That was the only way he could repay his gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while Nathan has been thinking about how he ended up in this place, his glance falls upon the elderly man with atrociously long ears. Hesitating, Nathan finally asks him, \"Um, excuse me sir, but how did I end up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock's smile breaks out into a full grin. He has finally broken the young boy's mind and has made him into a full-fledged and - not timid wet nurse - but rather wanton whore. He quickly fishes out his erect cock out of his pants as he commands, \"Get on your knees, whore! Suck this, slut, if you don't want complaints to your owner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan suddenly feels a tinge of fear. He does not know why he fears this man so, so he reasons that he fears the threat of the owner. Uttering a \"Yes, master\" Nathan quickly gets down on his knees and takes the long member between his lips. Expertly suckling on the massive dick, a ball of precum balls up as Nathan licks it off. Suddenly, the cock is forced out of his mouth as the elf further commands, \"Stand up and hands against the wall! Don't forget to lift that skirt while you're at it. Feeling that fear once more, Nathan has no choice but to obey the command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his hands against the wall, he could feel the massive shaft entering his plump pussy. Yelping in pain at the thickness, Nathan has no choice but to bite his tongue. Peacock proceeds to thrust his cock in and out rapidly with the joy of having conquered another unruly student. He smiles at the prank that he has set up for Nathan. It will be wonderful to see his progress a couple of months later. Deep in his imagination, he blows his load inside the pussy that Nathan has, but not before remembering to cast a fertility spell on his sperm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling to himself, Peacock withdraws his dick from Nathan's pussy, as the latter is red and raw from the brutal pounding that it has just took. Whimpering, Nathan tries to scoop the semen out of his vagina, as most of it cascades down his juicy thigh. <i>Too late</i>, Peacock thinks, <i>you're already going to father... *ahem* MOTHER a couple of bastards, since I also casted a quadruplet spell to make you deliver four babies. Those massive tits will finally be useful.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlapping Nathan's ass, Peacock orders him, \"You can go back now! Thank the owner for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan nods as he quickly runs out of the room, his breasts jiggling. Along the way, Nathan runs into Meade, who is waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for my inattentiveness. I'll pay attention next time!\" Nathan gets up as he breaks into a run again... or tries to, had Meade not grabbed him by the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nathan? Where are you going?\" Meade inquires, as he is puzzled by the fact that Nathan seems not to recognize him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, do I know you?\" Nathan questions as he tilts his head to the right. \"Oh, I know! You must have been a customer! I'll discount for you next time we meet! See you!\" And Nathan jogs off in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Meade stands there in a stupor. Nathan has truly not recognized him! Meade realizes that something must have happened between him and <i>master</i>... Peacock. Meade shakes his head. Since when did he start calling that blasted fool <i>master</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Meade is fearful of <i>master</i> Peacock, he thinks to the time he met Nathan. Sure, he might have not been the best person, but he is someone that Meade could rely on! Meade marches back into <i>master</i> Peacock's room and flings open the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you have done something to Nathan! Return him back at once!\" Meade scowls, trying to put on the most intimidating face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock glances up from a book that he is reading and says...</span></div></div>",

Name it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a minor thing really,\" Peacock purred. \"First, you will transform yourself into an animal. Something small, harmless, obedient. Then you will lower your mental wards and submit yourself to my will, to be bound by my magic to serve as my familiar for the rest of your life. Your sorcerous essence will flow into me, your strength will become my own. Once then, I will return your friend to himself. Unless, of course, you want such a promising young boy to live out his days down by the docks as a cock-hungry whore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeade's sagged. Master Peacock's offer was harsh, but fair. A life for a life. In the back of his mind, a part of him was screaming, raging against the fog of glamor that still numbed his thoughts. The part of him that was still free watched as he summoned his magic, his body shifting and shrinking, dwindling away into a beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock's hands were shaking as he set aside his book and swept across the room in his graceful Elven form. He could barely believe his luck - a sorcerer familiar was a prize beyond anything else. He crouched, stroking the fur of the little mongrel bitch that whimpered before his presence. She tried to slink away, tail low between her legs. He seized her tight, his eyes burning with light as he forced his thoughts into her head, delighting to find her mind utterly undefended, filled with simple animal thoughts of fear and flight that become increasingly frenzied as he pushed deeper, wrestling away control over her mind piece by piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcane manacles flickered into existence about her legs as the last of her resistance gave out, sealing the bond. Instantly he felt a rush as her sorcerous energy poured into him. He shuddered, revealing in the near-orgasmic high, drinking deeper until the poor, drained dog yelped in pain. He stood. The animal slumped, its doggy chest rising and falling in laboured breaths. Peacock chuckled giddily. He had almost taken everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked grin spread over Peacock's face, as he conjured to his fingers a crimson hellish flame, then transmuted his fingers into cold steel. The magic of all the Orders was his to command. Meade's spells, along with the rest of his knowledge and skills, were his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good dog,\" he crooned, patting Meade. \"Now, as for our arrangement, Nathan...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peacock smiled to himself. He had finally achieved his ambitions. And how easy it was too! All he had to do was toy around with a couple of amateur sorcerers and the prize was his. Naturally, he has no more use for Nathan, and could have easily left him as a whore serving cocks for the rest of his life, but that would be too easy. Peacock wanted to play with them even more and knew that the power of his familiar depended from its will. The more it struggled to escape, the more strength it would give him. And what better than to give hope to Meade by bringing back Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock expanded the limits of his mind to the maximum and searched all around the castle, and finally found him. Cowering in fright, Nathan was whimpering as he limped across the hallway of the castle, some of Peacock's elven seed dripping down his thigh. Peacock smiled as he mentally shouted, <i>Return back at once!</i> Using his mental vision, he saw Nathan flinch as he heard the voice, looking from side to side to see where it came from. Realizing that the voice must have been in his head, Nathan proceeded to head back to Peacock's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, Nathan saw Peacock jump up in anticipation as he lets loose his cock once more before letting loose a command, \"Suck it, whore!\" Leaving the submissive Nathan no choice, the latter had no choice but to drop onto his knees and once more suck on the massive member. This time, Peacock grabbed the back of Nathan's head and forced his dick into Nathan's mouth, dislocating his jaw in the process. As Nathan was knocked unconscious from the pain, Peacock proceeded to ravage his throat with his massive shaft, before finally pulling his cock out and letting his semen lose on Nathan's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what would have happened to this promising magician if you had not agreed to the deal?\" Peacock asks Meade as he casts a healing spell on Nathan's jaw. Meade could only whimper in reply, horrified by Nathan's prospects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But since I'm an elf who keeps his word, I'll turn your little friend back into a sorcerer if you so desire,\" Peacock gleefully says. Casting his spell once more, his fingers ravaged the inner mind of Nathan in the attempt to undo the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>You shall remember that you were a wizard once more. You will also not notice my seed on you once wake up,</b>\" commands Peacock as his tendrils were occupied in changing someone else's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a matter of time before Nathan wakes up and gets up, rubbing his jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, why does my mouth hurt so much,\" he murmurs with a sore throat. Noticing Peacock, he could only defiantly say, \"What are you done with your speech?\" Oblivious to the sperm covering his eyelids, he can only wonder as to why his vision was so blurry. \"And where did that little bitch come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his question, Peacock can only say, \"Indeed, you can go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot expecting Peacock to give in so easily, Nathan can only gape at him. However, that only lasted a second as Nathan smirked and said, \"Knew you couldn't do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nathan walked away, Peacock couldn't help but grin with all his might. What Meade and Nathan did not know was that the latter was impregnated, preventing him from turning back into a man until he birth. And once he gave birth, he would lose all his magic that he ever had, passing them on to his bastard children. <i>Serves him right</i>, thought Peacock as he turns to focus his attention on Meade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Nathan walked down the hallways, he couldn't believe how easily he obtained victory over the devious man. His true sight that he obtained from his father had served him well. Walking into his room into the dormitory, Nathan shouted, \"Hey Meade! You wouldn't belie-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words are cut short as he sees no presence of his new found friend. It was strange, Meade should have gotten back before him, yet he wasn't here. Racking his brains, Nathan thought and thought and thought... until he realized that the dog was Meade! Somehow, Peacock had gotten an advantage over him and forced him into his servitude. Realizing this, Nathan...</span></div></div>",

He felt a flicker of magic inside it. It was trying to transform back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah,\" he chided, snuffing the spell out before it had barely began. \"You forget yourself. That magic is mine now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the spell flared. He rolled his eyes. <i>Fine!</i> His slave wanted a transformation. it would get one without ending. Peacock willed the bond to reverse - no longer draining energy from the defeated sorcerer, he was channeling arcane energy into her, more than her small body could contain, filling her with jade magic, which spilled out of her mouth and eyes as emerald light, crackling over her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body swelled asymmetrically, her flesh splitting open. She hit the floor as her legs morphed beneath her into a hundred glittering centipede legs. The animal whine in her throat was cut off as her muzzle twisted first into a bird's beak, then a fanged maw lined with suckers. Spreading patches of fur, skin, scales and spines fought with each other across her body, while half-formed limbs bubbled-up and burst, splattering the floor with multicoloured blood and vital fluids. It tried to pull itself away on spider-legs and squid-tentacles, but soon its movements had degenerated into mere pained thrashings. It gibbered madly. Its amorphous surface was now covered in a hundred eyes and twisted mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mental command, Peacock cut off the torrent of magic completely, and the liquid pulsating flesh contracted inwards. He watched as the creature desperately tried to attain a stable, survivable form before the spell of transformation - now exhausted of energy - ran out. The multitude of eyes and mouths were swallowed up as it raced to form lungs, organs and a functional brain. It was aiming for something small and simple, whatever would use the least of the dwindling magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last sparks of Peacock's emerald magic dissipated from his slave. Meade had been unmade. A brown slug lay on the floor. It barely moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See where rebellion gets you, my darling,\" Peacock smirked. \"Take it from me, you should have been grateful to be a bitch. A dog takes joy in serving, as you would. A slug merely exists to be stepped on.\" He gave one of the eye stalks a poke. It retracted into the soft flesh. \"Another thing you will find is that a slug has barely any brain at all. So I would put out of your mind all thoughts of revenge. Concern yourself only with your memories. For like a cup that overflows, soon they'll start to leak out of that slimy skull, slip away when you're not looking. Two weeks I spent as a remora slug inside the fat folds of an Orc chieftan - it took me months to relearn language, years restudy all the knowledge I'd lost.

How could this be? The answer is simple: this was a half-elf, born of a human and an elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry, you know that I like tugging on them,\" replied the other boy who was currently preoccupied with his activity.

Had it really been 16 years? My, how time flies when you're having fun. His power and prestige had grown since acquiring his new familiar, granting him great status among the hierarchy of the college, allowing him to effective operate outside the rules. He had broken so many students since those days, quite publicly too, relishing in the scandal of each one. Yet the faculty hesitated to stop him, especially while he consistently turned out a healthy new brood of magic-capable offspring once he grew bored of his latest toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet these were the first of his bastards to come to roost. He swooped in, gripping the chin of the prettiest boy. \"Ah yes, I see the family resemblance.\" The boy squinted at him, confused. \"- the resemblance you share with your siblings, I mean. Tell me, how fares your mother? Busy, is she?

The class watched, discomforted by the display of affection between student and teacher, but they had heard of his reputation and none wanted to draw his attention, preferring rather to sink their faces into their textbooks. Peacock relished the power. These four half-elves could be his with a single letter to the headmagus' office, transferred from their studies directly into his harem if he desired it. But that was no fun. \"Well my beautiful Quimm, you and I and your brothers are going to have so much fun this year. Now your first lesson will be...\"</span></div></div>",

To be able to do it at a young age with no practice is quite frankly unheard of. Peacock takes another look at the quartet. If Gerard represented beauty, Richard represented strength, Quimm represented pride, then... Raimund represented intelligence. Peacock shudders. What power! If he manages to obtain him as a power source, he would become the greatest magician ever! However, it was only a ticking time spell, ready to explode and scar one's face. The danger from him was great and needed to be tamed immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock launches a mind control spell without haste.</span></div></div>",

He could put the pieces back together into something functional and less-drooly later at his leisure. It was a feat he'd managed dozens of times before, a routine procedure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind rebounded off Raimund's like hitting an iron wall. Shocked, he redoubled his efforts but was again rebuked. Blood dripped from his nostrils. Finally he threw everything he had at the boy, lashing out both psychically and physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last moment before the retaliation he realised his folly, that he wasn't assaulting one mind but four. His children were linked, even if they didn't know it, reinforcing each other mentally. Perhaps he could have managed it if he'd targeted one of the weaker ones first, like Gerard, but it was too late for that now. The iron wall become a iron vice, trapping him, crushing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried every trick in his book - threats, pleas for mercy using images of their loved ones, nightmare visions of torture and perversion that would have recoiled lesser minds, but these children had grown up in a brothel, there was little that could shock them now. With a final blow, Peacock's psyche was shattered into pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class erupted into gasps as their teacher crumbled apart into a dozen large black cockroaches which skittered for the walls. \"Smash 'em!\" cried Raimund, leaping over the desk and pulping two of them between his heels. His brothers and sisters joined him, and in moments all that remained were piles of brown goo and twitching insect limbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we get him all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard sprinted for the door and dived, scooping the final insect into his hands, which he dropped inside a pencil case and slammed shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother gasp as a naked man popped into life where Peacock's familiar had been. \"Blorp\" he said vacantly, as he squirmed along the ground. \"Blorp blorp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether the siblings gathered around the pencil-case from which came skittering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's dad?\" said Quinn. \"I say we smash him and be done with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" agreed Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't we get in trouble for killing a teacher?\" Gerard whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked to Raimund for guidance. </span></div></div>",

Is it Wanton Wet Nurse and Timid Slut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Nathan and realise that his words are true. This close to Peacock, his woman's body has betrayed him. He stands affixed, entranced, aroused, drinking in the sheer, potent masculinity that emanates from the Elven King like a stench. With one hand, he teases the engorged, dark nipples that seem to strain to escape the confines of his bodice, tweaking them through the rough fabric. His breathing comes in short, ragged gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze roving hungrily, Peacock chuckles, \"It seems the poor maiden is overcome by my presence.\" His eyes flit from his breasts to yours, drifting idly upwards to meet your gaze. \"Which raises the question, why aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFixed beneath his stare, you want to run but you dare not leave Nathan in the clutches of this man, and right now, transfixed as he is, you're not sure you'll be able to tear him away if you try.

He turns his aborted grope into a harmless flourish with all the fluidity and grace of an elf, such that even you questioned if he had indeed been reaching for the male member that still hangs between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe draws back. \"Tell me, what were you two scamps tittering about on the back seats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Tell me</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan's words tumble out of his mouth in a torrent. \"Meade was saying he doesn't like you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeacock gasps. \"Is this true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow a lump in your throat. <i>Why are you so scared of him, he's only a teacher.</i> Squaring your shoulders, setting your jaw, unaware of how silly these look in your new body, you stand your grown. \"I... I don't trust you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Trust'? Tsk tsk, slut. <i>I</i> am the teacher. Your trust -- your obedience-- is expected. It is you who must earn <i>my</i> trust.

She kisses her way up your body to suckle on your nipples, her fingers sliding over the soft folds of your womanhood as the wave of bliss slowly ebbs. Yet, as good as she makes you feel, something is missing. Her body does nothing to arouse you, and you find yourself longing to be penetrated, dominated, by something masculine.

He chuckles. \"Now no more hiding ugly surprises beneath your skirts,\" he instructs, and his words seem to lodge themselves in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sir, I won't, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good.\"</span></div></div>",

Tearing yourself away from his presence is like ripping your arm. You just want to stay there forever, staring into his entrancing elven eyes. Yet the two of you tremble at the thought of disobeying him, and obediently leave his classroom. Turning, you're at least rewarded by the knowledge that his gaze is firmly on <i>your </i>ass, not Nathan's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day, you and Nathan get to know each other better. In the Great Hall, you sit together and practice kissing for Peacock. In the common room, you lie entwined by the fire, running your hands along each others curves. Nobody treats it as odd, merely assuming that you're practicing your roles. Afterwards, you go to your rooms and strip, lying naked in the coarse bedding, teasing each other's bodies in preparation. Nathan's milk-swollen breasts are exquisitely sensitive, while Nate's touch is electric as he toys with your lower lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when you're both aching and dripping, Peacock swans into the cramped dorm. Your heart soars as he picks you first, spreading your legs and making you a woman. He pounds you roughly on the cold stone floor before moving on to Nathan. Then back to you. The stamina of his beautiful elven body is amazing - he fucks you both for hours until your pussy lips are red raw, and even then gets you both to suck him off one final time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, <b>don't speak a word of this to anyone</b>,\" he instructs as he pulls on his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master,\" you intone in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day is more of the same. You rise at dawn, eat breakfast in the Great Hall, then lectures. In the afternoon you study and in the evening you get fucked by your lord and master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, you awake bruised and sore, but jump out of bed nonetheless. You wolf down breakfast and race to lectures to be first there. You sit at the front, staring lovingly at Peacock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe beams at the class. \"Right! The two days are up, so that means the roleplay is over, you can all now return to your original bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you shift out of the body and persona of the wanton slut, the spell is lifted. </span></div></div>",

Many others had perplexed looks and whispered quietly with neighbors. You tried your best to hide your confusion. As Mr. Peacock returned to alphabetically calling names and assigning roles, you ask Nathan as casually as possible, \"What's a Taddol?\" It was a species that you had not heard of before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan shrugged first before answering, \"No clue.\" He gaze was fixed towards their teacher. He was clearly nervous about what his 'role' would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the teacher called, \"Snigguh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here sir!\" Nathan quickly answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Principled... Taddol.\" Mr. Peacock smiles briefly, before moving onto the next student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan turn to you, \"We're both Taddols, whatever they are. What are the odds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"I think its rigged. But, at least neither of us are a worried gremlin like that kid.\" you motioned toward one of the other students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan snorted. \"True.\" He pulled out one of his textbooks from his satchel, <i>Creatures and Other Various Things</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the most creative of books names.\" you commented as Nathan fingered through the apparent dictionary for creatures found in their world. He turned a couple of pages in the Ts section before finding the one they were assigned. You and Nathan both gasped at the picture depicted on the page. \"That's a Taddol. That's what we have to morph into?!\" You balked at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're going to become close friends.\" Nathan sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny.\" You stated, clenching your fist. You fought the urge to complain to your teacher. 'Its only two days.' you whispered to yourself. You begrudgingly turned to look at your roommate, soon to be body-mate. The Taddol was apparently a race that came from an unlikely paring between the brutish, dumb ettins and the graceful elves. \"We might as well write our character sheets the same.\" You and he then began filling them out, taking notes from the physiology described in the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the names had all been called and all the sheets completed, Mr. Peacock cleared his throat loudly to end the commotion. With all eyes on him, he started, \"Class, now is the time to take on your randomly assigned roles. Vivacious Nure-onna, start us off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivacious Nure-onna one of the students in the back row, Kendall Kelvin, stood up hesitantly. She looked older, probably because of the sharp glasses she wore. Her blonde hair was in a tight bun, not a strand out of place. \"Of course sir.\" Kendall smiled mildly before sitting carefully back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, No. Do not hide the changes. Embrace the change. Be the Vivacious Nure-onna.\" Mr. Peacock yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall jumped up startled. She instead sat on her desk, with her legs dangling off the edge. Kendall closed her eyes and you could see her focusing on the changes. Instantly, her legs began to grow longer. Kendall's shoes and socks ripped dematerialized as they were forced together. The skin and muscles began to interweave, taking on a deep jungle green like color. Scales quickly covered her now single appendage, finishing the transformation into a long snake-like tail. Her finally hair slipped from the bun and fell over her shoulders. As the last touch, she set her glasses down beside her and stuck out her extra long tongue. You noticed that the tip split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive.\" Mr. Peacock nodded approvingly. \"Now, who's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan quickly stood and roughly pulled you up with him. \"Come on. Lets get it over with.\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mr. Peacock could make some smart remark, you and Nathan wrapped your arms around each other, his right and your left, and pressed the sides of your bodies close together. You both closed your eyes and began focusing on the changes. First, you and he began to grow and quickly towered over your classmates. The arms you had wrapped around each other melted through your clothes and into each other's shoulders. Your sides were no longer pressed together as they had began to blend, closing the space between your heads. Your left leg and Nathan's right quickly vanished as they were absorbed. You quickly grabbed the desk in front of you to help your balance as there were only two legs supporting the body you now shared. The robes you had worn separately had now been carefully woven together to cover that body. Finally the more detailed part of the transformation began. Your heads began to reform, taking on each other's facial characteristics, making yourselves resemble twins. Each of your ears extended upward creating soft points, though not as defined as elves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class was stunned as they stared at the single Taddol before them. You and Nathan opened your eyes, having finished. You nervously drummed your fingers on the desk, very aware of everyone starring. Nathan pulled at the neck-hole of the robe you shared. The fabric was a little tight around both of your necks. From the front for the room, Mr. Peacock cackled loudly, breaking the silence. \"What's so funny?\" You yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a couple of moments for your teacher to gain control of himself. Stifling his chuckles, he said, \"Oh, you both completed a marvelous and complex transformation. Bravo.\" He clapped his hands lightly. \"However, you were not asked to be a single Taddol.\" He smirked. Some of the other students began to giggle under their breathes. You heard Nathan's lips part as he was about to speak, but Mr. Peacock spoke first. \"I applaud your earnest in challenging yourselves. I'm sure your two days together will be enjoyable, to say the least. Shall we carry on. Whose next?\"</span></div></div>",

A deep throbbing pain spreads out from your waist. With little warning your belt burst open and you grasp for the trousers with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers feel two hard bony structures just beneath the surface. Before your eyes, they thrust forward.... keeping going. As your eyes go wide, it feels like this will never end.

A wave of pins and needle runs up your neck and over your face, and crossing your eyes you see dappled grey hair sprouting from your nose. The nose itself swells before your eyes. Your teeth feel like they're growing too, swelling up like tombstones in a mouth far too small for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting your eyes to the pain, you listen to the crackle and pop of cartilage.

You have learned, I think, that there is no knowledge more important in the world to a wizard, than knowledge of his or her limitations.\" He raises his hands as if to clap. \"You have until the end of the week, when lessons begin, to reverse this.

The body you now inhabit feels nervy, tightly-wound, and it is a challenge keeping its rising animal panic from taking control over your human mind.

One week is a long time, no worries.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStamping restlessly, one of your hooves thuds against an upturned food trough half-buried in the hay with a ringing clang which echoes around the lofty stable.

Let alone a necromancer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispers and even a laughter could be heard from the other new students, while the professor grins and speaks up, 'Hello, students, and welcome to the newcomers to the grey order. I am professor Yamaw for thoses who doesn't know me, and will be one of your teachers for what i hope will be a fruitful study of seven years. Or the first one to burn you to a crisp.~ Accidents can always occur, after all.. But nevermind that, you will? We're not here to kill you, but to teach you the manners to living through the underestimate possibilities of the afterdeath. And.. Given some of you already lost focus.. Let me show a warning and possibility.. It could be quite painful, after all.~'.  She pulls the left sleeve of her robe off, revealing what looks like a bone arm, except you could swear it was stolen from a lizard. 'As you know, necromancy gives you potential control over flesh and bones, and.. If you got the need to remplace a limb off, you can seek Dr. 'Lizard arm', is which myself!'. She giggles. 'Know that i also have a knack for breaking bones.. Especially from unruly little idiots..~'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the new students, including you, weeps in fear, while most of the older ones prefers to dodge the professor's gaze, visibly not really tempted to try their luck, or to feel her wrath. Eventually, your fear change into apprehension, as you grab the stub of what was left of your left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were younger, you had quite the cold personality, while not quite disobedient, you weren't certainly among the most prudent, so much you strained where you shouldn't.. One day, you cot attacked by a hungry feral wolf. Given you managed to flee before he'd jump on you, your wound weren't directly mortal, but you wouldn't have survived, if it was for the lucky apparition of an undead that punched and made the wolf flee. It was controlled by a mage in grey, and even if he didn't quite smelled good, he still took the time to fleshcraft what was left of your arm, so it wouldn't bleed or infect. You wondered back then that why he didn't used your arm, given the wolf didn't quite managed to eat it away, but you suppose that it was stolen by the same mage that helped you..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor speaks up, 'Alright all. Here's the main rules. And quoting them back would certain not harm anyone: No harming the standing undeads nor living beings, outside of duels and certain circumstances. No reanimation with souls without authorization. Soulless constructions and golems are, on the other hand, fine, as long as the first rule is respected. And no rituals, even if you might eventually learn more about thoses. Especially the lich ritual. Thoses are exclusively reserved for grade 6 or higher, and never, <i>*EVER*</i> within the college. We are respecting a certain neutrality, and if you are caught disregarding our neutrality and/or rules, you risk getting excluded without further notice, and might get into painful situations. Like me breaking your bones.~ I heard broken limbs are the best way to make a human scream..~'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the older students mutters, 'Lizard arm struck again, distilling fear in the newcomers..'. The visage of the professor harden up, like she was angry, 'What did you said?'. 'N-nothing!'. 'I prefer that~. Now, fellow students, guide the newcomers to the storage, the class still start soon.'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students move out, and you were about to, too, when the professor stops you, 'Not you. Not now.'. A chill goes through your spine, 'Y-yes, professor..?'. 'I've notice that you lost an arm. And given you're not skilled enough to repair it yourself, i'm willing you help you, this once. And don't worry.. I won't harm you. Yet~'. 'T-that's kind..'. The professor giggles, then leads you aside. 'You can refuse if you want. And if you want, i can pick parts for you. Your arm will be as good as new!'. 'A-and what if i want to choose..?'. 'Your choice.~'. 'Even an arm like your..?'. 'Oh, sure, cutie!~ But regardless of what you do, you'll follow class like the others!'. 'Y-yeah..'.</span></div></div>",

'Are you sure that you want such? Given how your arm is, i would have no other choices but to actually amputate the rest of your arm. The point of an arm is to be able to use it, like it is part of your body. We could always undo it and fleshcraft you an arm, but that would be only a waste.'. 'Y-yeah.. I accept.'. You pull the floaty sleeve over from your stub, showing it, ready for being taken off. The professor giggles and taps you gently on the head, 'No need to be so hasty..'. 'E-eh..?'. 'I see that you've made your choice, but before we do something stupid, let's <i>*at least*</i> pick what would be your new member, okay, cutie?~'. 'S-sure..!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor leads you toward one of the crypts, 'Know that they is actually more crypts than needed, for educational reasons. We are keeping them organized in a  manner that would imitate what would potentially occur in reality. After all, in the midst of a fight, or depending in the situation, you might be forced to adapt.'. 'W-why are you saying me that..?'. 'Don't mind it too much, the other students are being told that too. It allows us to cultivate a certain spirit of initiative.'. 'R-right..'. 'Heh. Don't worry. You'll get over it.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are lead toward one of the crypts and lead inside. And two things surprise you: No particular smell wafted from it. And it was full of a mishmash of bones of all kind, scattered in a completely random manner. Yamaw says, 'Here we are! I'll let you rummage around a bit, to see how you fare.'. You grumble. You could barely know what bone <i>*might go onto*</i> but you couldn't tell the difference most of the time. Carefully, you search, through the mass. Cautiously given you know that the precarious structures might crumble away, and that some of the bones are potentially sharp, like ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some tedious attempt of getting the bones you wanted, you ended up with a pile of bones, unaware of what you picked, excluding a draconian skull in perfect shape, and a large claw. Or teeth. You couldn't tell.. Then, you show off your 'findings' to Yamaw, which laughs. 'Heh. I guessed as much. Doesn't matter as of yet, but you've.. Completely failed. None of thoses bones, excluding the skull, are even remotely close to lizards.'. She weaves with her hands, and pulls all your findings, aside from the claw(or teeth) and the skull, back in the pile, before she pulls off more bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Yamaw says, 'Brace yourself..'. 'W-why-..!?'. She suddenly grabs your stub, through the fabric of your robe, and forcibly fleshcraft it, making your shoulder explode. The pain sent you reeling, as you hold your bloodied remainings of where stood your shoulder. Yamaw giggles, 'Oops. Too strong. My bad.~ Now, let me make your new arm..'. She grabs the bones, one by one, and builds up the arm, with an assured hand, infusing some necromantic mana into it to keep it whole, ending up by fleshcrafting our new shoulder, attaching the new member to your skeleton, rather painfully, as you urk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamaw says, 'Thereee.. Try to move it.'. You tentatively do so and.. Notice it feels almost natural, like you were born with it. The bone arm, much like Yamaw's, had a hand ending in three claws, but unlike her, you had the feeling you could still use to hold things and do similar actions.. Noticing that you still had the claw thing and the skull, you ask, 'Can i try to.. Use thoses?'. 'Sure thing!'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start with the claw, holding it with your skeletal hand, and holds it onto the back of your hand. Trying to imitate Yamaw, you channel some mana into the bone and where it stands, painfully forcing the base of the teeth to dig into your flesh, fusing it up with the bones of your hands, before you repair your skin up, as best as you can. You move your hand around, playing with your fingers, happy with your work. Then, you pick the skull. Not wanting to tempt your luck by changing your own human skull, you first separate the draconic skull in two, in the middle of the maw into two horizontal parts. Then, you place the parts around your head, modifying them so it'd fit, before fusing both part in a helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatiently looking, Yamaw finally says, after you finish your work, 'Interesting work. Just be careful with your new hands. Now, let's head back in the classroom. The students probably made their picks by now.'. 'Yes, miss!'. 'Just call me Professor Lizard arm..~'. 'O-okay Professor Lizard arm..'.</span></div></div>",

You only had a second to catch your breath before being dumped again. You got a small bit of the water inside, it tasted horrible, the water being used by everyone. But you had to keep your mouth shut, otherwise you would take more water. Vadicus then pulled you up again and then slammed you down in the toilet again, hitting your head. He then made you circle around so fast you almost threw up. Then with a shot you rose again from the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have class in a few minutes so this will be it for today, but don't worry I will end this with a bang.\"  He shot you through the air again, you waited for a moment and then you fell in the other toilet which even reeked worse. You felt the water getting inside you, you had to get out. You pulled but your head was stuck, panic struck you as you didn't want to end it like this. Then you suddenly felt being pulled, the person grabbed your wrists and pulled you out of the toilet. It worked as you head finally got free and landed right on your butt. <br>\r\nYou spew out the water, coughing as you turned around to thank your savior. But nobody was there, only a trail of water going outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up again a little wobbly after being held down that long. You wring out your robes; water pouring out of them. This wasn't what you expected at a college. You were sure that of the one of the six-hundred sixty-six people having magic they wouldn't be bullies. And even worse that of the one of the six-hundred sixty-six that had magic you had to have it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never knew your parents, if you would you would have stopped them taking you here. You were raised in an orphanage, always being the oddball they were happy to see you away. You didn't even knew which race your parents belonged too, you think as you look in the mirror. You look almost human, except for the ears. The elven pointed ears, the ears that made you a target for Vadicus. It was the first moment that you two met, he had his eyes on you. Day after day you would endure his bullying; nobody would intervene.The rumors were his father was the second most powerful wizard the and nobody wanted to find that out for true. Thanks to that you didn't have many people hanging around with you. Everybody was afraid they would be bullied next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you felt special. When you were brought in you had to take a couple of tests to determine to which College you would go. The wizards were surprised that your skills with magic was good on every flank, all of the Colleges would want you. You chose the Light Order so you would learn enough magic to hide away those ears, but after today you knew what you want to learn. \"One day I'll transfer Vadicus his soul to something so unpleasant for him and then I'll teach him something.\" You promised yourself holding up your fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, you saw your bag on the ground. It wasn't damaged luckily. You toss it over your shoulder as you think about what you'll do now. Class was starting in a few minutes, if you would run you could make it. On the other hand your robes were still wet, going to your room to change was also an idea. </span></div></div>",

You were now about to hit the good stuff, after a few weeks of theory now was the week of practice. You couldn't wait, a little bit closer to your dream. You sprint away, going through the castle's hallways. Actually it was a bit bigger than a castle, or at least the castle in the neighborhood of the orphanage where you grew up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou liked how big the place was, there was so much to discover. It also made sure you could try to avoid people. People like Vadicus, you still don't know how he found you that morning. You were sure nobody saw you sneaking into the toilets. But when you were done you still walked into Vadicus with that smile on his face. It wasn't that pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the door to your class; everyone was seated already. Even your professor was here already, professor Walmut. But everybody called him professor Nut, his beard was in the shape of a nut. Everyone asked him why he had done that, but he just said it was an illusion everyone had to know by the end of the year. The first year was more based on illusions and a little bit of soul tinkering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mead sit down.\" Nut just said not looking away from his textbook. You hoped to avoid his glance, but it seemed he just knew it. You watched as everyone stared at you when you walked by them. You sat down in the back of the class; it was the only spot left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now since everyone is here, Nut looks at you, we can begin the lesson. In the first few weeks we all discussed the theory which I think is good enough. But the college thinks we should practice too. Nonsense, I say, better you go out and try it yourself. Best wizards are made that way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But since it's been decided for me, I'll go along with it.\" Nut just sighted. \" Now I want to see what you can do.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody was looking at each other, they thought Nut would show them and they just copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's going to get first?\" Nut said impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody said anything, you wouldn't want to go either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since nobody volunteers, I'll pick one.\" He travels down the aisle as he looks at everyone's faces. Then he stops at you. \"You Mead, show us what you can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at him for a second, then he snaps his fingers and the chair disappears, being replaced with a stool. You were just sitting at the front of the chair, so you fall down your butt. You stand up quickly and hurry to the front of the room, you heard rumors Nut would cast an illusion on unwilling students who were too slow, being chased by a dragon was not that attractive to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand in front of the class you wonder what kind of illusion you should create. There were different types. There were for examples area illusions, which would make the surrounding area into something else. Or object/people illusions, which would make objects or people appear. People illusions were even capable of getting a personality. And then replace illusions, to disguise something as something else. It would be even more difficult than normal illusions, as you had to hide the original. You wonder what kind of illusion you had to go for. Or perhaps you could show them the bit of soul tinkering you studied. You decide on... </span></div></div>",

Get something into it.\" Nut suddenly says. You look around and see the others snickering as you were staring into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then try to concentrate. The spell was big, you had to say the magic words while thinking about everything inside the room at the same time. The only reason why the spell worked that one time you thought was because you were so busy studying you almost wished you were back there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll demonstrate in front of you the area illusion spell.\" You tell the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will never work.\" A boy you recognize as great Joseph shouts in the class.

Let us see it Mead.\" Nut said silencing the class again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrate and recall the spell, you speak out the words and wave with your hands and close your eyes.

Her waist could be seen and just as you imagined it in the book, Anne's waist was looking soft yet stern. Her face had undergone some changes as well, you were delighted to see she had pointy ears. Her bone cheeks were more visible, her mouth, eyes and hair were just the same although her hair looked more golden.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work Mead.\" Nut said coming forward.

But Mead was demonstrating a copy illusion spell in front of us which requires a wizard to undo it himself, otherwise it will still remain there.

Sadly his arms weren't covered in feathers so he hit the ground very hard. The whole class had to laugh about it, even Nut had a little smile on his face as he saw his worst student hitting the ground very hard. One of the boys even had a worm with him which he fed to Jean. To all your amazement Jean just swallowed the worm whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive Meade, Nut said as he instructed two students to hold Jean as Nut performed the spell to extract the bird essence. \"Normally the soul who was transferred inside would be considered the weakest and would pass the host it's soul.

This time in a good way to be said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class is finished Nut is holding you back and makes you promise not to use that spell again.

You don't see the reason why they couldn't just build it bigger. The castle is build on an ancient pool of magic, the place just glows of magic, allowing students to tap even deeper into their magic. But it wasn't the safest place always outside and inside.

You could always use it, and so you tear off the page from the journal and stuff it in your pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are about to leave you look at the different cages, perhaps you could take a look at the different species.

You are about to make your way when you see Vadicus coming round the corner of the hallway. You are almost afraid he will see you, but he doesn't give you a look at all as he goes to the nearest bathroom. This would be a good opportunity to get back to him for the things he did to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do? You think.</span></div></div>",

Strange, why would the ceiling be blocked off while the door was open. You quickly look down where you are. It seems like the common room for the girls. You saw a few girls practicing their magic, others were chatting in a corner with each other while others were sleeping off.  You have to admit it's a lot cleaner here than by the guys, there are even a couple of vases with flowers. In the corner of your eye you spot the washrooms. You grin perverted as it was the ideal spot to see the girl in their natural habitat. You make your way over until you suddenly hear your name being spoken by some of the girls.

The washroom door opened and a couple of mean looking girls were coming through. From their looks on their faces you know they meant business.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It started a week ago, on the eve of the harvest festival - now there's a cruel joke. A strange blight came across the crops. The plants, they were corrupted, wilting and rotting before our very eyes. By the morning, our entire harvest was nothing but filth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It affected everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye! Turnips, 'taters, corn... It's not unknown for one crop to suffer, maybe two, but not all of them and never so fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were they duped?\" you ask. It was common for con men to target these outlying settlements. They would use a rudimentary spell to duplicate a wagon of seed, then sell it cheap to unsuspecting farmers. The seed would grow just fine for a while, until the life-sustaining magic that had created them faded. The crop would swiftly die, often leaving the farmer in dire straights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua's bushy white eyebrows twitch at your half-accusation. He avoids your gaze. \"N-no. No no. They were good crop seed from last year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a slight sigh, like a disappointed parent. The elder is many times your age, but you could be four hundred years old for all he knows, an impression you like to reinforce. \"Joshua, need I remind you it is a criminal offense to lie to a wizard going about his duties. Were the seeds you used to grow these crops legitimate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... were assured by the Goblin-\" he mutters quietly, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Goblin's word is worth even less than their wares; you must know that.\" Another sigh and a stern glare. \"I should hope you haven't brought me all this way on a mere matter of faulty grain, Joshua. Do you have samples of the blight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My granddaughter does- Ilia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman steps forward. Like all the people of this village, she has a plain face, with dull brown hair cropped short and a thin, wiry body, though she looks better fed than the others. A piece of silver glitters around her neck. It is the symbol of the Goddess; the same symbol, you notice, that adorns the surface of a clay pot that she pushes into your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits back and watches you closely with an expression of open distaste, her eyes flitting occasionally to the bowl in your hands. With a smile, you realise she is expecting your unholy body to burst into flames at the merest touch of her holy symbol. These religious types always do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting the bowl in your hands to shift around the blighted ears of corn that sit in it, you can see nothing out of the ordinary. They are shriveled, with brown-black kernels like rotten teeth and leaves that are dry and yellow as old parchment. \"This appears to be regular blight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-but it didn't spread like it!\" Joshua exclaims, growing agitated. He can see he is losing you. \"It was fast... faster than anything I've ever seen before. Faster than we could tear it out. Faster than we could burn it. It was unnatural! You have to believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you,\" you assure him. But you don't. He has a desperate look to him. This is a remote village, a reclamation project settled less than forty years ago when the then-King decreed an program of rebuilding the lands lost to the creeping wild. It has no wealth and few neighbors to trade with if it had. They are relying on you to report back to your superiors with a conclusion of occult interference, which would necessitate that their liege lord deliver aid to see them through the winter months. If not, the blame will fall squarely on their shoulders and they will be left to fend for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut backwaters like this are always losing their harvests and involving the church or the study with false claims, tying up much needed manpower. Normally a wizard wouldn't have been sent this far out on so trivial a matter, but since this is your first case they're starting you off small. Besides, there's a nuance to their claim, an additional fact that is worth a cursory investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was something else to your story. Tell me about these shadow creatures,\" you request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've been seen around the village for months now,\", Ilia interjects before Joshua can speak. \"They were in the fields the night before the crops died, dozens of them. Nobody dared go out there, except me. They're like smoke. You can only see them when they move, and only out the corner of your eye; they disappear when you look at them straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they appear to be doing anything in the fields? Were they interfering with the crops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were doing the work of demons,\" she says bluntly. \"Drawing hellrunes in the soil. Polluting our land with magic. And I fail to see what a wizard can do to help. This isn't a job for a wizard. They should have sent a priestess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ilia...\" the elder tries to quiet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they should! A priestess could consecrate the ground in a day. Magic isn't any use against magic. It only makes things worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ilia, stop!\" Joshua gasps. \"Aye, a holy woman <i>could</i> clear the blight, but what good is that to us with winter at our doorsteps and our stores empty? With magic we can replace what we've lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid conjuring food is not the reason I'm here,\" you interject, keeping your voice level, even while smarting from the suggestion that your powers, years of training and finite toll be spent on such menial work. \"These shadows, however,<i> are</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

Ilia hesitates at the edge of the corruption, clutching at her necklace for comfort. You have to pull your cloak up over your nose to get closer, but even still your throat burns and your eyes water. Fat, black flies hit your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colours are inverted: the crops and hedgerows reduced to brown stumps while the soil is bile green, with the consistency of cream cheese. Where you stand, a few feet from the edge of the corruption, the soil is healthy and brown, a transition far too sudden to be natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where you saw the shadows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia shakes her head and points out across the fields to the epicenter of the blight. You figured as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a standard mark of corruption,\" you choke out. \"Area of effect, maybe half a mile radius. Standard... standard stuff. Should just be a case of erasing the mark. Right... uh... here goes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tentative step forward and your foot sinks deep into the soft soil, dragged down with wet slurps of escaping swamp gas. In a moment, you're up to your knee. You try to pull free but your leg might as well be set in stone for all the good it does you. Your free leg scrapes deep grooves in the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia's arms slide under your armpits. Your combined effort wrenches you free, though not your boot which is swallowed up by the fettid earth. \"Mother protect us,\" Ilia gasps as the two of you land on your backs. \"They said wizards were supposed to be smart. What was your plan, to walk across?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corruption penetrates deeper into the topsoil than you thought. You reconsider your approach. From the air perhaps?

Down to your underclothes, you unsheath the wand, holding it awkwardly with the toes of one foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may want to look away, my lady,\" you say to Ilia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems unperturbed by the sight of you standing there, near naked and shivering, and folds her arms with a stubborn look. \"I've delivered babies before, you know. Baby boys. It's nothing I haven't seen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, my lady,\" you smile, willing the spell into life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the briefest moment, you hang in the air, caught halfway between human and animal, joints twisted into hideous conformations, every inch of skin blistering with erupting feathers, fingers shrunken to nubs, lips swollen into a soft, fleshy beak. It is a brief moment, but enough to make her lose her dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you to look away,\" you laugh, but all that comes out is \"Squaawk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wobble unsteadily on your new legs, adjusting quickly to the form's centre of balance as you were trained. Happy that the wand is clutched securely in your talons, you flap your broad wings and rise (a little awkwardly) into the air. You've never really loved bird forms, disliking their weak, fragile bodies and alien, malicious minds, but the feeling of flight is an undeniable pleasure. Rising higher, you barely even feel the flies, now the size of tennis balls, that batter against your wings and head.

Unlikely, considering the small settlement has a priestess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurnt out fire elementals holding on as smoke on the wind. It would not explain the shadows but not the blight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemon souls pushing through reality from the other side, manifesting as hazy figures. Possible. But again the presence of a priestess should ward away such incursions, assuming she is performing her rituals right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFetchlings? Nah. Fetchlings weren't malicious but they were mercantile. If they saw starving villagers, they'd be selling them food by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheap seed and jumpy villagers. You underline that one with your stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the miserable landscape, grey clouds are rolling in. Away from the village a dip in the land shields the fields from the weather. Villagers mill about the edge of the rotten brown expanse as if lost. Some are even splitting open the decayed husks as though expecting to find ripe grain inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whitish gown of the priestess draws the eye. Ilia is marching towards the field, dragging a lanky youth behind her. He seems bemused and brow-beaten, carried along by her harsh tongue more than her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop whining and drink this,\" she snaps, pushing a bowl of something to the boys lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe obeys. Annoyingly, whatever he's offered is clearly much stronger than the swill given to you, as the lad immediately staggers as if drunk. The priestess lifts a handful of dirt, smearing it down his cheeks and forehead. She straightens a chaplet of green grass on her head and begins to incant, though sounding to stammer and fumble some of her lines. Taking the addled boy by the hand, she leads him between the rows of withered crop, discarding her gown as she goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe specifics of such things lie beyond your area of expertise, but you recognise a pagan fertility rite when you see one. The old ways still hold sway in these remote lands. You raise a flagon to the lad's good fortune, assuming that the priestess isn't required to kill him upon consummating the ritual. Evidently you didn't raise it high enough - a minute later, Joshua is racing towards the field, bellowing his daughter's name. As he dives in after the pair, a thick black cloud of flies feasting on the decay buzzes into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlies, you write in the dirt, driving the stick in as the fullstop. Frightened villagers mistaking a swarm of flies for shadow figures. That's all this is. The others will mock when they learn the details of your first mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the fields comes the sound of coitus interuptus of a sort, as Joshua bellows, \"Ilia! No! Not the baker's boy! Got off him right now! What will your grandmother think?!\" and Ilia begins screeching at him like a banshee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't finished yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're finished <i>now</i>, young lady! Remove yourself from... his person at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't stop me!\"</span></div></div>",

Discarding it quickly - you simply toss it aside onto the ground - you stand up stretching your limbs, feeling as if though you had just went through a petrifying spell. It seems that the crops are not the only thing that is a disaster in this town, they need better craftsmen as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStroking your chin - your beard still hasn't sprouted yet - you ponder whether you should instantly hop into the saddle of your horse and gallop all the way to the capital. After all, it's just a swarm of flies and a regular blight here. These villagers are simply wasting your time and you do not care whether they die out or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, your fellow graduates...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember your time at the academy's graduation. Drunk on success - and on fine wine - you boasted about how your first mission will be a grandiose adventure, filled with magic battles, demons, and charming women. You hold your head within your hands. How could you have done such a shameless act?! How can you now return back like this? You'd be laughed out of the city by your peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, a wizard must do his duties, even if it's only for his own sake. Perhaps you would stumble upon something mystical and solve that instead? It certainly would up your reputation quite a bit. You steady yourself as you hear the door opening, with accompanying shrieks. Joshua slowly trots in, dragging Ilia by her arms as she kicks her legs and squirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of me! I will solve our village's problems, not this blasted wizard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut your mouth!\" Joshua yells angrily at her, turning to get a brief look at you, hoping you aren't offended. \"Get back in the kitchen. Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia stomps her foot, visibly irritated, but obeys her father as she moves to her household duties, cursing under her breath while rubbing her arms. It seems that her grandfather's influence still remains, albeit barely. He turns to you, sweating beads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why don't you stay here for the night? We will have soup ready for you and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you. I'd best be going,\" you tell as you roll your eyes. He definitely desperate. Probably hiding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, please, stop---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not get me wrong, old man. I must see what all these nightly creatures are all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua visibly relaxes as he slumps his shoulders, relieved that you aren't planning to leave. Unfortunately for him, you aren't planning to help either, as you have already come to the conclusion that the harvest failure is solely the result of the villagers' negligence. Dark shadows? Blight is too fast? What ridiculous nonsense. It's quite obvious that they are trying to con you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading outside - the sun is already setting - you look around as you head to the fields... or rather, the forest behind the fields. If there is anything to find in this backwater region, it would be there. Walking at a slow pace - flying is solely restricted for combat purposes to conserve mana - it takes you around an hour to reach the place. The sun has already set, so visibility is low, but that's nothing to a wizard like you. Lighting a small flame on the tip of your index finger, you enter the dense forest, hoping for adventures, and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that you are out of luck. As you walk through the woods, it becomes quite obvious that only small animals, like squirrels and birds, actually live here, and that you will not engage in any battle with a mythical monster tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curses!\" You scream as you tumble into a river. As it was too dark, you didn't notice the cliff end beneath your feet, and you tumble into the river below. Why are you so unlucky today? Feeling extremely nauseous, you slowly wade out of the river. Luckily, you reach the shore, as your little flame was extinguished by the gushing water. Hmm, you really are feeling light-headed right now. Did you catch a cold...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally on the shore, you decide that it is time to head back to the village, when suddenly something flickers on the edge of the cliff, which is illuminated by moonlight. A shadow! And it is a big one too. It quickly disappears, but you quickly give chase as well. Rounding the corner of the cliff, you are astonished to find...</span></div></div>",

Drawing your wand from the heavy, sodden folds of your clothing, you point it into the deep darkness. \"Who goes there! Show yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twig snaps to your left. You spin around, barking the wands command word. A dozen bright flachettes burst from the wand's tip, turning night briefly into day and an innocent bush into green confetti. Seeing movement in the brief flash of light, you turn and fire again, blasting the lower part of a tree into splinters. The upper half crashes down. As the noise fades, you can hear only the blood pounding in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Remember your training. Control your breathing. Think rationa-AAH A GHOST!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtop the cliff rises a shadowy figure, raising its arms and uttering a bloodcurdling \"wooOOOoooOOO.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fire wildly, taking chunks out of the cliff but catching the monster in the torso. It collapses with an all-too-human cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks as you climb the cliff. Joshua is laid out in the dirt. The brown hessian blanket around him has been shredded, along with most of his chest. The blood is pouring out between his fingers. \"It's all my fault,\" he sobs. \"I was the one who dealt with the goblin. I knew better but we had so little money. Now the village starves because of me.\" With every word, more blood trickles down his lips. \"I thought if I could get you here, make you think there was a monster, that you would be able to help,\" he says bitterly. \"Ilia was right about your sort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ilia, of course. A priestess can heal you!\" you cry with hope. But as you turn to scramble back down the cliff, Joshua snatches at your clothing. The blood soaks through to your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please stay. I don't have long left, and I... I don't want to die alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can be fast,\" you say desperately. He shakes his head. \"Why would you want me to stay? I just shot you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beggars can't be choosers, I suppose... Now there's a life summed up,\" he chuckles grimly. His weak fingers slip away and he sinks back, staring up at the moon, no longer even caring to stem the bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears of training never prepared you for this. You pat his shoulder, searching for something comforting to say. \"The, um, journey doesn't end here, I guess. Death is just another path... or something. One that we all must-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua closes his eyes. \"If I pretend to be dead, will you let me die in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while you just sit there in silence, his breathing getting weaker and weaker until it has almost gone. Then suddenly you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joshua.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">...not yet...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps there is something we can do. You know.... to save the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">...talk faster, boy...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, like you said, if I can show that there was a monster here, your lord will be expected to send aid as recompense. I can use my magic to change you, make you into a hideous beast, just before you die! Something really dangerous! Then I can skin you and take your hide back as proof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>...I don't want to die a monster...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll die a hero, Joshua! You'll save the village!\"<i> And I'll look totally awesome carrying your terrible, monstrous hide through the college gates</i>, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua gives something between a groan of disgust and a death rattle. \"Aye... alright, do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glimmer of arcane energy flows down your arm. Placing your hand on his chest, you will it into him. He shudders. The mangled flesh beneath your palm starts to soften and bubble like warm candle wax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now focus, Joshua. Think of the most terrible creature you can think of and fix it in your mind. Now start to move towards it. Feel yourself flowing into it, becoming it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt works! The frail malrnourished human form of the village elder becomes less distinct with each passing moment, ripening with thick musculature and sprouting terrible claws and tusks. You can practically see his bestial skull hanging over your fireplace already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a single tear rolls down his cheek and his monstrous lip quivers. \"<i>Ilia, my sweet daughter... Let my last thoughts be of you...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Focus! Don't think about her! Think monster thoughts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is too late.

You would probably incite a war, filled with carnage and brutality. A war that you yourself would have to participate, and would probably die in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">mmm</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look downwards at the stirring figure. It... can't be. He's <i>alive</i>?! How is this even possible...? You are sure that you have just been holding a limp figure in your bare hands, completely motionless and lifeless. How?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... is this... heaven...?\" The figure slowly opens its eyes, as the blonde eyelashes flutter while the blue eyes lazily wander around, searching for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You should know that heaven is a construct of the Church. The truth is much more harsh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... so Ilia was wrong about it after all... ha ha...\" The figure laughs as it slowly closes its eyes, drooping the lids in the process. You begin counting on your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the figure snaps open its eyes and jerks its head up, as its blue eyes look wildly all over you. You look down at your hands with seven fingers pointing outwards. Took it a little longer than you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. It's me. The one who shot at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... that means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. You're alive, and well, it seems... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">unfortunately for me</font>,\" you mumble the last part quietly, without the chance for Joshua to hear you. Your eyes trail downwards to look at the fairly sizeable breasts, as you feel your massive man meat, still wet and cold from the river, forming a tent in your pants, as you try to subtly shift it downwards. Noticing, Joshua follows your gaze... and gasps. His now slender arms begin to prod his hefty breasts, moaning from the new sensitivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... what... this is... boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. It's as you think.\" You say sourly, as you use the distraction in his attention to bring your dick up between your leather cuirass and your woolen underwear, wincing from the pain. You hear a shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH ME, BOY?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDainty fingers grab the cuff of your robe, slightly shaking you as Joshua furrows his brows to look intimidating. Unfortunately for him, his pretty face only looks part intimidating, and it's a very small part indeed. The rest of it looks as if it is begging you to blow your load all over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of me.\" You growl as Joshua winces, hesitantly withdrawing his hands. \"As to the question, how in the curses would I know?! Why do you look like a demonic elf anyways? Elves don't have claws - or in your case - sharp nails. What use would it be to them? And those... canines? They don't eat meat at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought wrong. I know myths have been circulating around these parts from the day of old, but how could the stories be that convoluted with nonsense. Who told you that anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... my father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well, fortunately for you, it seems that you have the regeneration of an elf as well. Congratulations. You'll get to live thousands of years in this forest all alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...All... alone...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the vil...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to scare the tarnation out of them and have them call in more aid and actually hunt you down? I wouldn't recommend that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ilia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...is a priestess. They're demanded to kill elves and other unholy beings on sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elven figure in front of you flaps her lips, unsure of what to say. Nodding to yourself, you begin to walk away. Seems this mission was a complete bust. You'll probably be laughed out of the city by your colleagues, but what can you do about it? All you have to do is report to your superiors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel arms wrap around you, large breasts pressing into your back, and nipples poking out and rubbing all over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear short sobs behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't... I don't want to be alone... I'm scared to be alone... Please don't leave... Please... Please take me with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt. Joshua has already caused more trouble for you than what you've bargained for, but you have always been a softy for teary girls. Damn! You think about what you should do. He'll probably cause you even more trouble later on, but you kind of feel like a scumbag. It's kind of your fault for suggesting the idea anyways.</span></div></div>",

You will need a companion, will you not? Somebody to be beside you in the dark hours of the night. To watch you while you sleep. An escort, if you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heat beats faster, and wicked thoughts dance through your head. Thoughts of having Joshua down on his hands and knee, using his long ears like reins on a horse as you ride his elven from behind. And he did say he wanted to be \"trained\". Imagine what you could do with him over a few decades. Before long you he would become a submissive immortal slut all of your own, there to be fucked for century upon century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, stepping closer, barely able to stop yourself from tearing the ragged remnants of the clothing from that body and doing him here on the forest floor. \"Mmm.

Truth be told I don't even know if I could bring myself to hurt another man but it seems to me that one <i>look</i> at this ferocious body would discourage most attackers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks to you hopefully, the light of the moon reflecting in his big, teary eyes and you groan. \"Fine,\" you say sullenly. \"I'll take you under my protection to the capital.

I can hardly return to the village with you in them. After all, you were the monster that killed him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Joshua</i> died bravely trying to subdue you. Were it not for him, I might never have caught you. He died a hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua's lip quivers and tears spring again to his eyes; perhaps he realises his old life is over, that he will never return to his friends and family. He nods and begins to strip slowly. \"Can I still wear this?\" he asks, gesturing to the simple hessian-sack he had used to create the 'shadow figure'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegrudgingly, you nod. His clothes you tear into long strips and use to bind his wrists. Your frustrated dick had almost given up hope, but twitches into life as you craft a crude leash out of the longest piece and a collar to tie about his slender neck. \"Now remember, you're my prisoner so you do as I say. When we get to the village, don't speak. Don't even look at the others, even if they're friends and family. Especially if they're friends and family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffs and nods. \"Can you tell my daughter one thing? Tell her that with my last breath, I forbade her from marrying the baker's boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I wanted a proper funeral. Tell her that. None of this pagan nonsense so likes so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and give the leash a quick flick, setting him walking back the way you came. Soon you emerge from the trees. The man on watch approaches you, drawing a rusty iron blade and uttering a prayer at the sight of Joshua. \"Cor blimey, look at the claws on that thing! It's a venomous elf like from the tales!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your most dramatic voice, you say, \"Do not be afeared citizen, for I have captured the monster that has afflicted this land. Alas, in the skirmish to subdue her, your elder, Joshua, was slain. She shall be taken to the capital immediately, where the king's justice awaits.\"</span></div></div>",

You barely refrain from cursing: shapeshifting was a delicate process that takes years of practice to manage anything beyond a senseless lump of flesh, and you had put a good swell of magic in the hands of an amateur. It was your mistake, really. His thoughts <i>should</i> have been of the dead and purely hypothetical blight-fiend that this podunk town concocted, but instead, he thought of his prissy daughter. Now, his years of wisdom were likely being tempered by the capricious whims of teenage girlhood, perhaps accompanied by the petulance of Illia, if the gods truly hated you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And this cock-and-bull nonsense about venomous elves,</i> you append. And now you have to ensure that he doesn\u2019t get killed for a week or two. Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yank the leash gently to wipe the miserable expression off his face, but it just seems to intensify. His hands flex, and his large sharp claws inch out from his sheaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeel, foul beast!\u201d you cry, planting a foot into the small of his back, pushing him forward into a patch of soft mud. The dirt-encrusted glare that he shoots back at you is enough to make his watery blue eyes somewhat intimidating, at least judging by the murmur of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the illusion is shattered as Joshua props himself up on his taloned hands, the sexless burlap sack losing its former quality as it clings to his sizable prow. You surreptitiously cast your gaze across the mob, whose murmurs have taken on a distinctly lascivious quality, judging by the male elbows jostling male sides, and the disapproving gazes of peasant women towards either the pitiful elf or their leering husbands. You bite back a sigh as his sharp mitts slip on the mud, squashing his chest forward with a gasp that doesn\u2019t sound anything <i>close</i> to monstrous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men of the crowd seem to be embroiled in a serious discussion on whether taking the blight-fiend that killed their elder as a concubine would be an appropriate honor to his memory or not. You\u2019re mulling over the best spell to disperse the crowd with minimal casualties. You\u2019re not going to give up your only sign of a completed job to some superstitious yokels, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU FOOLS!\u201d sweeps across the crowd, dispelling any talk of elf trafficking, and even the small sigils you were tracing behind your back. Every head turns to the cacophonous source; Illia, who is standing upon a stump, arm outstretched towards the murmuring crowd. She\u2019s garbed in a hemp robe that\u2019s been crudely striped with berry juice and tree sap to resemble the uniform of the Goddess\u2019 priesthood, along with lumpy woven chapeau perched loosely atop her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you not see what this creature is doing?!\u201d she cries, stepping forward in front of the mob, gesturing to her transmogrified father. \u201cThis <i>monster</i> has woven a spell of lust over you, to cloud your vision and tempt you to sin!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs a stick off the ground and jabs Joshua in the tit, sending him back with a yelp, arms draped protectively over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis beast, and its curse, can only be truly exorcised by the Goddess\u2019 chosen!\u201d she declares, waving the wood around like an aspergillum. \u201cNot by those with\u2026  <i>impure motives</i>.\u201d She glares at the male population of the mob, who shamefully avoid her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d you add, stepping forward and stretching an arm in front of the ersatz holy woman \u2014 much to her apparent disgust. \u201cShe shall be taken to the city\u2019s highest church, and, uh, strung up and all that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension in your shoulders relaxes as ripples of uncertainty thrum through the crowd. Priggish priestesses could work wonders among the uneducated; better note that down for future ventures in the countryside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorry not, for I too, shall accompany him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>wait no.</b></i><br>\r\n</u><br>\r\nYou whirl towards Ilia as the crowd murmurs uncertainly. She flashes a smug smile in your direction before once again addressing the crowd. \u201cWe shall leave come sundown!\u201d A non-existent tear is wiped from her eye. \u201cI shall return one day, my people, I swear this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without much fanfare nor heed for the now-sniffling crowd, she turns on her heel and makes off towards her hut. You quickly follow suit, jerking your captive after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching up with the petite Ilia is no trouble at all, but your similarly-statured prisoner stumbles and trips over the uneven terrain. You can\u2019t help but stare at the variety of shakes and wobbles that stem from his attempts to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dragged my daughter into this.\u201d he snarls. \u201cThe sole reason I let you do <i>this</i>\u2014\u201d  A gnarled hand traces his nubile form. \u201c\u2014 to me, and you <b>recruit</b> her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not his petulant snarl-cum-pout that gives you pause, nor the ears flattened against his head, but the rather large claws slowly emerging from their blackened sheaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you can\u2019t help yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour daughter dragged <i>herself</i> into this!\u201d you hiss. \u201cFirst, she saves your prodigious ass from that sorry display, then she casts herself as the lead role of this mummer\u2019s farce! <i>My</i> time was spent making sure a little milksop of an elf didn\u2019t start weeping!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dagger-staring competition is interrupted a shriek from the subject of your argument; \u201cAre you consorting with the <i>beast</i>, warlock?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick \u201cNo,\u201d is grumbled, and you set off towards the now-one-person hut, pulling Joshua a bit more than you have to. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hut is an interesting sight: half the hut is adorned with the symbols of the Goddess, the curved silver lines adorning every pot, plate, and the thin blanket placed over a pile of straw. The rest of the hut is notably bare; not even a spare plate rests upon the ramshackle table. The sight appears to be unusual to even its former occupant, whose mouth hangs lightly open with ramrod straight ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIllia busies herself with a rucksack, shoving bits of wizened fruit and an assortment of hierogram-emblazoned clothing into the ragged thing. She shoots you a smug glance in between objects. \u201cI would think that \u2018our\u2019 savior\u2019 would be above the charms of such a wretched creature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just\u2026 teaching her what\u2019s what,\u201d you murmur distractedly as you look around the hovel. \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly moved on quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIllia stops her packing to shoot a glare over her shoulder. \u201cI certainly miss my father, you heartless oaf.\u201d A robe is stuffed in with a particular amount of venom. \u201cBut I know he\u2019s in a better place at the very least \u2014 I made many a prayer to that effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears sparkle at the edge of Joshua\u2019s eyes. Quickly, as Illia\u2019s back is turned to you both, you flick a pointed ear. He manages to stifle the instinctual yelp and pivots his head towards you, stormy visage on full display, but, fortunately, reads the clear message on your face. He slowly turns to face forward once again, gnawing a lip to keep his expression still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rustle of clothes and light setting of the moldy timbers are the only sounds that ripple through the hut. You make busy with one of the plates, examining it primarily to avoid conversation with the zealous girl. Joshua tries to keep his movements to a minimum \u2014 every sharp movement draws the pernicious eye of his daughter, evoking a choked gasp from the elf-cum-elder every time, to Illia\u2019s quiet satisfaction \u2014 and eventually settles on picking the mud from his burlap garb. Your feigned inspection takes less and less of a priority as Joshua continues his preening; and you\u2019re eventually more or less just staring at the transmogrified elder, paying especial attention to every unintentional hike of fabric, and the flash of creamy skin that it reveals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOgling an <i>animal</i>, I see. How typical of a <b>wizard</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua stops his ministrations at once and stares at you with open disgust, covering himself in a display of feminine modesty that you\u2019re fairly certain he didn\u2019t possess two hours ago. You cast a quick gaze at his bust that, due to its size, is merely squashed against his chest rather than hidden by his monstrous mitts, then turn your gaze to the upstart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s practically doubled over in silent laughter, mouth curved into a mocking grin that you fervently want to wipe off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something wrong with monitoring a dangerous monster, <b>girl</b>?!\u201d you intone, sweeping an arm out for dramatic effect. It doesn\u2019t seem to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know as well as I that the monster wouldn\u2019t dare to attack in a place like this,\u201d She makes her own grand gesture at the clumsily painted holy symbols on most of the walls. \u201cI\u2019ve held more rituals than I can count in here; it\u2019s practically sainted ground!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strokes a wall fondly, not noticing the vague look of outrage building on Joshua\u2019s face. Just as quickly, she produces a bundle of cloth and hurls it at the offended elder, who squawks in alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo get the beast-thing dressed \u2014 maybe when it\u2019s in <i>human</i> clothes, your perverse lust shall dissipate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stride out of the house, elder in tow, not dignifying her outrageous remark with the witty response that you were <i>thiis</i> close to formulating. Joshua leaves the house with little complaint, but halfway on your trip to a nearby secluded glade, he grabs the hemp rope out of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t <i>believe</i> you,\u201d he gasps, in a tone that is eerily reminiscent to Illia\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m a <i>man</i>! <i>You\u2019re</i> a man!\u201d Despair flits across his pretty face for the nth time that day. \u201cOh Goddess, she was right about you people\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was checking for irregularities in your form, man!\u201d you whisper-shout, looking over your shoulder for any wannabe observers. \u201cThat spell that hit you was about, er, circle nine! You don\u2019t want to end up a pile of bones and sinew now, do you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know it\u2019s a lame excuse the second it leaves your lips and judging by Joshua\u2019s squint, he does too. Thankfully, the fact that you are the only wizard in this discussion gives you enough plausible deniability to stave off any explicit doubts. Still scowling, Joshua snatches the bundle of clothing and starts off towards a particularly dense clump of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d you cry, extending a hand towards him. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you need help with that\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d he pronounces icily. \u201cStand guard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, you lean against a tree and scan the horizon. Eugh, no one would come here unless they particularly liked the smell of dung. With a sigh, you summon up some Light essence and exert your will onto a nearby thrush, sending it to alight on a nearby bough and transferring your sight to it shortly thereafter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Joshua shrug off his sack and struggle to squeeze his round bits into the ill-fit garb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Trousers and jerkins, with only a thin shirt underneath, probably his old stuff,'</i> you note wryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, a heavy sense of resignation weighs down your heart. The faux-priestess had set back your \u2018immortal-elven-slut\u2019 plan by a couple of decades, at the very <i>least</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Goddess demands justice! <i>I</i> demand justice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you shall have it!\" you shout back, though your voice hardly seems to carry over the horde of villagers that surround you. Only your rapidly diminishing wizardly authority is stopping them from tearing you and Joshua apart. At a time like this, how you wish you had a Staff of Booming to silence the crowds like the senior professors did for their students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is protecting the beast!\" Ilia screams. \"Look how she hides behind him - they have forged an unholy pact!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp of outrage ripples through the crowd as the look from the half-clad bestial beauty to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're losing them,</i> you think in panic. <i>Don't even justify that with a response.</i> \"Food!\" you blurt desperately. The starving villagers hush for a moment. You seize your moment. \"Your lord has been remiss in the protection of your lands. This creature-\", with that you give a yank of the leash, sending Joshua face first into the mud, \"-must be brought before him, so that he might be shown his failure and reminded of his obligations to you, his subjects. Then and only then will he send food and supplies to see you through the coming winter. Without it, you will all starve and Joshua will have died in vain.\" The crowd retract slightly. Ilia however is picking up another rock, on the verge of launching into a crowd-inflaming tirade. You race to cut her off. \"Then I shall take the monster to the capital for her punishment to be meted out. And let me tell you that the tortures of the city folk are terrible most indeed. So terrible even that I hesitate to speak them to your innocent ears.\" Ilia's throwing hand hesitates but doesn't fall. \"Nails! Burning nails in both eyes! And her skin shall be flayed with thorny whips and her eyelids peeled with a... sort of peely thing. And a rusty poker shall be inserted into her... her... y'know... anus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of women in the crowd gasp, covering the ears of children they had previously thought were merely attending a family-friendly lynching and hurrying them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then she shall be given over to three Orcs of large girth, one for each hole. And finally... I will... um... wee on her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd has heard enough, dissipating in disgust. Only Ilia remains. She meets you with a steely stare, still weighing up her rock. \"Go then. But if I ever find out that you lied to us, that you kept my father's murderer as a filthy familiar or something, I will pray for you to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn uncontrollable snort of laughter bursts from your nose. \"Truly terrifying. I pray it never comes to that. Now, my prisoner has a long journey ahead of her. Fetch her some clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nostrils flare in rage. With an impotent stomp of her foot, she turns and marches away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua sniffles behind you and you can feel him trembling even on the end of the leash. You make a show of dragging him through the village to where they stabled your horse. His friends and family kick mud and spit as he passes, and by the time he reaches the barn he is sobbing and filthy. The horse likes the sight and smell of him even less, and it takes minutes to quell the animal enough to allow Joshua onto its back. You climb up behind him. \"At least you died a hero,\" you console him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia throws the bundle of clothing at the horse hard enough to almost unseat you as you gallop out of the village. Once safely away from the pitchfork-wielding, you dismount to allow the shivering Joshua to dress himself. He looks back at the distant dim light of his home as he pulls on the woolen garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fear I will never see it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I certainly hope I never see her again,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ride a little more and camp for the night. The following day the rains roll in. The next six days are huddled in the saddle against the unrelenting rain, swaddled in drenched clothing, the countryside a featureless grey blob. You see not a single traveler upon the roads. At night you camp in the shelter of trees or rocks, huddled together for warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly on the second night do you consider getting a little more than <i>warmth</i>. As you slide closer to the sleeping elf, nestling your body nicely between his thighs, his claws slide out from their sheaths, though he remains snoring throughout. You begrudgingly remove your throbbing erection from his vicinity, and grumble yourself to sleep.</span></div></div>",

All that remains of the original tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit that the wooden walls are unusually formidable, thicker than many stone walls you've seen and stretching forty feet high. A herd of sheep is being herded towards the gate, and they seem to like Joshua even less than the horse. Maybe its the magic still in him or he just smells like a predator. They part like a wooly sea. \"Who goes there?\" the guards challenge, raising their spears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An agent of the king,\" you reply, flashing your magisterial documentation. They usher you through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua marvels. \"Even the lord's guards obey you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honestly, it's the first time you've had opportunity to try out the official documentation, sealed by the king himself and granted upon your graduation. More interesting than the effect on the guards is the effect on Joshua however. \"Of course. I am the hand of the king. I carry his authority wherever I go. All but he must obey the will of a wizard.\" It's stretching the truth but the look of admiration on his pretty face is too much for you to pass up.

As you step within, you raise the Magisterial Seal, stating, \"I hereby requisition a room, a stable for my horse, food and a hot bath, upon the authority of the king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, Joshua suppresses a small squeak of delight as the innkeeper scrambles to your demands.</span></div></div>",

You groan as you grab your crotch, which has just sprung up from its dormant state. Must he need to tease you so much...? This isn't how you imagined your journey to be. You think back to the times where he would innocently rub his butt all over your crotch, show up naked after taking a short dip in the lake, and press himself closely against you at night. He clearly didn't recognize what body he was in now, still thinking in his old ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't worry, little buddy. Everything is going to be alright.</i> You think as you pat your crotch, which is waning like the branches of a weeping willow. Joshua is currently prancing up and down on the bed like a little girl, which you find very... strange. Why is Joshua behaving like an enthusiastic child all of a sudden? Surely he isn't already turning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a fine bed this is. And so... soft too. I have never seen anything like this before. This is fine craftsmanship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<i>Oh, right</i>. You have forgot that not even a week ago, Joshua had been a hick of some poor village. The bedding quality must have been quite shoddy in comparison to even that of a small town, if their sturdy, hard chairs are any indication. Your back even involuntarily twists itself as it remembers the uncomfortable hardness. You grin to yourself. If Joshua is this delighted by the beds, you can only imagine how royally he would look up to you when he sees the food. He would think of you like... like... like a king!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... I smell something good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are snapped out of thoughts by his voice, and for a second think that he's referring to you, but a quick knock on the door quickly clears those suspicions. Opening it, you spot a maid standing right outside with a platter of food, seemingly quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-milord, I have brought your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid nods as she heads inside, squeaking as she sees your companion and rushes to put the platter down on the table. Normally, you would admire her features: her petite breasts and wide hips, but unfortunately for you, Joshua completely blows her out of proportion. She doesn't even seem interesting to you anymore. Has Joshua's presence already affected you this much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you are an elf, I've decided to bring you some vege--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Joshua greedily salivates over the grilled beef and roasted chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Pass me that salad, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua happily nods his head, ears squirming from pleasure as he digs into the meat. Hmm... that's strange. Even if he has claws and fangs, he should still have a preference for fruit and vegetables if he is an elf. You decide that you must research more about him. As you both finish up your meals, you quickly stand, brushing off any crumbs and head for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am heading out for some fresh air. <i>Do not leave the room no matter what</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you growl your last command, you quickly shut the door behind him. You're not too worried that someone might spot his beautiful (and dangerous) appearance. Even if he effectively cockblocked you for several days, he was still obedient, and would look up to you like a puppy would look up to his master. There will be no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian begins, before a quick flash of your Magisterial Decree dissuades him from continuing. You head over to the \"Species Section\" and fish out several books on elfs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" You spit. For the past hour, you have been listing through pages and pages of elf species, hundreds of them, yet you could not find even a single species that looks even remotely related to your companion. You sigh as you take the last book into your worn out hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Book of Extinct Species? Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to toss it aside into the (not so neatly) stacked pile but some kind of curiosity captures you. You wonder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. There's no possible way. I've heard that most of these beast are incredibly power-- ...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your eyes are looking at a picture that looks nearly identical to Joshua's current look. It was a section on elves, but this elf had claws and fangs. The name describing this beast is Delfemon. You gulp as you read its description aloud to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A delfemon is an extinct species of elves that used to think very much like humans. It is speculated that the brains and thought processes are very similar to that of humans. It mainly consumed meat, but it is classified as an 'omnivore', one who eats both meat and vegetation. It went extinct over 10000 years ago. Only one skull of this species had ever been found. Before that, they were considered to be myth, and rightly so. It is said that only 100 or so of these creatures had ever existed. Such low numbers are speculated to be a result of their body producing very low sex hormones. Just one is able to take on an army of tens of thousands...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp. What the heck?! There's no way this can be possible. It shouldn't be possible! According to the First Law of Conservation of Mana, a being can only turn another being into one with equal strength or lower. You couldn't possibly be this powerful... right? Then... Joshua? You shake your head. It was all nonsense. Your companion simply pulled an image out of his head without thinking about anything. There's no way he could be a delfemon. No way. You won't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the library (you don't clean up), you decide to... </span></div></div>",

Thrusting the torch into the darkest corner, a patch of shadow remains untouched by the light. It squirms and slithers away, scattering apart into single motes of shadow. Using the fire to shepherd them towards the door, they scatter into the winds once outside, drifting away towards the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than an hour later, having cleared the rest of the huts, you return to the bonfire. \"Shadow mites,\" you inform the elder tersely, driving the stick into the soft grey soil, burning embers pointing upwards. \"Leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your cloak you draw a satchel of powder, sprinkling a handful over the smouldering end of the brand.

They're trying to establish a class four storm enchantment inside the city. It'll bring on the rainy season prematurely, which'll hopefully cool off the Salarians, literally and figuratively. You know how lethargic those reptilian bastards get in the cold. Since they're leading the rabble, it should cut off the head of the snake, so to speak. Journeyman Nathan Snigguh should be waiting to meet you in the portal room once you arrive. Good luck.\" With that, the fire gutters out, leaving you alone on the quiet, darkening moorland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Nathan is down there too. He's been in the field only a year but was already developing a taste for high-risk environments and a reputation for dangerous bravado. You urge the horse on a little faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is midnight by the time you arrive at the wizard's tower built halfway up the side of a valley littered with old dragon bones. The tower sways unpleasantly as you climb the many tightly-coiled steps to the portal room. The two magineers are waiting for you. The apparatus that surrounds the wyrmhole portal already crackles with energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll only have a few seconds once the wyrmhole opens so don't dally,\" the head magineer says as he carefully slides the final lodestone into the machinery with a carefully selected alignment. The whole array begins to spin and the dormant wyrmhole that floats in the center of the room ripples and undulates like water. \"Try to keep your arms tight to your chest. Don't be tempted to jump through the gate - you <i>will</i> end up slicing your head off. Get ready. Stabilising in 3...2...1...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mass of formless dark energy is rent open, forming a circular rift in the air just wide enough for a human to fit through. The magineer pushes you hard in the back and you step quickly towards the portal, meeting that blast of hot, dry air that comes from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you're through, out of the Vavatch exit portal. The bright light burns your eyes. Shielding them, you see you stand in a round room of golden-white sandstone. The air is like the inside of an oven and choked with smoke and the sound of fighting nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping away from the portal, you see the bodies of two magineers slumped across the portal control machinery, blood dripping from their robes. Before you can draw your sword, an immensely fat, black man in sumptuous robes barrels into you, running for the portal, the two sacks beneath his arms spilling coins and gems onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The city is fallen! Flee now while you can!\" he screams in his foreign tongue. He makes it to the portal just as it destabilises. At least, most of him does. The portal collapses with a bang, leaving behind a pair of smoking, sandalled feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no sign of Nathan in the room. As you hesitate, unsure of what to do next, the door shakes violently. It sounds like an army is out there. It has been barricaded but it won't hold. You move quickly to the window, searching for an alternate exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sprawling desert city of Vavatch stretches out beneath you, an ocean of slums and palaces. The streets are choked with people and beastmen fighting bloodily. A tide of emerald green bodies, the Salarians, forges in from the fringes of the city against a sea of black-skinned Nagrandians. The latter seems to be losing. They are surrounded and pushed back to just the central districts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is too far to jump. Another thud rattles the door, splintering the wooden barricade. A scaled claw reaches through the gap, slashing deep gouges in the timber with a ferocity that alarms you.</span></div></div>",

The thick wood trembles beneath the onslaught. Even after years of training, this will be your first true taste of combat. You fight against the panic rising in you. Remember the training. All those early morning sparring in the yard, they have to count for something... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is small, cluttered with broken machinery and bodies. Little room to maneuver, and most offensive spells will be as lethal to you as to your enemies in such a confined space. They have the advantage of numbers and strength. Once they get through the door, they'll tear your flesh to bloody rags in seconds. Can't fight. Can't run. Nowhere to hide. That leaves only disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have seen a Salaria close-up only once in your life, dead and laid out on a slab in the Grey Order dissection room. It had been a young, female; her lithe, reptilian body marred by the cuts and bruises of the altercation with her owner that had killed her; her egg sacks swollen to bursting with unfertilised eggs. It will have to do. You focus on the shape of her body in your mind and allow your own to flow into its mold, becoming her in every aspect except for the fatal wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the transformation completes, the wooden barricade is finally torn asunder and a tide of green-skinned warriors flood into the room. They fall upon the corpses of the human mages, tearing them apart with their claws and stuffing chunks of their meat into their mouths filled with rows of razor-sharp, triangular teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your alarm, these Salarians resemble nothing of the one you are now mimicking. While you have mostly human features, these are a far more animal breed, with elongated snouts and deeply-set, inhuman eyes. They must be a different subspecies altogether. Two of the warriors seize you by the arms, forcing you onto your knees. Their strength is unbelievable, bringing tears to your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[And what do we have here. One of our own dressed as a pink skin], one of the Salarians, the only one in the room with a sword, growls in his guttural tongue. [And such exotic features. One of their pets perhaps? Take her clothes.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir claws make quick work tearing away your journeyman robes. The rags are tossed aside. A gasp seems to run through the Salarian warriors in the room. The lizardmen crowd closer, their cold eyes flashing with hunger, licking their blood-soaked lips with long, forked tongues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one with the sword cups the swollen egg sacks on your chest, his rough, armoured scales sliding over the softer, delicate scales of your own skin. [Now this <i>is</i> a gift. This female is in heat, and ripe for the picking it seems. You are out of season, little one. Mating season was six months ago.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives the sack a squeeze and you cry out as the sensitive, breast-like protrusion fills you with strange, alien sensations, whether pain or pleasure you're not quite sure. To your horror, you realise that the body you've morphed is in the middle of its mating cycle.</span></div></div>",

I am but a slave of the pink skins. My masters brought me here so that I might parlay with you.</i>]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<i>Parley!</i>] the leader snorts. [<i>Hah! Already we have the pinkskins and the blackskins beaten. They are surrounded, and by nightfall this city will be ours. We have no need for parley. Though we have need of you. I don't think much to your face, but your body pleases me.

He steps closer, striping away the blood-drenched scrap of clothes that conceals his manhood. The animalmen holding your arms push you forward so that you're on your hands and knees on the tower floor. The thick, scaly shaft of his penis is directly in front of your face. [<i>Stop!</i>] you cry pitifully. <i>[I am... I am cursed.</i>]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs. [<i>A nice try, though I think not. I am afraid, though I must have the first honour of siring your young, I cannot deny my brothers the pleasures of your flesh, especially after they fought so valiantly. Do not be afraid. Many of them are exhausted, and will be gentle.</i>]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he takes your head in his talons and forces his member into his mouth. You gag on the animal's shaft as a roar of approval goes up from his men. You had forgotten that Salarians impregnated their females through the mouth, the semen travelling down into the egg sacks in the chest, fertilising the eggs within, which were then disgorged through the nipples. Is this really to be your fate - to be a brood mother and conquest of the leader of the slave rebellion, the very army you had been sent here to defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kneel there, taking this abuse, little do you know it has only just begun. A hand is on your tail, holding it to the side, and a moment later a second shaft, even bigger than the first, enters you from behind. A shameful, bestial moan escapes around Raelon's cock, as you feel yourself warming to this punishment, a hot swell of arousal building in your belly. You're in heat, and to be surrounded by so many masculine, virile Salarian warriors, all lining up to mate with you and fill you with their potent seed, is a dream come true for the instincts of a fertile female that guide this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaelon spurts into your mouth, and you swallow down his gift. He slides out of you, while the animal behind you comes and pulls out to, to be instantly replaced by another. [<i>As delightful as this has been, I'm afraid I have a city to claim,</i>] Raelon gloats smugly, as he strides to the door. [But I will return to collect my sons, once you bear them. Let's hope they have my face!] he laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as he has left, another of the Salarian males steps forward, his erection searching out your mouth, but at the last moment one of the warriors grabs him roughly. [What do you think you're doing? Only Raelon has the honour of impregnating this female,] it snaps harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first Salarian pushes him away. [<i>Raelon had first pick, is that not enough? There are scores of us and only one of her, it would be a tragedy to waste such a pretty mouth. Besides, my sons will be twice as strong as Raelon's!</i>]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second Salarian's claws slide out further from within their sheathes.

It is made particularly enjoyable by the boatman, a half-troll who speaks barely a word of the common tongue as the long miles slipped past. No remarks of 'so you're a wizard then?' or 'so what's your business in X?' to spoil the peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly once does he register your presence, fixing you with a hard glance the moment you dip a hand into the crystal-clear waters. \"They chop hand off,\" he barks, his gnarled fist tightening around the thick wood of the oar. Kvossians are very protective of their water, as well they should be. It is the lifeblood of their city, and of the arid countryside that it supplies for a hundred miles around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo precious are they that all eating and ablutions are performed away from the aqueduct, at one of the sluices-cum-guard-towers dotted every few miles. Terraces of vibrant, green plantations line the hills around each sluice - fruit, tobacco, tea, and grapes - a stark contrast to the hot, arid landscape beyond. At each of these stops, wrapped and bound bundles or the occasional keg are loaded aboard the small boat until it sits quite low in the water and the half-troll begins to sweat to make headway against the slight current.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last Kvoss comes into sight just as evening is drawing in. Much like the plantations, Kvoss is built against the slope of a mountain in a series of terraces, but instead of crops there are buildings, each made of the local white sandstone. As the boat draws nearer over one of the 9 viaducts that emerge from the mountain, you begin to see the bath-houses, the summit palace, and the spacious villas with their rooftop gardens, all jutting out like the staircase of a giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air here is humid and fragrant. There is a noticeable heat emanating up through the bottom of the boat too and the water begins to steam as you grow closer, freshly hot from the heart of the mountain. The aqueduct nears a level about halfway up the mountain and the half-troll\u2019s boat comes to a berth in a boathouse. Porters dressed in little more than ornate loincloths hurry forward to unload the cargo, and a flurry of coin and tiny scrips of paper exchange hands. You clamber off the boat and once the hubbub has died down, you palm one of the porters a few copper in exchange for the direction of The Inn of the Prancing Ponce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, you want the fourth or third level, right next to the central cistern. Down two levels,\u201d the man says cheerfully. \u201cSay, you wouldn\u2019t be a wizard, would ya? What\u2019s your business in Kvoss then? Here to solve those murders, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly depart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanterns are being lit and despite the ill rumours that have been coming from Kvoss for months, there remains a atmosphere of joviality as you descend the broad, paved streets to the fourth level. Men, women and children emerge from their homes to walk the streets to eat, drink, and socialise. It seems peculiar coming from Lightgarde, where most law-abiding citizens would be inside by the drawing of night, but here the men openly adorn themselves with gemstones and bulging coin-purses, while the women wear fine silks. Each person seems to have their own, exotic perfume, until your senses are dizzy. The displays of wealth diminish as you descend one layer and then the next, though they never go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Inn of the Prancing Ponce extends over two levels and occupies six floors. It\u2019s many balconies ring with laughter and music, and the sounds of perhaps a bawdier entertainment coming from the lower floors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I stand out like a sore thumb</i>, you think as you step inside and forge towards the bar between revelers in their loose, colourful clothes, while you yourself are dressed in a dusty, heavy, woolen travelling cloak. Halfway in, your foot lands in water. There is a small channel of running water in the floor that winds between the tables, seemingly carrying empty cups and bottles back to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barman is distracted, staring off at something with his brow furrowed, so you order wine from the barmaid in the vain hope that holding a cup of alcohol might help you blend in. Then you turn to the room and begin to look for your contact within the throng. Somebody who looks out of place. It isn\u2019t long before you spot...</span></div></div>",

Dense curls of smoke almost conceal a figure there. They are dressed in a dark green cloak much like your own with the hood pulled up over the face and a long smoking pipe emerging from the shadows around the mouth. A ugly-looking mastiff gnaws at a bone at their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s my man, you think, shouldering your way through the crowd. They had arrived several days before you to investigate the rumours of murder and disappearances in the area, and your orders are to meet and assist. The smoke is acrid and thick - the sort of cheap, strong stuff that only a person with the immortal constitution of a wizard would dare inhale - and it has done an excellent job of clearing an area of empty space around the corner table. A thick cloud of it pours languidly out of the hood as the figure pushes it away from their face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-praepostor Scraif,\u201d you stammer, as the smoke disperses from around the man\u2019s face.

Of course, I never forget a, uh, face.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClose enough, sir.\u201d You extend a hand to shake but remembering the formal greeting between wizards, you swing the handshake up into a clumsy salute. \u201cJourneyman Sorcerer Mead, Crimson 4th circle, Golden 3rd circle, Jade 4th circle, Grey 3rd circle, Light 2nd circle, reporting for assignment, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait patiently for him to respond in kind with his own ranks but he merely takes a long pull on his pipe. \u201cIf you\u2019ve finished announcing your presence to the entire tavern, why don\u2019t you take a seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, sorry, sir. I didn\u2019t realise we were undercover.\u201d You quickly park yourself on the seat. You notice he too is perfumed, like the locals - a strongly masculine cologne of leather and sandalwood underneath the overpowering pipesmoke. \u201cSorry for saying shit just then. I\u2019m just- it\u2019s great to finally be working with another sorcerer, I always looked up to you in college. You were an inspiration.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that wine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-t\u2019s a prop. I was trying to blend in. I-I would never drink on duty. Absolutely not.\u201d You instinctively flinch, recalling the sting of the birch after all these years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan tilts his cup towards yours. \u201cThe barkeep won\u2019t serve me. I haven\u2019t had a drink in three days. Nothing stronger than fruit juice at least.\u201d He taps the rim of his cup against yours impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs\u2026 is this a test? There was that time in second year you caught me sneaking out after hours to the tavern...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scowls. \u201cYes, I birched your arse red for it, and I\u2019ll do it again if you don\u2019t top me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of the wine goes into his cup and shortly after goes down his throat. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, and begins to immediately eye the remaining half in your cup. You set it down and push it across the table, and he gulps it down like a man dying of thirst in a desert. He gives a satisfied gurgle in the back of his throat. \u201cFighting monsters is thirsty work, eh?\u201d he says with a wink. With two fingers in his mouth, he gives a shrill whistle and gestures the barmaid across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to order now,\u201d he barks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the barmaid smiles sweetly, before turning to you. \u201cWhat would you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBread, soup, wine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barmaid nods, and turns her gaze to Stefan. \u201cAnd what would your daughter like to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge works different for wizards than it does to mortals. As immortals, they do it at their own leisure, some taking centuries to mature to middle-age, others growing straight into silver-haired old men with flowing beards in their teenage years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in his mid-teens, Stefan\u2019s aging had halted, and stayed there for the past thirty years, not aging a day from the last time you saw him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was a Versi.</span></div></div>",

It is an affliction that comes to all who practice magic, manifesting in its own distinct ways depending on the spells cast, eventually consuming their bodies after a long lifetime, but most wizards have at least few of them to show by their fifth decade. Stefan is almost pristine, at least from the neck up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/87/59/0c/87590c1c439350031e5419f4281215eb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/87/59/0c/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more worried that she thinks I'm old enough to have a daughter,\" you chuckle dryly. Though you are almost as old as he, you still feel like you're in your mid twenties, partly from your immortally spry nature, mostly because you have never particularly felt the urge to grow up and mature into a bespeckled silver arcanist, preferring the field work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you look distinguished,\" Stefan grumbles surly. \"Fuckit,\" he growls, flicking his finger in a beckoning motion. A bottle of wine on a fellow patron's table flies across the room on unseen winds and lands in Stefan's hand. He lifts it to his lips to take a long draught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't anything like the Stefan you remember from school. That guy was a total hardass, strict with himself and those under him, and commit to the cause. Watching the liquid pour out of the bottle and down his throat with little resistance makes you wonder how life has treated him for the past twenty years. Not well by the looks of things. You had seen this before in a few of your female colleagues who had become disillusioned with the Order by the shoddy treatment they consistently received from their male superiors, but Stefan was a man and had been a grade-A student to boot. \"Should... should you be doing that if we're supposed to be undercover?\" you query. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empty bottle finally hits the table. \"You tell me, you're in charge now. Orders were to pass the mission over to you the minute you arrive. Guess they don't trust a... man like me to operate alone.\" He gives a belch and says, \"so now you're making the orders, there's a few things you ought to know...\"</span></div></div>",

You mean as in 'assigned to recently'? No - they've had me doing nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? For how long?\" Looking after and training the new recruits is a necessary part of the job on their annual field-experience sojourns was an important part of the work of a senior wizard, but nobody really wants that duty. They think just because they've read a few scrolls that they know everything, frequently give bad attitude, and pray you don't get into trouble because they were prone to hurting themselves with their own spells in a fight (if you're lucky) or hurting their guardians (if you're unlucky). Not to mention they're usually hormonal, teenage messes, and acting as a surrogate father-figure has never been part of the arcane training wizards receive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also boring as shit. The magi know how much of a liability an untrained wizard is, so the guardian is usually sent to the heartlands for the duration. It's a bit of a holiday, visiting the comfortable, wealthy suburbs of Lightguarde, casting a few cantrips to amuse the fat, contented locals. It's 'hearts and minds' work. Boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan shakes his head. \"You don't understand. They've had me doing nothing else. I mean, since I graduated. This is all I do, shepherding wide-eyed first years around. This was the closest thing I've come to a proper mission in fifteen years.\" He spreads his hands in a angry shrug. \"And now it's yours. Congratulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stunned. Stefan, the man who you'd looked up to a student, is a glorified babysitter? That can't be right - you've seen him fight, or at least spar, and the guy has talent. He can sling a spell like the best of them but also throw a hell of a punch, packing more strength into those arms than their feminine appearance would suggest, which took many of his opponents off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a waste,\" you utter eventually, lost for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis downcast features flicker for a moment as he meets your gaze. \"Thanks,\" he mumbles, the alcohol evidently starting to take affect. Reaching into a pocket, he tosses you a key. \"At least the student is off my hands for the duration. They're your problem now.

Just don't let him do anything-\" Stefan rolls his eyes drunkenly. \"Oh, why do I care, you'll understand when you see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuhing you way through the bar towards the staircase leading down to the rooms, the barkeep tries to catch your attention, a concerned look to him as he looks across at Stefan slumping somewhat drunkenly at his table. He tries to rope you into a conversation about your inadequate parental skills but you brush him off politely, and he backs away, tugging his bristly moustache in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfumed candles illuminate the hallway to the room. The key turns smoothly in the lock and you slip quietly inside, not wanting to wake your new ward if you don't have to. You've handles a few of these teenagers before and now how much of a pain in the neck they are. It doesn't help that a lot of the recruits are from small, remote settlements, and are raised with the small-town idea that they're the \"chosen one\" after displaying their burgeoning wizard powers. It takes a while after they get to school to realise that there are several thousand chosen ones just like them, that they're not special, and that their elders really do know better than them. Until that point is reached, they're usually insufferable, acting as though they're legendary heroes in some trashy play, with all the diminished self-preservation instincts that entails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is unusually spacious with a curtained balcony looking out over the lower levels and two impressive four-poster beds. One of the four-posters has the drapes drawn about it, though a faint glow shines through the gaps in the material. You can hear a rustle from beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stefan said, it <i>is</i> past bedtime, and it would not do to allow the young student to get away with staying up after hours, even if he may be reading a tomb by candlelight. It is important to be firm from the outset, establish boundaries. Besides, teenagers need their sleep, and you don't want to be dragging his sleep-deprived arse around the city in the morning. Stepping up the bed, you pull the curtains back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight before you takes a few moments to process. It is quite a mish-mash of reality and illusion, as well as anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA teenage...boy (yep, you're pretty sure it's a boy) lies naked on his back on the bed, eyes closed as he emits soft gasps of pleasure. Riding the 'boy', cowgirl style, is... the barkeep. The bearded, moustachio'd barkeep. Totally naked. Except his proportions are off, making him appear far more muscular and masculine than the barkeep upstairs. And, more importantly, his entire body is transparent, gently-glowing. He's an illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the point where the real and illusory flesh meet, the barkeep is sporting a pussy, particularly out of place on his barrel-chested form. The boy on the bed's cock juts up approximately through this incorporeal organ. The boy's hand is shoved through the barkeep's illusory abdomen and wrapped around his own cock, stroking it in time to the rhythmic rocking back and forth of the illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gives another grunt of pleasure, a trickly of sweat running down his chin to drip onto the perspiration beading on his breasts. \"You fucking... slut... stupid...wench...\" he utters under his breath, reaching up to caress the barkeep's swollen pectorals. Just as he appears about to climax, his eyes open and see you. They are glowing with a faint light that matches that which makes up the illusion, though that light winks out immediately, as does the barkeep, leaving the boy there suddenly alone and clutching his cock, staring up at you in pure fright. His breath comes rapidly, his petite and perky breasts heaving on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/008/036/917/large/naztazzia-gagalac-joi2.jpg?1510069442\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/ima...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two bloody Versi's</i>, you think inwardly. <i>Just my luck.</i></span></div></div>",

You\u2019re quietly impressed; that kind of self-control is hard to teach \u2014 though he certainly did need a lesson in suppressing his more basal urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the kindling of respect was quickly quenched with the impetuous smirk that curves his pert lips. Slowly he slides to a seated position, still maintaining the blanket wrapped around his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee something you like, <i>slut</i>?\u201d he drawls, fear altogether gone from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not quite sure where your energy comes from, nor the way in which you channel it. But it comes nonetheless:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stomp your foot down with a spark of Jade, guttering out a few candles with the wind from the floorboards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smirk has vanished by now, but his eyes still hold a spark of vainglory, spurring you into your next reckless action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snatch his face with a gloved hand and force his head upwards. Staring into his eyes, now flashing with venomous loathing, you lay down the law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Journeyman Meade, your fucking <i>superior</i> in this operation, and I will brook no treatment of this kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth moves, either to form words or to gather enough saliva to spit, it doesn\u2019t matter. You press your fingers into his cheeks until you can feel the outline of his teeth through the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I hear another godsdamned insubordinate word from your mouth or see the merest fucking <i>hint</i> of phlegm, I will send you to the whorehouse in an <i>instant</i>.\u201d His eyes light up with a glimmer of hope; he doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cYou\u2019re not in Versiland anymore, whelp \u2014 the only thing marking you as a man is that cock you love so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes still crackle with hate, but a slow recognition grows behind that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo keep your knob in your pants, recruit,\u201d you thunder. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t manage that, at the very fucking least; try not to alert the <i>entire fucking city</i> that you\u2019re a <b>mage</b>!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jab a finger at the embossed window to emphasize your point, releasing his face so his eyes can follow. In all likelihood, only a trained mage of the Light Order would be able to spot illusion magic from the street, but he doesn\u2019t need to know that. The recruit massages his jaw, face still smoldering with suppressed rage. But, to your quiet pleasure, he nods slowly. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNow, tell me,\u201d you rumble, devoting roughly half of your willpower to suppressing a smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, recruit?.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRodrigo,\u201d he hisses. You flash your eyes angrily. Hopefully, he didn\u2019t see the edge of your lips twitch. His expression twists into a squinty pout, like he\u2019s sipped sour milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRodrigo, Ma\u2014SIR.\u201d His eyes bulge at the near mistake, and he bunches up the fabric, casting his eyes downwards. He shifts away from you as if burnt, bunching the balance of the blanket around him. His plump bottom lip trembles ever so slightly. Gods, you <i>love</i> your job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, Recruit <i>Rodrigo</i>,\u201d. Get some sleep.\u201d You stride to the door with a flip of your dark green cloak, being sure to flash its iridescent lining. \u201cYou\u2019ll need it.\u201d It wouldn't do to turn your back on a wide-awake, likely bitter guttersnipe; and you needed Stefan to brief you a bit on the happens in Kvoss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile bends your lips as you tread through the dark hallway back to the tavern; flanked on either side by the white stumps of extinguished candles. </span></div></div>",

Though she wielded a long stick with a candle on the end to kindle those high up on the wall, her task still required much clambering on chairs and stretching up on tiptoes, small as she was. Her audience found more joy drunkenly cheering on her struggles rather than helping her, amused as they were by the odd events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it had been a little much, the display of Jade at the boy's manner. The recruit was just that after all - a boy - and a sharp clip about his earlobe would have had the same effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, thin man barges past as you push through the crowd to Stefan's corner table, a pretty girl tucked within the crook of his arm beneath the folds of a black cloak. \"There there, my sweet, hold tight to me, I'll keep you safe. Just a little darkness, is all. Let's get you somewhere warm, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was empty. No sign of Stefan Scraif save for the dissipating swirls of his pipesmoke and a half full cup. Where the blazes had that blasted versi gotten to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...wait...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith distinctly more urgency and physical force, you forge through the patrons to the tavern door. Upon the street, the bulky shape of two figures beneath the dark cloak moved clumsily but hastily towards an alley between two buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dart after them. The gaunt gentleman looks back with alarm at the sound of your footsteps. He bristles, spitting some slur in the local tongue as you seize Stefan by the forearm and pull him free from the man's embrace. Stefan falls into you, barely conscious, blind drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man surveys you with a beady, glittering eye. \"I was simply making sure the little lady got home safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be plenty safe with me,\" you retort sharply,  showing him the first two inches of steel from your scabbard to demonstrate. Evidently he does not feel the need to see the rest of the sword; vanishing swiftly into the dark. It is a relief - with your left arm struggling to hold Stefan's dead weight, you did not fancy your chances in a duel had he decided to push his claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slam the sword back in its scabbard. <i>Two</i> versi! <i>Why is it always me that gets these assignments?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you not support yourself?\" you ask. Stefan merely moans into your chest. His hands clutch your cloak tightly but his legs only buckle with each step, dragging across the cobbles. You tighten your grip to take more of his weight. The immediate temptation is to lift him completely into your arms to carry him as one might a damsel in distress, but to do so to a man and a peer would be a humiliation. A wizard is far too proud and powerful a being to be lugged about like a bride on her wedding night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had he allowed himself to become so inebriated in the short time that you were up in the room? Versi men are slight in stature, sure, but by all accounts they're the match of their mundane counterparts when it came to physical constitution and capacity to handle their drink. Furthermore, it is a professional disgrace for a wizard to willingly get themselves into such a state. Sure, wizards drink. Many drink heavily in fact. But alone. A wizard losing possession of their faculties in a crowd could bring about the death of dozens with a single gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pray I don't file this in my report,\" you mutter down to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head lolls back and rolls in circles, his eyes fluttering open and closed independently of one another. There is sweet citrus upon his breath that takes you back to distant days in potion class. Gripping his chin, you hold his head steady. As his pink lips part, the scent beneath the wine and cheap pipe-weed is unmistakable - <i>maiden's end</i>. He's been drugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well one of you was certainly in for a surprise this evening,\" you say darkly, gripping him tighter so as to drag him with renewed haste to his room. Your fingers struggle to find modest purchase, briefly tightening about the soft flesh of his right breast before shifting upwards to underneath his armpit. Not that he would mind necessarily, had he been conscious - versi males are said to regard their breasts more as fleshy battle armour for their heart and lungs rather than anything sexual, with especially endowed men viewed as being more impressive warriors. Yet it certainly makes you uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a barked command, the halfling girl scurries ahead of you to unlock the door. Scraif's rented room is spartan by wizard standards, cheap. A thin slit of a window for light, and a hay-stuffed mattress and a basin of water for furniture. You lay him down on the bed. His fingers still clutch tightly to your clothing even in his stupor.</span></div></div>",

He lets out a high cantankerous moan at the disruption, but you pay him no mind, choosing instead to gather the thaumic energies of Gold and Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaiden\u2019s end was an alchemic ingredient \u2014 a distinctive pink root, to be exact \u2014 that teetered on the cusp of illegality. Sales of it were accompanied by a mutual winks and tacit agreement to not discuss the transaction. It affected the mind primarily, dulling the tendency towards independent thought to the point of blissful obedience. It was mostly accepted and permitted in prisons, where ruthless criminals would have their food and drink so saturated with the stuff that they would walk to the chopping block and bare their necks with dumb smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut its namesake and more-widely known usage was in bars and brothels, of course. Any whore or guileless wench that didn\u2019t recognize the telltale fruity scent might find themselves leaving the establishment over a brigand\u2019s shoulder, tittering at the futures of depravity being whispered into their ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, a massive inconvenience for you. Stefan could be deprived of his higher faculties until noon or two days after that, depending on the dosage. And though you would like to put some faith in Scraif\u2019s abilities to detect common types of poison - something everyone learned well by second year at the academy; it\u2019s all too likely that puffing cheap pipeweed had dulled his sense of smell and taste to the point of insignificance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lucky that he was drunk, you suppose; a morally uninhibited and practiced mage at someone\u2019s beck and call was a fearsome thing. Better they mistake him for a maiden than realize his potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re pretty.\u201d you mutter quietly, smirking gently. You reflexively flinch at the twisting from the mattress: comparing Praepostor Scraif to a \u2018topside wench\u2019 would get you a caning if you were lucky; a session as spell practice if you weren\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s no matter, you suppose. Even if he heard it, he\u2019ll forget it soon enough. You carefully slide the dark woolen cloak off his shoulders and start fiddling with the buttons of his jerkin. It\u2019s embossed with intricate designs of winding chains and savage river-creatures, as is the Kvossian custom, but one primarily reserved for nobility, not stall-sold to a traveler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>It\u2019s secondhand</i>,\u2019 you realize belatedly. Light scuffs and scratches stand out against the dark patterns. Either he had cozied up with a noble family, or more likely, he had spent the majority of his allotted funds to purchase something befitting a man that fit his slight frame. A shame he didn\u2019t read up on local traditions before he came; this kind of jerkin is worn by boys on the cusp of manhood and shrugged off just as their shoulders start to broaden. Secret sniggering and masked pointing must\u2019ve followed him as he frog-marched recruits down the streets; all directed at the girl who wanted to be a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake off the small pang of sympathy stirring in your chest, grit your teeth and eventually manage to dislodge the buttons from their too-tight niches. Every second you wasted now was a minute of work. The cloth shirt is considerably easier to remove, with a sharp \u201cUp.\u201d sending Stefan\u2019s arms above his head with a drunken whoop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that he was lucid enough to follow monosyllabic commands should worry you, but you continue about your task relatively undistracted. It\u2019s quite hard to be fully focused with the upper half of a nubile young woman smiling beatifically at you, eyes half-lidded, alabaster breasts heaving with every syrupy breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanneling Light energy, you press your left hand to the side of his skull. His body stiffens ram-rod straight and his breath hitches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDream well,\u201d you intone, and his body relaxes once again, stupid smile curving his lips again. It\u2019s not so much for him as it is for you; drawing toxins out of a body tended to be incredibly painful, but a steady channel of Light could overpower all earthly sensations, the more entrancing, the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the tricky part. You place your hand palm-down on the soft skin of his stomach, just bordering his ribs and focus Gold into it, willing all traces of maiden\u2019s end to concentrate in his gut. Momentarily, he lets out a whimper and nuzzles his head into your hand, nearly disrupting your focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s mind-numbing, dangerous work; a lapse in concentration could collect one of his vital humours, and coalescion spells vary drastically from subject to subject. The only sign of progress are Stefan\u2019s soft coos and pitched moans from the literal gut-wrenching pain being morphed into light pleasure. You\u2019re glad that Stefan, seemingly doesn\u2019t share the libido of his (and yours, unfortunately) ward; a spell of this sort didn\u2019t bode well with a squirming patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand is slick with sweat against his soft skin by the time you\u2019ve collected enough to be satisfied. Your Gold spell has concentrated a small pitted ball of the drug in his stomach, no bigger than an eyeball and levitating precipitously above a lake of bile. If there was any left, he\u2019d have to sleep it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You risk a glance at the window. Light has began to dance across the horizon, splitting the sky with orange. It\u2019s a source of consternation and slight relief: the former because you\u2019ve spent the balance of the night fondling your former prefect, and the latter because the small lantern you had was woefully insufficent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis part was much easier in comparison, but still demanded a degree of prudence. Slowly, you draw a finger up his abdomen, appreciating the comparatively cool flesh. As you pass through the valley of his cleavage, a shiver wracks his slight form and a choked gasp escapes his lips. Calamitously, he starts to shift, scything a leg across the other and throwing an arm across his midriff, nearly dislodging your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it!\u201d you hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops his squirming abruptly with a small gurgle, breasts slightly swaying on his chest. You let out a held breath and continue the journey upwards, past his collarbone and into his lily-white neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScraif gags lightly, his eyes fluttering open. Gold and blue meet your stormy grey as you draw the pink marble up his throat, his body convulsing in reverse-peristalsis. It\u2019s with a grin that you reach into his mouth, dance your fingers around his uvula and grab the ros\u00e9 marble, releasing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt splits the weak daylight like a prism, scattering small motes of light against the walls and ceiling. You grin ruefully at the thing: this distant cousin of a penny-sweet was probably stronger than the dreck they passed around in the Alchemists\u2019 guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stow it in a pouch on your person and risk a look at your impromptu patient. Worryingly, his eyes are still following you, vacant smile still playing at his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou purse your own in frustration: you hadn\u2019t gotten all of it. But the deep wave of exhaustion sweeping over you dulls whatever inclination you have for reflection on your work. You had never been good with channeled Light spells, and keeping it up for four hours had taken a toll on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger over to the nearest corner, lean against it, take another look at the topless Versi a few feet away from you, and close your eyes. Stefan\u2019s breaths are the last things you hear before falling into a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tavern room may be unheated, but the warm lining of your cloak has shielded you from snow and wind before. The wattle and daub under your back is lumpy, but a feather bed compared to the nights you spent on the obsidian wastes of Mount Rothediac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you sleep quite soundly, until a dry, rasping cough jolts stirs you. You open your eyes to see that your magic has, well, done it's magic. Stefan is sat up on the mattress. One palm pressed his temple, his other hand about his throat, from which comes a hoarse croak. His hangover must be legendary, his throat parched, but having a stone the size of an eyeball drawn the wrong way up his gullet is something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his eyes still squeezed shut against the shaft of sunlight through the slit window, he rolls over on to his front, groping blindly for the handbasin of water sitting beside the mattress. His nubile chest shifts quite fascinatingly as he stretches himself out in search of a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he does so, his hand grazes against the crumpled pile of his discarded jerkin and cloak. His hand flit down to his bare chest, and he gives a deep, shuddering intake of breath. Slowly, as if dreading what they might see, his bleary eyes open and fixate upon you, his entire beautiful body freezing in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't talk if I were you,\" you state sternly. \"It'll only hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe draws the jerkin to his chest as if to hide his breasts. A strange display, from a man, of what could almost be feminine modesty, although it is certain that he's been socialised in our ways in his time outside his country. Yet the rest of his posture, as he rises from the matress, is anything but feminine. The fist holding the jerkin is clenched tight, trembling with what you might think was rage if the room wasn't so cold. His eyes flash dangerously and his jaw is set. If you didn't know any better, you could swear he was about to punch your lights out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt you're feeling sore. I <i>tried</i> to make it pleasurable for you, of course,\" you say, unable to hide the smugness of a job well done. \"But it <i>was</i> very large, and you certainly didn't make it easy, fighting me the whole time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, it is as though the air has been drawn from the room. The winds of magic, the currents of thaumic energy that flow through the world imperceptibly to mortals, are suddenly draining towards a central point, Scraif, starving the local area of the fundamental energy wizards needed to function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other time you'd seen wizards draw so much into themselves was when witnessing magi preparing themselves before the casting of potent, draining spells. And Scraif is a sorcerer like you - he doesn't <i>know</i> any spells of that level, the Orders make sure of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other reason why a wizard might do such a thing would be if they were preparing to fight another wizard - choking their opponent of the energy needed to fight. This is conjecture - wizardly combat being a school of learning reserved for sanctioned and trusted agents of the academy, and like powerful arcanum, it is certainly an education deprived of sorcerers ever since the calamitous Sorcerer Wars of centuries past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConjecture formulated in the fraction of a second you have to consider unfolding events, but accurate nonetheless. With a crackle of golden energy, a ripple of force bursts from Scraif, blasting the straw mattress into whirling chaff and slamming you back against the wall. Scraif has evidently had a different upbringing. At some point he's learned to defend himself against his fellow wizards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just like all the rest,\" he snarls, as he...</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve escaped the decadent courts of the Bishanian queen and the twisted prison-tower of Erolus with a few clever words and a small feat of prestidigitation; surely you could handle your former prefect solely with the prior! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other, more worrying hand, Stefan\u2019s fair face seems to be twisted into a masque of hate, his unoccupied hand tracing sigils in the magically-variegated air concentrated around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh\u2014\u201d Your voice splutters out into a hoarse whisper, spurred by the dead air. before you manage to collect yourself. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in what happened, Scraif, any sorcerer could\u2019ve <b><i>GLK</i></b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of your quite-impressive speech is interrupted by what feels like an iron bar bent around your throat \u2014 a spin on Perroso\u2019s Manacles, once again collapsing you against the wall, hands scrabbling at your neck. Stefan advances towards you, stomp by floor-rumbling stomp, the hand holding the jerkin white-knuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more of your <i>fucking <b>traitorous</b></i> words, Meade,\u201d he growls, spitting your name like a curse. \u201cI should\u2019ve known last night, with your \u2018Yes sir, Praepostor!\u2019 and \u2018How full would you like your cup, Praepostor?\u2019\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small part of you wants to protest his inaccurate recollection, but that\u2019s far from your greatest concern. Your right hand\u2019s fingers are still occupied by the invisible binding around your neck, nails gouging indentations in the construct. Wizards were a vain and volatile sort, fair, but a reaction like <i>this</i> to a two helping hands was far beyond the pale! True, Light magic feels invasive at the best of times, but any visions he might have endured should have been wholly positive, and furthermore, completely self-created. Your mind races, furiously trying to cobble statements of placation communicable through one-handed gestures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leans towards you, extending a hand that positively <i>burns</i> with magic. Your gaze inadvertently dips to the valley of flesh crushed against the jerkin, and he stiffens straight as if struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGods, you\u2019re <i>sick.</i>\u201d he hisses, his voice heavy with unidentifiable emotion. He advances towards you once again, hand once again glowing with contracted Crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the counter-incantation you\u2019ve been scratching into the manacle takes, and the force dissipates from your neck, the raw skin greedily sucking in the wisps of magic that remain. Scraif jerks backward, his anger morphed to terror, and a fair bit of magic returns to the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet the fuck away from me!\u201d he screeches, slinging bolts of unrefined energy at you, letting the jerkin fall to. Fortunately, countering those was a central part of a first year\u2019s education, and you do so with ease. He scoots back against the wall and pulls his knees to his chest, body quivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, you lay your back against the wall opposing his and slide down, a wave of relief washing over your body. Scraif doesn\u2019t make a move in response; you imagine that channeling a least an entire room\u2019s worth of thaumic energy through one\u2019s form must be draining. His eyes are sharp flinty slits, though, and they dance through the room, falling on everything but you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve seen conduct like this in wild animals, and bedraggled survivors of leveled towns: scratched and savage, ready to claw at anything-or-one. It\u2019s the mirror image of last night\u2019s Scraif, cooing and shooting winsome smiles at anyone who met his eye. You\u2019re not sure which one you prefer, honestly, and adding the image of your second-year praepostor and the wannabe-besot from last night doesn\u2019t make your choice any easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat; this air wouldn\u2019t do for whatever was next to come, whether it be writing a report or attempting cooperation. \u201cScraif, do \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you do it.\u201d he interrupts, his voice dry and flat like old parchment. \u201cJust tell me how you got me here, then leave. Please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth opens and closes like a Kvossian trout. Goddess, did he think that <i>you</i> were the one that drugged him? Was <i>that</i> what this tiff was about? Your face reddens to a ruddy sheen at the unspoken slander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you on about, man!?\u201d you bluster. Scraif\u2019s eyes widen in response and he tries \u2014 and fails \u2014 to further flatten himself against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came downstairs after putting the boy to sleep to find you hanging off a stranger\u2019s arm and you\u2019re upset at me for <i>extricating</i> you?\u201d All color has drained from Scraif\u2019s face, and his mismatched eyes are fixed firmly on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that I would\u2019ve worked on you all night \u2014\u201d He squeezes his arms tighter around his calves and his eyes sparkle with horrified tears. \u201c\u2014 on my own volition? You <i>needed</i> it, Scraif; elsewise I\u2019d have you making moon eyes at me still!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bastard and a liar, Meade!\u201d He tries to rise to his feet, but his legs fail him and he collapses, leg splayed out, his delicate form exposed once again. \u201cI would never do \u2014 I <i>haven\u2019t</i>\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou damn well did, Scraif!\u201d you shout back. Flexing your fingers, you once again fill yourself with the unpleasant sensation of Gold, letting it give shape to your memories. A small rectangle wobbles in the center of the room, a collection of your memories of last night flitting through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan watches with increasing horror at the images that flit across\u201d covering his mouth at the sight of his lazy smile and fluttering eyelashes; choking back a sob at his enthusiastic observance of your command; hiding his face with his legs as his illusionary doppelganger lovingly rubs itself against your hand. You shift your gaze away, to give him some sense of privacy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dispel the illusion with a flex of your fingers and a roll of your neck. Scraif still has his head hidden \u2014 he knows just as well as you that a mere second-circle Light mage doesn\u2019t have the skill to alter their own recollections. You allow a smile on your face as you stare up at the ceiling; he should be nice and contrite now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Scraif is no better off than a few minutes ago: he\u2019s wrapped his tunic around his upper body like a blanket, his leather jerkin discarded to the side. His body shakes intermittently with the force of contained sobs and small tear-stains are spreading across the legs of his pants. Pangs of regret stir in your chest: you didn\u2019t think he\u2019d take it <i>this</i> badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out.\u201d he intones in a muffled voice. \u201cThis damn city \u2014 this damn <i>kingdom\u2019s</i> won. I'm poisoned.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble to the door, risking a look back at the figure who, for all intents and purposes, looked quite the delicate waif.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand on the doorknob, you\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You should say something, though you're not sure what. Nothing too patronising, that would only make things worse... something that says, even though he doesn't have to share exactly what has happened to him in his life, you understand, you sympathise, and you're here if he needs help or simply to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to speak and receive a mouthful of door for your trouble as it is violently shouldered open by a frantic Rodrigo. A thin bedsheet wrapped haphazrdly about his frame, he resembles a priestess in a diaphanous gown, though the double-headed battleaxe clutched in his left hand ruins the illusion. It looks oversized and unwieldy for his frame, though he swings it with ease towards the corners of the room as if seeking out a threat. The metal of the blade is a lustrous, blood-red colour - some rare alloy of mysterious properties perhaps, or just the gaudy affectation a freshly graduated teenage wizard might request of their blacksmith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this intrusion?\" you bark, lightly sidestepping as the axe swipes nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, my third eye is seriously tingling, if you know what I mean, and I don't mean the one in my pants. I think somebody is throwing some serious energies around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you state icily. As the axe swings wildly again, you neatly seize the haft and his attention. \"We were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" His gaze moves around you to fall on the slumped, sniffling, half-clothed versi on the floor and his eyes go wide as dinner plates. He stares up at you, accusing but afraid. \"Wh-what did you do to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a refreshing change from the impudent youth of last night. Fear is almost as good as respect. \"The same thing I'm tempted to do to you,\" you hiss. \"Bursting in to a superior's chambers unannounced. The sheer nerve.\" With a hard shove on the axe, you send him tumbling backwards out of the room. It wouldn't do to have him see Scraif's state for too long - the boy might never respect the praeposter again after witnessing the tears rolling down his cheeks. \"Get dressed. We have a mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow him out. His face is pale, his eyes are unable to look away from the sad figure of Scraif as you close the door behind you. He hefts his axe, a flicker of defiance passing over his face. \"Do you have something to say, recruit?\" You force a leery grin. \"Perhaps you'd like to discuss things in private.\" He swallows hard and shakes his head silently, skulking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing such implied threats doesn't sit well with you, but it <i>is</i> effective and typical among the culture of the colleges. With all those massive egos and powerful individuals trapped together in an single institution, a strict hierarchy enforced by systems of fear and dominance is the only hope of creating any semblance of order, the only way to stop the place blowing itself apart with spiraling rivalries. Wizards there are either predators or they're prey; the weak forced to service the strong, or collected as no more than etheric batteries or back-up bodies for the upper echelons. You know teachers who accepted the positions only for the opportunities offered to them for hand-selecting and grooming promising students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank the goddess you're in the field, away from all that. But for Rodrigo, it's the only culture he's known for most of his life. If you don't bring him to heel soon, he'll start looking at you as his next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting in the common room for your ward, you roll a small platinum coin across the counter to the innkeeper to ease your conscience. \"Have the woman in room six transferred to finer accommodation. Anything she wants, she gets.\" Hopefully a day of comfort will straighten Scraif out. It must be the stress...</span></div></div>",

The water gushes from a barred, ornate circular pipe several feet in diameter- fresh, free... and ignored by everybody on the street. The locals are giving it a wide berth as a matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say this is where they found the bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recruit has been giving you the stink-eye since the tavern, and had insisted on bringing that absurd axe with him, despite the strange glances from the locals. \"Uh huh, that's what we were told. The water was tasting weird for days, then one morning they found the pipes clogged with corpses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Clogged.</i> Nearly a dozen, they think. The guards had to cut them into little pieces to get them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step up to the font and run your hand under the flow. The water is quite cool, and refreshing in the dry heat. You run a cupped handful through your hair and take a mouthful, swilling it around. It tastes perfectly like water. A local gives you a filthy look when you spit it on to the cobbles - water is almost divine to them, a sin to waste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guards didn't happen to save any of the bodies, did they? I'd like to inspect them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What part of 'little pieces' do you not understand? Those bars are inches apart - those bodies were tomato soup by the time they got them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't think to cut the bars first?\" you scoff at the ingenuity of local law enforcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the bars...\" Your initial assumption was that the bars were iron, but of course iron would have rusted long ago. On closer inspection, the dull grey metal has a light green sheen - adamantine. \"This place is like a temple to these people, or a vault. It's really well protected. Every exit sealed. Nobody gets in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even wizards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think we've been holed up in a tavern for days? Nobody sets foot in there without the Lord's permission, and good luck getting that. And you know how Scraif is - he won't even let you go for a piss without a permission slip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching up on your tip toes, you are able to peer in through the bars down the broad pipe that disappears into steam-filled darkness. You strain your eyes for any sound. You sense the recruit standing close to your elbow as he mutters, \"I don't blame you for what you did to the guy. If you ask me, he had it coming. Somebody should have broken him in years ago.\" At your sharply raised eyebrow, he adds, \"come on, the guy has been living here for thirty years. He should know how things work by now.\"</span></div></div>",

I might not be the smartest in my class, but I quickly learned what I am to you people. Sure, the first few years were rough, but I adapted eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm truly sorry to hear that,\" you say sincerely and gently, \"but this can wait until after we resolve the matter of the dozen dead bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to know where we stand, if we're working together. I don't care what you do with Scraif; as far as I'm concerned he's your property now. But if you get bored of him, decide to move on to me, we'll find some sort of arrangement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Arrangement'? Do you come to <i>arrangements</i> with all your superiors?\" You find it hard to make eye contact with the boy, filled with a mixture of great sympathy and disgust for the life he has lived and the compromises made as a versi living in Tryzantium lands, and you focus on the outlet pipe, staring fixedly into the depths. Though the water is cool, waves of steam still vent this way from deeper in the monumental construction. Staring through the white clouds and shadows, a misshapen object can just about be seen deeper in the pipe. Alas, the bars are set close together and adamatine, resistant to most forms of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to brush him aside, silence his coy words. \"In any event, you delude yourself to think I'd show even the slightest interest in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. I'm twice the man Scraif is.\" He steps up behind you, his arms slip lightly around your bicep, drawing your upper arm between his soft breasts as he rests his chin on your shoulder. \"Which means I'm twice the woman in your eyes. That's how it works, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to shake him off, to scold him as you did last night, but it is one thing to face him when he is calling you a slut with his dick in his hands, and another thing entirely when he is pressing his deceptively feminine form against you while whispering honeyed words in your ear. \"See this axe? A gift from archmage Widogast. We both got something we wanted. Like I said, I'm open to arrangements. I doubt I could stop you if you got the urge, but I'd at least like to be raped on my own terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

By what whimsical rationale had the gods blessed the versi males with such ample padding, you wonder. A portable cushion for long hunting trips perhaps? For that matter, why were true women so endowed in that area? The recruit seems to anticipate your caress with resigned satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You versi sure are a handful,\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bolt of golden energy crackles from your palm into the recruit's backside, who gives a yelp and a leap into the air. He doesn't land. His body, clothed and weapons contract in on themselves in a heartbeat. Your hand placement was top notch - a doll-sized Rodrigo falls into your palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a dirty trick!\" his mousey voice pipes up at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rock his world. His hands grip your index and little fingers tightly as he bellows in terror as the minor movement nearly unseats him from his perch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom tip to tiny toes, Rodrigo now stands less than a foot in height. It is all you can do to resist the urge to 'aww' as he glowers up at you. What the hey. With the index finger of your other hand, you ruffle the hair on his little head. The angry brandishing of his toothpick sized battleaxe lets you know you will only get to do that once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing your arm through the adamantine bars, the minute recruit is deposited onto the floor of the water pipe. The water level and the curvature of the pipe is low enough that he can walk albeit awkwardly above the waterline on the curved ceramic surface of the bottom half of the pipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crumpled dark shape in the distance is still there, shrouded in steam. \"Wh-what the hell do you want me to do?\" he asks fearfully.

You couldn\u2019t trust a greenhorn with reconnaissance, you suppose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shove the recruit a bit further down the pipe with a flick of your index to his rear, then wrap the selfsame finger along with your middle one around a bar of the grate. A quick spark of light was all it took before you started to shrink, yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar plummeting sensation situates itself in your stomach as the world stretches around you. The bar, no thicker than the barrel of a smoking-pipe, grows to the size of an oak, and your two finger grip quickly necessitates both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodrigo\u2019s face is consternated rather than impressed as you pull yourself up, choosing instead to cross his arms and pout rather than help his superior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make another mental note to include \u2018impetuous\u2019 in your <i>scathing</i> report. Or maybe \u2018insubordinate\u2019 would do. \u2018Feckless\u2019 was always a good one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhydja have to send me in here, if you\u2019re just gonna come along?\u201d he whines. He rolls his eyes dramatically and tightens his crossed arms, huffing all the while, but you can see his slight shoulders relax. The little scamp was nervous, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch a crick out of your neck and peer into the darkness. The object\u2019s is still hazy through the fog, with no sharp corners or edges to define its shape. You heave a quick sigh and resign yourself to the trek. Although\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, recruit, lead the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d You hope you do a better job hiding your exasperation than he hides his fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be behind you every step, boy.\u201d You conjure a small burst of flame demonstratively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodrigo sags in disappointment, but refrains from further complaint. He moves his shaky hands in familiar gestures, summoning a small orb of light, illuminating only the barest distance ahead of you. His other hand hefts his battleaxe, arm lined with light Jade, to enhance his strength, you assume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d never admit it to the whelp, but you are slightly proud \u2014 you\u2019d probably take point in a similar fashion. Well, with less fearful trembling, but still. In your hand trembles a dull purple orb of arcane energy, dull enough to not pique the recruit\u2019s attention. If you\u2019re unlucky enough to encounter any rodents of unusual size, it\u2019ll be a red mist before the recruit musters up enough nerve to strike the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you walk down the pipe, no furry things attempt to harass you \u2014 the talk about Kvossian hygiene isn\u2019t just that, apparently \u2014 and your attention naturally falls to the figure carefully tiptoeing across the metal like an anxious showhorse. You observe the sashay of his wide hips for a few seconds, musing on the purpose of such feminine adornments. Was it for a lower centre of balance? To hide more muscle fibre underneath soft, pliable padding?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. It\u2019s best not to be caught doing anything that could be construed for ogling, lest Rodrigo start another round of clumsy (ambition-laden) flirting. It\u2019s a wonder that he\u2019s managed to navigate the Academy\u2019s twisted paths of backroom dealing and hidden motives <i>mostly</i> unscathed; you\u2019ve seen more talented wizards fall to more deviant demeanors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere exists, in the public eye, a certain stereotype of sorceresses, of voluptuous beauties with low-necklined robes and waves of shimmering secondary-coloured hair. The truth was usually far away. A good amount of the women that make it through the Academy\u2019s sexist rigors either glamour themselves into wrinkled crones and move to the edge of some podunk village to serve as an enigmatic apothecary; or simply go to the more matriarchal Erolus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny average citizen gaping at the beauty conjuring shows of dazzling light would likely be horrified to learn that the figure they were ogling was, more often than not, a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s nothing particularly wrong with the shapeshifting itself: one of the most effective journeymen you know is almost always in the form of a female fairy \u2014 he said it was easier to find comfortable bedding, and saved him quite a few coppers on food and ale. He never did say why it <i>had</i> to be a girl fairy, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a systemic system of predation that created these faux-sorceresses. Those talented in Jade and Light magic were taken under the wing of their superiors and given ample praise and gifts, their frequent absences from class excused through letters and assurances of \u2018private tutoring\u2019. Their ability to change shape would be honed, though the idea of learning any other kind of practical magic would be eschewed entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d be left with a simpering lapdog of a wizard, a chap who could change into a comely young lass whose proportions dwarf the effete rules of biology, but would balk at the idea of casting your most basic defense spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA student you met at enrollment, Lionel Scaffson, went down this sordid path. He was a bulky lad, \u2018round six and a half feet tall and weighing more than ten stone. Now, he spent most of his time half that weight and two feet shorter, lounging in a cushy desk in front of some slimy bureaucrat\u2019s office, resting his heavy bust on the enameled wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his credit, it seems as if Rodrigo has escaped the worst of this indoctrination, the \u2018kept man\u2019 part of it all; the hefty axe in one hand seemed to be evidence of that. Still, his views on superior-subordinate relations was distressingly unprofessional, and disappointingly transactional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could probably train that out of him, you reckon. You and Scraif \u2014 er, when he\u2019s \u2018better\u2019, you suppose \u2014 could show him the sense of accomplishment a job well done brings, and maybe trade out that gaudy axe for a more practical \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, b-boss? What is th-this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop a foot short of crashing into your charge. You were so embroiled in thought that you hadn\u2019t noticed the gradual approach of your quarry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a large golden medallion roughly your current size, a golden chain draped haphazardly on the curved metal surface. That\u2019s not what gave Rodrigo pause though; that would be the design on the medal proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s an open, diseased mouth, the gums pockmarked with rot and pulsing red with some arcane substance, the teeth either carved out of yellowing ivory or taken from the mouth of some poor sap. The sides of the metal are bone-dry, but the design proper seems to be wet as the real thing, either the work of a minor glamour or bestowed upon the jewelry by forces you don\u2019t want to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost unsettling of all, in between the teeth where the throat would normally be, sits a single bloodshot eye; the veins a red filigree, the pupil a deep inky black with no sheen or slight reflection of Rodrigo\u2019s conjured light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d you murmur to Rodrigo, but he pays no heed to your belated answer, instead swaying slowly towards the medal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop him short with a yank of his jerkin, and he lets out a squawk, shooting you a look of contempt before he realizes where his feet were taking him. \u201cThanks.\u201d he mumbles, a look of slight contrition angled at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want a circle four ward on you before you even <i>think</i> about touching that thing.\u201d you command. In seconds, a light shimmering haze surrounds you and the versi youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a display of initative that you\u2019re slightly proud of, Rodrigo starts moving his fingers of his left hand in familiar patterns, outstretching his right towards the metal. You stop him with a lighter hand than before, but his look is no less sour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not using magic on this thing,\u201d you say, dragging a finger across the metal\u2019s surface. You can feel a soft vibration of energy even through your ward. \u201cWho knows how the dammed thing\u2019ll react.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodrigo sighs dramatically, a bit of his bravado regained with the protective magic ensconcing him. \u201cWhaddya propose we do then, <i>sir</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore his tone and wave vaguely at the chain. \u201cWe have arms, don\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodrigo sags in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone looking into the pipe would see quite the sight: two ersatz oxen dragging quite the odd plow behind the two of them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That selfsame man stands by a counter near the stairs as you enter the tavern proper, still pulling his mustache like its a lifeline. He opens his mouth to say something as you pass, but a quick sour expression has him thinking elsewise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan is still seated at the table, but his mind seems to be in another place. His head is slumped facefirst on the table, his long hair forming a silver wreath around his skull. A viscous river of drool slowly makes its way across the wood grain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You take a seat at the table, unsure how to continue. Waking a wizard was a daunting task; a drunk one even more so. You wince as you recall an incident of your own: after a night carousing with a Erolusian strumpet, you had lit the wig of the brothel\u2019s madam ablaze after she shook you awake. You had paid more than a little extra for that; throwing around the name of the Order to fix slipups rarely ended well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver-tressed head to your right starts to shift around, and you flinch involuntarily. Stefan mumbles, or it could just be a collection of groans and grunts. You lean in closer, trying to catch any words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrae- Er, Sorceror Scraif?\u201d you venture. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 met the \u2018student\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContralto peals of laughter rise from your former prefect\u2019s bowed head. With great effort, Stefan raises his head, still lightly wobbling from the drink. His eyes are bleary and unfocused, but the smile on his face is solidly set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did a lot more than <i>meet</i> \u2018im, Miissteeerr <i>Meade</i>.\u201d he slurs. His breath is hot and boozy \u2014 he must\u2019ve put a lot away in the time you were gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get <i>cute</i> with me, Journeyman.\u201d he grumbles, leveling an accusatory finger at you. That very finger made its way to his left eye, impacting it not with a squelch, but with a <i>tink</i>. It hums softly with magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018A scrying orb,</i> you realize, your face blanching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaw the whoooooollleee thing.\u201d he crows. \u201cHeard it too. Turned the damn thing off after the urchin conjured hisself a <b>fuck</b>, but got it running again just in time for the show~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can practically feel decade-old cane stripes start to throb. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014 That is to say-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh <b>hush</b>.\u201d he rumbles. You quietly comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Meade that I sent up there,\u201d he sniggers, waving a delicate hand at you. \u201c\u2018Yes, Praepostor Scraif? How high should I jump, Praepostor Scraif?\u2019 A pusillanimous, deferential toady, here to steal my last scrap of \u2018thority.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look askance the tavern for anyone who might be looking, but no eyes meet yours. Even the barkeep has averted his gaze, instead tending to the side of the counter that faces away from the both of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask, the flint-edge of anger creeping into your voice.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd <i>that\u2019s</i> the man that emerged!\u201d he exclaims, shakily hoisting a cup in mock toast. He clumsily traces a sigil on the table, shifting his stool closer to yours with faint Jade glow. \u201cA chap who\u2019ll take no guff, with a voice \u2018a thunder and fist of iron!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand snakes its way below the table and rests on your thigh. Some distant part of your mind is telling you to move away, but dread curiosity and confusion roots you in place. The smile that curves his lips is disarmingly unguarded, his eyes half-lidded and hazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re like a dog, snarling at strangers \u2018n rolling over for master. My own attack dog.\u201d he murmurs. \u201cMongrel Meade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leans forward, gently swaying and chuckling lightly as your mouth opens and closes like a  Kvossian trout. You scoot backward as far as your seat will allow, all the while trying to gently dislodge his hand, but it doesn\u2019t budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn Versian strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScraif, I really do think it\u2019d be best if you\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhhhh,\u201d he whispers, pressing a small finger to your lips, and you can\u2019t help but comply. His eyes are feline past the lids half-covering them, and the mixed blue and gold slowly but inexorably approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS\u2019 good for you that I <i>like</i> dogs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re <b>really</b> not sure how to take that, but Stefan apparently does as he closes his eyes, his pert lips parting as they approach your own, a nonsyllabic coo escaping from them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, his head falls onto the table with a meaty <i>thunk</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his limbs follow shortly thereafter. Hissing in sympathy, you cup his chin and lift his head from the wood. His eyes flutter lightly otherwise but remain bleary, and a nasty red welt has started to swell on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScraif, I\u2014\u201d A sudden coughing fit overtakes you, and Stefan burbles gently in response. You can hear the breath catch in his throat. Eh, sod it. If he remembered his name tomorrow, you\u2019d be shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs slowly and inconspicuously as you can \u2014 which is to say, not at all\u2014 you slide Scraif into your arms; dipping one arm into the crook of his knee and laying the other one along his spine. It\u2019s not the ideal position to carry a peer, but you\u2019re looking for expedience, not ego-preservation.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTo your dismay, Stefan lets out a discontent moan and squirms in your arms until his face is pressed against you bicep. He shifts again, curling his body lightly against your shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep chortle rises behind you and a heavy hand falls on your shoulder. You whirl around to meet an extraordinarily ugly man, an empty eye-socket red and puckered and his teeth practically orange with Sylphroot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaw this one lurking \u2018round the pub fer <i>hours</i>,\u201d he drawls. \u201cThought she needed a stiff one \u2014 and it looks like you\u2019re giving \u2018er both kinds tanite!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe guffaws uproariously at his own joke as you quickly make your way to the stairs, balancing the tasks of head-protection and feet-collision-avoidance. Various knowing eyes and appreciative gazes are extended to you as you navigate the floor, and the rotund bartender avoids your gaze even more assiduously, if that was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking the way up the stairs is an exercise in side-stepping, and you\u2019re slightly thankful for Scraif\u2019s clingy nature: the arm that he curls around your bicep is a much-needed binding for your squirmy cargo. The sigh you let out is a mixture of consternation and relief: Wizards that get <i>this</i> drunk are like powderkegs serving double-time as candle-holders; messy, with more than a little collateral damage. This tavern got off easy considering he only got\u2026 flirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can partially sympathize with him; if you were marooned in Versiland for the better part of a few decades, you\u2019d be more than a little frustrated, in more than one way. Him smokily murmuring your name into your ear is \u2026 more difficult to justify. Sure, you stole a few looks whenever you <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">had the fortune to be</span> ended up in the baths at the same time, but you could hardly be blamed for that; the only breast you\u2019d seen before that belonged to some poxy whore in the slums of Tryzantium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that was your boyhood. You\u2019re both Circle mages, and you\u2019re held to a higher standard of conduct than horny students in the bath; you\u2019ll overlook this one night of indiscretion, provided Scraif conducts himself well on the investigation of\u2026 no, wasn\u2019t it the guarding of\u2026 hm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, he didn\u2019t even brief you. Something about murders? You unlock and open the door to your room with more than a little difficulty and dark expression. Rodrigo\u2019s bed seems to be relatively still; he\u2019s either asleep or quite good at pretending, and you can\u2019t quite muster up the motivation to care either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disentangle Scraif\u2019s arm from your own and dump him on the bed without ceremony. As expected \u2014 and to your slight relief \u2014 he barely stirs, merely emitting another low grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou survey the room, but disappointingly no cot or bed meets your gaze. Only a knackered old rocking chair on the opposite corner of the room. It\u2019ll have to do, you suppose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There is a culture somewhere in Hashan you think, that uses a rocking chair as a torture devices. The subject is strapped to the chair and left alone for days. The moment they fall asleep, slumping backwards or forwards in the chair, the chair rocks, inducing the sensation of falling and startling them awake. After a week of sleep deprivation, the subject is usually willing to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could now confirm its efficacy after a night of half-sleep, precariously propping yourself in positions to distribute your weight evenly upon sleep, only to be awoken from a scant few minutes of slumber by a loud creak and precipitous falling sensation, as your leg shifted or your elbow slipped from the chair arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is well after midnight. The revelry of the tavern has dispersed and the streets are quiet, making you now accurately aware of the pervasive, ever-present background tinkle and gurgle of the cisterns, aqueducts and waterways of Kvoss. What you judge to be every two hours, some vast, distant sluice is opened by some rumbling machinery, sending a roar of water deep underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wooden bars of the chair back dig into your spine. The two beds call to you. After days of travel to get here, how wonderful it would feel to slip between crisp sheets. You could always order Rodrigo awake, send him away on some pointless errand, make him run laps of the area until sunrise perhaps. You glance over and immediately wish you had not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a hot, sticky night, typical for Kvoss. Without the springs, the area would be a desert. With the springs, the area is a sauna. At some point during the night, Rodrigo has evidently kicked the sheets back to feel the air on his skin. His bare, naked skin. The sheets lie tangled about his feet, while the rest of his nubile, nude form is draped... displayed... over the bed. His head lies in a pool of his dark hair spread out over the pillows, his slack expression unbearably sweet and innocent in sleep, like a cherub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shaft of moonlight streaks through the tessellated window panels, casting an ornate geometric pattern over his softly rising-and-falling breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise you've been staring at them long enough to judge the movement of the moon across the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodrigo grumbles and stirs, scratching absently at one breast and rolling on to his side in his sleep. Previously tucked between his soft thighs, his flaccid manhood slips free as he does so, jarring you from your lengthy admiration of his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a grip,\" you whisper to yourself. \"He's a student.\" And one already worryingly forward and precocious. The Order is meant to instill in the recruits the idea of sublimating ones own personal pleasures in favour of a broader love for king and countrymen. True, it rarely works well in wizards. But in the boy it doesn't seem to have worked at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suspect growing up with a body like that in a predominantly all-male environment. No doubt his peers have taken liberties with him over the years, or tried to at least, by guile, force, or magic. Hell, you could list more teachers than you'd like to admit whom you wouldn't trust alone in a room with the boy .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Including yourself</i>, you think with shame, realizing your eyes have drifted back to his resplendent rack. The heat must be getting to you. Or perhaps the distance. Easy to forget ones duty this far from the empire's center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanneling a modicum of unaspected energy, you draw the sheets back up his body from the safe distance of the far side of the room. Then you shut your eyes tight and force sleep to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleeping beauty awakes,\" says the voice, half mocking, half admiring. \"You really slept there? You must be stiffer than me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to find...</span></div></div>",

You relieved and a little impressed to see he has taken the initiative to garb himself in combat attire, and is busy strapping a greave to his shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to sleep in all day or are we actually going to go catch this guy?\" he says impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armour he's donning is the standard issue leathers, and his are unmarred by sword or arrow or flame - he's as green a recruit as they come, despite what his cocksure attitude might suggest. Crafted to fit both sexes, it is delightfully shapeless and sexless, concealing the worst excesses of his curvature, though the shortsword he sling about his waist still seems to hang off his broad hips in a way that can only be described as coquettish. He looks like a girl playing at being a knight, but the first lesson learned as a wizard is the deceptiveness of appearances - you're confident he can handle himself against most humans and beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. This is so fiddly. Normally I'd have at least two guys helping me put these on,\" he says, exaggerating his pout. \"You want to help?\" he asks, holding out his tassets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A master does not play squire to his apprentice,\" you retort sharply. \"Dress yourself. Then you may dress me,\" you command, ignoring the flicker in his eyes and smile on the edge of his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise and stretch, crossing the room to where Scraif lays, unmoved from the position in which you dumped him. A gurgling snore emerges from his wide open, parched lips, about which flies are buzzing. The smell of drink is still heavy on him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pitiful sight, especially in front of a recruit. The Scraif you knew would never allowed himself, or anyone else for that matter, to drink himself into such a stupor. The years have not been kind to him. Which pused him to drink, you wonder... the loneliness; the work; or perhaps the attitudes of his superiors. Many recruits these days are women, but the upper eschelons of the Order is almost exclusively men (or at least they are men most of the time), and men whose attitudes have not been challenged or changed in hundreds of years. They do not smile kindly upon female underlings - except when having their meals brought to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodrigo relishes playing squire. You suspect he even enjoys the sharp strike from the back of your hand every time his fingers begin to reach into places they should not go, or linger too long. He is generous with his compliments, his obsequious words seemingly seeking to make amends for his actions during the night, but it is clear his comments on your physical prowess are for his own satisfaction, not yours - the sort of remarks a crass labourer might make to a woman that catches his eye upon the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you make one more comment about the size of my muscles, I swear I'll birch your hide,\" you bark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make a boy a promise...\" Rodrigo titters, dodging out of the way of your backhand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the last of your armour is donned, Scraif has yet to stir. \"Let's just leave him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give the orders here, boy.\" <i>We should just leave him.</i> \"I have yet to be briefed on the mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know all about that,\" Rodrigo replies airily. \"As a matter of fact, half the tavern have heard about what we're doing here these last few days. I'd be <i>more</i> than happy to fill you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy does everything the boy say sound like a damn innuendo? \"Fine. Let's here it.\"</span></div></div>",

He is still drunk and concussed, barely able to lift his head from the sheets or open his eyes, but his other hand finds your wrist, tightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hurts,\" you wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweeet Meade,\" he murmurs in his half sleep. \"Always playing the fool... so that we could... be together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Be together'?\" The shadowed quilts of the recruit continue to rise and fall steadily, thankfully (hopefully) asleep. \"Listen, you sot, the only times we were ever 'together' were when you had me bent over a desk with my pants around my ankles.\" Oh gods, please let Rodrigo be asleep. \"Or have you forgotten all the times you used to birch me raw?

He gives a howl of sadness and frustration, burying his head in the pillow. With words laced with venom of tormented childhood memories, you snap, \"when I saw you today, I actually felt sorry for you - a wizard stuck in his teenage years, humiliating.\" With your hand now free, you give his young body an angry, demonstrative jab. \"No wonder you haven't aged a day in 20 years. You're still hung up on some stupid teenage crush. You need to grow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a stifled snicker from the supposedly sleeping form of the recruit.

That boy was her every thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to make a comment again, when the elder holds up his hand. \"I know, I know you want to know what this has to do with anything. I'll tell you. It's Martha you see. When the boy died she had quite a shock. When we hadn't seen Martha and the boy for a couple of days we went inside their cottage. Inside the boy lied on his bed peaceful and Martha was sitting on a chair just staring at the boy. Like she was someplace far away.\" The elder shrivels. \"After that we thought things would go back to normal, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just sounds like a mother who has lost her child, cases like that are similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not!\" The elder shouts pushing his cane into the ground. Realizing what he had done, the fire in his eyes wither down. \"I'm sorry, this is just very hard for me. Things have changed around here. Martha isn't herself anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of behavior?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first she wouldn't speak with us anymore, she kept to herself.

She comes out of her cottage, visits the market stalls, even joining the women gossiping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sounds suspicious to me, it sounds like she has picked up her normal life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, she has never been like that. She was always the odd one.\" The elder grabs you by your shoulder. \"Please just go and talk to her. Maybe you can see what is wrong with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull away the hand from you. \"If that's what you're asking fine, but you know what the fine is for calling us without an emergency.\" You stand up as to prepare to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder nods as he stands up as well. He explains to you where you can find the cottage of Martha. \"I have good faith in you, and please try to help my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you leave the elder's house. Outside you stare at the dark sky. Some mission this turns out to be, most likely there was nothing and the elder had to pay the fine. But something makes you curious to what has happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go to Martha's cottage, try and speak to her if she's still up.

And as one of your old masters used to say: \"<i>Better head straight into the den of the wolf, than to walk in the meadow</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find your way to Martha's cottage thanks to the direction of the elder.

And you just had your best pair of boots on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the path you arrive at Martha's cottage, when you look back you see the village beneath you.

You can see the cottage was originally bigger, but the years of decay had it's toll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door, or what's left of it looks rather frail so you pound upon it lightly. You think you can hear some movements but you are not sure of that. When the door opens you see a young woman looking at you curiously. Her face is rather plain, but there's something of a twinkle in her eyes that give her something special. Her black long hair is braided and her figure is a bit skinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" She asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day miss. My name is Janus Meade.

Two chairs, a burning fire with a kettle on it and a large and a small bed.

How could she have seen through you that soon? Was there something involved here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have seen that ring before you know. Wizards who are graduates receive such a ring, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the ring, it is true what she says. You got this ring when you completed your trials. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true Martha, but how does a girl like you know about this?\" You ask back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha giggles again as the kettle is boiling and she prepares a few cups. \"We all have our secrets Janus, I can't tell you that one, although I can tell you I knew it from a mage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands you a cup of tea. The answer she gave is rather vague, but should you drink it? Would it be poison?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha sees your hesitation and takes a first sip. \"I don't think I would poison the tea I drank myself, Janus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and take a sip too. It doesn't taste that bad, it reminds you of the cherry trees you used to play under as a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you might know the answer why I'm here , Martha.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's a Mage, then there must be something supernatural to have happened, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod again. \"Your father is worried about you.\" You flap out. You don't know why you just told her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father? He just worries too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People say they have seen you going into the woods at midnight.\" You let out again. What's wrong with you? There must have been something in the tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha giggles again, but this time with a more serious look. \"Those are just gossip tales, rumors from some boys who want to act like they know it all, to have some status in the inn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind Martha, I would like to do a magical examination.\" You say pulling yourself up from the chair. A magical examination would determine supernatural activities in and around Martha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem is that your legs aren't moving and you return back into your chair. You feel the panic inside you. You had not foreseen this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need a magical examination Janus.

The old man, gives you half of the fine he was supposed to pay. \"What else can I do? You couldn't do anything.\" He mumbles. You tell him the demon wants to come with you. The man his eyes bulge as he pulls you at your coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sir, I know this might sound crazy, but if in her travels with you might receive a child, please give it to us.\" You realize it's the only thing he would have of his daughter. You can't promise such a thing, but if the situation occurs you will consider it you told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you made sure your horse was ready, you were now standing in the stables. Since this mission turned out to be a failure, you will have to move on. It's still night, and your horse hasn't rest that long so you will have to spend the night in the woods. The old man had offered you to spend the night at his house, but you couldn't accept that.  The nearest city is a few days on horse. In the city you could probably find someone to point you to a job for a wizard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally hear someone coming close. You turn around to see it's Zanzi, she's only wearing a long brown dress with a white shawl around her head. You can see she is barefooted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" You ask her surprised by what she's carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see she's carrying a little knapsack, but nothing else with her.

You shiver at the thought of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Zanzi asks you as she feels you shivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" You say shaking your head. \"Let's go.\" You turn the horse around and then make him run away. The villager's are surprised to see you leave so soon, but knowing your kind they rather see you leave than stay.

And it's all thanks to that girl. First she had to pee constantly the first part of your trip, you could walk even more faster than that. Then she complained about the horse walking too fast, she said she had to barf if you wouldn't go slower. You thought she was kidding, who had ever heard of someone barfing from riding on a horse? You were proven wrong fast, as she barfed next to you  when you were at a crossroad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was how things were suppose to go like, you would seriously need to get rid of her.

You would need one; with all the beasts and monsters out there you wouldn't be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back to the fire, your face is glowing with the warmth of a fire.

Just look at the fire, so small it is but how destructive it can become. The warmth it gives us, and the protection of it against the animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly love fire, don't you?\" You ask Zanzi. She really seems excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of the elements I grew up with.\" She simple answers. The meat is done at the end of the stick and she tears a piece off and gives it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a bite from it, and find it surprisingly good. Zanzi looks like she enjoys it too. You are slightly surprised when her face morphs back to her succubus self.

Her small ass jiggles up and down as she takes you in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you're about to cum, something happens inside Zanzi. Your member is stuck inside her, and slowly you can feel Zanzi feeding on you. She moans louder as you feel getting weaker. She lies with her breasts on top of you as she forces you to put her nipple inside your mouth. To your surprise there's a milk like substance getting out. Only it's not milk. It's..  You don't remember anymore, you just want to do it with Zanzi. You grab her and push her on the ground again as you feel your member getting harder again. You move inside Zanzi, it's a little difficult for some reason like she doesn't want you to move but something inside of you has been released. You move with full speed, surprising Zanzi as you kiss her like crazy. Then you turn her around as you grab her ass, and give it a few playfull slaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that you feel it, that moment you've been savoring. With as much power as you can, you push your load inside Zanzi. As Zanzi moans, you move inside her trying to give her everything you've got. When you let go off her, your cum is leaking out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you with interest, like something out of a special collection, but then everything gets dizzy inside your head. You lie down as the tent is whirling around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you.\" You mutter just before you lose your conscious. You can see Zanzi grinning wicked just as everything turns dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up...</span></div></div>",

I think I'm starting to suspect what is wrong with this village. Methinks a demon walks in your midst, and I think I know where it is...\"</span></div></div>",

Clambering over the low stone wall that pens in the animals, you slog across the soft mud, heading towards the herd of cattle huddled beneath a large oak. A number of emaciated-looking bulls lie on the ground, their breathing laboured. Their skin is an unhealthy palor, mottled with sickness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cow stands among them. It positively glows with good health. Though it looks thin, its udders are so heavily swollen it can barely move its back legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts eyes observe you with interest. Crouching beside the udder, you grab hold of the teats, pumping squirts of milk from them. As a puddle of milk pools in the dirt, the dairy cow gives a deep, pleasurable lowing. The noise seems to stir the bulls, even in their diseased state - they struggle and fail to lift themselves on trembling legs, sporting massive erections as they try to get near the female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow's moos become louder and less bovine as you continue to pump and tease the teats. Leaning closer and lifting the udder to your lips, you run your tongue along its length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmooo, suck my teats, you filthy wizard slut!\" the cow bellows suddenly, before stamping its hoof in annoyance. \"Damnit. That kinda just slipped out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shapeshifting sex demon, as you suspected. This is what had terrified the animals and most likely driven off the other cows. No wonder the villagers had been acting oddly - they had been drinking its milk, consuming its tainting essence, both sexes driven into mating frenzy. Jesse, on the cusp of puberty, would have been more susceptible than the others. Not to mention a growing boy needed to drink his milk. Poor kid. A few more days drinking that stuff and he might have become a succubus himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw your sword, raising it above the cow's thick neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, wizard, have mercy! I am no threat to you! I never meant to hurt the humans, but I had to feed. I can be of use to you. I can be yours. Bind me to your will and I will serve you faithfully.\"</span></div></div>",

Succubi are near worthless in combat being creatures of soft flesh and all. A <i>real</i> cow would probably stand a better chance in a fight. A single blow will take off its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. I can be yours. Forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What use could I possibly have for a desire demon too weak even to take human form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon's words spill out, hurried and afraid. \"If I'm weak, it's only because I'm young and starved. I was spawned only recently, cast out by my broodmother with nothing, forced to feed off these animals' lusts to survive. Allow me to serve under you and I can grow strong. <i>We</i> will grow strong, together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering your sword, you say, \"There's a broodmother here, on this plane? Tell me where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus' cow eyes grow bright with interest at your words. \"Yes! She dwells in a cavern beneath the earth, an army of my brothers and sisters crawling forth from her loins. Thousands already, hundreds more each day.\" The bovine jaw twists into a wicked smile. \"But I'll never tell you how to find her unless you bind me first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth. There are worse familiars to have than a succubus. \"Very well. Speak your terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitement fills the demons' voice. It is giddy at the thought of becoming yours. An older, more experienced succubi would have held back, calm, coy, and collected, but this one seems almost childlike as it lays out the terms of its contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise never to harm me, or allow others to harm me. You will sustain me, and in exchange I vow to serve and obey you as long as you live. Your every desire is my command. Anything you need, everything you want, I will become.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not an ungenerous offer. Most demons wouldn't be so broad in their terms of servitude, limiting their contract to only a small number of highly specific functions, but then again you do have a sword to its neck, an effective bargaining tool. Although, \"This sustenance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will lie with me each night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah. And wind up like these wretched animals,\" you scoff, gesturing to the diseased, withered bulls, half-dead from the demon's life draining touch. \"Once a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll starve! Thrice a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And have my balls rot off? Twice a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must think I was spawned yesterday! Twice a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every fortnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each Friday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every twelfth night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" the demon shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not easy shaking hands with a cow, but you manage it somehow. The terms laid out, you intone the words of the eldritch pact. As the spell finishes, spectral chains emerge from your chest, binding the demon's hands and feet before vanishing. A flush of fiery demonic energy is kindled inside your belly as the connection is established, and you feel a little of your own magic flow into her. Briefly your member stiffens, subsiding slowly to a low background arousal - one of the unfortunate side-effects of taking a desire demon for a familiar is you're doomed to be constantly, mildly horny until the connection is broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind reaches out to your own, rummaging through your thoughts. \"Master Meade...\" she croons, savouring your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep out of my head,\" you say gruffly, closing your eyes and traveling along the mental link that links you now. Her mind is like an open book, and a pornographic one at that, a jumble of uncomplicated thoughts and even simpler desires. She is currently picturing you naked (rather inaccurately it must be said) and fantasising about the nights that lay ahead for the two of you. Out of her thoughts, you find her name - Heredrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it please my master,\" Heredrine purrs, rubbing her body against yours, her large bulk knocking you into the mud, \"I've managed to save up enough energy to change my form once. Is there anyone in particular you'd like me to be?\"</span></div></div>",

We don't want to unsettle the locals any more than you already have.\" You dig up a memory from a few days back of a farmer's daughter glanced briefly in an Inn - plain, flat face, broad nose covered in freckles, dirty red hair - and toss it into her mind. She receives it like a dog with a bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor more experienced lust demons, the act of transformation is an art, the transition itself used to titillate and arouse onlookers as the demons flows sensually from one form to another, body parts forming like blossoming flowers, while others linger teasingly. Others take a more indecent approach, birthing their new form into existence, but even that has a certain flair to it. Heredrine's transformation is anything but sensual - it's an affront against nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first few moments, as a mop of curly, red hair sprouts on the cow's head, it looks rather comical. Then the skull splits apart lengthwise between the eyes, exposing the brain, and you feel your stomach turn. With a hideous crackling sound that will haunt you to your dying days, lumps of gristle and bone erupt from the cow's hide, sending sprays of yellowish bodily fluid arcing across the field. Blood vessels crawl like worms over the surface of her skin, which mottles with discolored blotches of human-like flesh. The legs snap and crumple, and the demon collapses into the dirt, a gibbering mound of broken, undulating, bloody gristle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the mental link, you feel her panic as she struggles to hold herself together. For a terrifying minute, she seems to become stuck between forms until at the last moment it all seems to snap together, the broken bones and mutilated lumps of flesh all coming together to form the farmer's daughter lying naked in the soft mud, and filthy but whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tadaa,\" Heredrine says weakly, looking close to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the most amateurish display of shapeshifting I've ever seen in my life,\" you snort. \"And where are the clothes? I suppose you expect me to concur you some now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my first time doing a human,\" she sniffs, climbing clumsily out of the dirt, taking the plain, loose-fitting dress you pluck out of the air.</span></div></div>",

One side of her face is caked in mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"does my form please you, master?\" she asks hopefully, seeing you looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does not. The bust is far too big. I told you I wanted demure.

Has the curse been lifted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The demon is dead. A succubus, as I suspected. It was a hard fight, but I was successful in defeating her. Your village is safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elder sags with relief, but as his eyes fall on Heredrine they tighten in distrust \"Who is this? I don't recognise her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Yes. Um. This is, uh, Hera. My companion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please to meet you,\" the filth-encrusted succubus says, extending her arm, but you slap her hand down before it can make contact with the Elder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wasn't with you when you rode in,\" the Elder states with suspicion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. That's because... because... she was invisible, because I cast a spell on her,\" you say weakly. The Elder seems undatisfied, so you add, \"Because I'm a Wizard.\" The combination of impatience and innate authority that the last word carries is enough to remind him of his place, and he accepts your explanation. \"Now if there's no more business to attend to, I must leave. Evidently the succubus feeding off your village came from somewhere and it's imperative I find and destroy the source as soon as possibly. Have my horse made ready, and saddle another for my companion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are no other horses, master wizard,\" Joshua says. \"The demon scared them away. Also there is still the matter of my grandson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, you'd forgotten about Jesse. Had you killed Hera, he would have reverted to his original form on the moment of her death. by keeping the demon alive, you might very well have sentenced the boy to a life as a buxom wench.</span></div></div>",

You press the back of your hand to her forehead. Either she's running one hell of a fever, or she's well on her way to becoming a full demon.The last test proves it. Rummaging through her long, blonde tresses, you locate the two small but unmistakable bony lumps jutting from her skull just above her hairline. Baby horns.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua watches you keenly as you inspect his grandson. For Jesse's sake, you walk out of earshot before giving your diagnosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The demon's essence was in the milk you took from it, that's how it was affecting your village. The boy must have been drinking it for weeks. Coupled with his age and what I suspect might be some innate magical attunement, it's taken deep hold in him. He's perhaps over half-succubus already. Best case scenario, without the milk the demon essence will just burn itself out. He'll become a normal woman, ready to be married off, settle down and start a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the best we can hope for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worst case, the essence will become self-sustaining, corrupting his body and mind further, and he'll mature into a cock-hungry sex demon, slaking his unholy appetites on the lusts of men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua pales. \"Goddess have mercy. There must be something you can do,\" he whispers desperately.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere might be, but it will take time. A stab of guilt twists in your stomach, after all it <i>is</i> your fault the boy is stuck. Had you just killed Hera, the tainting effects of her essence on the villagers would have evaporated. Your duty requires that you find and slay the Broodmother as soon as possible, but at the same time you can't just leave the boy like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of resignation, you admit, \"There's nothing I can do, but a cleric or a priestess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a chapel here!\" the Elder exclaims.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try not to laugh at the crude shack the villagers call a chapel. \"That won't be enough. It'll need to be a church or a cathedral, and a full exorcism performed by highly trained religious professionals. I can take him to the nearest town, hopefully they can provide the help he needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take him,\" the Elder says with surprising fierceness.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shame there's only the one horse, else I'd agree with you. The boy will be safe with me. Go tell him to pack, I want to get a few hours ride in before evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua goes grudgingly, nursing unspoken reservation. Glancing around, you search out your new familiar, finding her crouched beside one of the houses, peeking out at the three young men who had flanked Joshua, who are in turn ogling the fecund form of Jesse as she sits by the fire. They're making a poor job of hiding it. Their faces fall as Joshua orders Jesse away, then turns on them. You can't hear his words but you're sure he's giving then a tongue lashing.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicely done,\" you say sarcastically, stepping behind Herebrine. \"Thanks to you, that boy is more of a succubus than you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I didn't ask them to milk me!\" she shouts defensively. \"... Although I<i> did</i> enjoy it. Especially the one with the big hands...\" she giggles.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nearest town is Tulbeck, two days ride away. I'm taking the boy there. Hopefully the priestess there can purge your taint out of him.\" Two days there, two days back. You just hope the Study will be sympathetic regarding your unscheduled detour. Probably not, they hate it when wizards stray outside mission parameters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit by the fire, eating what scant food the village can provide while your horse is made ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muuum, stop it. I'll be fine,\" Jesse moans, stomping sulkily through the village towards you. A woman who could at first glance be her sister struggles to pull a heavy woolen hat over Jesse's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to make sure you wrap up warm,\" Jesse's mother says, rubbing her red, watery eyes. \"And make sure to eat right. And do everything that the wizard tells you! And don't talk to any strange men. In fact, I don't want you to talking to <i>any</i> men at all. Even if they seem nice. <i>Especially</i> if they seem nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizard!\" Jesse groans, squirming out of her mothers grip as she holds her tightly and peppers her with kisses. She hurries over to you, red-faced and sullen, shoulders slumped. \"Can we go now, please, before she starts crying again,\" she mumbles.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has a satchel slung over one shoulder and has been dressed in the only things that fit, her mother's clothes. A frayed traveling cloak, patchwork from multiple repair jobs, shields her from the cold, while underneath she wears a close-fitting, pale green dress, stretched noticeably tight around her demon-enhanced curves. Your eyes drift...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud cough startles you. Joshua stands behind you. \"The horse is ready. A word before you go, wizard,\" he says quietly, as Herebrine and Jesse race off towards the stables with childish glee. He shakes your hand firmly. \"On behalf of our humble village, I thank you for everything you've done, master wizard. Without you, the demon would undoubtedly continued to poison us, until we were all driven away, dead, or worse.\u00a0We owe you a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid. <i>But if you so much as lay a finger on my grandson, by the Goddess I swear I'll hunt you down, rip your bollocks off, and feed them to your so called companion</i>.\" He is still smiling, still shaking your hand. Your fingers have started to turn blue. \"So keep him safe and keep your hands to yourself. Understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" you wince, rubbing blood back into your fingers as he finally releases his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the stable to find your two companions squabbling over which of them gets to sit up front on the horse. Its going to be a long trip...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should by front cause I want to hold the horses mane!\" Jesse yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be front so I can feel masters cock in my ass,\" Herebrine screams back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know what that means! Stop making up words!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey scuffle briefly until you step in, physically separating them.</span></div></div>",

As you coax the horse forward, she gives an exciting, scared yelp and grips your waist, her warm body pressing into your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so going to hell for this,\" you moan despairingly, as the rocking motion of the horse causes your dick to grind against the ass of the succubus in front. Herebrine doesn't help matters, pushing herself back against you with gleefully relish, clearly delighted as your swelling member digs deeper and deeper between her buttocks. As the horse trots through the settlement, villagers gathered and watching the departure, she leans against you, lifting her body so that she's is almost riding you. She throws her head back and gives a lustful gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that. Not in public,\" you hiss into her ear, pushing her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to fall!\" Jesse shrieks suddenly, clutching you so tightly that her fingers dig into your abdomen, her soft breasts crushing against your spine. Even through three layers of clothing, you can feel her nipples raking against your back. That's when you spot Joshua among the crowd, staring with an unblinking, steely gaze. Swallowing hard, you spur the horse on, exiting the village at a swift canter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse shuts her eyes and buries her face in your shoulder, her arms wrapped around your upper chest, holding on for dear life.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mare soon slows to a gentle trot. It hasn't seen rest for days, save the few hours spent in the village, and you let it set its own unhurried pace along the uneven dirt track that winds through the bleak northern moorland. The landscape changes little as the afternoon wears on, mile after mile of brown bracken interspersed with the occasional cluster of stunted trees roll slowly past beneath an iron grey sky. It begins to drizzle. The succubus and the half-succubus snugle closer for warmth, sandwiching you between their hot demonflesh. Steam rolls off them as the rain soaks into their clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulled by the sway of the horse and the dullness of the surroundings, Jesse rests her head against your shoulder and soon begins to snore, the heat between her legs burning into your back finally abating.  Herebrine takes the closeness as an opportunity to resume her teasing, grinding herself against you, and you can no longer find it in yourself to push her away. Ever since you took her as a familiar, you've been horny as all hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you forgot to give me panties with this dress,\" she giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda noticed when I helped you on the horse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we said we'd do it every twelth <i>night</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sort of night now...\" you say, glancing around at the dark afternoon. \"Night-ish anyway. I mean, when you think about it, it's always night somewhere in the world, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you're going to feel awful after doing it wih Jesse sleeping asleep on your shoulder, but for the time being as your succubus reaches back and slides your dick out of your pants, you decide you don't care. It takes some careful manoeuvering but with perserverence you're able to hike up her dress and slide into her eagerly awaiting pussy without unhorsing yourself. Her body is like a furnace, almost painfully so. With the cock teasing she's been giving, it takes only a few moments before you're done. She doesn't seem to mind. For a succubus, the sex itself is just the foreplay, the appetiser before the feast that follows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of bony, teeth like ridges inside her snap closed around your member like a steel trap. With an orgasmic moan, she begins to feed. Your balls shrivel up like raisins and a wave of painful, numbing cold flows through your loins, spreading out over your entire body like ice in your veins. You suddenly feel very exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse stirs in her sleep, pressing herself closer. To your dismay, you realise the succubus in her is responding to your orgasm on instinct, siphoning off a portion of your physical and sexual energy for herself. Together, they're taking too much. As the creeping weakness spreads over your chest and head, you struggle to stay awake. Your mind thinks back to the field of bulls, diseased and shrunken, too weak to carry their own weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slump in the saddle like a puppet with its strings cut, unable to lift a finger or even speak, utterly drained. Herebrine slides off the shrivelled, grey thing that had been your dick. She positively glows with good health. She gives a satisfied burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt great! How was it for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gcchluh... Guuhh,\" you blurble senselessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You crazy bitch, you damn near killed me!] you scream through the mental link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, master, I thought I had it under control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[My heart nearly stopped!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-but it started again, right? I was starving, and you tasted so delicious I couldn't help myself. I've never had a human before. And anyway...,\" she says with bitter jealousy, \"I didn't see you objecting when you let Jesse have a taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghluuuhh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Let her?! I didn't <i>let her</i> do anything, she just did it! Dammit, I can't move a thing. My whole body is paralysed. How long am I stuck like this?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long, master. Most of the bulls were back on their feet after a few hours.\" Sensing your displeasure, she hurriedly adds, \"It won't hurt so much next time, I promise. I'll be gentle, and you'll adapt to it in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven seconds of fun and suddenly you feel like you've run a marathon and back. How was that fair. Your eyelids grow heavy and you black out.</span></div></div>",

Jesse is curled up by your side, while Herebrine has sprawled herself, catlike, over your body. The air is cold enough to make your breath steam but she is pleasantly warm. She looks different, healthier. She's still wearing the body of the farmer's daughter, though her skin has more colour and her figure looks stronger, more filled out. She's made some alterations, you suspect, mostly to the face to make it less homely. Spending your consumed life energy for a few cosmetic alterations...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince trying to sit up. Your entire body aches, every muscle feeling like its been wrung out. It would be unwise to make a habit of sleeping with succubi. Thank the goddess you've got twelve days before you're obligated to fuck her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour movement stirs Hera and her green eyes open. \"You're aware. How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I should have got an incubus. At least they buy you dinner before they fuck you to death. Did you put the tent up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to check your memories on how to make a tent, but yes,\" she says apologetically. \"You fell asleep and I didn't know which way we were supposed to be going so I stopped for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains the weird dreams about tents... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling to the tent entrance, you look out over a misty moorland sparkling with silver dew. The horse is sleeping beneath a blanket nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's early. The sun only just came up an hour ago. I kept watch all night,\" she says proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a pat on the head and a \"good dog.\" Then you poke Jesse awake. She moans reluctantly in half-sleep, clinging to the warmest thing she can find. For a moment you just stare as the flaxen half-succubus wraps her limber body around Herebrine, her sleepy head resting in the warm valley of the succubus' cleavage. Her nipples stand out like diamonds in the frigid air. Your member stirs, egging you towards an early-morning threesome. This time your self-control wins out. Sore and miserable, you set yourself the task of making a fire and breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour thawing and feeding, you rouse the horse, climb on its back, and resume your journey to the town of Tulbeck.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning wears on, dreary and bleak, the weary horse plodding along the track that meanders down from the moors into a sheltered, grassy valley. The meadows turned to stone-walled pastures, though these is little sign of livestock within them. The valley is quiet, serene, almost eerily so, but no more interesting, and Herebrine soon falls asleep in the saddle, tired from the nights watch. Jesse grows bored and pesters you for tales of your wizarding adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to come clean. \"To be honest, Jesse, you and your little village are the first real adventure I've been on. I only just graduated in the summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be right. You told Grandfather you were two hundred years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was just a lie. I didn't want the village to know I'm just a journey. People are more likely to respect a wizard if they think he's old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old are you really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty one. But don't tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Jesse says. \"So you <i>are</i> old!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You think so? Well how old are you?\" you ask, instantly regretting the polite inquiry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twelve!\" Jesse exclaims, her large nipples digging into your back. \"Well... eleven, but I'll be twelve next month!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... that's nice,\" you choke feebly, squirming yourself further forward, almost pushing Hera onto the horse's neck as you try to escape your transfigured charge. She follows you, her slender hands holding your waist, her firm thighs close against your legs, her perfect breasts pressed against your shoulderblades, jiggling with every movement of the horse. \"You know what, I think I'll just walk,\" you announce, dismounting swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a splash. Something warm and red sprays into the air and over your face. You look down. You've landed in a puddle of blood. It reaches up to your ankles. Your legs are covered in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeizing the reins, you pull the horse to a stop. There are pools of gore all over this turn in the road. It is only partly congealed, still fresh. There are shallow trenches in the bloody mud as though something has been dragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse is staring at you, white-faced and wide-eyed. \"What is it? Whose blood is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\"  You think &lt;<i>Wake up!</i>&gt;  to Herebrine and draw your sword. A thick cloud of flies buzzes in the air on the other side of the low pasture walls that line the track. Cautiously you approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body is so mutilated and the wool is so drenched in blood and crawling in flies, that it is a moment before you realise you're staring at the corpse of a sheep. All four leg have been hacked off at the knee, and the skin has been torn back, exposing the muscle, which has been cut away from the bones and peeled away layer by layer. The cuts of flesh fan out almost like the petals on a flower. Something has very methodically taken the sheep apart, piece by piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, across the field, is a squat cluster of farm buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerebrine is sat bolt upright on the horse, her head darting this way and that as she sniffs the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;What's wrong? You smell somebody?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head. &lt;No, but I recognise this place. This is... this is where I was spawned! Not far from here, I'm sure of it!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach tightens. &lt;That means your Broodmother is here, right? And your brothers and sisters?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Very close, yes!&gt; Hera thinks back cheerfully, evidently not sharing your mortal terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheep has been butchered, but no part of it has been eaten. Whatever killed it drew out its suffering, feeding not on its flesh but on its agony. So you're facing either a pain or fear demon. Most likely a juvenile this close to its spawning grounds, but it has fed and grown stronger, and should certainly not be underestimated. You think back to everything you learned in Demonology class, wishing now that you'd spent less time making eyes with your classmate Julia. All of a sudden, out her in the figurative and literal field, your years of training have deserted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can always run of course - continue on the road to Tulbeck and return with the militia, a party of warpriestesses and a wizard or two to scour the area of demons and hunt down this Broodmother. Or you can attempt to vanquish the demons yourself, like a heroic adventurer. Like the Meades of old.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you think about the Meades of old, you can feel a slight tingle going through your body. The Meades of old were heroes, villains and conquerors. Your forefathers would frown upon you if you would go to Tulbeck. Even your great, great, great-uncle, Hyronomous Meade (famous for doing his surname proud and yet still be a mighty warrior) would frown upon you leaving the scene with your tail between your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll go to the cave, Herebrine you know the way?\" You ask. Herebrine nods silently. \"Lead the way.\" You tell her. It's then that you're about to embark on your first adventure. You lead the horse on foot while Herebrine gives you the occasional direction. In your head you try to remember everything you learned about brood mothers. You also think about some spells you could be using. Broodmothers are famous for their large size, though if she spawns out something like Herebrine it might just be a novice broodmother. Older and wiser broodmothers would spawn more experienced succubus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way into the direction Herebrine points you to, you notice the atmosphere changes quickly. While at first everything was green, slowly the color fades away. The trees have lost their leaves, the air has become thick and you occasionally come upon the carcass of a sheep or sometimes even a wolf. It's as if the closer you get to the broodmother's cave, the more energy the broodmother seems to have sucked out. It's good that you have come now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.\" Herebrine suddenly says. Your feet stop immediately. You didn't realize you were already there as you didn't pay any attention to the path in front of you. It's a good thing that you stopped because one step more would have lead you to falling into the giant hole in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this it?\" Jesse squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is definitely it master, I can smell my broodmother down there.\" Herebrine says once more sniffing the air to make sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get down on your knees close to the hole as you look into it. There is nothing to see: the whole place is dark. It's then that you notice Jesse and quickly grab her wrist. Her hand lets go off the pebble she wanted to throw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy? Do you want them to notice we're here?\" You ask a bit angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I just wanted to know how deep it was.\" Jesse sniffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the help, but I'd rather not let them know we're up here.\" You tell Jesse. Jesse understands it and quickly steps away from the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to your horse and search your saddlebags for the rope you have. You find it and use it to tie one end to a tree trunk next to the hole. The other end you throw down into the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here's what we are going to do. Me and Herebrine will go down into the cave to find the broodmother, you Jesse stay here with the horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me alone up here? I can't do that, I'm too scared to do that.\" Jesse cowers as she grabs the hem of your robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that scary, animals won't come here. It will be much scarier down there.\" You nod towards the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you can protect me there. Up here I'll be all alone.\" Jesse says looking upwards with you with her big scary eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you can come too. But you'll do exactly what I say, if you end up dead your grandfather will kill me as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that you do a list final check. You remember a few spells that may come in handy, you have some potions with you in case you need them and your horse is tied up to a nearby tree. You then grab the rope, making sure it's sturdy enough, and make your way down the hole. After you comes Herebrine and after her comes Jesse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so your first adventure really begins....</span></div></div>",

Or the broodmother must have recently nestled here and hasn't brought up any protection of this place or she thinks she's too powerful and so she doesn't need any guards to protect her. Either way, you still have to face the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now as we go on we'll be quiet. We don't want these things to notice us, alright?\"  Herebrine and Jesse both nod their heads as you make your way into a tunnel. It's not a big a tunnel as you thought it would be. Just a few more inches and you would reach the roof of the tunnels. Odd though, you expected the tunnels to be bigger. How else would a broodmother make her way deep underground? Unless someone planted her here. That would also be an option. You've heard of dark wizards who plant these things. They then quickly disappear and leave the broodmothers on their own. And then when the time would come, they would slay them and collect the life energy they have left. Of course that would take a while, broodmothers need the life energy first to make new succubus and then in return would get more energy back. They could get as big as a house you heard telling, ugly as they would get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way inside the tunnels goes straight through. As you ponder about all these things, Herebrine is amazed at being back here. She looks her eyes out. Jesse on the other hand looks scared, twitching by every slight noise. You wonder if it was such a good idea of bringing her with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that you arrive at a fork. Two tunnels go opposite direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this is tough, I wonder which one leads to the broodmother.\" You ask yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The right one master. The right one.\" Herebrine says getting excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you so sure?\" You ask her surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master I know the scent of the one who created me. It comes from the right tunnel.\" Herebrine says impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's in that other one?\" Jesse asks clutching your robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I think it could be my brothers and sisters.\" Herebrine says hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" You ask Herebrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, I didn't spend that much time with my siblings when I was cast out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way to go? You ponder. Taking the left way would take you to Herebrine's \"siblings\". Dangerous as they are if you could find a way to get rid off them you would make a better chance against the broodmother if she would try to call upon them in a fight. However it would take some of your magical energy and time. Going right would let you face the broodmother. If you would take her out, then the other incubuses and succubuses would die too. Problem is that you're not sure how powerful she is. It could be a weakling, or it could be a powerful boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice is yours. Which way to go?</span></div></div>",

You wish you had a thief with you, but thieves are expensive and then you always have the chance that they steal the rest of your stuff too. You stop all of a sudden noticing the thin string running across. However both Herebrine and Jesse walk behind you and as such they walk right into you pushing you forward. With one of the greatest strokes of luck you manage to step across the string, not setting off the trap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be careful?!\" You ask angry pointing above you. \"You almost had me killed.\" Herebrine and Jesse then notice the net above them filled with poisonous spiders.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A bull had been killed for the purposes of your punishment. The carcass lies in the deepest catacomb of the castle of the Grey Order, putrefying. Its belly has bloated and burst. For six months it has rotted away in total darkness until with the clatter of a key and the screech of iron hinges the door is opened. A wizard enters, his mouth muffled against the thick stench. He holds a flaming torch over the carcass, examining the areas where meat still hangs from the bones. In these areas is a carpet of maggots, thousands wriggling and crawling and fighting over each other for the last scraps of rotted flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe studies them for a long time. From his cloak he takes a pair of tweezers and a glass phial. He plucks one of the squirming maggots from among the others, holds the thin pale body up towards the light to check it before dropping it into the phial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks the catacombs back to the surface, ascending through the boundary between the Colleges of the Grey and Green Orders, and from there climbing the tower to Father Rechard's study, finding the him asleep at his desk. He gently rouses the old wizard. As he leaves, he tips the maggot into the green leather chair that sits across the desk, stands back and utters an incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maggot squirms, boils and bulges, sprouting limbs, a head. You're pinned to the chair, reeling at... everything. <i>What is this place? What is this thing sitting in front of you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly it comes back to you. \"Oh...\" you croak, feeling sick. \"I was... right. It wasn't a dream. I <i>am</i> human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Rechard smiles. \"Yes, Meade. You have been sent away from us for some time. Do you remember why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was... being punished... for something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is how it is,\" Father Rechard nods sadly. \"And why were you being punished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly your human memories come back to you, though they are muddled and alien. \"I was on a mission.... I... I was trying to help someone,\" you murmur. It was a thought that had kept you sane during your punishment, at least for the first few weeks, that one thought repeating over and over in your head. \"I was trying to help someone, I'm sure of it.\" Faint memories resurface. \"There was a woman... she was in trouble...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRechard scowls darkly. The old wizard grows feral, fur bursting from his skin in ugly tufts, his claws digging into the frayed wood of the desk. \"You strayed from your post. You were supposed to be protecting your brother, yet you abandoned him when he was relying on you! The pack is only strong when we work together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt comes back to you. You and Zedicus had been assigned to root out a nest of Dark Stalkers in the tunnels beneath the city of Arundel. It should have been simple - a show of force would have sent the cowardly creatures scurrying back to the deep underdark - yet Zedicus had lost it, become bloodcrazed. He been intent on butchering every last one, firing off uncontrolled spells that injured your guide, a dwarven woman and destabilizing the tunnel. You had thrown the guide over your shoulder and bolted as the tunnel collapsed all around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zedicus was mad. He nearly killed-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still you spout this nonsense! The life of a dwarf is inconsequential compared to that of a wizard. The Colleges can not afford to lose even a single man. Had you not run, Zedicus would still be alive. I thought your punishment would have given you time to consider that... Perhaps another twelve months are in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't dare speak. The Father's anger seems to ebb away, he sinks back into his chair, an old man once again as the wolf in him retreats. \"Get out of my sight,\" he mutters. \"Don't let me see you in this office again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leave, you notice an absence, the loss of a comforting presence in your mind that has existed since the early days of your training. \"My familiar? What has become of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destroyed. In your absence, it became uncontrollable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Destroyed...</i> With sudden resolve, you realise your time with the Colleges is over.</span></div></div>",

It had been your hope that they would take at least a day to notice you gone; alas, they knew almost the second you crossed the College threshold. No doubt you had triggered some old spell cast on either the grounds or the students to tracked their movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the whole city is out to get you. The penalty for desertion is death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's market day in the Shambles. Between the crooked buildings, the street is packed with with stalls. The local butchers have expanded out into the open air to peddle their wares for the day. Slabs of red meat and plucked poultry swing from hooks. The blood and offal which flows in a runnel down the center of the street will mask your scent. The milling crowds will hide you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you pause, hunched against the side of a building, clutching a pain in your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Obsidian Creature barrels through a butchers stall in a spray of blood, mechanical limbs trailing entrails as it leaps on top of you. It's serrated metal teeth sink into the forearm you fling up to shield yourself, stopping -just barely- at the bone. With a scream of pain, you hammer against its exposed skull with your fist. It begins to shake you around like a rag doll. In a moment, its vice-like jaws will sever cleanly through your arm. The aura emanating from its obsidian bones washes over you like a wave of freezing water, sapping your magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping your free hand around its throat, you life it bodily from the ground. Its rusted claws tear lines down your chest. Locked together, you launch yourself and it into one of the stalls. It doesn't even faze it - merely collapsing the structure around you. However, a large, sharp cleaver presents itself in the ruin. You grab it, swinging it down with all your remaining strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt strikes true, cleaving apart the Obsidian Creature's head and thudding deep into the mess of pink mush and clockwork that is its brain. The animal twitches violently and goes limp, releasing your mangled arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger far enough away from the Creature to rekindle enough magic to fleshcraft shut the wounds in your arm. It's a rushed job - now your forearm looks like a lump of unmoulded clay - but all you care is that the bleeding has stopped. There can't be much left in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople are screaming and running. Witch-hunters will be alerted, assuming they're not here already. The situation is getting worse with each attack. With each spell cast, the stench of magic on you gets stronger, the trail gets easier to follow. The witch-hunters will be able to see it, a vivid rainbow of sorcerous magic that leads straight to you. Even if you could escape the city, they could track you on open ground, in dense woodland, even at night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to survive, you need to somehow remove or mask the magic energy that saturates your skin. You know of only three ways that it can be done.</span></div></div>",

Butchers were always cutting apart carcasses only to discover what they thought was a calf or a sow was in fact an ill-fortuned adventurer wrapped up in a skinsuit. The body was (assuming the butcher wasn't completely unscrupulous) handed over to the Faith, while the skinsuit was peeled away and sold to a merchant for a few copper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere. <i>Babbingtree and Sons' Skin And Costume Emporium,</i> declares a shop-front in peeling gold letters.

Surprisingly enough, the realization that you no longer had a place in the wizard's society didn't strike you, didn't torment you, didn't taunt you. You just felt a... <i>momentary emptiness</i> -- before the sudden resolve captivated you. It was as if your entire world view had changed as you committed yourself to your daring escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making it out alive with just a fork and a knife, you set off the very boundary of Tryzantium's borders, carrying the Mark of a Traitor with you -- the Obsidian shackles being last reminder of your past with the Colleges. Nowadays, you launder around the Bohemian Bounty Company, a bounty hunter agency run by your younger sister, Lia Meade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until recently, it specialized in the retrieval of valuable items and documents that had been stolen from the homes and pockets of high-ranked individuals, whereupon Lia relied upon her cat-burgling experience and skills she developed in her younger days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with your arrival, the company began to also specialize in the retrieval of something else: humans. Transforming it into a real bounty hunter agency, you sought out violent criminals and petty degenerates and brought them to justice during times when the towns and villages couldn't afford to hire watch-guards. Though your magic may have waned over the months as the dreaded metal continually emptied your pool of mana, your physical skills still remained -- a distant reminder of your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you are lying on the sofa on the second floor of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up,\" a voice resounds, as its owner struts up the stairs, revealing a blonde-haired beauty with large mammaries. And a cheeky face. \"You've got work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" You grumble, sitting upwards and staring at your sis. Lia Meade, twenty-seven years old, known cat-burglar and vigilante. Despite being one of your only two full siblings, the relationship between the two of you was never one you considered to be amicable. Perhaps it was a result of her jealously towards your sorcerer potential, perhaps it was an effect of being the only female in the family (your mother left you when she was a baby), or perhaps it was a result of you peaking on her during bathing times in the past -- you don't really know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got finished with up too,\" you stand, looking downwards at her. You suppose that you could describe her as short and mousy, if not for the large sackers that she was currently wielding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" She shrugs her shoulders, clearly enjoying the situation. It always feels like she's out to get you. \"Work calls. Besides, you butchered the last mission. Got the wrong guy at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that was hardly my fault!\" You protest, waving your arm back and forth. The horrid memories surfacing into your mind anew. \"How was I supposed to know that there were two bald, hunch-backed men in that village?! They looked exactly the same -- a chance in a million.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell that to the commissioner,\" she grins sardonically, wagging her finger. \"Anyway, there have been several disappearances in Temeos and nearby towns. Apparently, the assailant targets men in their middle age, seemingly causing them to vanish in thin air without any trace. You seem like the perfect fit, so I want you to investigate the cause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" You furrow your eyebrows. Your other bounties were a lot more straightforward than that. \"No clue as to who might have done it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that was the case, there wouldn't be any need for you, would there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble, finally departing from the comfort of the sofa and treading towards the stairs. Missions, bounties, headhunting... the hectic roundabout was sharpening the mental edge of your nerves. But mental breakdowns didn't put food on the table, and neither did the College anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janus,\" Lia calls as you walk past her. You turn, some part of you hoping to hear a word of farewell, but are greeted by the sight of her holding up a coin-purse she just swiftly pick-pocketed. \"Don't forget your wallet,\" she said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please! Y-you're mistaken about all of this!\" The man yells as the suction on him increases, forcefully sucking him inwards. He was caught in a trap and being swallowed like a sheep in quicksand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't have set your perverted mind on raping a poor, innocent child in this back alley. Receive your punishment, villain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I-I just thought you needed some a-assistance. Y-you called for help!\" He begins to plead more fervently as he sunk in even deeper. But it falls on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence! I know your kind,\" the girl objects, relishing in the horror shown on the haggard man's unshaven face. She was unaware that she had roped in an innocent barkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! P-please...\" The barkeeper continues, but it was already too late. His head had sunk into the depths of the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole body was being absorbed... absorbed into her <i>own</i>.His arms, head, torso, and legs had all swiftly sunk into her flesh, specifically her breasts. It was a horrifying sight - had anyone been there to see it. The absorption didn't last long, but it didn't end there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, eat up~!\" The innocent-looking girl says into the empty alleyway. Then it began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breasts began to violently jerk and tremble as the barkeeper's resistance increased, but the girl's breast cells tore into him like a school of piranhas, feeding on him in tiny bits as they grew and multiplied. Her oversized mammaries began shrinking as the man was consumed within them, permanently integrated. The jerking and tugging stopped once the breasts ceased to shrink, his silent screams silenced forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... only this much?\" The girl says in a disappointed voice as she examines her hangers. \"Figures that those with less mana will add less to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's name was Myra Meade. Born in the remote village of Budire to an adventurer and a peasant woman. Her father traveled as his job, so she never saw him -- and perhaps that led her to develop twisted perceptions of men. And as far as she was aware, she was an only child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe discovered magic at the age of fourteen when she scoured an abandoned hut near the river that likely belonged to an elderly witch before her untimely death. Within it, she discovered a grimoire that contained highly forbidden magicks, including the one she was using now: \"Comedet ex Avaritia\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA highly dangerous spell, it sucked its victims into the body of the user, engulfing them completely. Then, the cells within that region would begin to greedily devour its target, growing and multiplying based on the victim's magical potential. Anything undevoured would be heavily compressed and expelled from the cells as waste, to be removed from the body the natural way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyra groaned. She would be excreting dozens of pounds of feces later at night, a byproduct of her human devouring escapades. Though, she couldn't deny that it brought an ecstatic pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like mister won't be committing any more crimes!\" She happily chirped, picking up and dropping her sizable tit. <i>To think that she started out as flat as a washboard!</i> Her first victim was her childhood friend and rival who had the nerve... the sheer audacity to beg her to be his girlfriend. She flew into a rage there and then, using the spell to consume him within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How dare he look down and view her as chattel!</i> She didn't even consider the possibility that he wanted to have a romantic relationship -- rather, she was thoroughly convinced that he viewed her as property. Since then, she went on a hunt for criminals (namely, men!), delivering justice in a way that only she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all deserved it anyhow,\" Myra muttered, as she noticed a suspicious looking fellow passing by the alleyway. Smiling, she begun to approach him. <i>I shall deliver him justice</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the streets of Temeos, past the boisterousness crowd of merchants and other lollygaggers. The town didn't exactly live up to the glory of the capital, Lightgarde, but then again... none did. The people flocked about their own business, passing by you at an unprecedented pace, though there was one that seemed to want to speak to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, mister!\" The girl bounced up and down. She was a child -- about fifteen years of age -- though there was one particular trait that stood out: her breasts. Those gargantuan behemoths looked silly on such a young frame, though they seemed to have life on their own. They moved in a way that invited you, though unlike the breasts of the whores in the streets of Lightgarde, they invited you in a different way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Feed me'</i>. A memory flashed through your mind as you recalled your long-gone familiar. Yes... those breasts called out to you in the same way that he used to -- in times when his hunger needed to be sated. And that brought a chilling shiver down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, mister!\" The girl repeated, still bouncing. \"Where're you from? Who are you? What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery fiber of your being was screaming to get away from her, your expertly honed wizard's sense warning you of the upcoming perils.

Even when she stopped bouncing, the continued to, jostling and swaying as though fighting to escape the confines of the tight shirt, evidently tailored for a girl of much smaller size. It was all you could do to tear your eyes away and continue walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to keep your eyes on the mission, brother, and not that young woman's rack,\" comes a tiny voice in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting your eyes heavenward, you spot her familiar figure hopping across the rooftop from one chimney-stack to another with the agility of a cat. Lia was in her full nighttime attire - the figure-hugging leather clinging to her athletic curves, presenting quite a show for nobody but the pigeons. She slid down the smooth, red tiles of a roof, peering over a gutter. \"What are you looking up here for, dingus? Pay attention to your surroundings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngrily, you tap the earring in your left ear. \"Yeah, I <i>have</i> done this before, sis. I can find them myself - you really don't have to be looming over my shoulder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the last mission you did... consider this your evaluation,\" comes her response. \"What about that big guy over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy-set man in a bloodied apron trudges past. A butcher, returning home from work. \"Mia, I can hardly start questioning everybody in the street! You must have something else to go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is silence for a while, then, \"Well, quite a few of the missing men were known nuisances - y'know, peeping Toms and the like. Maybe there's some white knight paroling the streets, defending the honor of women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so all I need to do is look for the guy is the white plate armour,\" you reply facetiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you make some moves on a few girls, maybe that will draw our mark out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A second ago you were telling me not to-! Are you serious? Do you really want me to get pulled in by the watch as a sex pest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda,\" comes the amused voice in your ear. \"Okay. Fine, I'll be down in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earring was a neat little piece of magic - allowing the two-way transmission of sound between people. There is a sound like somebody sliding down a drainpipe and landing on a dumpster, then shortly after it begins to transmit the creak of leather, the rustle of fabric, the quiet soft grunt of somebody wiggling themselves out of ass-hugging leather armour. \"Ah, that feels good. That thing was wedged so far up my -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis! Can you please cover your earring while you're... rustling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is she up to?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets were starting to clear a little as the evening drew on. The traders shutting down their stalls, and the homes and taverns began to fill with the everyday folk. This was the time in the evening when whoever or whatever it was that you were hunting tended to strike, usually going after middle-age men last seen having a few too many to drink at the pub before last seen stumbling off home. Maybe your sister was right - maybe this thing was targeting lecherous men while inhibitions were a little diluted with booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm ready, grab my ass,\" comes the voice on the earring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm walking right towards you. Just do something as I walk past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you spot her, walking down the cobbles in your direction. She's hard to miss, dressed as she is in the garments of a bar wench - the sort of wench commonly seen at disreputable bars, whose affections are commonly negotiable. Though she is no match on the busty young woman you'd previously seen - having a much more honed, muscular physique - the waist cincing girdle does a fine job of pushing up her not-insignificant breasts. The skirt descends to just below her belt, while her boots rise to her thighs. You wonder how many daggers she has tucked in those boots, as they click-clack in your direction.</span></div></div>",

He was clearly drunk, you could even smell the booze on his breath from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your stinking paws off me, you son of a bitch, or else I--!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLia didn't get to finish. His fingers moved swiftly for a man his weight, and one of them found its way to her luscious ass, sinking inwards as he grabbed into the flesh and pulled her into him. The other found its way to her girdle, yanking it downwards and allowing the magnificent breasts to spill out. He grabbed one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing happened so quick that she couldn't even peep from shock. She didn't expect she would suddenly end up in the arms of a disgusting, heavy man who was way too unattractive for his own good. She opened her mouth to scream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and that turned out to be her fatal mistake. The man's head lunged in like a snake, firmly locking lips with her in a passionate kiss. Lia's eyes widened as his tongue began to explore the confines of her mouth, greeting her tongue as it attempted to avoid his in vain. She had suddenly turned from a bold 'femme fatale' to a meek, little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that he had a firm grasp on her as she wriggled her bottom in order to (unsuccessfully) evade his lecherous hands. Lia glanced over to you, eyes begging for help. You shrugged your shoulders. Of course, you could easily intervene, but something cause your legs to freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene was shocking to you -- it was like something out of the myths. His fingers moved along her body like tendrils, making her writhe as tried to desperately evade his grasp. But there was no escape, his vice grip held onto her like a crocodile holding its jaw shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\" The voice came through the earring, the familiar sound belonging to your sister. It was clear she gave up on escape as she pitifully looked towards you for assistance. At the same time, the drunk whipped out his cock, an impressive, veiny behemoth that was dripping with pre-cum, ready to thrust into her as he ripped aside her panties. He began lining up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hesitant. On one hand, your sister would give hell to you if you let the drunk have his way with her with his turnip-like dick. Yet, at the same time, she did want you to find the 'white knight'... and you certainly didn't want to fail your evaluation. Or you could simply watch...</span></div></div>",

You poke at the cobblestones at your feet until you locate one that feels lose. Bending down, you quickly pry up the heavy, round stone. You weigh it once in your hand, judge the distance, and hurl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone soars through the air, its aim true, dealing a glancing blow to the would-be rapist's turnip dick with a nauseating thud. The man puts his head back and howls in pure pain, staggering back into one of the carts as he nurses the bloody organ between his legs, which is now sporting more kinks in it than a human penis aught to have. It deflates like a punctured skin of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pain-maddened eyes lock onto you. For a moment he wobbles uncertainly from the drink, pain and anger, obviously sizing up whether to lunge at you or run away, but as he sees you stooping to pick up a second cobblestone, he turns and bolts in a desperate hobble, cradling his mangled manhood with pained moans. He pushes away through the crowd, though you see his head come into view occasionally, the gleam of the silver earring in his left ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLia is still in the half-paralysed state she had been during the assault, staring vacantly, her marvelous breasts still on display. You shake her roughly to her senses, and they jiggle rather beautifully. \"Come on, we need to get after him. He's the bait now, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruh-right, of course,\" she mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his weight, the man moved faster than you expected, the fear of you spurring him on, and it didn't help that Lia's immodestsly swaying tits were slowing her down, as she tries futilely to tuck them back into the torn shirt. Fortunately his size made him easy to make out through the crowds. He had the look of a sailor, with the thick silver ring through his left ear and his right arm covered in gaudy, lurid tattoos. Naturally he was heading to the docks. He knows the way better than either of you, ducking down narrow side streets you didn't know existed, so that you nearly lost him twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is!\" you cry as you see him dive into a chapel. The guy must be seeking clerical aid for his wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA priestess in her middle years halts you at the door. She raises a lantern to your faces in the darkening evening, regarding your sweaty, breathless faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Chpel of Saint Alora.\"  Her eyes flit down to take in Lia's immodest state. \"Is this man troubling you?\" the priestess says, shooting you a judging look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap, \"Damnit, priestess, get out of the-!\" but a glimmer of angry, divine light in the woman's eyes makes you hold your tongue, knowing well how little patience Saint Alora of history had for the indiscretions of men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a house of the Goddess, young man, you will let the lady speak first. Now, has this man hurt you?\" she says somewhat sympathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLia takes a moment to compose herself, finally succeeding in maneuvers two fragments of fabric over each nipple. \"No, maam, we merely need entry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is after hours. Worship hours are during daylight only, unless your need is of an urgent nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLia bites her lip. Then suddenly she blurts. \"I'm pregnant!\" The priestess's arm arches as Lia wraps her arm about your waist and drags you closer. \"I'm pregnant and need to be married. Immediately. I will not have my lover living in sin one moment longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priestess nods her hod. \"Very well. I shall go prepare the ceremony. You may wait inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the chapel, it is a high-vaulted, circular central chamber, with a statue of Saint Alora in the center, her furious bushy eyebrows glowing at the room. Though none are being allowed entry, a few remaining worshipers still pray before it, yet to be ushered out. It is a typically serene atmosphere, except for a quiet low moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's coming from there,\" Lia whispers, pointing to a door leading off from the chamber. True enough, a thin trail of blood leads to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside there are rows of bunks with crisp white sheets and bowls of clean water next to them. A sconce of herbs emits a numbing white smoke into the air. This is the ward, where the injured can come to have their wounds cleaned and stitched by priestesses and healed by prayer. Save for the weak light from the sconce, it is darkness and quiet, waiting for the influx of wounded from drunk barfights that will break out during the night. But there is at least one person in here. You can hear the soft moans from behind one of the bunks...</span></div></div>",

Strange, before you could have sworn it was the low sound of a man crying out in muffled pain or alarm. Now it sounds higher pitched and breathless, like a young woman in the throes of passion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, as it turns out, is exactly what it is. It is a teenage girl down on her hands and knees, gasping in ecstasy. Her dress was pulled down so that her truly mammoth breasts hung lose beneath her like the udders on a cow, her nipples scraping against the stone floor with each gasp of her bosom. She looks to be having or has very recently completed an intense orgasm, judging by the perspiration on her brow and trembling in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looks up, you recognize her. \"Hi mister!\" chirrups the girl from earlier. Gripping the edge of the bunk, she pulls herself to her feet, struggling a little under the weight of her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cant stop staring at those tits. They've changed. They're bigger, you know it, and there is definitely something <i>alive </i>about them. Not that tits aren't alive, at least ones not on undead, but these roil and sway with a will of their own. That wasn't it though - through the left nipple there was sporting a new piercing, a thick silver hoop that hadn't been there before. While the right breast was emblazoned with colour - adorned with familiar-looking sailor tattoos of almost-equally large breasted mermaids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take a man of your intellect to add 2+2. An feeling of dread forms in your stomach as you watch the breasts contract slightly, the rough shape of a man's face seeming to push to the surface of the skin for just a moment before being swallowed up again in the soft, succulent flesh. Somehow this girl had absorbed your sister's attacker completely. Your mind runs through all the possible threats you could be dealing with - a new kind of vampire? An ooze queen? A succubus? All creatures that would have given your wizard self a run for your money, let alone your now depowered, mundane self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" the girl asks sweetly, unfazed at her nakedness. \"I help out here, sometimes I clear up after the people that get brought in here. We get a lot of filth here. Are you sick? Usually we only let sick people in at this hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're looking for a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lia can announce to this... creature-in-female form that you're the ones hunting her, you pull her close, clamping your mouth about hers tight enough to muffle everything but the surprised squeak that emerges. Her eyes go wide as you linger the kiss, trying your best to communicate with your eyebrows the imminent danger you both are in. Her eyebrows convey one thing, though they convey it well - 'what the fuck do you think you're doing'?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What my fiance is trying to say is that we're looking for a priestess to marry us,\" you say loudly as you break the kiss, cutting off Lia's furious outburst. \"She is with child, so we're to be wed, isn't that right, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLia jaw froms into a gritted smile and she nods, though the eyebrows are still conveying - 'I'm going to kill you later'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so sweet that you're doing the right thing!  I never knew my father myself.... he left my mother before I was born... if I had my hands on him now...\" The girl's face darkens briefly then brightens suddenly. \"I'll go help prepare for the ceremony!\" she says brightly, skipping away.</span></div></div>",

No wonder - the thing was solid gold through and through, though it had been only stout oak and iron when it left the Floating Market of the goblins two months ago and several hundred miles west of here, carrying its precious cargo. The group was more than happy to deposit the load at the magus' feet. You stood forward with a crowbar with which to prise open the fused, golden padlock but Aurel brushed you aside. With a wave of his hand, the metal chest split open like a blossoming flower, divulging the contents - the three Philosopher's Stones, glowing like embers within their nest of transmuted hay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurel, who had recently celebrated his second centenary, was nonetheless giggling like a child. He descended on the artifacts like a hen over a clutch of eggs. For a moment, it looked like he would make the mistake of touching them - you really hoped he would - but at the last moment he pulled away. \"They're back... they're back!... must make plans... must tell the others... must be... alone.

Leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are matters to discuss, magus,\" you broached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then be quick about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you gestured to the Orc, Mr Green, who stood forward and produced from his pocket a small, frozen figure, handling it with a gentleness you'd never before seen from an Orc The golden statue was of a goblin woman, full-sized, though it looked like a doll in his hands. Her hands were outstretched as if to grab something, and her expression was a mixture of desire and terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have noticed, sir, or you may have not, that there are only four of our party returned. When we came upon the stones, Miss Blue, the thief, touched them... accidentally. Without her help, we'd never have gotten inside the city, nor into the vault -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you expect me to magic her back, don't,\" Aurel snapped bluntly. \"The philosopher's stones' power can't be undone - that's the whole point of them! She will remain as she is for eternity; long enough, I think, to ponder her mistake. However you may divide her amongst yourself if you wish. That's all, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing, sir.\" It was clear you were already pushing the powerful wizard's patience, but you would never get this chance again. \"The terms of our agreement were if we returned the stones, our crimes would be pardoned. All our crimes. You swore this in front of the King. <i>All</i> our crimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to repress a smile, you drew the traveling cloak up over the obsidian manacles binding your wrists. Aurel reeled away in outrage and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A deserter!\" he choked. \"No deserter has ever been forgiven. The King will hear about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure that he does, magus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been years ago, though Aurel had still to get over the trick you played on him. The King had pardoned your desertion of course along with the original crime of theft. Moreover, he'd found it rather amusing, and appointed you his court consultant on magic. In fact he'd made up the position then-and-there, simply to annoy the magi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obsidian manacles that had drained and masked your powers since your desertion from the Order were removed. Even still, your abilities have been slow to return and would likely never again be what they once were. Even a simple fireball is beyond you most days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour investments - that is to say the sorry segment of Miss Blue, smelted down into bars and coins - had paid off handsomely. Now a rich merchant with the ear of the King, you'd purchased an estate near to the city and a household of servants and slaves.

Instead the spell backfired and you were turned into a mouse instead. For weeks you ate nothing but scraps and cheese and fled from the royal feline. Your peril was a source of great amusement to that witch queen known as the princess. After almost being killed by the royal cat the princess lifted the curse that you were under. She then assigned you to two months of royal cat duty. Of course your wife and children were pleased to see you safe after your latest mishap with the princess, but they weren't keen on the idea about tending to the royal cat's needs and wishes. However, you assigned some servants to tend to the spoiled rotten feline. Who knew a cat can be so demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday you were busy doing business as usual. Thankfully the royal pain named Princess Celina wasn't around. The last thing you wanted was to be hexed again. But you feared the day when the princess would desire your position as the consultant of magic. You dreaded the very idea, but eventually as you grow older the princess will eventually take the position for herself. So away you worked on various endeavors, yet unaware that an owl sitting in the window sill was spying on you. By the time you finished the owl managed to read all the information that it needed. Once you turned around towards the window the owl took off towards the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! That pesky princess was spying on me again. No doubt she plans on blackmailing me. She's already blackmailed several magi into spilling their secrets to her. Yet if I dared speak out against the princess the king and queen would have my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true that you weren't allowed to speak ill of the princess in front of the king and queen for they truly cherished her. Yet you had your suspicions that the king and queen's recent dive into insanity was caused by Princess Celina. You had no idea what the princess could be planning, but whatever it is would be your undoing. So off you went to report to the king. By the time you reached the castle gates you spotted...</span></div></div>",

Let's be thankful that she hasn't decided to create more talking animals.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mid-winter, and the River Sene slides through the city at a crawl. You walk alongside it through the docks, kicking up the snow with your brisk pace. Aside for the taverns, this area of the city is deserted, the silence deepened by the falling snow. You have been summoned on urgent matters by your financial adviser, Bezzal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBezzal's barge is safely moored in its little inlet, and his warehouse - usually a sight of manic energy staffed by Goblin's running before their master's whip-like tongue - is now all but empty, populated only by Bezzal's small army of golems standing to attention. There'll be no trade, not while the Sene is a churning, brown slush of dirt and pulverised ice, and the roads and mountain passes blocked for the winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barge is unoccupied but the golems stand aside to permit you entry to the warehouse. In the office at the back, you find Bezzal. The Goblin is naked and strapped to one of the long, wooden tables he uses for his part exchanges. An Orc is strapped to the table beside him, the leather harnesses securing him there stretched tight over the musculature of this impressive specimen. Looking at the inadequacy of the constraints, you surmise that the Orc is here freely, though he seems unhappy about it. His massive, barrel-chest heaves in deep breaths. His entire body steams in the frigid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! A friendly face, thank gold,\" the Goblin smiles when he sees you. \"I trust these machines more than I trust anyone, but I fear if they drop me they might not have the brains to pick me up again.\" With that, he nods at a waiting golem. \"Continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem steps forward. It is a different model to the copper-and-iron sentries that guard the warehouse; this one is steel-and-brass of a more slender, refined design and it moves fluidly, taking off the Orc's head with a single stroke of the goblin knife clamped in its claw. The Orc's head rolls across the table, its body going immediately limp, and the golem moves on to its master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate this pa-\" Bezzal winces, as the blade slices through his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem wastes no time in setting the Goblin's head on the Orc's shoulders. Another flick of the knife fuses the two. He flexes his new, powerful body and sits up, the leather straps snapping like wet spaghetti. He looks absurd - a tiny, mottled-blue head sitting atop a mountainous, green body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am now,\" Bezzal says. His voice comes out a deep rumble, still his own but amplified by the bellows-like lungs of the young Orc body. \"Always a risky business, transferring, even with golems. Top of the line, totally new,\" he says, rapping the golem on its steel chestplate. \"But you never know when they might do something really stupid. Knife. Give.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause, the golem releases the knife from its mechanical claw. With it Bezzal sets about uniting his client's head with his own, old body. The resulting amalgamation is even worse. The Orc clutches his head in his thin, scaly hands, perhaps in despair, more likely to stop the weight of his massive skull snapping his scrawny, goblin neck like a dry twig. But even in that tiny body, the pouch of silver handed to him seems small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a poor price for such a trade,\" you comment, once the Orc has waddled away unsteadily. \"I wouldn't take your body for all the gold in the kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor would he,\" Bezzal chuckles. \"I convinced him it was merely a temporary swap and he'll have his body back in time for spring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And will he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I am a merchant of my word,\" the Goblin gasps in mock outrage. \"As I explained to him, I hate to be landlocked. It gets me on edge. If I don't have a river to escape on, I'd want to have a body to fight with. And this boy's body is built for fighting. When the river thaws, he can have it back. Although I may have forgotten to mention that my racial regeneration factor is a heartless bitch. In a few months, this beautiful body will be only so much paltry goblin-flesh. As will his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least his head might match his shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye. Robbed of his orc-strength, his identity... I think I might give him a job mucking out the stables...\" Bezzal runs his hands over his body gleefully, soon locating the large, green, orcish member. His eyes light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to come back later?\" you offer politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe composes himself quickly. \"No, we have important business to discuss. It would appear that...\"</span></div></div>",

Which have they hit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them,\" Bezzal says, his expression dark. \"No doubt they waited until the rivers and roads were blocked by this infernal weather before they acted. Now that we're trapped here in the city, they're free to sabotage every one of your business ventures out there. At this rate, you'll be bankrupt before spring thaws us out. They're patient, thorough, resourced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wizards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your old school friends? Most likely. Some of the incidents certainly have their filthy mark to them. A barge on it's way to Newport suddenly spontaneously combusted. In this weather! Took thirty tonnes of silk with it. Down South, fifty acres of vineyards withered and turn to dust. It will be years before we get a harvest again. A delivery of good steel weapons to the Orcland border arrived as rust. And not to mention the caravans that have just been disappearing! One crossing the Rawridge pass - understandable, certainly at this time of year - but then another within spitting distance of Arnica's city walls, in broad daylight, on a patrolled road. Now you see why I chose this body, my friend. We are at war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have come to me sooner about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye,\" Bezzal nods guiltily. \"But I had to make my own investigations first. I didn't want to involve you until absolute necessary. But then yesterday... Come with me.\" The goblin sets off at a lumbering gait down the long warehouse aisles. You follow. The steel golem, perhaps mistaking Bezzal's words as a direct order, tags along too. Soon you reach a number of large casks used for transporting wine. You recognise the vintage, Arbour red 1245, a purchase you'd made personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the only delivery that's managed to get through in the last two weeks. Thought our luck had started to change. Then one of the workers tried a snifter. Poor bastard. There's no sign of tampering on the casks but it's been replaced, every last drop, with pure, fermented bubbleberry juice. It's never seen a grape in its life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the worker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swelled up like a balloon and popped. Very unpleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill runs through you. \"My wife drinks Arbour red. This was meant for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's likely they knew only that this was a personal purchase, and gambled you might drink it yourself. It confirmed what I'd begun to suspect anyway; that there was a spy in my workforce. I dismissed the workers, and sent for you immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poison's a dirty trick even by wizard standards. If they want me dead, they should fight me and be done with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the King's favourite adviser,\" Bezzal reminds you. \"The magi wont dare kill you while you're under his protection, unless they can make it look like an accident. If you'd drunk the wine, the blame would have most likely have fallen on me, since I supplied it. Anyway, since that seems to be the route they're going, I strongly suggest you get an upgrade. Perhaps an Orc liver. Orc livers are exceptional at dealing with poisons. Free of charge.\"</span></div></div>",

They still die when you stick a sword in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. Perhaps not,\" the goblin shrugs. \"You haven't seen Aurel in many years, have you? They say he's more machine than man now, that since the recovery of the Philosopher's Stones he's been burning through his toll so fast that in a year there'll be nothing left. Perhaps this is his last revenge against you before he dies. Even still, the progression of his condition will make him powerful. You meanwhile can barely conjure a coin from behind your daughter's ear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't dare take the philosopher's stones with him; not after what happened last time. They'll be locked away safe in the college. His powers will be greatly diminished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBezzal sighs in surrender. \"It's your funeral, Mead.

Cries of pleasure would carry across the broad stretch of river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday the compound is silent and near deserted, blanketed in snow.

The half-a-dozen naked women in his arms do their best to cajole him out of the freezing weather but are eventually forced to physically drag their uncooperative client back into the brothel with their combined strength. The ornate, golden raiment and pompous hat perched on the head of the drunk was unmistakably that of the Dean.

You stand in the gap between a tavern and a bookmakers hardly wide enough to call an alley, press your back against the cold stone of the tavern and place your feet against the bookmakers, and begin the task of shimmying your way up. The buildings lean towards each other so that by the time you near the top, three stories up, sweating and exhausted, it's a squeeze to pull yourself up onto the rooftop of the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment, crouched on the snow-covered tiles, gaining confidence in your balance and relaxing the sore muscles in your legs. The chill wind quickly dries the sweat built up from your climb. When you start shivering, you decide to move on, edging carefully down the length of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a long way down but you assure yourself that should you fall, your old wizard reflexes will take over and transform you into a bird. Probably. You just need to remember to flap your wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't fall. You reach the edge and flatten yourself onto your front, crawling forward until you can see over. The tavern you're on, The Salty Oar, hangs out over the wall that surrounds the clutch of buildings that is the brothel. The largest building where the respectable clientele go for the high-price prostitutes is about ten feet of empty air away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down. A man in a gold cloak rounds the side of the building, walking the furrow in the deep snow made by his patrol. He passes out of sight and reappears a few minutes later, tracing the same path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA draconian woman leans against the side of the building, smoking a cigarette and watching the gold wizard's patrol with disinterest. She's bare-breasted and beautiful, the flakes of snow hissing as they touch her hot skin. Her entire body steams. The wizard doesn't even bat an eyelid. He's been lech'd no doubt, and well-trained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo well trained; his patrol is like clockwork. You wait until he passes by then climb to your feet and shuffle back the way you came, kicking away the snow from the roof tiles. You turn, take a deep breath, run, and leap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the building hard, knocking the wind out of your lungs, but your fingers find purchase on the windowsill. For a moment you just hang there, getting your breath back. The room beyond the window is unlit and the scarlet velvet drapes are drawn. You pull yourself up until that you're sitting on the windowsill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe draconian woman stares up at you. With the same look of disinterest, she stubs her cigarette out with her bare foot, clears her throat pointedly... With frost numb fingers, you release the coin purse from your belt and toss it down. Without a word, she plucks it from the snow and saunters inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King's suite is two floors above you, warm flickering fire light streaming through the window. Finding handholds in the old stone, you swing yourself up and away from the security of the ledge and begin the slow ascent.

Sad to say, but you're getting too old for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been much simpler to have just adopted the form of a bird and flown up, but there was always the chance Aurel would have smelled the fresh magic on you.

A centaur-skin rug lies before a fireplace of dark marble. Preserved elven heads line the walls, staring down at the huge four-poster bed with expressions of otherworldly beauty, still wearing the glamour they had on when they were decapitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the edge of the bed sits Aurel, down to his undergarments, his robe and his staff placed aside. Bezzal was right; he doesn't look well. He hasn't aged a day, but he has grown fat and his toll has consumed most of his human flesh. The entire right side of his face gleams in the firelight, converted into metal skin. There are ugly patches of metal sticking out all over his body, and his limbs look odd, the joints articulated like a golem's. Perhaps that's what he's turning into. Maybe in a few years they'll retire him and put him to work cleaning out the college toilets. That would be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up at a soft knock at the door. A woman enters. She's hashian, short and petite, wearing the full-length robe-like dress traditional in her culture. Seems like Aurel has exotic tastes. She looks young with a shy, timid demeanor that seems out of place in a brothel. She begins to disrobe, slowly casting aside the various sashes holding the garment together, finally allowing it to fall away from her shoulders just as Aurel's excitement reaches its peak. He rises from the bed, his movements jerky and robotic, and moves to embrace her.</span></div></div>",

Just as she's about to put her mouth around Aurel's shriveled little shrimp, he pulls back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like that.\" He moves across the room and retrieves his staff.<i> Shit. Had you missed your chance?</i> \"What happens next can never leave this room, whore,\" he says severely, pointing the staff at her. She nods, terrified. \"In a few moments I'm going to turn myself into something. After I've done that I want you to, uh... I want you to use me. After you've finished you will clean me and p-put me away for the next girl to use.\" He gestures to a small, rectangular, mahogany box that sits on the bedside table. \"Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods mutely. Taking his staff, the great and powerful magus lies on the sheets, his large belly protruding upwards. An incantation is spoken. Yellow sparks fly. Aaand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff drops to the sheets. Beside it lands a solid-iron, nine-inch dildo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe your luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hashian girls hesitates, her eyes flitting to the door. When the sex toy speaks, she almost jumps out of her skin. \"Do as I instructed. Pick me up.\" She almost trips in her haste to get to the bed. Trembling, she grabs the magus by the shaft. \"Not like that! Stroke me. Hold me like I'm the most precious thing in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" she nods and runs her hands clumsily up and down his length. When he speaks again, she nearly fumbles him in her alarm. You can hear the annoyance in his voice. \"Tsk tsk. I suppose that will have to make do. You may use me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly on safer territory here, the girl lies on her back on the bed, spreads her legs, and positions the faculty member at the entrance to her tight, tidy snatch. She's a very small girl and it is a very large dildo but she takes almost half of it inside her without complaint. She moves him tentatively back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This could not be more perfect,</i> you consider. <i>So long as Aurel remains in the confines of her body there is no possibility of him changing himself back. I should act now while he's helpless.</i></span></div></div>",

Besides, if you play your cards right you think you might just have a chance of walking out of here right under the guards' noses with Aurel in your *cough* possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hashian prostitute does her duty, seemingly reaching climax with the unwieldy dildo after only a short length of time. Without much fanfare, she removes the wizard from her body, rinses him briefly in a basin of water placed beside the bed, and deposits him unceremoniously in the velvet-lined mahogany box. As soon as the lid snaps shut she seems to relax a little. Hurriedly she gathers her garments from where they lay and leaves without even bothering to dress herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door is closed, you pull yourself up and tug at the window. It opens! A blast of warm air flows out, the sweet, heavy smell of expensive incense. You clamber over the sill and shut the window behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire body is shaking with cold and your fingers feel like they might drop off but at any moment the next girl could walk through that door. You have only moments in which to <i>become</i> the next girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip out of your male clothes and hide them under the bed. Standing there naked, you utter the incantation under your breath, hoping against hope that you still have the power to pull off such a spell. Almost immediately, the familiar sensations of alteration flow through you. There is a mirror on the ceiling. Figuring you might as well enjoy the view, you lie on the bed to watch the changes taking place to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first are superficial; colour seeps into skin that hasn't seen the sun in months, the pallid, goose-pimpled flesh deepening to a dark caramel. The hair that covers your limbs and chest retreat into the skin with a sharp itching pain, leaving you smooth and hairless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrands of fiery, red hair push their way through your scalp, snaking across the bedsheets. You help to tease them out with your fingers. The curly, dirt-brown hair you usually sport unfurls and grows until it is long enough to fall around your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slight paunch and beginnings of a beer belly that have dogged your physique ever since you gave up adventuring sink away. Tough old muscles melt away, vanishing between the shallow layer of flat spreading under your skin that smooths out the angles of your male physique. Your vertebrae crackle and you give an unexpected gasp of pleasure as that lower-back problem snaps into non-existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving stretched you to your final dimensions one way, the spell begins to task of plumping you out in the other direction. The sensation of your buttocks swelling against the soft golden satin sheets is divine. At the same time, your lips plump out into a voluptuous pout. But the main attraction is occurring on your chest. The breasts blossom generously, soft pink nipples sending shivers of delight through you. The changes are almost complete. Your penis shrivels and vanishes, replaced by a delicate female equivalent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while you just lay there, breathing a little heavily as you recover your energy. You made it to womanhood, and in spectacular fashion, you might add, drinking in the sight of your mirror image that hangs above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/dFWJ7aC.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/dFWJ7aC.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the spell is not complete. It's evident from your observations that Aurel is victim to the mental degradation of the golden toll; his sense-of-self is fading, he has begun to see himself more as an object than as a human being. If you're going to exploit that, you need a form that is imposing, commanding, and powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the second incantation, the changes resume. Rivulets of raven black run through your hair. Strands of bright copper remain, glowing like burning embers from between your dark locks. Your toes press against the footboard; you're growing. It's like a strong hand has taken hold of your spine and is stretching it out. Thick bands of muscle, hard and lean, return beneath the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts ache as they swell, growing at such a speed you start to wonder if they ever intend to stop, if maybe you got the spell wrong. You grab them, the pliant flesh pressing between your fingers. They stop eventually, though not before attaining a size not unlike melons. Even on a body rapidly approaching seven foot than six, they seem large. The nipples vanish into a mottling of copper-coloured scales, which spread over the breasts, flowing over your shoulders, and halting half-way up your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful, feverish heat mounts in every inch of your body, especially down below. Sliding a hand down to your pussy, the heat flowing off it feels like a furnace. For a second your fingers linger, half-tempted to plunge into your new, fiery womanhood. But you have more important matters. Rising to sit, from out of your shoulder-blades slide two powerful, leathery wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check the mirror, seeing only a statuesque draconian woman, her body screaming sex. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the business at hand... Reaching out a muscular arm, you take the mahogany box from where it sits. You pause, drumming the long, talon-like fingernails of one hand against the polish surface of the lid. Trapped inside this little container is your tormentor, one of the most powerful men in the known world. You...</span></div></div>",

Then... you open the lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, little toy,\" you purr, running your talons along his length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello indeed!\" the dildo retorts acidly, and you're amused to see it vibrate along to each word. \"I have been left waiting for far too long! Mark my words I'll be having words with your madame after this. And what manner of creature are <i>you</i>? I explicitly said I wanted <i>no animals</i>! Take your filthy fingers off me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit, how could I have forgotten that Aurel was a nasty little racist? I should have chosen my form more wisely. </i>Nevertheless, so long as he is within the confinement of the box you have no need to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Furthermore, the last girl did an unacceptable job cleaning me! I expect her to be chastised severely. Do you hear me? I want her whipped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStroking your fingers up and down his shaft, you make soft shushing noises. \"Hush, little toy. I have already spoken with her. I'm afraid the reason she didn't treat you well is because she was most disappointed with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I should hardly think that was my fault!\" Aurel cries indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said to her, a poor workman blames his tools. Alas, she is quite insistent. Tomorrow she intends to throw you away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Throw m- What an earth are you talking about?\" A note of concern enters his voice. \"Listen, obviously there has been some sort of mix-up. I am Aurel Gilderson, Magus of the Council of Five and I've paid a great deal of money to this establishment. I demand to see your madame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh long and haughtily, as if he had told an exceptional joke. \"Poor little thing, I'm afraid you're mistaken. There is no Aurel Gilderson. There never was. You are a toy, a <i>thing</i>, nothing more. You are in no position to demand anything because <i>things</i> cannot demand anything. You were purchased only last week by Mei, but she has grown most dissatisfied with you. She regrets ever buying you at all. In the morning you will be tossed in the bin, cast aside like a piece of rubbish. Do you understand your place now, little toy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little heavy handed, you think, but finally Aurel seems to twig. Excitement creeps into his voice as he speaks. \"I... I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am... I am a thing,\" the dildo replies, trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a thing, <i>what</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...m-mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owner,\" you correct him devilishly. Wrapping your fingers around his shaft, you lift him from his box, bringing him close to your lips. He vibrates against your palm in arousal. \"Luckily for you, I am a kind owner. I am willing to give you a second chance, but only if you please me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How, how may I please you, owner?\" Aurel says eagerly seizing upon his assigned role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firstly, Mei is under the curious impression that you are able to talk, one of the reasons she wishes to be rid of you. This is obviously ridiculous. Objects don't talk, do they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, owner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Objects do not make any noise at all, do they?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dildo is silent. You smile, fangs gleaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Secondly...\" You lean forward, parting your lips and taking his head into your hot mouth, running your tongue over it until you're sure it is well lubricated. To your surprise, your body react to sucking on the member by becoming lubricated down there too. <i>Don't look a gift horse in the mouth I guess.</i> \"Secondly, you will fulfill the role of a dildo until I am done with you, is that understand? It may be for minutes. It may be for hours. That is not up to you to decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt says nothing but seems to trills in your hand in silent affirmation. Good. Happy that you have gained Aurel's cooperation in his own kidnapping. Grasping the shaft tightly, feeling the imitation veins against your skin, you slide him down between your mammoth breasts, across the taut stomach, and press his head against your soft lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation is electric. You're forced to clutch the satin sheets with your free hand, biting down on your lip to stop from crying out. And he's not even inside yet. You watch as your slim pink lips start to open and swallow the head of the big, hard cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hurts a little as you push the thick member inside yourself and it takes time to get it in so far you can no longer see any details of the head. At that point you rest a moment so that your tight pussy can become accustomed to such a large object. Then slowly you work it back and forth just a little. Strangely, the sight of the dildo sliding in and out of you is more arousing to you than the actual feeling of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually your body relaxes and you're able to push it in a little more with each stroke. But for your plan to work, he will have to be inside you entirely. With an almighty effort you push the dildo in as deep as it will go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orgasm hits like a tidal wave of pleasure. The dildo is pulsating violently against your insides as it climaxes too. Unable to think, unable to do anything but throw your head back and scream in pleasure, for a moment the two wizards cease to exist. For a moment there is only the draconian woman locked in bliss with her favourite toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while to come down from that. Shaky and glistening with perspiration, you get unsteadily to your feet. The full length of the dildo is inside you. With every step it sends a shudder of pleasure through your body. Crouching to retrieve your male clothes from under the bed nearly has you moaning again. The clothes go on the fire; no point leaving any clues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, composing yourself, you walk to the door and slip out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour golden wizards stand to attention in the corridor immediately outside the King's suite. Choking down your surprise, forcing yourself not to hesitate, you saunter straight past them, naked, flushed, reeking of sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, boys,\" you growl huskily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back, it's hard not to take personal pride in the knowledge that even these lech-riddled, neutered minions are watching every sway of your dragon ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the stairs, a prostitute passes by. She fixes you with an odd, confused stare. Touching her arm lightly, you lean in and whisper in her ear, \"I'd give our magi friend a few minutes if I were you. He's exhausted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hopefully that should buy me a little time before they realise he's gone</i>, you think, descending hurriedly to the lower levels of the brothel.</span></div></div>",

Three of the creatures already lie, twitching slightly, in a box on a bed of crushed ice - itself a luxury. You intend to become the fourth. Taking your wand, you bury it in the ice, shallowly enough that your claws should be able to dig it out at the right moment. Then without hesitation you utter the incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is comforting to feel armoured plates sprout out of your body and to see your fingers merge together and clack against your swelling thumb formidable claw. It makes you feel a little more secure having these defenses, even though you know in actuality you'll be all but helpless. You fall to the wooden planks of the cart as your legs dwindle into a short, flat tail. Four pairs of legs erupt from your side to replace them, which you twitch experimentally. It's always wise to get mobility back as soon as possible after transfiguration, while the animal instincts are still fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're halfway between forms and still the size of a small dog when you hear the horses come to a stop. That was sooner than expected. A high, nasal voice calls out, \"Halt!

You're still large enough to clamber inside easily. You lay yourself on your front, legs splayed, claws out in front. Your body reels at the burning touch of the crushed ice against the flat shell of your abdomen, but you force yourself to lay still. You can hear footsteps coming round the side of the cart, yet you're still unfinished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two pops, your eyes emerge from your head on twin stalks and your body shrinks to its final size just as the tarpaulin is whipped back. A short, thin man in thick, gold-rimmed spectacles peers in. He peers around the cart, examining each item, his gaze crawling agonizingly slowly over everything. The ice is making you ache terribly. Your limbs twitch and spasm. He stares down at you lying next to your three brothers, thinks nothing of you, and moves on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This seems to be in order,\" the wizard says in barely-concealed disappointment. \"You may pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, my most gracious Lord,\" the driver mutters facetiously, spits, and whips the horses into action.</span></div></div>",

It had been a simple enough scheme to begin with - take a cheap, streamlined golem, insert it into a mold in the shape of a desirable woman, fill the mold with pink slime and leave it to congeal. Voila! Instant, obedient sex slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you weren't the first entrepreneur to think of using golems for sex but it had always been a niche market, the appeal of sticking your penis into a metal slit generally losing its appeal the first time it gets caught in a cog. You had been the first to attempt fusing the idea with a flesh-substitute in the form of slime. It should have moved thousands of units.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept the project had become mired in problems, and had only just begun to leave the production line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst there had been the problem of supply; paying huge numbers of adventurers to go out and hunt vast quantities of slimes. It wasn't cheap. Then it had taken months of experimenting with different blends to find the exact cocktail of slime breeds to produce the right colour and correct consistency. Too thick and the joints couldn't flex. Too thin and the flesh just dripped off. In the end it had required powdered cattle bones to get it to coagulate in the molds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that had been encountered the issue with the slime getting inside the golem and gumming up the intricate clockwork mechanisms. You'd had to use sealant on all the joints, applied by hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most recent problem had been caused by the adventurers cutting corners on supply as the local pink slime population fell. They'd started sneaking in highly-acidic green slimes right under the noses of the colour-blind goblins; it had contaminated every single vat, forcing you to flush them out, sterilise everything and start over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it <i>now</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the golems went insane and killed three of the production workers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me you're joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not. It hadn't even been activated yet. It just stepped off the production line and tore a guy's arm off, then proceeded to beat two others to death with it. They've barricaded the factory but its still in there. Until somebody goes in there and shuts it down, we can't resume anything.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You marched back to your estate from the port, a large Hessian burlap sack strung from your right shoulder all the way to your left waist and then back again around the back. It was filled with a commodity that was rapidly growing within the kingdom: tea. In your days of youth, tea was almost non-existent, and quite frankly unheard of. But then an explosion occurred -- a boom -- that exploded it into popularity after a young vagrant brought up the delicious liquid to the king himself. Namely, you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the king's endorsement, you have been the forerunner in its distribution to Tryzantium's market, dominating the market with a share of just below half of it. And since some of competitors bought their tea in bulk directly from you, your ships brought in over half the tea on the market. Of course, you could have easily pushed out your opposition, given that you had the king's ear and you were selling your tea double over its market value (and it was still the cheapest!), but they were mainly composed of noblemen and you definitely didn't want to bring their wrath on you. So, you just left things as it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tea that you were carrying now was the rumored Arubian tea from the distant island of Aruba, near the country of Hashaan. It was legendary in its status -- and in its price -- and you decided to import a small batch over to see if its taste would lay well on your and the king's tongues. Perhaps you could import it as a tea for noblemen, forcing them to pay a pretty penny to acquire its rich taste. But the price was off-putting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing you were quite famed for was your wit, cunning, and experimentation. Instead of travelling the easy leeway, you would always think and ponder: how could you save costs? How could your products be improved? These attributes had always led to victorious pathways and had served you well over the years. This time was no different as your mind wandered about, thinking of ways you would be able to cultivate this tea in your own gardens instead of having to sail halfway across the world to retrieve it. You were going to leave the experimentation to your young assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung, that was the word. Though you have achieved the pinnacle of power and riches for a commoner such as yourself, the splendid days of your youth evade you. Gone were the days where you bore your spear through creatures of four legs and two (and sometimes three!) as you galloped through the plains of Morovia to explore the next cave for treasures. You still practiced your arts in the spear, of course, even advising the Praetorian Guard in their training, which was quite ironic considering your position as a consultant on magic. But the days where you employed the techniques you refined over the years were long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what techniques they were too! You took only five years to fully master the principles of thrusting, slashing, and blocking, such that the polearm seemed like a natural part of your body. Thanks to your teacher, the wanderer Brovay, who would appear in various kingdoms from time to time to save them from peril, you learned the \"Minevre\" -- a quick thrust to the stomach, followed by a swing with the reverse end to the head, and finished with a slash to the legs of the opponent, all done in one uniform motion. It was practically undodgeable. And if you applied mana to it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. The reminiscing tore you apart from longing. You needed a leave -- a vacation -- perhaps to the warm lands of the south. <i>Something to talk about with the king</i>, you thought. You doubted that he would let you go: the elves were stirring up trouble once more, and he required your funding to deploy an army and deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, you were standing in front of the gates of your abode. The distance between your estate and the port was only two versts, but your thoughts had occupied your mind to the point that it quickly evaporated, as if you hadn't just walked and had teleported instead. You pushed the gate open, striding into the courtyard. You lived alone, of course, as no woman would want to marry a deserter, even if it had been a pardoned one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet something felt strange. The mana around here felt <i>too</i> dense. An ordinary human wouldn't have been able to sense it, but as a former magus, you were suffocating in it. Something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of heading towards the mansion, you took a slight detour past the shed towards your weapon's cache, where many cold steel arms had been collected over the years. It had nearly everything -- mail, axes, daggers, swords -- but most of the weaponry were polearms, such as halberds and especially spears. You spent just half a minute frisking through the stockpile before you found your most prized possession: the \"Spatium Exterminatore\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had found it in the ruins of Transmenyla, a region in Morovia. It was a four meter long spear with a tip that gleamed and reflected sunlight of its body to produce an array of rainbow colors. This legendary spear was supposedly able to \"convolute space\", according to hearsay. Whatever that meant. But interestingly enough, whenever you applied mana to it, the enemy always seemed to be eaten from the inside -- devoured by someone or something -- before its fragments would fall to the ground, stretched out as if they were a piece of rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood before the door to your mansion for a few seconds, wondering what adventures awaited you. This was just like in your youth, the fear of danger exhilarating you, though your old bones groaned in protest. You finally built up your courage, huffing once before flinging open the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElves. Two of them. Both of them were sitting in your comfortable chairs (damn them!), discussing something in Elfish. You didn't know what it was. One of them was a woman. She had blonde hair that ended in purple streaks, pointy ears, huge breasts, and was in scantily dressed clothes -- high heels extending all the way up her thighs and some sort of thin purple fabric that extended over her nipples and crotch and back again, along with a cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/JB1K2XZ.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/JB1K2XZ.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one was a man. He was also blonde, like almost all elves (those damn treehuggers!), and a crown made of wooden branches was sitting on top of his head. He also wore a majestic green robe and cloak that seemed to reflect the sun itself. You recognized him from your discussions with your king. This was the elven king! His own self! You weren't sure why he was here, but you knew it didn't bode well for you. Rumors of his strength floated around, and you were quite sure that your death was imminent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! There he--\" The woman began, but you didn't let her finish, already leaping forwards with your spear in hand, and battle cry erupting from your throat. You seemed to have caught them off-guard, as their bewildered faces let you know that they weren't expecting an attack. And you weren't going to give them time to recoup and knock you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplying mana to your spear, you quickly thrust it towards the stomach of the king. Not expecting this brazen move, he only just barely managed to teleport a few feet away before the polearm would have skewered him on the spot. But he wasn't your target. After all, how could you, a mere mortal, hope to bring down the king himself? No, you knew you were going to die, but you definitely weren't going to die alone. You quickly shifted your spear to your intended target, aiming at the stomach of the elven lady sitting in your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shocked look was still present when the spear pierced her stomach. The same effect that you have seen many times began to occur, as her stomach seemed to have begun to be sucked into a vortex. An invisible force knocked you back at the same time, probably a telekinesis spell cast by the elven king. You slammed into the wall of your house, and everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma, are you all right?\" You heard a male voice resound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... yes, Lysa.\" The woman replied. \"I didn't expect my little Jany to attack all of a sudden. With <i>cavum nigrus</i> too! Thankfully, I whisked it away to the outer cosmos. Any other, and they wouldn't be able to heal themselves after half their stomach is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Cavum nigrus</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... it is a spell that applies a heavy force on surrounding object... I have last seen it two thousand and some years ago. I would have never thought little Jany had mastered. I suppose my blood does run in him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cracked your eye open. They didn't seem to be attacking you. And they were speaking in <i>human tongue</i> too! The woman seemed to have also noticed that, as she ran up to you (stomach was completely intact!) and pulled you towards her breasts for a deep embrace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Jany!\" She exclaimed. You briefly thought her aim was to suffocate you, that was how tight the embrace was. \"I haven't seen you since you were a little baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... who are you?\" You choked out, gasping for air as you wriggled in her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you recognize me? It's me, Arlayna, your grandmother! Your father's mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, yes, now that you thought about it, you did remember your father mentioning that his mother was an elf. But you hadn't ever seen her: at least, not that you remember. But, thinking about it, she was probably telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why is the elven king here?\" You nodded towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, meet Lysa! He's your cousin.\" Your eyes bulged. The elven king was your cousin?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lysanthir.\" He quietly corrected her. \"880 years of age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...pleased to meet you,\" you slowly drew out. \"Uh, Arlayna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... grandma, why are you here?\" You ask her hesitantly. Why would she suddenly turn up all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is about your children. Or lack thereof. I have heard that you haven't had any yet. That will not do at all. The Meade line must continue. So I have come here to return your youth, so that...</span></div></div>",

Why does it skin sag so, as though it is made of a soft dough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightly for a woman of er *ahem* stature, your grandmother skips across the room to stand behind you, her breasts squishing against your back. Normally you would have never allowed one of the <i>enemy</i> to see your back, let alone be within stabbing range of it, but there is something about this woman that bypasses your guard more effectively than a vorpal blade, some strange aura of knitting and cookies that evokes an overpowering sense of security. Despite your years and social stature, there is little you want more right now than her to tuck you into a warm bed and read you a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands caress your cheeks. \"Janny is a little old and he may have a few wrinkles here or there,\" she admits. \"Though normally he would be as immortal as you or I, were it not for a slight case of obsidian poisoning. Nothing a warm glass of milk from his grandmother won't cure,\" she purrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is the rustle of clothing, or maybe just the snap of a taut elastic band, and strong hands grip the side of your head, gentle but firmly twisting you around. \"That doesn't look like a cup,\" you mumble as she positions your mouth around her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If only I could bottle this sweet ambrosia, I could sell it for far more than tea', thinks the dwindling voice of the adult trader in you. The inner child, or rather the inner baby, that is currently firmly in control can only think of the two wonderful breasts filling its entire world and how wonderfully delicious the milk squirting against the back of your throat tastes. Arlayna gives a grunt of pleasure at the modicum of relief granted her painfully swollen breasts, pushing Janny's head closer as your tongue laps at her tits. Elven childhood could last decades, even indefinitely, and elven mothers were designed to provide sustenance during that time, while the half-elven children she had born the Meade family tended to leave the teat after only a few years. Her breasts are still achingly full from the time she had birthed your father, over half a century ago. \"Drink deep, my child,\" she sighed, tipping her head back in ecstasy. \"Please. Don't stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour belly is warm and full but you continued to feed greedily. As you do, the wrinkles about your eyes begin to smoothen and the distinguished grey upon your temples darkens once again. The tips of your ears grow a fraction more pointed as grandmother's milk awakens some dormant elven part of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happens if I don't stop?</i> you wonder dimly. <i>Will I become fully elven? Will I even become an elven child, not even a century in age, barely a todler by their standards? A part of me wants to find out...</i></span></div></div>",

You have ripened to an old age of 54, though you have kept your appearance more youthful than it should have been, no thanks to the supply of supplements that you have been consuming of lately. And yet, being a former deserter, the trouble that your reputation brought you preceded your position. Nobles scoffed at the idea of marrying you, and commoners feared you lest they wanted to have their heads lopped off. You are the king's consultant, after all, even if your rank of nobility is absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haa...\" You sigh, as you sift through the papers of upcoming imperial decrees. Approving the king's monetary management was also part of your tasks, though they mainly consisted of putting your stamp on them, not wanting to irritate his kingship too much. Still, you always had the opportunity to protest a tax increase on incoming merchant goods, being one yourself, and possibly even get it revoked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need at least some nobility,\" You say, clicking your tongue. You had settled down with a young woman of a mayor of a local town, and had two children, a boy and a girl, yet you felt that this has all been superficial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have made myself who I am! I have built my fortune - my way up! Yet why do I have to settle for some peasant wife?!\" You exclaim, burying your face inside the trenches of your palms. Yes, despite being highly rich, thanks to your lost companion, and the right hand of the king, nobility evades you. Despite searching high and low for a noble wife, your goals seem to elude you. You strive to join the noble ranks - to leave your name in history - but it seems that fate had other plans for you. Just then, a knock is heard on your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I permit you to come in and speak,\" Your voice resounds. You might not be a noble, but let all the gods in the world be damned if you don't act as one. The door creaks open as the stature of an old, yet sturdy and upright, man walks in, his military gait deceiving his age. This was your head butler, Rievus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's you, my good butler,\" You slacken as you recognize the familiar face. \"What brings you here? Do you have some news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly man corrected his glasses on the bridge of his nose before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, my lord. I have found her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You furrow your eyebrows. What could he possibly be referring to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have found her,\" He repeats. \"A noble lady, desiring marriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyebrows raise this time. Now this is interesting... You have spent over 20 years searching for the one to elevate your status to nobility, and now one has just fallen out of the blue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir. Her name is Lady Casandra, a high-ranking noble from Versiland, who has arrived to this nation in search of suitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Versiland...?\" You scrunch your brows, deep in thought. \"Does such a nation even exist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have looked up the documents for this occasion and have discovered that it is indeed a faraway nation. You have no need to worry. We even have an ambassadress in court. Beautiful thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulders relax. It is well known throughout the court that marrying a high ranking noble from a nation that has foreign relations with Tryzantium will yield a lesser noble title to the spouse as well. Not only that, the title was heritable as well. While you preferred a title of duke or maybe even earl, you could always work your way up from a baron. The hard part was actually getting one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, is she...?\" You ask, and Rievus nods his head. \"Gorgeous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou straighten out and cough briefly before addressing the butler, \"Arrange a meeting for us as soon as possible. I would like to meet her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRievus only smiles in response. \"I have thought that you would say that. She is already in the dining hall, being served the finest tea that we have. Now would be the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as you roll your eyes, \"Normally, I would have your head off for insubordination, but... I suppose you know me too well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRievus only mutters, \"With pleasure\" as you pass by him, trying to preserve your noble air. You wanted to laugh. You wanted to shout. You wanted to jump. Finally! After all this time, an opportunity had presented itself. Sure, she might have come from a distant land, but she was a noble! This was your chance to ascend to even higher realms of power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gracefully walk into the dining hall as you gasp from the appearance you see in front of you. A woman is sitting in front of you, slowly sipping tea from her cup, as a maid walks up and places another one on the opposing end of the table, no doubt for you. She is elegant, graceful, beautiful, and all manners of confident and noble. You have to force the muscles of your jaw to remain still so that you don't embarrass yourself as you gaze at her rich blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough, alerting everyone of your presence, as you enter and take a seat by the table. The steaming hot tea sits in front of you. The tea was your pride and joy. You have specially culminated different herbs for the production of tea, and you have been hailed as the greatest tea entrepreneur in the nation. Right now, a tea of '<i>Capebleux</i>' was positioned in front of you and the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite nice,\" the lady suddenly begins to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? I'm quite please,\" You reply as you take a sip from your own cup. Ah, it really is a fine tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume that you are the noble of this house,\" the lady spake, once more taking a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I am not a noble,\" you begin, and see that her face seems to darken. \"But I am a man of great power. Why, I'm the king's right hand some would say!\" Her mood seemed to instantly brighten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" You continue, standing up and walking to the window. \"Fame, wealth, power, I have it all! I just don't have one thing, and you possess it, my fair lady-\" You turn around and slightly flinch. You rub your eyes as you look again. Did you see things?

It is way the shadows fall across her lap or... a crease in the fabric. Your heart beasts a little faster. Could it even be... a chastity belt? That sultry pout of her lips, the way she holds your gaze with such forwardness, even the manner in which she sits, legs parted... her whole body screams that of a sensual, even wanton woman desperately in need of a man. No doubt a woman of high standing given over to such passions would be needing of a chastity belt. No doubt a stout one judging by how it tents her skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to catch your gaze, she shifts lightly in her seat, crossing her legs elegantly and dropping her hands lightly into her lap. She blushes nervously, playing with the satin of her skirts. Biting her lip, she lowers her gaze and says, \"And what is this thing that I possess, that you are so keen to get your hands on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-why your knob - uh, your noble line of course,\" you bluster. Remembering to whom you speak, you hurriedly add, \"I hope you don't think me too forward in this, my lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs delicately, raising one hand to her mouth, while the other remains resolutely in her lap. \"Oh, no not at all. I admire a man who knows what he wants and is open about it. But is that all you want of me?\" she inquires, leaning forward intently. Her elbow rests on the table,  her arm underneath her bust lifting the soft flesh of one breast until it seems almost ready to pop from its brazier. Her little finger plays with the tip of the spoon in the teacup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard. Impetuously you throw yourself into the seat opposite her, seizing both of her dainty hands in your own. She shifts her chair forward a little under the table. \"Of course it is not only your title and lineage that I seek, my dear!\" you gasp. \"You are far more to me than that. Those things are merely the tools with which I will give you the life that a woman of your bearing, of your beauty truly deserves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezes your hands. \"Do go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart pounds in your chest. \"I will shower you with riches the likes of which you have never seen. Gold. Gems. Expensive perfumes from the east. Our wedding will be in the cathedral itself and you will have a dozen servant girls to carry your train, which will be of the finest lace. And afterwards I shall find us an estate to call our own, where we shall live out our lives in perfect love and contentment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How wonderful,\" she replies, eyes glittering with happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you shall be the belle of the king's court. All the ladies will look upon you, green with envy, at every banquet and ball as you promenade in the finest silken dresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds magical,\" she sighs, moving closer across the table, so close her lips are almost touching yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in time, through our love, you shall bear me many healthy, wonderful children.

Her fingers stroke the back of your hand. \"Could I meet him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft sole of her slipper nudges against the side of your leg beneath the table. You sit bolt upright in your chair as her foot strokes ever so slowly up and down the side of your calf. \"Would you introduce me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I would be deli- nothing would bring me more happiness than to show you off - show you <i>to</i> the king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you do it... soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-tomorrow?\" you echo incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles sweetly. \"Yes, tomorrow. For, as you know, I am many months travel from my homeland. Unable as I am to ask my father's permission to marry you, I must instead ask permission of the king.\" The soft touch of her foot withdraws suddenly. \"Unless of course you wish to wait. I could always send a letter if you'd prefer. Assuming the weather is right and that the message does not get intercepted by bandits along the way, we could be wedded by, oh, next winter?\" She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next winter?!\" you gasp. \"No! My lady, prepare your finest clothes, for tomorrow you shall have an audience with the king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips curl into a toothy grin. \"Wonderful,\" she purrs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walk to the king's chamber in your finest gown, with a cape draped over your shoulders. You dressed elegantly, for, after all, it was a meeting with a king. And a king is the ruler of the people whom all must adore and worship. You would be damned if you would appear before such a figure without your finest apparel. It only took a couple minutes for you to obtain approval into the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty, I am pleased to see you,\" You greet him, following the rules of etiquette set from time beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoh, it's you, Maede. How very nice of you to come visit this aging man. I become bored quite easily these days, unfortunately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the king. His aging figure propped up on the throne, wrinkles abound everywhere. Though he was younger than you, he unfortunately could not ingest any elixirs, nor other potions to maintain his youth. After all, it would dilute his blue, aristocratic bloodline, and that is the very last thing he would want. And thus, he aged much more quickly than you did, to both his and your dismay. After all, though you might have been prone to jealousy when it came to high ranking positions, the king and you were very close. Some would even say friends. The two of you have really bonded over the years, sharing much joy and laughter together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize, Your Majesty. Business has been very busy lately. I wish I could have more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable,\" the king says, stroking the fat layers of his chin. He used to be so vigorous, so full of youth when you had met him. But his age caught up, he could not be as active as before, and his appetite had not settled down, causing him to obtain quite a pot belly. \"But, I wonder... for what reason have you come to seek an audience with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. I have come to seek an audience for a very important reason. I want to marry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see the king's ears perk up. \"Hoh, what's this about? Aren't you already married?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. However, as you might know, my wife is from a commoner class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I have always found it to be a pity. I like you, after all. I had wanted to give my daughter's hand to you in marriage, but...\" His voice trails off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. Kings and their bloodline could not just dilute their blood willy nilly, without a good reason. It was taboo, and even the king could not overcome it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that, I have found a noblewoman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king jumped out of his throne. Or tried to, at least, as he huffed from straining himself, belly shaking violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you mean...?\" The king began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. I request that you would kindly meet her, and approve of her marriage to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king sat back into his throne, looking sullen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm busy at the moment... unfortunately. But fret not, my loyal friend. Servant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA servant came into the room, carrying a scroll on a pillow within his palms, carefully moving as to not drop it. It was red, engraved in various symbols of the royal crest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...!\" You exclaim, recognizing it. It is a royal contract, worth a fortune, only one every 50 years was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. This will legally bind the two people who sign it, causing them to become inseparable, and locking them into their new forms for all eternity. Age will not separate the two, and only the enchanted blade of a dragon's tooth will be able to harm you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... something so valuable...\" You begin, but are cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. Take it. You have been a wise and loyal public servant of mine for many year. Go on. Take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitantly stretch out your arm, grasping the legendary scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I thank thee, Your Majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry. I wish you happiness and good fortune. Ah, I still remember when you appeared in front of me in my youthful days, a daring adventurer might I say. To relieve yourself of a deserter status in such a way... you had me fooled. But it was a hearty laughter that you brought me. Go, and be happy with your newfound one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were standing in front of your manor, scroll grasped in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she here?\" You ask your butler, Rievus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and waiting quite patiently for you,\" He affirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... did you check...?\" You hesitantly, gulping from the sheer nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour butler smiles, fishing out a vile filled with a viscous, blue liquid. \"There are no worries. I extracted some during her sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the gods!\" You exclaim, examining the vial carefully. \"This blood... why, this supersedes enough the king's blue blood. Just how much nobility is within her? She must have come from a very long line of kings and queens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a couple more seconds to examine it, to make sure your eyes didn't deceive you, you pass the vial back to the butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rievus, I will be in there with our dear guest. I would like to ask you to make sure that no one interrupts us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily enter the manor, heading immediately to the dining room, where the noblewoman is once more sitting and drinking hot tea. <i>Belleyeux</i> this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh, you are back so soon? You must have sensed my loneliness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have came as soon as possible to be a bringer of good news,\" You say, taking her gentle, warm handing and giving it a kiss on the back of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? The king has agreed to meet us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even better, my lady,\" You say, thrusting out the scroll. A gasp could be heard escaping her lips - she understood what the scroll meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you said that you are not a noble, right?\" She hesitantly asks, gazing into your eyes as both her hands rest on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not, unfortunately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet... you were given such a treasure...? From the king himself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile wryly. \"I did say that I have a high amount of authority over the king, did I not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see her biting her lip, squirming in place, no doubt becoming lost in her fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I see.\" She says, turning to gaze deep into your eyes. \"My lor... no, Darling. I can feel it. You will be the most perfect wif... ahem, husband for me to spread my influence. Why, with the amount of power that you have, and my noble lineage, we could rule over the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is what you desire, my lady,\" You respond, smiling, bowing to her in an extravagantly acting form. It seems that your power and influence have charmed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" she moans, biting her lip and squirming in the seat once more. \"I cannot take it anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" You exclaim, surprised by her sudden outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, we must consummate at once!\" She leans in, and begins to stroke your unshaved cheek. Surprised by her actions, you fall backwards, landing on the floor as the lady leans in even closer and begins nibbling your ear. \"But this is not the place to do this. Come, drink this, and we will begin... in your quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets a small bottle of liquid onto the ground beside you, while playing with your ear with the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this for?\" You ask, curiously looking at the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is nothing. A simple aphrodisiac. I am a very needy ma... woman in bed. Come, drink and join me,\" the lady says as she sashays off into the direction of your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug your shoulders, amused, and delighted with this development.

In your giddiness, you toss the driver a week's wage and skip lightly down the street to number 16, gaily singing an old romantic sonnet from your younger, courting years to youself. \"I have often walked down the street before. But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before. All at once am I several stories high, knowing I'm on the street where you live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're about to launch into your second rendition, you realise that you <i>have</i> walked down this street before. Why, this is the street on which lives the wonderfully wealthy textile trader, Jaxon Soames, with whom you have done good business with on many occasions. And right here is his house! Number... sixteen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow strange. You are sure you would have heard word if he was planning to move home. You glance at the napkin, wondering if Lady Casandra intended to write 91 instead of 16. Surely there is some mix-up. Perplexed, you approach the door and pull the heavy chain for the bell, already preparing your apology to Master Soames for your embarrassing intrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the face that answers the door is neither Soames, nor his wife, nor the butler. A cherubic, rosy-cheeked face stares up at you with bright blue eyes. There are flowers in her golden curls. The woman, nay barely more than a girl, is dressed in the simple clothing of a servant girl, a dripping, red washrag held in one hand. \"What is it?\" she says, her freckled nose crinkling in the cutest of ways as she squints at you in suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, I was under the impression that this was the home of Mister Soames.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Soames aint alive no - uh, I mean he aint, um, livin' here no more,\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean he's moved house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somethin' like that,\" the girl grumbles and moves to shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me start over,\" you smile sweetly, as the door rebounds off your foot with some force. \"I am actually here to see the lady of the house, evidently the new owner of this property and no doubt your mistress, Lady Casandra. I have been able to think of nothing else since the moment I met her. She fills my every waking thought. My loins burn for her. I <i>must</i> see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's shoes squeak against the marble floor as you firmly force open the door with her behind it. The entrance hall is exactly as you remember it, still hung with the tapestries that your friend had been so fond of. \"Why, he's left without taking his possessions with him! He must have been in quite the hurry to sell to your Lady! Some of these tapestries are worth quite a fortune - she must have made him quite an offer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant girl stamps her foot. \"Hey! This aint a good time! You can't just barge in here!\" Her slow, accented drawl and stubborn manner only serves to endear her to you more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sweet girl, what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lot- Lotte.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Little Lotte, surely you would not stand in the way of true love,\" you laugh. \"Evidently your lady has not told you about me yet. understandable, her arrival into my life came only yesterday, though it seems like a lifetime. I am her fiance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hah! The little scamp has quite the quick mouth on her! 'Which one' indeed. Most amusing.</i> You pat her golden head avuncularly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your gaze upwards, you hear the sound of movement on the floor above and say, \"I can hear that your mistress is busy. I shall wait in the parlour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotte's hands seize your arm as you push open the door into the parlour. A rather remarkable sight greets your eyes. What was normally a very well kept and tidy room was completely eschew. The leather armchair that stood before the fireplace had completely fallen over, the rug was missing, and the full-sized portrait that hung upon the mantle had been taken down, revealing a safe embedded into the wall behind, the door of which hung open. It was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least he remembered to clear out his safe before he left!\" you chuckle, stepping forward to pick up the fallen armchair. Something crunches underfoot. You look down. Fragments of green glass are scattered everywhere, while the jagged neck of broken wine bottle has rolled beneath the couch. A bucket of red, soapy water sits beside a large reddish-brown smear that coats the floor. It dawns on you slowly. \"I think I see what happened here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can explain! It wasn't my fault! It aint what it looks like!\" Lotte spurts, resembling a frightened deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cluck your tongue at her. \"Enough of that, little miss. You can't just go around dropping bottles and spilling red wine everywhere, and thinking you can get away with it.\" You crouch down to her level to fix her sternly in the eye, or at least as sternly as you can muster with those doe-yes staring back at you. \"Now, soon your mistress and I shall be wed which, as the man of the house, will make you a part of my household.\" Not wanting to frighten her too much, you soften your tone and ruffle her hair. \"I will not mention it to the lady this once, so long as you put in good word for me,\" you say with a wink. You point to the brown smear. \"And finish cleaning that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard and nodding, Lotte sinks to her hands and knees, attacking the stain with the rag with some gusto. Righting the armchair, you sit yourself down to wait, the only sounds coming from the slosh-slosh of the servant girl's cleaning bucket and a faint, light tinkle that seems to be coming from the ceiling. The crystal chandeleir hanging in the center of the room is bouncing ever-so-slightly to a distant, rhythmic thud on the floor above, setting the thousands of beads rattling. Curious...</span></div></div>",

Her arms are crimson to the elbows. She squeezes out the rag in the bucket of suds and takes the handle, the water sloshing over the brim. It looks far too heavy for such a slip of a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to help you with that... my... dear...\" With a confused look your way, she lifts the bucket with ease with one slender arm. \"You're stronger than you look, little one,\" you call after her as she carries it to the kitchen. You hear the creak of the old iron pump and she returns with a pail of fresh water. \"I suppose a lifetime of manual labour will strengthen a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't too long before the floorboards are spotless. \"A splendid job,\" you remark with a smile. \"I'd wager you've done that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you could say that,\" she says with a smirk. She wipes her brow with the back of one hand and blows a lose curl out of her eyes. \"It's always me who ends up cleaning up after Cassar- Cassandra whenever she makes a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that <i>is</i> your job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs in a non-committal way and sets to rinsing the red off her forearms. The skin beneath is white as milk, though a series of long, crisscrossing scars mar the flawlessness. Your blood curdles at the thought of how such a dainty thing could come to such harm. She notices your stares but makes no effort to hide the marks. She runs the side of her thumb over one particularly jagged one, an expression of fond reminiscence passing over her face as she does. Most girls would be embarrassed to display such flaws to the world and yet she seems almost proud of them, once again confronting your gaze with a bold attitude that would not seem out of place on a teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have a hard life where you come from?\" you inquire with utmost gentleness, wanting to stretch out your arm and trace those scars with your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it ain't that bad of a life,\" she says, half-smile appearing on her face. \"I mean, sure, there were many times where I had to backstab people in order to do the job. I'm kinda weak after all. But I pulled through every time, struggled, and survived!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor thing. She had obviously lived a harsh life, having to lie and deceive in order to obtain a drop of water or single morsel of bread. Those scars on her arms were an indication of the struggles she's lived through. A legacy of all the nobles who had used and beat her. A reminiscence of all the times she's been caught stealing from the market. She had obviously not lived any better if she considered this life to be anything other than daunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo other nobles, this was of no concern, but you had prided yourself in your kindness. Being a former <i>deserter</i>, you understood the pleas of the weak and the exiled. You would need to talk to Lady Cassandra about this once you two wed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor thing,\" you remark, reaching out to pat her head. \"Poor, poor thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you making fun of me, mister?!\" She scoffs, placing her hand upon yours and squeezing it lightly. How quaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, catch,\" you say, reaching into your pocket for a gold coin and flicking it at her. Her eyes widen to the size of two large plates, before she nimbly jumps upwards to claim her prize. You feel something hit your leg and graze your knee, rubbing against it. You glance downwards as she swiftly lands on her feet, but notice nothing of particular. Did her leg graze you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I mean, what's my mission this time, sir?\" She exhales, twirling the gold coin between her fingers as the light glints in the shiny metal. \"Do you want me to rid you of someone? Or maybe provide you services?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle at her cute attempts to impress you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it. It is yours. Go buy yourself something nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaaaaat?\" She yells, staring intensely at the radiant metal. \"You mean I can just have it? Seriously? I... um, thank you, kind sir! N-no one has ever done such a thing to me before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is of no importance,\" you smile, ruffling through her hair once more. The silky strands flow through your fingers. \"Just remember to work diligently under me. Anyway, may I be so kind as to request to see my beloved Lady Cassandra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Lotte freezes, her nervous body twitching as she stutters out the words. \"C-Cassar...Cassandra is b-busy right now with... stuff. I... I will go upstairs to call her right n-now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices the pail of water occupying the space in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get this out of the way!\" She says, launching herself to the bucket. Her hand swiftly reaches the sides, and her finger runs across the sharp edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" She exclaims, her cut finger drawing blood, dripping from the small opening, as she swiftly inserts it into her mouth and begins to suckle on it. Her other hands reaches out towards the handle of the pail, grabbing it firmly as she carries it with her to the stairs. \"I'm sorry you had to see that it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only stare in disbelief at the fleeing girl. When she cut her index finger, at the very moment. you swear that you saw a trickle of dark blue, almost bordering on purple, blood escaping from the wound. Even the king didn't have such a color when you saw him injure himself hunting several years ago. Shock, awe, excitement, curiosity all flowed through your veins, as the metallic smell wafted in the air. Who could that girl be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe widow Soames tugged feebly at the ropes lashing her hands and feet to the corners of the four-poster bed. Her fearful eyes darted back to the rolled up carpet that lay against one wall of the bedroom. The once beautiful, exotic patter was now soaked in blood. Her husband's feet still clad in their satin slippers poked out of one end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie, please, why, why, why are you doing this?\" she sobbed. \"Were we not kind to you? Did we not take you and your sister in? All those pretty things I let you wear. All the previous gifts my husband gave you before you... <i>murdered</i> him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Lady, let's not pretend your husband let me into his home out of a sense of <i>charity</i>,\" Casario mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis blonde wig had been knocked askew in the scuffle. Reaching up, Casario slid the itchy thing off his scalp, running his fingers through the short brown stubble. It felt so good to be free if that thing. He tugged the bodice of the maid dress down, freeing his squashed breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing was still ragged and he reached behind him to undo the tight corset cinching his waist and crushing his lungs. He took a deep breath. Master Soames had put up quite a fight for a man of his size and years. It had taken several hard wacks from Lotte to bring the old merchant to the floor, and even then the bottle had broken before the bone. He'd had to stab the guy nearly a dozen times before he stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been ideal. Casario preferred to keep the husband alive to watch as the he went to work on the wife but today was different, plans had been accelerated. Meade would be arriving in a few hours and the property needed to be repurposed in that time as the abode of the noble Lady Casandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My necklace,\" Lady Soames stammered. \"It was a gift from my husband, black pearls from the shimmering sea. It's worth a fortune, just take it and let me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassario spat. \"Your husband has given me plenty of pearl necklaces already. And besides, how can I let you leave without showing you... <i>this</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassario's dress dropped to the floor, the crumpling sound of fabric unheard as a loud gasp from Lady Soames resounded through the room. Cassario relished the feeling as he strutted through the floor, his flaccid penis swinging like a metronome as it smacked halfway between the groin and knees with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie,\" Lady Soames stammered in terror. \"W-why do you have such a vile thing in b-between your legs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, indeed?\" Cassario rebuked as he reached the bed, gliding his fingers from the navel of the woman all the way down to her crotch. \"Could it perhaps be because I am not an actual woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but how? Those breasts! And that figure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tut, tut. It seems you still have much to learn about us Versi,\" Cassario said, chuckling, as he slapped his large meaty cock against her folds a couple of times. Blood quickly rushed to the phallus and, as it grows impressively, so do the eyes of Lady Soames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It cannot be...\" She whimpered, gazing at the erect member, which now had the length of her forearm and half of its thickness. \"D-don't. This... this monster will destroy me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassario only smirked as he positioned the tip of his cock at the entrance of her pussy, anticipating the complete mental breakdown that was about to occur, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie, we've got big problems! Huge problems!\" Little Lotte rushed into the bedroom as the tip of Cassario's penis had just slightly went in. Much to his annoyance, he had to retract it from the vagina, a silent pop resounding through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Little Lotte?\" He growled, stroking his penis gently. He didn't like being interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's... he's here! He's here!\" Lotte frantically repeated, waving his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Who?</i>\" Cassario's eyes narrowed, before he frantically balled up the pair of pink panties that he was wearing and quickly shoved them into the mouth of Lady Soames, who had just opened it to yell for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Meade is here! Oh gosh, what do we do, what do we do?! I don't want to be found a murderer by him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\" Cassario hissed, putting a finger against his mouth. Shit! Meade arrived quicker than he expected. He must deal with him somehow! He had already gotten the invitation to the ball, so Meade wasn't as needed, but his riches would definitely be desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Lotte, I need you to...\"</span></div></div>",

B-but I thought we needed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He</i>. We needed <i>him</i>, Lotte,\" Cassario corrected his partner severely. \"Now that we have the invitation we can access the castle as we please so he has become a liability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he dunt suspect nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassario's expression darkened.<i> Please don't tell me he's fallen for a pretty face again</i>, he prayed to the god of murder. While Lothanova's criminal instincts has certainly adapted to the strange nature and customs of the Uplanders, his sexual appetite remained that of a normal Versi male, easily swayed by the feminine allure of a bushy beard or curvaceous bicep. \"Did he see the blood? Did he see the broken glass?\" The sullen silence was answer enough. \"He must suspect something. Dispose of him, hide the body, and I will take care of the lady here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotte slipped out, leaving the two of them alone again. Cassario seated himself on the edge of the bed, idly fondling his captive's breasts. He never imagined when he set off from Versiland that such things would have developed such a fascination in him. Growing up, his own had only ever seemed like a nuisance. Lady Soames had a fine pair, and it was with a heavy heart that he drew from the folds of his discarded dress a short, slender blade and a vial containing two viscous liquids, one dark blue, one other bright pink. The two liquids swirled together though never mixed, always separate like oil and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping to save this for some high lord, but the situation is becoming a little messy and I would prefer to cover my tracks. I can spare a little for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth forced open by the wad of sweaty panties, he trickled a few drops of the potion down her throat. She spluttered and retched. The bedposts rattled as her body began to convulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as her breasts sank into her chest. Her vagina was sealing up, the clitoris swelling. \"A pity, I had such plans for you. But this close to fruition I can't afford to have the Watch taking an interest. Thankfully when they find the corpse of your husband, they'll find the body of an unidentified man beside him, stabbed to death. They will of course conclude that the second man was an intruder and that the two killed each other, while you fled in terror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady convulsions had reached a peak. Cassario hovered with the knife, choosing a good place to sink it. He was spoiled for choice. Underneath her skin, bulbous blue veins squirmed like snakes as large lumps of muscle formed and migrated into position. Her bones crackled. The cords that had previously tied her to all fours posts of the bed slackened as her limbs lengthened. Irregular clumps of coarse hair sprang up on her chest. Her plucked eyebrows squirmed together into a single thick monobrow upon a brutish, protruding brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious. Lady Soames had been a mousy woman; it had been Cassario expectation that the Potion of Sex Change would create an equally mousy man. On the contrary, were it not for the grace of the gods that the lady had been born a woman, she would have been a far different, brutish creature altogether. As her male body formed, it could only be described as orcish, though certainly not in the company of an orc for fear of causing offense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newformed manhood between her legs was as ugly and malformed as the rest of her - thicker than it was long, throbbing with fat purple veins, it had the general appearance, size and sex appeal of a turnip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cords binding the lady's wrists and ankles cut deeply into the expanding flesh, straining to the point of fraying. Cassario's heart beat faster in alarm as the lady began to move sluggishly against her restraints. Hurriedly he raised the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe binding securing her right arm snapped and a hand like a spatchcock enveloped his own, crushing it, the knife falling from broken fingers. The left arm came free. A devilish fire erupted in the lady's beady, black eyes as Cassario felt his own breasts being roughly groped. The turnip was swelling with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lotte!\" he screamed in terror, struggling vainly against the beastly strength. He heard the snap of the remaining restraints and then suddenly he was pinned underneath the intense weight of the lady, his legs being forced apart as the fat head of the turnip nuzzled eagerly against his asshole. \"Lotte! Help! Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's was such a lovely thought to suggest a walk along the harbour, Lotte\" you exclaim, breathing in the salt air. \"Though hopefully Cassandra isn't missing her handmaiden too much. Surely she must need you to help her prepare for the evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cass told me to take you out, so that's what I'm here to do,\" Lotte grumbles. She still rolls the gold coin you'd given her over the knuckles of her hand, regarding it as if something about it bothers her. \"Keep walking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you continue on your merry way, your idle chit-chat receiving little response from your partner, though simply basking in her sweet, golden-haired presence is enough to distract your attention from the fact that she is making one wrong turn after another. Only when your foot sinks to the ankle in a stream of fresh sewerage do you finally notice you've happened to wander into one of the slums that sit near the docklands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Um. My dear, stay close to me. We appear to have become astray. Now as a foreigner you're not to know that these areas are a little, well, dangerous but I think I'd best lead from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gentle arm around her shoulders you lead her back the way you came but instead she pulls towards a shadowed alley, saying, \"nah, I know a shortcut, it's just down here.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"If you say so, my dear. Do stay close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sudden movement seems to surprise Lotte the maid as you bring her closer to you with one arm in a tight embrace, her body resting on her hip. She seemed so small, so vulnerable, her head barely reaching your chest. Her warmth permeated all the through your thick autumn clothes to the depths of your skin. She grabs your hand in a sort of non-committed way, deliberating on whether she should push it away or bring it closer to herself - before she decides on the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully walk into the alley as you keep her close to yourself, your boots splashing as the feces and soiled water thrown out of windows flow through the alley. It's dark. Very dark, in fact. The sort of dark where you could barely see your fingers if you waved your hand in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, you were a former adventurer, grizzled by the many exploits and fights you had to live through in order to survive. The caves of Moraccia and the inner depths of the Kiccigiorgi Forest were both pitch-black locations with barely any light penetrating through the cracks of the cavern or the tops of the trees. Yet you honed your senses, struggled, and survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough your senses have dulled since your adventurers days, you could clearly hear the pitter patter of water running down the buildings. Opting for sewage river running down the middle instead of the dry side walls, in case a thief or murderer attempts to silently creep up, you hoist the small girl by your side onto your hip, ignoring her yelp. You knew the relationship between a woman and her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly wade through the sewage, carefully observing your surroundings. You dare not move faster lest you run into one of the famous 'net-traps', designed to capture poor folks trying to get through the seedy parts of town, before they are violently beaten, gangraped, and murdered. Your alert concentration is broken by the whisper of Lotte's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mister,\" Lotte's soft voice resounds through the air. \"Can I ask you a question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite knowing better than to waver your focus, you could not resist the temptation of a conversation with her, the charming and alluring girl finally speaking to you for the first time during the walk. \"Yes. What is it, my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... so I kinda wondered...\" She hesitates, doubt filling her voice. It almost seemed that she was scared to talk to you, as if though some part of her resolve was breaking down. \"I just want to be frank. Why are you so nice to me? You're so strong, so muscular, so hairy. You look so beautiful. Why do you pay attention to lil' ol' me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Handsome, not beautiful.\" You correct her, though a smile creeps onto your face. It seems that the long night hours of training in your vast yard had turned the faces of pretty young girls, even if you did lose your touch from your adventurer days. \"As for your question, I have an answer. I implore that you do not talk of this to anyone else. You see, in my younger days, I... ran away from battle. A smart move. The entire troupe was wiped out. After all, how can a group of young mages challenge a dragon? Preposterous! Anyway, I had survived, but I earned the mark of a <i>deserter</i>, the lowest of status. I wouldn't bore you with the details, but in short, I can understand the plights of the needy. A vagrant such as yourself has lived a hard life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do carry on living your life shining brightly. If only what I do could be called not 'kindness', but 'being human'... maybe the world would be a better place.\" You hoist her down onto the dry alley, the sewage water having ended a few feet back. You smirk. You sounded just like one of those inspiring professors whom everybody loved in college. Who knew you were a good orator?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Lotte follows behind you, clutching the dagger unknown to you behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!\" Cassario's screams echoed through the bedroom chamber. He was on his back, tits roughly fondled by the large, sweaty, hairy arms of the former woman, his asshole being roughly and thoroughly fucked by the fat, turnip-like dick. At this point, Lady Soames looked less like a human and more like a troll. A large head adorned her body, with broad shoulders and a hefty gut hanging, as the thick log-like legs moved in rhythm with her body. Even her skin was less of the pale skin it used to be, and more like a pale, swamp-like green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a thing should have been impossible. A 'Potion of Sex Change' was just that. It wasn't able to convert races entirely. And it didn't. But Lady Soames' anger and desire for vengeance spilled out, distorting her form, causing her to swell into a beast with only the most vague, passable resemblance to a human... a monster. Her carnal desires had taken shape, molding her flesh into something unrecognizable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassario was screaming. Screaming in pain. But what frustrated him more was the fat, meaty dick currently resting in his asshole. Frustrated that he was being humiliated, fucked by the thing he hated most in this life. His asshole, sensing his frustration, dared not provide him any form of lubrication, making the dry experience even more painful. Cassario felt blood trickling down the walls as the cock stretched his cavity to the limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lotte! Help! Please help! Where are you?! Please come!!\" Was all Cassie could yell over and over again, pinned to the bed by the gigantic mass. He even doubted that his knife would be able to even penetrate the tub of lard and muscle. Not that it mattered, since the knife was lying firmly on the floor. Cassario's fingers were also completely crushed, bone fragments sticking out of the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassario felt the movement of the body speed up as the large testicles the size of pomegranates repeatedly slapped against his skin. Cassario knew what was going to happen as Lady Soames let out a grunt, hot semen forcefully invading the insides of the helpless Versi. His stomach distended, bloating until it was the size that of a pregnant woman, as a loud squelch echoed through the room as the turnip dick exited the hole. Cassario's stomach slowly deflated as the rush of cum quickly exited the hole, streaks of red blending in with the white color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Cassario couldn't see, he knew. He knew that his asshole would never be the same again. The non-incontinent hole was gaping, refusing to close despite the flexing of the muscles. It was now worthless, unable to satisfy anything other than the most massive of orcs and the smallest of wyverns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stooop...\" Cassario weakly moaned as the orcish woman-cum-man picked him up to give his mouth a brutal pounding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been walking in the small, dark alley with Lotte for a few minutes, the seemingly endless corridor never ending. You were surprised that she considered this a shortcut, since the distance seemed the same regardless of whether of walked by the pier or here. Yet the path had started and it must also end some time. You weren't concerned for yourself - you had been very careful - yet the palm of the girl you were holding shivered as you walked through the cool alley, breeze barely noticeable. Poor thing was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Lotte, on the other hand, was walking behind you, shaking from the guilt that was wrecking her right now. But orders were orders. He had to do it. It was meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only just barely turn around to calm Lotte to see the glint of the dagger plunging...</span></div></div>",

Never said I had to kill you,\" he says with a wink. \"Lucky there's a captain who owes me a favour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky overhead has begun to spin and the shadows lengthen as unconsciousness comes to reclaim you.

There is a throbbing pain in the left side of your skull. The floorboards beneath you roll and pitch nauseating. Are you drunk? It certainly feels like the mother of all hangovers. Cracking open an eye, you see... laundry? Yes, bedsheets billowing in the breeze above you... and above them, vultures circling your body... no... seagulls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look alive, mate,\" comes the voice of a woman.

The captain smirks, subtly patting the pouch of gold that was currently located in <i>her</i> back pocket. \"I... I can pay! Really, just take me back to Tryzantium and I will pay then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, no can do.

Until then, they're always a need for new scullery maids up at the castle.\" Muttering under his breath, she adds, \"aye, the rumour is that one of the princes has a certain <i>fondness </i>for the serving girls. Just this year, they had to send half a dozen scullery maids to convents after they were...blessed with child, so to speak. I shouldn't be telling you this, but I just want you to know what you're getting into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. At least you won't have to worry about the interests of an amorous prince, and will just have to look the other way as he has his lordly way with the servants. While it is strange to give a scullery maid position to a man such as yourself, it is an opportunity for food and shelter that you cannot pass up. Gladly you accept the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike much in Versiland, the castle is most peculiar, almost topsy turvy, wider at the top and narrowing further down so that the entire edifice stands upon a single, broad tower. Its battlements jut out high above, looming over the ground below. There is some sense to it of course, as archers within them would be able to lose arrows on anyone approaching the central tower, which is the only means of access. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the shadow of the castle perched above, you are admitted through the guarded gate of the keep and ascend a wide spiraling staircase to the castle above. Stern-looking stone statues wielding gleaming metal weapons regards you from the walls either side of the staircase, from which you detect a glimmer of latent enchantment. No doubt they are guardians built to defend this crucial central stair in the event of an attack upon the castle, though their polished, lethal-looking weaponry also serve as a reminder to the many soldiers, messengers, and workmen passing by that they are now entering the king's domain, with any misdemeanor subject to a severe and final punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the castle proper, the guard directs you into the servant corridor, a narrow passageway lit only by candlelight that threads through the castle, allowing the servantfolk to move unseen without disturbing the nobility or courtiers. Via an occasional glimpse through doorways, a member of the nobility can be seen. Their fashion is as unusual as anything in Versiland. Not that unusual fashion is particularly unusual among the wealthy, of course, but the men appear to be draped in flamboyant silks, exotic feathers and gaudy jewelry, with long trailing skirts behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Versi are more restrained, wearing darker, tailored attire lined with furs. Sensible clothing that one might reasonably wear while riding. A rapier or dagger commonly sits upon the hips of the female nobles, while the men are unarmed as far as can be determined beneath the voluminous, frilly clothing they wear.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hah, bull-ship,\" you grumble groggily. You turn away from the voice and the bright sun, curl up against a mound of rope and go back to sleep, rocked by the sway of the thing-that-you-refuse-to-acknowledge is a ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your dreams, you stand at the helm of the flagship of your trading fleet, forging homeward from distant lands with a hold full of rare teas and spices, enough to make you wealthy as a king. The ocean is a light pink and froths and foams against the hull like the ruffled lace of a woman's petticoats. Upon the horizon is Tryzantium and upon the docks stands your ladylove, Lady Cassandra, beckoning you on. Suddenly, up from the ocean breaches a gigantic, one-eyed sea serpent. It's ugly, flesh-coloured, vein-covered body soars higher and higher until its dwarfs your modest ship. Then seems to hang in the air for a moment, throbbing grotesquely, before gravity catches it and it plummets down towards the sea, crushing your boat into splinters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of icy cold water shocks you awake. You bolt to your feet, spluttering on salty liquid. You <i>are</i> on a ship! You stand on the main deck of what your merchant eye assesses to be a fluyt cargo vessel, though one of a unusual, backwards design with the quarterdeck placed at the bow of the ship, greeting the oncoming waves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fine wind billowing her sail, she cleaves through the choppy seas, racing away from your homeland at a rate of knots. Empty ocean stretches all around, lit by a fading sunset. You twist your head this way and that in desperate search of land, then clutch your temple as pain lances through it. There's an egg-sized lump there, crusted with dry blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wreck your memory, recalling the events of the previous day... or rather, the last day that you remember. You remember heading out to Lady Casandra's house, filled with the emotion of love, located at the place of your friend, Lord Soames. You then met with her charming maid, Little Lotte, and the two of you headed out for a silent walk side by side before she suggested to cut through a dark alley. And then... and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blank. It feels as if though your memory has been cut short, sliced by a finely sharpened blade. A white haze blankets your mind up until the moment you wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened? Were you two attacked? Robbed? Was your head beaten in by a couple of bandits? What happened to Lotte? Oh holy divinities, you hope that nothing bad did. You punt yourself. How could you allow such a small girl waltz into such a dangerous situation? You shudder in horror (and a little hypothermia) as you realize that you are praying for the fact that she was just raped... and not murdered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleeping beauty wakes at last,\" smirks the sailor in front of you with a mixture of white and wooden teeth. She sets the now empty bucket at her feet. Well, her <i>left</i> foot at least; her right leg ends in a pegleg. \"Thought we'd best wake you up, sun's setting. Didn't want you catching a cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater dribbles through your clothing and pools in your boots. The brisk evening wind cuts the sodden shirt, setting you shivering. If looks could kill... \"You didn't want me to be cold so you hit me with a bucket of <i>freezing seawater</i>?!\" you splutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clucks her tongue. \"If you'd offered an alternative I'd have took it. Tried shaking you awake. You were fast out.\" She taps the bucket with her foot. \"It got you up at least, didn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn sure got me up,\" calls a voice ten feet overhead. Hanging upside down from the rigging above you, a teenage girl stares down at you. She wears the tan breaches of a sailor and little else. Her bare breasts, torso and arms are adorned with lurid tattoos. \"Got my cock up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eli, you shut your mouth while we're in polite company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll shut her mouth... Shut her mouth with my cock!\" Sliding her hand between her legs as if cupping a penis, she leers at your soaked form with open lust. A line of drool dribbles from the corner of her upside down mouth to splash your cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it mandatory for sailors to make constant reference to their dicks, even when they don't have them, you wonder. Having spent significant time in their company, you're starting to suspect it must be coded into maritime law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do no such thing,\" the sailor bellows up at him before assuring you, \"Really, he'll do no such thing. He's a good lad really, just a case of old cabin fever. Captain had us all confined to the ship while we were in port - poor sod hasn't seen a girl in three months is all.\" The woman clunks forward to extend a calloused hand. \"Though I can't deny you are a sight for sore eyes. Pleasure to meet you, Miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer accent is thick, her knowledge of the common tongue and its pronouns consistently poor. \"-ter,\" you curtly correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Miss Ter. My name's Edward but the lads call me Pegward. Can't imagine why,\" she says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand remains extended though disregarded. \"I have no time for pleasantries while there is a woman back home in peril. Your name means far less to me than that of your Captain. Who is in command of this vessel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an expression like a wounded puppy, Pegward withdraws her hand and shoves it into the pocket of her breaches. \"You'll be wanting the Captain then, Luca Vandremin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should. He's an acomplished captain, sailed all fourteen seas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are only seven seas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On this side of the world perhaps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By what right does he abduct me onto his ship and steal me away from my homeland?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPegward scratches her chin. \"From what I heard, the lad what dropped you off said he intended to kill you if he ever saw you back topside again. Captain did his duty by removing you from such peril. What greater right is there than coming to the aid of a damsel in distress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy does she look at you like that when she says damsel? Why do have this feeling that you're missing something, something blindingly obviously right in front of your face? It's as though the world is playing a joke on, though you've yet to get to the punchline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will speak to your captain and see to having this vessel turned about immediately. As two men of trade I'm sure we can come to an arrangement,\" you declare, pushing past Pegward and sloshing your way across the deck to his quarters, wet bootprints in your wake. You hammer your fist against the door. With a glance down you realise how bedragled you look. The sodden clothing clings to your skin. You dredge a wet wedgie out from between your buttcheeks and peel off your silk shirt, bundling it into your hands and wringing it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden quiet passes over the deck. The creak and rattle of the crew in the rigging, the clomp of boots or wooden legs, the low background mutter, all halt at once. Standing at the captain's door, you turn back towards the strange hush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumbering around a dozen men (or what you had first assumed to be men), the crew on deck stand frozen at their posts or upon the rigging, whatever task they had been in the process of performing now forgotten in their hands. A dozen pairs of hungry-looking eyes all fixated on your naked torso. In your adventuring days, you'd fought many a beast that had sized you up like a steak dinner as they prepared to strike. The feeling is not dissimilar, and equally unnerving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes dart from sailor to sailor. Though they wear sailor's garb, on closer inspection there is no denying the bodies beneath. They are all, to a man -no pun intended- women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the entire crew female?\" you say in bafflement to Pegward. \"Captain excluded of course.\" The door swings open behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain that strides out from the cabin is only half of what you expected, displaying the trappings of a merchant captain, the expensive, gaudy dyes; precious stones about the hands; the fat coinpurse upon her hip (and is that another, larger coin purse between her legs you see?); the confident swagger as though a minute of their time was worth more than you earned in a month. Contrary to expectations, she is, like the rest of her crew, a woman. Quite a woman in fact. She carries something of the haughty air of Lady Cassandra, though her skin is a dark golden tan. Her pert bosom serves as a sizable shelf upon which to display the glittering golden chains that hang down from around her neck. Her hair is long, braided and dyed a brilliant shade of blue. A broad-rimmed velvet hat sits upon it, studded with peacock feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face is gradually turning a fine purple colour that rivals the vibrancy of the rest of her attire. Her eyes bulge as they dart up and down your half-naked body, then flit to her crew, upon which she takes an urgent step back. She averts her gaze to her feet, uttering hoarsely, \"for the sake of the gods, cover yourself!\" Shielding her eyes with the brim of her hat, she looks to Pegward. \"Our guest has suffered a blow to the head and leave of their senses, kindly take them to the barber surgeon to be treated, and fetch it some damn clothes before you bring it to my quarters again!\" she barked before hurrying back to her cabin and slamming the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's go, Miss Ter,\" Pegward says, grabbing your arm in a criss-cross manner, not unlike how men would pick up women at the town square. \"Captain's right. I don't mind... seeing you like this, but the boys might not be able to restrain themselves. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Boys'</i>, you think as she drags you along the screeching planks of ship to the cabin on the opposite side of the captain's. Yet you couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. You could see several of the crew covering their eyes with their small hands, yet the fingers themselves were clearly split as their gaze followed your movement on the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize it almost instantly. It was the stare that your modest friend Louis gave when you two went peeking on girls bathing in the river as teenagers. A stare that typically only <i>shy, young lads</i> would give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts, however, are interrupted by the rapping on the door as your companion reaches her destination. The cabin - if it could even be called that - resembled more of a shack, hastily built with spare wood planks. <i>It looks bizarre and out of place on this ship</i>, you think, as the sound of busybody work behind you begins once the door firmly shuts with a blam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the shack is unlike anything you would have imagined for a barber surgeon. The fragrance of various herbs wafts in the air, nauseating you, and numerous tools line the racks on the walls. You could see scissors, thin miniature knives, and other gadgets that you would not recognize despite being in the office of the king's physician many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the room, near what you think is a bed - it's just a thin, white mattress with no covers or blankets on it - stands another woman, complimenting the rest of the crew. The only difference is that, unlike the young females getting roudy outside, she is closer to your age - somewhere in the late 30s, or perhaps even mid 40s. Her black hair is tied in a knot that cascades down her shoulder, while her breasts clearly strain against the white coat as she reaches down to pick up a strange cylindrical tool, ending in a metallic point. You have to admit that she looked quite beautiful for her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the prob- ah, geez, cover up!\" She says, shielding her eyes as she turns around to face you two. Strange. Why does everyone seem to have this reaction? \"Pegward, why the hell did you come in here with... I'm married, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" She mumbles in her thick accent, eyes treading downwards. \"I kind of ruined her clothes, so... Anyway, I came here 'cause the captain told me to get her checked out. Mind doing it, mate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle-aged woman slowly retreats her hand from her eyes, though she now looks more upward, as if though only your head comes into her field of view. Slowly, she extends her hand as she speaks, head still positioned the same way as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, hi, it is nice to meet someone as attractive as you. Such a shame that I'm married. My name is Gustavio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach out towards her dainty hand, nearly crushing it. \"The pleasure is mine. Pray tell me, are you a physician? I see quite a lot of sophisticated equipment here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Physician?!\" She recoils, her face scrunching as if though she's hurt. \"I am not one of those primitive brutes! My talent goes beyond simple amputations and dental extractions. No, I am a barber surgeon. Here, lie down on this.\" She grabs you, eyes still averting from your figure, and drags you to the thin mattress, the steps on the wood softly resounding. You lie down, before being promptly covered by a white sheet, thin as a piece of paper. Gustavio becomes visibly relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Let me take a look.\" She says, trotting up to your side while snapping on what appeared to be a pair of gloves. Except, those gloves were of a thin material, and visibly showed her hands underneath them. Quite a peculiar sight to see. \"Where does it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The head.\" You reply, arm pointing directly at the bump, swollen to a large size as it pulsed with the blood flowing through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. That is quite a nasty injury. Blunt weapon, probably.\" She replies, hands carefully prodding over the discolored swelling as if though it was a delicate vase. \"I swear, if I find the bastard who would do this to a lady... Anyway, I need to drain the blood from the area. I trust that you are good with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no problem.\" You see her stretching towards the cylinder with the thin metallic prong on its end. \"But are you not going to use leeches or scalpels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leeches or scalpels? How primitive. It is obvious that I will use a syringe for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a slight pinch as something seems to pierce your scalp. A draining sensation washes over, as if though something wave is passing through your body. You feel it stop for a moment, along with a gasp of \"Oh, my!\", but it quickly resumes and last for a brief few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done.\" She proudly proclaims, holding up the cylindrical object which was now clearly filled with sloshing red blood - your blood. \"Let me rub you with some ointment and you should be good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers trace your scalp, the cool ointment - apparently made from a variety of herbs, according to her - resting gently on your hand. Your hand traces through your hair, surprised to find that you can feel absolutely nothing. \"Absolutely astonishing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the best for the very best.\" The lady bows in a very mannish manner. You wanted have corrected her stance, but there was something that you enjoyed in it. Like a pampered princess, you felt delighted of all this attention thrown to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder. <i>When did I start thinking like a girl?</i> You wonder, giving a curt nod in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you go, I would like to ask a series of questions. Why did you come in bare chested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me if it was inappropriate, but I was soaking wet with seawater.\" Your gaze shifts to Pegward. \"And besides, I have seen your fellows out there with naked breasts. Surely a man can bare his chest once in a while, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. <i>A man</i> surely can. Are you meaning to say you are one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap to your feet, feeling insulted. \"Are you meaning to say I am not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. You do not need to anger. I am simply \" She places a palm on your shoulder, forcing you down onto the firm mattress. \"I am simply verifying your cognitive capacities. You did take quite a large hit to the head after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. That actually made sense. You even feel embarrassed for your outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Pegward! She's completely fine now. You can take her to get dressed.\" She addresses Pegward, who had been standing in the corner attentively looking at you, seemingly worried. How strange. It seems that the entire crew had learnt Tryzantine from one scholar, and every single one of them botched correct pronoun pronunciation. Yet you couldn't help but feel that there was something wrong. Something missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk out of the room, Pegward turns to Gustavio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she all right, mate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doubt it. The poor thing took a big hit to the head. Even fancies herself a man, pitiful thing. Listen to me, closely, Edward. Take very good care of her. She's obviously shaken. Any lady would be by this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Pegward guiltily nods his head and trots out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGustavio sighs, looking at the vial he had deposited the contents of the syringe into. The sloshing red liquid was beautiful, its crimson color staining the glass wall. Without hesitation, he also began walking towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it seems that I must inform the captain of royalty on board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPegward led you out of the shack and into the main cabin. You were wrapped in the \"gauze\" that the barber surgeon had given you. Why? Who knows, Pegward and Gustavio insisted upon it. You could see numerous empty hammocks swinging, with some of them occupied by sleeping sailors. All girls, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPegward walks to a particular hammock - seemingly his own - and slides out a large oak chest with a large, unlocked padlock on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The padlock's for decorative purposes.\" Pegward shrugs, opening the chest. \"I trust everyone here. Here, wear this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou react just in time to catch a cloth. A pink cloth. A pink, gaudy cloth. A pink, gaudy, lacy cloth. A pink, gaudy lacy dress. You unfold it in your arms, staring in shock between the dress and Pegward, as they open in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mean to give me... <i>this</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to repay me. It cost me a fortune, and I was saving it for my future marriage, but... I think it would look beautiful on you. And I think the Captain would enjoy it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever mind the fact that she just told you that a <i>dress</i> would look beautiful on you, your heart aches in guilt as you look at it. She was obviously saving it for herself, and yet here you were, taking the most precious thing away from her. <i>A girl and her clothes are inseparable</i>, as your wise father used to say. A sudden idea pops into your wily mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pray tell, may you not simply hand me your sailor's uniform while wearing this dress instead? I am sure it will go well with your figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... you want me to c-cross... that is completely inappropriate, Miss Ter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. A sailor must always be prepared for duty, and wearing a dress would restrict her from that. Yet you know you would definitely look ridiculous in this dress, a shame on your father's legacy. You couldn't wear it, could you?</span></div></div>",

Your crew were quite insistent.\" You hold yourself with all the proud bearing you can muster in the pink lacy garment, while at the same time not daring to straighten up <i>too </i>far for fear that your chest will burst out of the tight bodice. It is a curiously designed garment. For some unknown reason there are slits down each arm, such that with the slight flex of your arm causes opening to widen, flashing your bicep to the world. Despite evidently not being designed for a man, it conforms to a male physique with great tightness. The neckline sits just a scrap of an inch above your nipples, the sea wind tickling the exposed hair of your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExposed, that's the word. Wearing this absurd thing, you feel almost naked walking past the crew on deck, whose collective gaze you can still feel. There is no place for a sword on a dress, and you miss the comforting weight of it on your hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain's face is red, no doubt with fury. Her posture is rigid, hand clenched on the knob of her door. Her gaze is fixed resolutely at the level of your eyes, eyelid twitching as her attention threatens to waver. \"Then <i>I </i>must apologize for the manners of my crew. They dressed you only as they are accustomed to, being ignorant of your ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a guffaw, you exclaim, \"you don't mean to say the men of your country dress like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the men but... It's complicated.\" Luca frowns. \"You deserve, and are overdue I suspect, an explanation. Let us talk,\" she says, stepping aside, barking an order at her crew to return to work as you step inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the captain herself, the captain's cabin is at first glance an indiscreet display of wealth. Glittering navigation instruments sit upon velvet cushions upon a desk of dark wood. The wall to your right is given over to glass fronted cabinets containing an assortment of maps, trinkets, and trade writs. The left wall contains the captain's bunk. The entirety of the fore wall is a single grand window - thick hexagons of stained glass set in lead, robust enough to endure the waves that crash against them, rhythmically plunging the cabin into emerald darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet your eye is more discerning than most, picking out the wear and nicks here and there, the draughty rattle of several of the window panes, signs of fading wealth. Not to mention the dozen or so wooden crates of trade goods that have been wedged in here between the furniture. Only a desperate merchant would sacrifice the comfort of her own cabin to squeeze a little extra gold out of a voyage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small stove warms the cabin, a copper kettle whistling away atop it. \"Tea?\" Captain Luca asks, seating herself at her desk. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets you out a fine (if somewhat chipped) china cup only a little larger than a shot glass and pours you a helping of the brew before filling herself a larger mug. She takes a large swallow with a wince, smacking her lips. You take a sip. For tea, it has a remarkable kick to it, enough to bring tears to your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an interesting blend,\" you cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough to knock the hairs off your chest,\" Luca remarks. She hesitates for a moment before pouring you another cup. \"I trust you can handle your tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBristling a little, you retort, \"My lady, I am the most experienced connoisseur outside of Hashaan. Nearly a fifth of all the tea consumed by Tryzantium passes through my warehouses, I think I can drink a cup or two.\" You knock back the second glass, spluttering as it seems to sear the back of your throat like whisky. It is certainly unlike any you've consumed before, and rather than invigorating you it sets your head spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you work your way through a third serving, you notice her studying you over the top of her mug, eyebrows furrowed. Setting aside your cup, you say, \"I see my presence on your ship bothers you almost as much as it bothers me. Unsurprising, since your crew is entirely female. You must be thinking of me as like a cat among the pigeons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like a pigeon among the cats. Or a cat among other cats. Whatever you are, it will not bode well for discipline,\" she grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Then you will think nothing of returning me to port!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why-ever not! I am a wealthy man; I must attend to my business..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A number of reasons. Firstly, we are a day out of port on an excellent wind; it would take three times as long to crawl back and there is no guarantee how long this favourable weather will last. Much of my cargo is perishable and I cannot afford the delay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the tea has gone to your head, as you reply somewhat curtly, \"What part of 'I am a wealthy man' did you not understand? Whatever it will cost you, I will make it worth your while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secondly I have reason to believe your life would be in danger from a murderous cut-throat known as Casario should you return-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and thirdly because I swore on my honour to the very same cut-throat that I would see you safely to Versiland, a promise I intend to keep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"You venturer to Versiland? What a strange coincidence, my bride-to-be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-comes from there? Yes, I thought he might.\" She looks at you with pity. \"I'm sorry to say you've been the victim of a pair of con-artists, men who have seduced and slaughtered their way to infamy and fortune, and only through your sheer luck and-\" For a second her eyes flit down to your bare chest. \"-charms have you come away unscathed. As I said before, you are deserving of an explanation. How best to explain... Would you like it told to you long or short?\"</span></div></div>",

An upcoming wedding to boot. I have no time for trivialities. Just give me the short explanation and we'll be done with it. The sooner I get back home, the sooner I become a happier man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Luca nods, her index finger pursed on her lip as her eyes wander, deep in thought. A few seconds fly by as the ships tumbles among the waves, the silent screeching distant to you. She finally decides to speak up, placing her hands into her lap, almost as if though she's hiding something from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I thought that might be the case. But I would suggest that you not rush back to wherever you want to go. Especially after my explanation.\" She pauses, as if though briefly considering something as she examines your face, her eyes seemingly flickering to your chest. \"I... I suppose that the quickest way is to simply show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Show you?</i> It was quite a peculiar statement that flared your curiosity somewhat. What was there to show that would satisfy an explanation of your abduction by this ship's crew members? Perhaps some letters or books? Whatever it is, you lean in forward in anticipation as the smell of perfume tickles your nose. But there was also something different, a sort of... salty smell? You couldn't exactly put your finger on it, but you suppose she was drenched in seawater as any sailor would. But then again, now that you think about it, you do seem to remember a similar smell coming from both your lovely Lady Casandra and Little Lotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Luca visibly gulps, slowly backing away from you as she averts her eyes. Her ship's hull plunges into the sea once more, as the stained glass reveals a breath-taking view of fish and plankton floating by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-now... before I do that, I would like to warn you.\" She proceeds, as she puts aside her cup and begins to play with her hat, seemingly out of nervousness. \"I... am quite a bit bigger than the others on here. I am the captain, after all. Still, I am warning you to not be afraid, as I will try my best to being courteous with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is she talking about?</i> You think, sizing her up and down as you adjust the hem of your dress (damn thing is always trying to slip off your chest). Her height? But she is definitely not among the tallest crew members here - the very same Pegward was taller. In fact, she was among the shorter people, which did add a certain charm to her as it complimented her hourglass figure quite well. Then maybe her rank? But being the captain, that was obvious, and you didn't deem it as something necessary to warn about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a strapping pirate back in the days. Rape, murder, pillage... you name it. I was feared by both men and women - albeit I suspect for different reasons. Kraken of the Fourteen Seas they used to call me. Anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are definitely confused. You brush your hair backwards, listening to the mad ramblings of the captain as she appears to twitch repeatedly, no doubt from nervousness. You wave your hand in a nonchalant manner, getting your point across very clear: 'get on with it'. Luca understands your intention as she nods her head, locks of purple hair spilling over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose it is time.\" She mutters, shooting up from the edge of her seat in a brisk manner. She grabs her brown, leather coin pouch, which suspiciously looks similar to yours, and tosses it aside onto her bunk bed. She pushes the tea cups and pot to the edge of the table and climbs onto it, knees forward, such that her crotch was directly in front of your vision, easily reachable if you just extend your arm forward. She begins to tug down onto the band of her sailor pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... excuse me, but don't you think that what you're doing is completely inappro...pri-...\" Your words get stuck in throat as the loud smack interrupt your rambunctious chain of thoughts like an opiate. Normally, you are not one to be surprised, but... what was attached to her waist...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gave off the impression of a beast, ready to ambitiously pounce onto its prey and devour it in one, fell swoop. It awed and disgusted you at the same time, and a slight shiver ran quickly through your spine, inducing yet another emotion within you. Fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Captain Luca, w-what is t-that!?\" You stutter, your voice getting caught in your throat as you try to choke out any semblance of sound. Luca's mouth rapidly turns into a frown, no doubt insulted from your reaction. You shield your eyes in a brief motion, fumbling as you try to push your chair out of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I am very sorry. I should have expected this reaction. As you can see very clearly, this is a penis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but why? W-why is it on your body?\" You say, as you silently peek through the small opening between your fingers. An elicit gasp comes from your mouth as you observe the massive manhood in between her legs. It was enormous, its length reaching almost all the way up to her knee and its girth the width of your arm. Veins visibly pulsated blood throughout it, as the beast swayed between her legs slowly, almost with growl. A beast that did not suit the beauty of this calm and collected woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I am a man. You are a man. <i>All of us</i> here are men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a lead weight drop into your stomach. Your chair briskly tips over as if though pummeled, the weight of your body swinging it like a pendulum as you drop to the floor with a thud. <i>This couldn't be true... this shouldn't be true!</i> But looking at her... <i>his</i> eyes (and his cock), you understood that no falsehoods were being uttered here. Your mind flashed to the events on this boat: the red cheeks at the sight of your body, the references to their dicks, and the sharp whistling sounds. It now all made <i>sense</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, another thing flashes into your mind, the floodgates to your memory unsealed as torrent of recollections of that day in the alley come back to you. As well as memories of... <i>that</i>. That <i>thing</i>. That <i>monster</i>. The thing that surpassed even Captain Luca's beast. You now know why you have lost your memory that day, your mind actively trying to surpass the horrors of that monstrosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... is Cassandra and Lotte...?\" You choke out, cradling your head in the palms of your hands, your brain feeling as if though it's splitting apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you speak of Cassario and Lothanova. Yes, they are <i>men</i> as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears begin to stream down your eyes. You felt betrayed. No, not by Cassandra... or whatever his true name is. You should've expected this. You should've been more cautious. You should've considered the possible biological differences between you and those from Versiland. You were a traveler, for god's sake! How could you not even remotely consider this possibility?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, you felt betrayed by Little Lotte. The image of that young, sweet girl was rapidly twisting inside your mind, turning into that of a cold-blooded murderer who might have even possibly raped the corpses of his victims. And he spared you for some unknowing reason?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't joke with me...\" You mutter quietly, seething with rage. You felt played. It had been one thing if he had stabbed you in the back and you had survived in that situation through cunning like in your olden days, but to be so fooled that you had to be spared?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now.\" Captain Luca says, noticing your tears. \"It is not such a bad thing to be among men. You are one as well, are you not? That means that we could create the bonds of camaraderie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca stops short. The reason itself is quite explanatory. Her giant manhood was swelling, rising like a mast as the veins had begun to rapidly pump more blood into this engorged erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought crosses your mind. <i>If men in Versiland look like this, could the women look like... me?</i> You watch as the beef-cock steadily rose, a dollop of fluid appearing on the purple, pulsating head, resembling very closely an eye that suited this beast quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast, that was the word. Luca's manhood reminded you of the beast in your dreams, dropping onto the ship as it crushes the wooden planks in an attempt to devour you and the rest of the crew. The resemblance was uncanny, a warning to your future self of the things to come. You shudder, trying to slowly crawl away from the beast. Yet as you shift your hand just so ever slightly, you collapse underneath your own weight, tumbling onto the floor. You could not move. You were a mess - a drunken mess to be exact, the strong flavor of the tea rendering your body highly uncoordinated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... I am very sorry for this.\" Captain Luca apologizes, reaching forward with a handkerchief to wipe off the pre-cum. \"I restrained myself to the ship as an example to my boys last time we docked and... I fear I have not bed with a woman for quite some time, so seeing your attractive self... No worries! I am not gay, so even touching you is out of the question! You have nothing to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit relieved by that statement, but a brief thought flashes through your mind. <i>Could you really trust him?</i></span></div></div>",

While a man could garner greater respect from the sailors, they would also be less inclined to the innate tendencies of protectiveness and courtesy around you, and you have heard the tales of what men can get up to with other men on these long sea voyages, even entire crews succumbing to their unsatisfied lusts at a time. The vulnerability of your position is starting to become apparent. Surrounded by nothing but hundreds of miles of open ocean and several dozen sex-starved men, things could turn ugly for you very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most believe you to be a versiland woman. There are only a few of my crew who know of the peculiarities of the top-sider's anatomy, and for good reason. On my last voyage here, there was a mutiny. I had docked at Lightgarde and allowed my men to go ashore as repairs were being made. There, my men found themselves pursued and propositioned relentlessly by your men, wooed and bedded, not that there has ever been difficultly in seducing a seaman. It is a joke of the gods perhaps that, despite our physical incompatibility, the men of our different countries are more perfect bedfellows in their temperament and appetites then the men and women of our own countries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the short few days on land, they experienced erotic delights few men can ever dream of. Once they were summoned back to the ship, the men became rowdy and the mood soured. They wanted to stay to be pampered and gratified for the rest of their days. My rash attempts to quell the men by insulting their manhoods for lying with foreign men only angered them further, until they become mutinous. They attacked me and the few who had enough to lose back home to stand with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good heavens. And yet you survived and reclaimed your ship. How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though very little action of my own. There was a stowaway aboard my ship, Lothanova, a young lad that slipped aboard in Versiland and who I had allowed to stay so long as he worked. For whatever reason, perhaps just an excuse to murder as many as he could, he took my side and killed the leader of the mutineers. The rest fled or were captured and thrown in the brig, and I limped back home with a third of my crew remaining. I made certain that those who replaced them were kept in the dark about the topsider's secrets and that there would be no shore leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting an opening, you say, \"Then you yourself concede that my presence here invites mutiny. The truth cannot be hidden for long and once it is, they will try to turn this ship about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. Perhaps not.\" The Captain rises and steps to the grand window that looks out over the water. For all it's backwards layout, the ship at least affords the captain an excellent view of what lies ahead. As the froth of the last wave spills down the glass panels, he stares intently towards the horizon. \"It matters little, for in a few hours we will sail beyond the circle of islands known as the World's Teeth and beyond that we will be held fast by the powerful currents of the Maw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Maw!\" you exclaim. \"Have you gone mad? That's suicide. No ship returns from the Maw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dangerous, yes. Suicide, no. A skilled captain with experience may pass through it, for the Maw is a drainage channel from one side of the world to the other. I suspect the main reason no ship returns from the other side is for the same reason my ship almost didn't - because no crew wants to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maw is a whirlpool in the sea dozens of miles wide. It's currents flow as fast as a river. Over the captain's shoulder, way off on the horizon, stands the jagged triangular rock of one of the Teeth. If the ship reaches that, there will be no returning home...</span></div></div>",

You realize the fact that if you enter that viciously spinning vortex just a few dozen leagues away, you will most likely never return to your homeland. No money on you, no connections, all alone in a completely new world. You doubt the captain would look after you \u2013 his duty is only to deliver you to Versiland after all. And you know no other person from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind shudders at that thought. What would you do then? You remember hearing stories of maidens from far-off lands becoming lost within the vast maze of the city streets, before catching the eye of grubby slave merchant looking to sell their wares in the dark alleys of the kingdom. A slave collar and she was a maiden no more \u2013 auctioned off to the highest bidder within the blackmarkets of the empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, such a thing seems like an implausibility to you \u2013 you're shrewd, for one; and for two, you have still upkept your training from your days of youth. Kidnappings, rape, murder... such things are not an issue for you. Your opponent would have to struggle for their dear life if they cross roads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But... how will I live?</i> You think, your mind wandering back to the streets of Lightgarde, and the citizens living in poverty. Mercenary seems to fall out of the question immediately. You recall the interactions that male rogues had with female knight-prot\u00e9g\u00e9es \u2013 they did not take too kindly to those of the opposite sex. Sentry-work? No, those typically looked down upon women not in their rightful place \u2013 the home, giving birth to and raising children. Your mind flashes through a couple more variants, all with the same result: men scowl upon the services of women. It made them appear not only weak, but also emasculated, and as such, understandable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Prostitution...</i> Your mind finally arrives at the horrid conclusion, the ultimate work left for you in the streets of Versiland, the first profession. Having nowhere to go, you will be forced into pleasing men, worshiping their cocks as they snicker and hand out generous payments for your handler. You shudder, partly from the very thought of it, partly from the sight of a kraken swallowing a blue whale whole at a distance from your ship. You swallow, the spit getting stuck somewhere in the esophagus, having to rely on the involuntary muscles to bring it further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... is there really no way you can turn the ship b-back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am truly sorry, but a promise is a promise. And I would hate to subject you to more danger than your already have.\" The captain waves his arm in a dismissing gesture, harrumphing as he crosses them once more. \"Do not worry. I think you will enjoy the premises of my homeland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently wince, your mind kicking itself into overdrive as various scenarios float through your brain, each one being analyzed within split seconds before moving onto the next one. Only two seconds pass as countless variations are thoroughly considered and rejected, before your mind sinks its fangs into a particular idea. You recall what Captain Luca has mentioned just not two minutes ago \u2013 the story of his arrival to this side of the world. You chuckle internally as you find your solution, glancing upwards to give him a brief glance. Your face forces a faux frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If such is the case, I suppose it cannot be helped. It's such a pity that I have to marry at such a young age...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Luca suddenly twitches, his face now showing full attention as the stoic expression melts, turning into concern. He senses something within your words, but is unable to discern the trap that you have just set for him. After all, how could he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wh... what do you mean by that?\" He chokes out, biting his crimson red lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" You exclaim, gasping as you bring the soft rosy palms of your burly hands to your cheeks in mock horror. \"You mean to tell me that you do not know the culture of the top-siders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know he does not. After all, his interaction with your kind has been minimal, a certain fear formed in the back of his mind after the treacherous mutiny of his crew had almost left him stranded in foreign lands. There was no reason why he would know the inner-works of your people. The quiet <i>'No...'</i> simply affirms your suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you mean to tell me that you did not know that the valiant gals of our nation are obliged to take a young lad's hand in marriage after she rescues him from peril, from danger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain almost seems to sputter as a brief series of onset coughs come from his mouth. \"But... but you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A male? Why, yes. And what about it? Do you think that we men are capable of defending ourselves with such bodies? Are you supposing that we must scar these delicate muscles with wounds and remain dreadful for the rest of our lives? Do you suppose that we are capable of fighting off entire legions of vicious beasts all by ourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA reverberating silence hung in the air. The poor captain's mind had still not comprehended the meaning behind your words as the gears in his head slowly ticked, arriving at the natural conclusion. You glance at the blue whale's tail sticking out of the maw of the kraken before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think you have met only men in the bar that day? Was it not because the women were out training in the fields?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems to hammer the point in, as a light seems to appear in his eyes in understanding before his face downturns red, probably from shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's such a shame that we must kiss and consummate our marriage...\" You trail off, biting your lip to prevent the snicker from escaping. The poor captain has covered his face with the palms of his hands. You wait, before the face emerges once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right...\"</span></div></div>",

I dare say you barely have two silver to rub together! In Lightgarde, I have a fleet of men of your stature working beneath me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice lowers into a warning growl. \"Watch your tongue, woman. Or I might be inclined to treat you less kindly. Would you prefer to join my household as a lady-in-waiting or a scullery maid? Because either can be arranged.\" With an expression like thunder growing on his face, he gives you a lustful look up and down. \"Perhaps even a wet nurse for my children. Aye... you'd fill that role nicely. A good beard for the baby to hang onto and washboard abs for it to rest its feet as it suckles. Yours is a body made for nursing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar of fury, you rise to your feet, leaning over the desk to glare down at him, nose-to-nose. \"<i>'I'</i>? I have a body for nursing?! Look at you.\" You give him a hard jab in the breast. \"You are as swollen as a cow, my dear! You could feed the whole crew with those udders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca stares at his chest incredulously. \"These are to protect my organs from sword blows and arrows, you imbecile! They are a sign of a strong warrior. How <i>your</i> males are supposed to fight with their hearts so exposed is beyond me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you a hard shove in the shoulder and you respond in kind, setting his \"chest armour\" jiggling. The back of his hand cracks against the side of your face, stunning you for a moment before you slug him back. A sudden lurch of the ship grants your blow a little more force than you intended and, as he recovers, a trickleof blood runs from his nose. With a cry of rage, he launches himself over the desk, pinning you to the floor with cries of \"harlot\" and \"insolent wench\", his semi-flaccid member digging into your thigh as he struggles to restrain you. He is far, far stronger than you expected, equivalent to yourself in fact, and it is soon a well-matched tussle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a second, stronger lurch from the ship and the lantern that hangs in the room tilts. A number of small objects that have fallen from the desk begin to roll across the floorboards as the ship begins to lean forward imperceptibly. \"Maw ahead!\" comes the cry from the deck above.</span></div></div>",

The scene itself reminds you of those played within a theater stage, where the man is just about to confess to his loved one and lock his lips in a deep, passionate kiss. The caveat being, of course, that you two are both <i>male</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insolent wench!\" Captain Luca seethes through his teeth after several long-drawn breaths. The adrenaline coursing through his veins has not settled yet. \"Did your father never teach to never raise your hand against a man?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ay,\" you reply, spitting into the captain's face. \"Perhaps if you looked the part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have seemed as if the scuffle would continue for a while, perhaps days and nights, if a fellow shipmate had not barged into the captain's quarters at this moment. You turn your head to discover that it is the ship's barber surgeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, I have news to report!\" Gustavio's face is flushed red, as if he had just spent his time running a marathon through the crowded and boisterous streets of Tryzantium. And he most likely did just that -- the running, that is -- hurrying to the captain's cabin to deliver the utmost urgent of news. You could only hope that it isn't about the ship's starboard splintering to bits and pieces from the forces of the Maw. Especially considering that the view from outside the stainless glass has been giving you no hope, providing you a clear depiction of the ship being swallowed by the crashing waves of the Maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is about the...\" His voice comes to a stop as he notices your muscular body being pressed to the ground by the captain. It is only now that you notice the slightly inconspicuous bulge that is hiding beneath his surgeon's pants. A detail that you hadn't noticed before, yet you wish you did. \"By the gods! Captain, are you out of your mind?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Gus,\" Captain Luca sneered as he held you down, his weight becoming slightly burdensome for you. \"I didn't sail the fourteen seas to be ordered around by some wench! Now, either you help me subdue her or else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca doesn't get to finish as a hefty shove pushes him off of you and sends him rolling down the cabin. Furious, he's about to protest the actions of his subordinate, but his voice gets stuck in his throat as the prim barber-surgeon whips out a while sloshing with red blood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Lotte's eyes gape in horror as he gazes at the scene in front of him. Shards of broken glass and a busted-up window -- with cracks traveling along the edge of the wall -- seemed to indicate the break-in (or the escape) of an incredibly enormous man, whose body was unhindered by the fragile glass-and-wooden barrier that was currently lying in pieces. Rugs, clothes, and bed sheets were strewn about the room, as if a whirlwind has passed through and scattered about the items. But most importantly was the figure lying in the center of it all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Casario!\" Lotte's voice escapes as he runs up to his fellow deceiver. One look at him told him all. His body was completely broken: bones crushed in his arms and legs to the point where they might as well be called bone powder. The unhinged and broken jaw from taking something massive inside his mouth. And last, but not least, the torn apart asshole with blood and cum gushing out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L...Lot...te...\" Casario barely speaks, wincing from pain as his broken jaw creaks. \"R...run... it's too late... for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears well up in Lotte's eyes. Despite the fact that the two always held more of a business relationship, they formed a sense of camaraderie over the years they swindled many Topsiders out of their money and lives. Lotte just couldn't abandon him that easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying, Casario?\" Lotte objects, wiping his tears. \"We need to get you help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could even drape his fellow's arm over his shoulder, a knock resounds from the mansion's door. \"Open up! We are the <i>Watchers</i>.

The quick change in Luca's demeanor befuddled you at first, of course, seeing as you didn't see anything particularly exciting about the vial of blood, which you had assumed to be your own. However, something interesting caught your eye in the midst of this, trickling from the captain's nose as a result of your scuffle with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps one, maybe two, but for three Versis to have the same royal color? A quick realization settled into the depths of your mind, telling you that this was no coincidence. If the males and females of the Versi differed from those of your own species, then perhaps the royal blood did so as well...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for my erratic behavior,\" Captain Luca says with his eyes downwards. \"It was inexcusable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is all he's been doing for the past few minutes. Just non-stop.... well, you wouldn't call it groveling, but it was pretty close to that. Respect and adoration have replaced contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do hope you can forgive me,\" he repeats, bowing his head once more. \"I had no idea that I took a prince... erm, princess aboard.\" He corrects himself, shifting his eyes to the barber-surgeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose you can't be faulted,\" you slowly begin, weaving the tale within your head. Could you perhaps use this to return to your homeland? \"After all, I didn't reveal this fact to you. As...\" You think about the direction you want to take your fib in. \"...<i>second</i>-in-line to the throne, I didn't want to use my authority on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca falls into a deep thought as he scratches his slender chin, while Gustavio doesn't hesitate to interrupt. \"Excuse me, but wouldn't the king worry about your absence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense this as your escape. \"Oh! Yes, yes indeed! My dad would be <i>so</i> worried about his <i>only daughter</i> missing that... why, I wouldn't even know what he'd do! So, captain, don't you think it would be best to return me back to Lightgarde?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Gustavio turn your heads as you await his decision.

We're inside the Maw's pull.\" He gestures to the cabin at large and finally you notice the extreme tilt that the ship is at, the lamps in the cabin hanging at jaunty angles. Beyond the windows there is only water, the horizon rising high above you as the ship plows down the slope of the massive maelstrom, like water running out of a sink, only dozens of miles wide. Ahead, at the very center, lies a dark hole of churning, frothing foam and spray. The ship is heading directly for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all going to die! I have to get off this ship!\" You turn and sprint, only to hit Gustavio at the door. For all his feminine appearance, you rebound off him like hitting a thick, muscular build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's hysterical, sedate her!\" Luca barks. Gustavio produces a rag and vial of tincture from his pockets. Moistening the rag, he grips your arm tightly, pressing the sweet-smelling fabric to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sweetie, it'll all be over soon. Just breathe. Breaathe.\"<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\nIt is dark. You are laying on soft, warm, silk sheets. Your head swims and feels remarkably heavy as you try to lift it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly coming to your senses, you start to pick out the features of the cabin by the weak flicker of a single candle and a strange, almost-imperceptible blue ambience coming from the great front windows. You are lying in the captain's bunk, blankets tucked under chin. As you push them back, a wave of icy cold air washes over you. A diaphanous, pink camiknicker clings to your hairy chest. \"Wad da fug,\" you utter groggily. It is well fitted, save for the cock that pokes out of one frilly leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn answering mutter comes to you. It is Captain Luca, murmuring in his sleep as he slumps in his threadbare chair. His breath mists in the frozen air. Sliding a bare leg over the side of the bunk, your foot recoils at first from the freezing floorboards. You stagger a little as you stand, though only from the after effects of the drug rather than any sway of the ship, which is perfectly still. You shuffle to the window, fully expecting to see the wraiths and demons of the afterlife out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly resembles the underworld. A vast, dark cavern hundreds of meters wide stretches around the ship, its gnarled walls glowing with an incredibly faint but all-pervasive blue luminescence. Black water as smooth as a mirror stretches away into the distance, its surface unbroken even by the movement of the ship, which seems to be gliding along on the placid waters at a surprising speed, judging by the rate at which the cavern walls slip behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca shivers in his sleep. So the Captain was right after all - he has found a navigable way through the world, to the kingdoms below - how then had he fallen on such hard times with such a trade secret under his belt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider your options</span></div></div>",

The screams of noble women still echo down the corridor, but they seem distant as you scrub at the gore that congeals on your arms. The small handbasin soon runs red, though your hands still drip with royal blood. It had been a messy business. For a child, the King had had a lot of blood in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last few years, you'd watched as your King became someone you barely recognised. As he'd aged and his health had begun to fail, and his children and siblings and lords had begun to squable and scheme and divide up the Kingdom even while he still lived, he became gripped with an obsession - to live and rule forever. It had been an obsession, you regret to say now, that you had facilitated as the monarch's advisor of magic and in the interest of the future stability of the Kingdom. It had been you who personally got in touch with the Fey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fey delegation arrived. They presented their offer to the King, and he sent them packing. But the Fey, being timeless creatures, are patient. When the King lay on his death bed, they returned .The King would receive their boon - eternal, undying youth - and in return, the elven forests would be allowed to spread, unchallenged, into human lands. This time, he accepted. His decrepit body was renewed into that of a healthy, young child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few months, the wilderness swallowed up nearly a third of Tryzantinium, and the oncoming winter showed no sign of slowing it down. In places, the elven borders spread faster than people could flee. Those trapped by the encroachment were transformed into mindless beasts or worse. Swiftly and efficiently, the new forests were dividing the human kingdom up into neat parcels of land, cutting them off from the capital before engulfing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone could see it was an extermination. The King's advisers beseached him to break his bargain. In reply, the King had them hung. To break the deal would be to kill the king, and to suggest such a thing was treason. For with his childlike body had come a new personality; petulent, wanton, and cruel, like a child, but with the mind and appetites of a grown man. As the forests encroached around Lightgarde, the refugees began to flood in. The King, terrified of angering the Fey, executed anyone who resisted the wilderness. His sons fled, fearing his madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should have acted sooner, made an end to the mistake you'd first made in involving the Fey, yet you didn't, partly out of concern for your family but your own skin too. Outside the King's protection, both the magi and the church would hunt you to the ends of the world. So you waited, hoping somebody else would act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis evening the court had sat down to feast. As one of his last remaining advisers, you were seated at the King's table, even helping the childlike sovereign up into his chair now that it was too big for him. A prisoner had been carried in for judgement, naked except for chains. Johan Sellwin. He had been a Baron and a man once, until the forests had taken his land and most of his humanity. The short, red fur that covered his body was scorched in places by the fire they had used to burn their way out. His tail quivered between his legs as he begged for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King's mood darkened as he listened to the beast's pleas. When Johan ventured that aid be sent to recover his holdings, the King flew into a rage. \"Skin him! I want his pelt! His family too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden sense of inevitability, you took a carving knife and drove it through the King's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of armoured guards rattle down the corridor outside, bringing you back to the here and now, causing you to glance up at the door you forgot to lock. They're hunting for you. They pass by, but the odd sense of light-headed detachment you felt since killing the King begins to fade. Now you must focus on getting yourself and your family as far away as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could move, with five pops of displaced air, the council of Magi appeared in the room, surrounding you. Everything went black.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"Why is he just standing there with his eyes closed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He thinks we're here to kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill him? Hah! I'm here to shake his hand,\" the Crimson Magus exclaims, thrusting his hot, leathery palm into yours. \"I've never shaken hands with a Kingslayer before. What an honour! The way you set him up, earned his trust all those years, then tricking him into the body of a defenseless child. You, sir, are an inspiration. Though a little preemptive moving in, I might say,\" he said, gesturing around the solar. \"You're not King yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull your hand free. \"I wasn't planning on killing him. I didn't plan any of this! And I certainly don't want to be King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually<i> that </i>is something we must insist on,\" the Light Magus says, drifting forward. \"There's never been a wizard sit the throne before. Such an arrangement would benefit us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to put me on the throne?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It may be the only way to save this Kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll never work,\" you shake your head. \"The Church will never go along with it. Nor the nobles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" the Magus nodded. \"However...\"</span></div></div>",

You move another large rock out of the way and just saw more darkness \"dam it!\". You had begun to think she may have lied to you, but you could not think why she would after all, the small bag you had contained her most precious items that had taken generations of her family to find. If you died down here Atub would as much as you but if your plan paid off you two and both of your races would have more power than anyone could possible dream of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving forward again you reached a wall of stone and hoped this lead to your destination. Atub had known about this hundreds of years old tunnel because a plague had hit Sentral long ago, and of course the other races were blamed for it. Many races ran and were cut down but the goblins instead dug tunnels and hid in till the madness had passed. The stone was moving and you could see light, one last shove and it moved out of the way. You crawled out and looked around the tiled room not sure where you were at first. You hear foot steps, you reach for your sword but it's not there, you remember you had to leave it back in the tunnel. Your just an unarmed naked orc in one of the most guarded places in Sentral. You prepare to fight with your bare hands but then the foot steps stop and you heard running water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around again at the unfamiliar surrounds and realise it is what humans call a shower block. You quickly move up against the wall and peak around the corner you see a human female showering with her back to you. You had been hoping for a male but beggars can't be choosers, you've got to move quickly or the female will smell you and raise the alarm.

That was the easy part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female human stands beneath the shower. The water cascades down her slim, pink body, hissing and steaming as it flows through her short black-and-red hair which glows like embers. You creep up behind her.

You try to muffle her cries and restrain her, but its not easy with just one hand. She sinks her teeth into your green flesh, kicking back at you, her heels connecting with your groin beneath the loin cloth. Her eyes blaze and suddenly her skin is like molten metal to touch. Now it's your turn to cry out as your flesh begins to char and blacken and smoke. Quickly you attach one end of the goblin jumper cables to your arm, the metal teeth biting your skin, and attach the other to her.

You grab the jumper cables shoving them in to the small bag, which seems a lot bigger now, with the other items that Atub lent you. You quickly cross the room to your new clothes and hides the bag under them. You just have enough put a towel around yourself as a group of human females reach the top of the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quickly move in formation across the room to your old body check to make sure you're dead and for other threats.

You smile even more in a few months time you can be back in your homelands with an army of mages taking the fight back to the demons that have invaded. The group of human females currently in front of you are some of your class mates, all trained to take on demons one-on-one or as a group. You hear more running footsteps, one of the human females comes up to you \"Good work Celoa!\" she points at your chest \"but maybe you should cover up a bit more\". You look down, you had the towel around your waist, you had forgotten that, unlike female orcs, many human females don't like showing their milk produces. You pull the towel up just as a very breathless and even more overweight pyromancer got to the top of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nAn hour later and you stood in your own private room admiring your new body, naked in the mirror. You had never understood why so many orcs and other races obsessed about human females. You ignored you the sexy bits and instead checked her muscles, her teeth, her feet and any other bit you would check if you were buying a horse. You also checked to see if there were any orc looking type growths. Atub had told you that there were three general rules that should be followed, when using jumper cables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Jump between two members of the same race.<br>\r\n2. Jump between members of the same sex.<br>\r\n3. Make sure both jumpers are unconscious during the jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtub had said if you didn't follow these rules it can increase the chance of parts of the previous owners personality bleeding though from memories and parts of your old body growing on your new one, especially around the genitals. It had taken a lot longer than you had thought to get though that tunnel, you needed to carry on with the plan. You dressed in your leather apprentice role, you will receive your rubber ones when you graduate to journeyman. You had arranged to meet the Sentral council of orcs and goblins in a pub in Darktown but just as you were about to go down the tunnel a message came, it said after you secured a \"skin\" the council wanted you to bring a crimson mage to the pub so they could have a practical demonstration of the jump. You knew with this body you could get any one to follow you in to the worse manmade hellhole in the history of the world.

Celoa was beautiful and sexy but next to eighteen year old Molly, Celoa looked like a old hag. Molly hadn't always looked like this, Celoa had been a late bloomer with magic only joining the crimson order at eighteen, she had been surrounded by eleven year olds. Feeling left out she drifted toward the other loner then a shy ugly girl named Molly. Over the years, Celoa became like a mother to all of her classmates but especially Molly. Celoa was good at everything she tried, the advantage of a late bloomer, but Molly was terrible at everything except one, Molly was great at making demon forms. Molly's current demon form looked like a goddess but underneath was still the ugly girl nobody had seen in years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Where do you want to go?\" <br>\r\n\"I was thinking Darktown\".<br>\r\n\"What?\" Molly looked surprised but a smile quickly spread across her face, she looked both ways down the corridor like you two were plot a conspiracy. \"Just the two of us\" you nod, you know from Celoa's memories that Molly prefers when it's just the two of you \"Ok let's go!\".

Each district in Sentral is split up by walls, for defence but more often than not to keep the increasing numbers of races apart from each other. Darktown was mostly lived in by orcs and goblins but at all times large amounts of other races passed though, if you wanted something illegal or a cheap prostitute in Sentral you came to Darktown. It was a fact that the town was the worst district in Sentral. It was five or six storey slum building all the way across to the opposite hill. The district got it's name from the river Dark that ran though the centre of the slums creating a valley. The river was a festering slow moving sludge filled with every disgusting thing you could thing of and a lot more that you couldn't. The bridges over the river rose high above it to escape the noxious gases that were strong enough to kill a orc at ten paces. As you stepped out of the light shining through the gate and in to it's shadow you saw the pub (and part time headquarters for the Sentral Council of Orcs and Goblins) on the other side of the valley.

Your father will soon complete his transformation into a true dragon. On that day he'll build up a new dragon empire and enslave the world. However, this made you uncomfortable. Why did this make you uncomfortable? The sole reason is that you were birthed from a human concubine. As you have observed Draconians who are a thousand years older or older can shapeshift into any humanoid form at will. When a Draconian can willingly transform from beast to man and back that is the sign that they will soon become a true dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were currently on the Rawridge Mountains in your father's cave. Your kin have created a hidden village in these mountains often luring unfortunate adventurers to their doom. At the moment you were watching over your eldest sister's eggs. Your sister Xorna was currently telling your father of her plans to take over Tryzantium. By what you could hear it involved making a pact with the orcs. Apparently it involved hunting down the demons that were plaguing the orcs. In exchange for helping  the orcs they would then pay tribute to your father. Yet since orcs are known to be slow witted when gathered together they foolishly agreed, with no idea that your father intended to create a new breed of Draconians and eventually true dragons by breeding Draconians and true dragons with orcs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you listen to the entire conversation. However, you started to feel a burning sensation. Suddenly you writhe in pain as your inevitable transition to becoming a Draconian begins. First a pair of silver wings protrude out of your back. Next your fingernails become sharp claws. Lastly you grow two feet in height, gain more muscle mass, and you grow silver scales on your back from where your wings sprouted. You panic as you feel your new wings. You always dreaded this day, but now there was nothing you could do. Within 10 or 20 years you'll probably grow a tail or horns depending on where the new scales appear first. As you slowly snapped out of your shock you felt unhinged. A strong desire to hunt and procreate overcame your being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your sister returned you took off to hunt for your first meal and to satisfy your lustful desires, yet in the back of your mind you were afraid that you would turn into a terrifying monster.

Your wife was waiting there, lighting the candles in preparation for your anniversary: a celebration to commemorate a year's long union. Her busty rack swayed as she did so, unbound by anything except for the creme-colored turtleneck dress. That thing struggled to contain her body, continuously riding up her legs and partially her ass cheeks as she shuffled around, forcing her to divert her attention now and then to correct its position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, dear!\" She sprung up from the bent-over position when you entered the room. A noticeable lavender scent hung about, probably from the perfume she was using. You enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's just us two today?\" You ask, pulling her in for a kiss.

You didn't think you've ever caught her glancing at a skirt, let alone wearing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...It was also not a secret that she was fond of girls, rather than act like a prim and proper lady. In fact, the two of you actually competed for Grace's affection back in the day. She certainly fostered a good relationship with your current wife, but you ultimately emerged as the winner after whipping out your eight inch cock and showing the nymphomaniac where her priorities lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I should welcome her, even though I was hoping it would be a romantic evening between us two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her exposed ass from underneath the dress, giving it a squeeze as you pulled her in for a kiss.

It is at this moment that the third party decides to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, not in front of others, please,\" your sister comes into the dining room, steaming in her bathrobe, clearly having taken a bath just now. She adorned a towel on the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you roll your eyes as you let go of your wife. \"Why'd you have to come if you were going to be such a party-pooper anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely to make sure my little Grace has a voice to speak up for her. Now get your paws off of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right,\" you fling your hands up in exasperation as you turn towards your wife. \"Did you set everything up already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about.

One of those people differed from the rest, standing in front of what seemed to be a throne and clothed in regal attire, which covered his portly belly. You cough, about to address this group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you noticed something strange. Your field of vision appeared to originate from a lower vantage point, almost as if you shrank to half your actual size. Your voice was puzzling as well, the cough being an octave or two higher than you expected. Looking around, you spot your wife and sister standing beside you, who were also swinging their heads in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sam, where the hell are we?\" You turn towards your sister, addressing her with the same high-pitched tenor. It annoyed you that she was now quite a bit taller than you, having to crank your head up to speak with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to you, eyes quizzically staring as if at a stranger. She narrows her eyes, before suddenly widening them in realization and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft,\" a snort escapes her lips, as her cheeks swell up with laughter. Your wife notices, also turning her attention to you. She tilts her head. \"Err... Sam, do you know this young boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Boy</i>? You've never heard her refer to you in such a way. But then, your height, your voice, everything begins to click as the cogs grind in place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know him? This little pipsqueak is my brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mirror!\" You shout to the rest of the figures, who were silently staring at you. The regal-attired one suddenly stirs, barking, \"Bring this young lad a mirror!\" to a nearby individual. It was a woman with golden locks descending down to her forest-green cloak, which covered her whole body. Her ears were quite unique: instead of the usual round curvature, they were slightly pointy and a tad bit longer than usual - almost like the ears of the Nightelves in World of Warcraft, though not quite as long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shall be done,\" she responds with a nod, before trotting off somewhere. The\"king\", on the other hand, turns to address you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize a little for the cold greeting, but the circumstances make this encounter a tad bit on the stiff side. But now that you are here: ask away and I shall attempt to answer every single one of your questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first of all, where the heck are we?\" Your sister immediately begins, taking no time to delay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question. We are currently in the kingdom of Tryzantium, in the world of Tamoria. I am the regent of this place - you shall address me as King Ivar. This kingdom is among the few of human's, but my realm is certainly the largest. No doubt due to my valiant war efforts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife coughs, a question seemingly arising on her lips. King Ivar notices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you may wonder why you're here.\" Your wife nods. \"In truth, I didn't hope to resort to this, but I was left with no choice. You see, the Woodelves from the East began to encroach onto our territory, poisoning our citizens and inventions in order to appease their wood-loving nature. Can't even send an army, their acid just melts through us like butter and their guerrilla efforts alongside their magic makes them an unpleasant group. Normally we deal with this by infiltrating and slaying their king once every few centuries, but he turned out to be a powerful foe this time. My Imperial Archmage, Janus Meade, was even...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trails off as the golden-locked woman entered the room, wheeling a large portable mirror that had a golden trim to match her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that you were at war with elves?\" You direct the question at the king, but it was actually the woman who responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not an elf!\" She grunts through her teeth with a condescending attitude as she approached you. \"This is just a... curse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is actually my Imperial Mage Janus,\" King Ivar responded through what appeared to be bouts of... laughter? Which he was clearly trying to hold back. \"He was a fine man with a wife and two kids, but his recent encounter with the elf king brought about this cursed form. Something about taking him as his wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently my lineage has an Elf Elder or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly right! He's only staved off his curse from advancement by consuming the essence of young, innocent lads!\" By this point he was fully laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your attention to the mirror in front of you, finally understanding what had occurred to you. You were young again - and by that you meant really young. You resembled your 10 to 11 year old self, complete with the short height, narrow shoulders, and childish face. You clearly regressed in age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit</i>. You think back to the days of when your sister made fun of your scrawny, prepubescent self, especially your... baby dick, which you were very self-conscious about before you underwent your growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does that mean I'm cursed too? I'm supposed to be a man, not... this,\" you remark, waving towards the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you want me to do?\" The woman, \"Janus\", answers, \"Humans are not even supposed to be able to conduct summoning rituals. I was only able to through elf magic and... several catalysts.\" She averts her eyes. \"I wouldn't be surprised that something would go wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janus, enough chatter, lead them to their chambers for now,\" King Ivar remarks, to which Janus gives a curt nod. You swiftly proceed to the hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four of you walk through the corridor, your sister Sam suddenly perks up, addressing you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there is something wrong with me as well, though I didn't want to reveal it to the king, but... take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly exposes herself, unveiling her bathrobe as the three of you divert your eyes and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp escapes your wife's lips, your new companion's eyes bulge out, and even you have to admit that you are stunned a little. Hanging between her legs was... a massive, girthy penis. It was a cock the size of which you never have seen before, not even in pornographic material. It was a beast the sight of which wouldn't appear strange on a horse. The veins that lined the monstrosity were visibly pulsating as a pair of pomegranate sized testicles descended below. A string of pre-cum was hanging off the tip of her head, an amount that wouldn't have been unrealistic for a full-blown ejaculation. You certainly could never release that much, especially in current form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ladies standing beside you seemed visibly hypnotized by the dick, you even noticed your wife visibly swallow - perhaps in fear - as she gazed onto it. Finally, the Imperial Mage pipes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears as if the two of you were both affected by the transfer. Perhaps even this young lady was as well...?\" She waved towards your wife. You look closely. She didn't appear to have been affected, but perhaps the change was hiding underneath her clothes. Or... maybe it was even mental...?</span></div></div>",

In its time of need, a Hero arose to vanquish all who threatened the kingdom. This was three thousand years ago of course, but it is said that the Hero would return should the kingdom require it. Not just said, stated very clearly in fact, with very detailed instructions on the appropriate summoning rituals for returning them. I followed them to the letter, using all the appropriate reagents and focuses. I can't understand what went wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the news of this, a sense of excitement swells within you and you puff out your puny chest. \"Maybe it did work.

Too much in fact. There were over twelve Sagas written about him while he lived, many more afterwards, and thousands of translations, all of which differ to such a degree that it is hard to discern truth from fiction. There are a few consistent elements however. He possessed great physical strength of course, not to mention cunning and a ruthless temperament, being merciless in his pursuit of his conquests, be they battle conquests or.... other. His most notable attribute was his huge, unwieldy weapon, The Unsated Sword. A powerful weapon but so oversized that only he, with his prodigious strength, was able to wield it. The Unsated Sword grew in power the more conquests the Hero slew, but it would never be satisfied, always thirsting for more. It is one of the things which makes me fear you cannot be the Hero, for it is said he could never be separated from it, and you clearly do not have- ah....\" The wizard stopped in his tracks, looking down at the meaty cock partially within Sam's robes. \"Perhaps...

Rigid like mithril, it was virtually unbreakable and every blow strengthened the wielder of this almighty protector - its essence pouring into the user like waves. Tales speak about its origin in the pits of Mount Krugmaul, forged by the ancient dwarves as ordinary shield and abandoned there after the Rapture occurred. Doused in oceans of mana, it gained sentience and with it bitterness, furious by its abandonment. Over time, that fury turned to solitude and it made an oath to faithfully follow the one who found it next as its own Master. The hero, in search of the dwarven-forged weapons, was unimpressed by his finding at first, but the two quickly bonded as Master and Servant and set out on their trail. Throughout the journey, the shield changed as it transferred its raw sea of mana to its bearer - from a rustic, dull piece to an elegant, sleek, beautiful display sought after by all the knights across the nation. In fact, the sagas even speak of the Hero's companion, cursed to a wretched form, who would routinely use the shield's power to... stave of... the curse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanus suddenly trails off as she stares at you wide-eyed, eyes quivering with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God!\" Janus exclaims.

If anyone knows how to make a map, email me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe World of [Insert name here] is a generic, vaguely medieval fantasy world of might and magic/swords and sorcery/dungeons and dragons. There are a shit load of races crammed onto just two continents, and unfortunately most of them are trying to kill each others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumanity, once top dog, is now somewhat on the back foot, having suffered a series of severe cataclysms in recent years and beset on all sides by Orcs, Elves, Demons, Dragons, Beastmen, and all the other races they've angered over the last 10,000 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human Kingdom of Tryzantium sits in the very center of the main continent on lush, fertile land. Its capital city is Lightgarde, wrested from the elves six hundred years ago, which is of vital importance due to its coveted position atop a confluence of trade routes, leylines, wyrmholes, and underground caverns that lead deep into the earth. Though Lightgarde is sheltered from war, out on the edges of the Kingdom villages are subject to almost constant attack from the other races and the hostile wilderness that has been allowed to spread unchecked.<br>\r\nTryzantium is defended by the wizards of the organization known as the Study of Magic, the holy armies of The Faith, local militia men and mercenary armies of all races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the north of Tryzantium are the northern wastelands, controlled by Orc warbands currently trying to repel/flee a demonic incursion.<br>\r\nTo the north-east are the steppes, an area of wide open grassland populated by a nomadic race of horse-riding humans fighting all out war with centaur clans.<br>\r\nTo the west are the Amazonians living in the shattered archipelago that was once the Kingdom of Horr. They are in constant war with the Orcs, who they are driven to wipe out utterly. Amazonian hunting parties frequently venture into Tryzantium, capturing human men that they then transform into Amazonians.<br>\r\nTo the east, the human Hashaan dwell on the other side of a great mountain range known as the Rawridge Mountains. Their relatively peaceful society was recently shattered by an event known as the Great Shift, which upheaved their strict caste system. The mountains themselves are home to the Draconians and what remains of the Dwarves.<br>\r\nTo the south is the vast, hot continent of Nagra, covered in arid plains and teaming jungles, home to the Nagrandii. <br>\r\nDotted all over the place are the Elven Forests. Elves are <i>generally</i> isolationist and non-aggressive unless pushed, but have been becoming increasingly belligerent with the weakening of humanity.<br>\r\nUnderneath all of this is the Underworld, a vast network of caverns and tunnels home to many undiscovered races. The Dwarves have recently been pushed out of their underground cities by the Vorelves, corrupted, carnivorous Elves.<br>\r\nParallel to all of this is the Demon netherworld, a parasitic dimension sometimes referred to as Hell. Demons feed off the mortal races, and sow discord among them in the way a farmer sows oats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnology has remained at a vaguely medieval level for thousands of years thanks to a pervasive anti-technology field that blankets the entire world, causing the workings of advanced technology to malfunction and fade from memory. Certain areas have managed to advance to a level comparative to 21st century Earth however. Fashion design continues to invent, driven forward primarily by elven fashion scientists, and has long since discovered both the zipper and exciting underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world has three moons: A red one, a white, and a black one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need a cartographer.</span></div></div>",

The women of Horr are cast out, and form the Horrian Remnant in Tryzantium lands.<br>\r\nWith the need to house the refugees, attempts are made to reclaim many of the old settlements taken by the wilderness, with promises of financial and military aid for the settlers.

Nonetheless, an experienced, fully-trained spell-caster can be the equal of an army - as such they are a resource tightly controlled by the government, the Church, and the Council of powerful Magi that oversee the development and deployment of all magic-users. Trained to fight and die defending humanity, wizardry is as much a military discipline as it is academic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe study of magic as performed by humans and semi-humans, often referred to simply as The Order, is split into five sub-orders of Colleges. The most powerful individuals of each Order make up the Council of Five Magi. The Council constantly struggles to keep the lesser magic-users in check, and will mercilessly quash any signs of dissent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Five Orders</b></u><br>\r\n<b>College of the Crimson Order</b><br>\r\nStudy the Lore of Pyromancy and Demonology. Can conjure fire and summon demons.<br>\r\nA demon that has been summoned into the world must first be shackled and bound before it can be of use, lest it run amok. The Crimson College often holds elaborate parties where it's students practice their acts of bondage on lesser demons, serving girls, and each other, involving judicious application of leather and extracted, processed tree sap. The other Colleges are never invited, much to their chagrin.<br>\r\nWear robes of red and black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>College of the Golden Order</b><br>\r\nStudy the Lore of Alchemy. Can transmute objects and are master craftsmen of enchanted items. Can transmute themselves into a combat form of living metal.<br>\r\nWear yellow robes often singed, sooty and stained from their study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>College of the Jade Order</b><br>\r\nStudy the Lore of Life and Beasts. Are wizards most attuned to nature. Have power over nature and can summon thorns and briars out of the earth to attack their enemies, command beasts, or call on elemental powers to aid them.<br>\r\nJade wizards are masters of shape-shifting, taking on animals forms for combat or travel. However, a transformed wizard will always have a distinguishing trait that they carry with them through all their forms, be it a birth-mark, eye colour, or their human voice.<br>\r\nThe colour of their robes is green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>College of the Grey Order</b><br>\r\nStudy the Lore of Necromancy and Vicissitude. Can reanimate corpses and cast curses of decay. Vicissitude resembles orcish fleshcrafting, granting the user power over flesh and bone, molding it like a sculptor molds clay. They can use these powers to fix bones and repair wounds.<br>\r\nGrey wizards are granted two forms: a monstrous form which is generally used in combat, as well as a blood form, which turns the user into a mobile pool of blood.<br>\r\nThe colour of their robes is dark grey. It helps hide the stains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>College of the Light Order</b><br>\r\nStudy the Lore of Souls. Capable of manipulating the very minds of beings - befuddling them, changing them, even extracting them entirely. Light wizards can move souls from one body or vessel to another, and as they age the most powerful of their Order are awarded the honour of transferring their souls to a younger body.<br>\r\nAre exceptionally dangerous and deceptive, but regarded favourably among the common folk simply because they wear robes of pure white and often cast illusions of great beauty on themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Wizard's Toll</b></u><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"Power corrupts. Magical power corrupts magically. \"<br>\r\n<i>- Albert Einstein</i></div><br>\r\nAlthough wizards are functionally immortal (but age slowly and can be killed), the continuing practice of magic exacts a payment on the body and mind. With every spell cast, a wizard becomes degraded somehow, less-human, eventually reaching a stage of inhumanity where they must be hidden from society or euthanized. The speed of deterioration can take as long as several centuries or as short as mere minutes, depending on a number of factors. <br>\r\nEach wizard's Toll manifests differently, but the Orders tend to progress along similar lines:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Crimson Order:</b> The wizard gradually takes on a demonic appearance. Their behaviour grows increasingly depraved as their moral sensibilities decay. Ultimately they resemble nothing more than natural demons (in so much that a demon can be called natural) in both body and mind, and are often Bound by other Crimson Order wizards once they become a danger to themselves and others. Many, mistaken for demons, are simply banished to hell.<br>\r\n<b>Golden Order:</b> Their flesh is progressively replaced by metal or mineral, and over time they resemble sculpture or machinery more and more. While often still animated, their sense of self erodes to the point will not act unless directly ordered to or operated by somebody else.<br>\r\n<b>Jade Order:</b> As their Toll progresses, Jade Order wizards grow distant to human affairs and closer to nature. They spend longer and longer periods in their animal or plant forms. Ultimately, the distinguishing trademark that each wizard carries between forms disappears, marking the point when the human form and mind is irretrievably lost.<br>\r\n<b>Grey Order:</b> The body gradually takes on the appearance of a walking corpse. The wizard develops a desperate hunger to feel the warmth of life once again, manifesting in several possible ways, not worst of which is cannibalism. In the final stages, the blood clots in the veins, the flesh begins to rot and drop off the bones, and the wizard is humanely incinerated.<br>\r\n<b>Light Order:</b> The wizard's physical form fades away, until only their spiritual essence remains. As the toll progresses and their hold on the physical world weakens, their attunement with magic increases but so does their vulnerability to obsidian. Light order wizards risk being drained inside obsidian or other soul-catchers, their soul trapped inside the rock forever in an existence worse than death. To protect themselves against this, a Light wizard will often attempt to secure themselves to the physical world by binding their soul to an item, animal, or human, or transferring it entirely to a new host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Sorcerer</b></u><br>\r\nSorcerers are a rare type of wizard able to cast the spells of all five Orders. Sorcerers are always the seventh son of a seventh son, though not all seventh sons of seventh sons are sorcerers.<br>\r\nWhile they have almost limitless potential, Sorcerers rarely achieve greatness. Lacking a strong allegiance to any particular College, they are seldom given entry to any of the inner sanctums, where each Order's most powerful and secret spells are kept.<br>\r\nAdditionally, the Magi work personally to curtail the training of Sorcerers, as a master of all five Orders would be a dangerous rival to even their combined power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Familiars</b></u><br>\r\nMagic-users often keep animal companions, otherwise known as familiars, that have been magically bonded to them in a process called familiarization. Familiars absorb a fraction of their master's Toll, suffering the same deleterious effects and helping to extend the wizard's lifespan.<br>\r\nAdditionally if the familiar is a magical creature, its master is able to perform any spell or ability the familiar knows. This rule applies even to shape-shifted wizards. For example, if a Crimson Order wizard were to familiarize a Jade Order wizard in the form of an animal, he would gain access to any and all spells known by the Jade wizard.<br>\r\nDespite the Magi's attempts to outlaw the taking of other spellcasters as familiars, very few wizards will baulk at the opportunity to familiarize a sorcerer, as doing so would give them access to the spells of all five Orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Female wizards</b></u><br>\r\nThe acceptance of female wizards is a recent development, brought about only by the desperate need for spellcasters in these dark and troubled times. Change is slow to be accepted by the long-lived, stubborn-natured wizards, and many wish to return to the old ways, where any woman found practicing magic would be bound, burnt, familiarized or worse.<br>\r\nThe forbidden, female-only study of witchcraft, a different branch of magic altogether, is still very much alive and persecuted brutally by the wizards, as it has been for thousands of years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Binding</b></u><br>\r\nIf a Wizard fails training, or is expelled, or goes rogue and is caught, they may be Bound. Obsidian manacles are affixed to the wizard's arms, legs and neck, and siphon away his or her powers until they are gone.<br>\r\nBinding is also the most effective way of a rogue wizard avoiding detection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Enchanted items</b></u><br>\r\nA spellcaster may enchant an item, such as a wand or sword, giving it certain attributes or allowing it to performing a spell on command. While the initial Toll cost of creating such an item is much higher than casting the spell once, the benefit of an enchanted item is it can cast the same spell an unlimited number of times without accruing any further Toll. Because of this, most spellcasters enchant items with spells that they use frequently.<br>\r\nEnchanted items can be used by anybody, regardless of magical talent, and many are now in the hands of collectors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Anti-magic</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Witch-hunters</b><br>\r\nThe rules governing the study and practice of magic are strict, and deserters are not uncommon. Many wizards go rogue, seeing the crumbling of the empire as an opportunity to claim personal power, and seek to establish their own towers and territories out on the borderlands.<br>\r\nWitch-hunters are men and women whose bodies have been fused with obsidian weaponry and augmented with clockwork prosthesis, allowing them to hunt down and kill rogue magic-users. The exact details of their creation and the extent of their capabilities are unknown; as such they are greatly feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Untouchables</b><br>\r\nAlmost as rare as wizards, Untouchables are individuals who are supremely magically <i>un</i>gifted, meaning they cannot be affected by any spell. Their immunity to magic is a characteristic much desired by the Study, who employ them to keep a watchful eye on the students.</span></div></div>",

It worships a single powerful Goddess, the All-Mother, Camanae, creator of the world and mankind, who is a triune godhead composed of three aspects - The Maiden, The Mother, and The Crone. The Goddess is often prayed to by her Individual aspects ('Mother protect me', 'Crone guide me') or as a whole, often referred to as Carmen in her singular form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much matriarchal as the Orders of Magic are patriarchal, the Church is led almost exclusively by women. It extols what it regards to be feminine virtues: purity, peace, and the power of creation. While not misandrist per se, the church holds that men are imperfect souls, in need of guidance, created to serve, fight, and die for the glory of women and that, through religious worship and sacrifice, devout men might be purified and reborn in the next life as women, perfect souls. Men are regarded as pitiable, innately sinful creatures, useful yet disposable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite its alleged mission of peace, the Camenae church is capable of fielding vast armies and has an ancient, bloody relationship with magic users and the nation of Ordania that continues to this day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess' holy fire is a entrancing gold-and-pink flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess is not above rewarding good behaviour, bestowing holy blessings on its most faithful.<br>\r\n<b>Armour of the Goddess</b> - the worshiper's body becomes wreathed in holy flame, which will block all demonic and magic assaults and deflect most physical attacks. The fire may be thrown offensively. It will however, burn through any clothing and turn armour to bubbling slag, necessitating that the worshiper live their life naked.<br>\r\n<b>Aegis Wings</b> - the devout sprouts a pair of angelic wings. They are large enough to envelop themselves and others, shielding them from harm. In addition, they can fly.<br>\r\n<b>Halo of Judgement </b>- the worshiper's head is surrounded by radiant light, granting them the ability to read thoughts and see past sins.<br>\r\n<b>Glorious Aureola</b> - not to be confused with glorious areola. The believer's body is surrounded by a luminous cloud. People close to the devout experience feelings of spiritual ecstasy and can be motivated to commit acts of great personal sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirroring their Goddess, their ranks are split in three - maidens, mothers, and crones. Maidens are those that work in the field, often fighting on the front lines. Mothers are involved in day to day running of the church, tending to the flocks and dispensing justice where needed. Crones maintain the archives of the church, and tend to the dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ranks</b><br>\r\nMother Supreme<br>\r\nMother Superior<br>\r\nGrand Great Mother<br>\r\nGreat Mother<br>\r\nMother<br>\r\nSword Maidens</span></div></div>",

Unlike the all-encompassing, powerful nature of the Triune Goddess, these deities are small gods, little more than powerful spirits that dwell within idols, totems, masks or fetishes and embody some aspect of their worshipers' lives. There are gods of cleaning, gods of the water well, hearth gods of making bread, even specific gods for which animal one might wish to hunt that day. One wonders how they keep track of them all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt times of crisis or during special celebrations, these spirit may be called upon or may itself choose a mortal vessel in which to inhabit, so that they might dwell within flesh-and-blood, and walk among their mortal followers. During this time, they might be compelled to perform acts according to their role. The human vessel in which they dwell may undergo significant remodeling during this time in order to fit its role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese Gods are the figures around which their society structures itself, with each individual clan or faction giving fealty to one or many gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemarkably, this system is rather democratic. Should the worshipers find their deity to be lacking in the performance of its duties, they may decide to have it removed from power. If this passes, the spirit is \"emptied out\", its soul forcible extracted from its spirit form, leaving only the mindless shell of its power. Candidates wishing to fill the role of the god may then step forward and, should they be worthy, their soul is transferred into the God-shell, and they gain all the powers and responsibilities that come with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Church of the Triune Goddess has sought to get their hands on an example of one of these God-shells for centuries, so that they might transfer the souls of one of their faithful into the Nagrandian god's form and from there influence the worship of the heathens towards the worship of Camenae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Orders of Magic have also desired to acquire such a thing, primarily as they have always been rejected by the gods for their arcane practices, and would like to create their own divine ally.</span></div></div>",

When physically manifest, He bears a striking resemblance to Camenae's divinely feminine form, almost identical in fact save for His manner of dress, His swaggering masculine presence, and the majestic cock that hands proudly between His curvaceous thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the Triune Goddess, The Triumvirate is composed of three aspects: the Youth, The Sire, and The Sage, each part embody a part of a man's life. Though each form a singular being, they often appear to act independently and are often prayed to individually - 'Sire guard me', 'Sage teach me'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Youth</b><br>\r\nSeen as the virginal young man, or boy, who has not yet awakened into manhood. He embodies adventurousness, ambition and new beginnings, youthful ideas and enthusiasm. To a Tryzantium local, He resembles a young, pretty maiden, though one strangely sporting a bust lip and bruised knuckles, with a cocksure air. At times he wields a wooden sword - a toy, but one capable of ending any who might laugh at this 'girl'-playing-as-a-warrior. At other times he wears the paychwork armour and second-hand weaponry of a young warrior being sent away to their first battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Sire</b><br>\r\nThe next phase in a man's life, The Sire embodies virility and conquest, consolidated power and authority, and the gaining of knowledge. Though a symbol of idealised manhood to the Versi, to a Tryzantium local He would resemble a haughty amazonian woman in her prime years, garbed in full plate armour and wielding a huge double-headed battleaxe that she hopefully won't cut herself with. He is large breasted and broad hipped, though in truth the broad hips exist to make room for the massive, meaty versian dick that sits between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirile and amorous, tales are told of the many times he has shapeshifted into alluring forms to seduce his conquests. He is said to be able to impregnate anyone and anything, and his children are beyond counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Sage</b><br>\r\nThe Sage embodies the final stage of a man's life. He is a wise man, representing knowledge, darkness and eventually death. He has lived her life to the fullest and has gained the knowledge of a lifetime. He is there to guide the Youth and advise The Sire when He needs it. He is the waning moon, the chill of winter, the dying of the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe resembles an old woman, often robed and hooded, clutching a tome of ancient lore or staff.</span></div></div>",

Wands are able to channel spells directly, bypassing physical and verbal components and conjuring the spell direct from the wizard's mind. This is vital for when a wizard is indisposed to speak or perform the intricate motions required for a spell, such as when in an animal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a wand at hand, a wizard runs the risk of becoming trapped in a form and will often secret their wand into a safe place before transforming, ensuring their ability to transform themselves back into human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWands and staffs also help in aiming projectile spells, such as fireballs, and to hide the spellcaster's intent from their opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWands and staffs can be enchanted like any other item, and owners will often equip them with basic,commonly-used offensive spells, such as the standard fireball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to channeling, some spells require components that must be met in order to be cast. These may be as simple as an ingredient, such as eye of newt, that is consumed upon casting. Some are more complex. For example, the reverse self-transmutation used by Gold Order wizards to transform from an inanimate form to their human form requires them to be in contact with human flesh upon casting, and additionally they must be in possession of 100% of their body. The loss of an arm for example, will make them unable to revert until their arm is recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most Orders have their own set of spells castable only by themselves and sorcerers, there are a number of spells common to all Orders:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Common Pool Spellls</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Low level spells</u><br>\r\n<b>Invisible hand</b> - allows you to manipulate objects from a distance with unseen forces.<br>\r\n<b>Erase</b> - removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a target, erasing Symbols, Runes, and Sigils.<br>\r\n<b>Tongues</b> - this spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a racial tongue or a regional dialect. The subject can speak only one language at a time, although it may be able to understand several languages. Tongues does not enable the subject to speak with creatures who don\u2019t speak. The subject can make itself understood as far as its voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed toward the subject in any way. <i>Tongues</i> can be made permanent with a permanency spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Mid level spells</u><br>\r\n<b>Familiarization</b> - a spell that binds an animal to the wizard. The animal becomes the wizard's new familiar, sharing in its Master's toll and surrendering any magic ability it has.<br>\r\n<b>Symbol of Silence</b> - When scribed on an object or person, a Symbol of Silence mutes any noise the target makes. A wizard affected in this way is unable to cast spells with vocal components.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>High level spells</u><br>\r\n<b>Splice</b> - fuses any two creatures or things. The outcome of fusion depends on the ability of the caster, though many result in abominations with (fortunately) short lifespans.<br>\r\n<b>Permanency</b> - This spell makes certain other spells permanent.</span></div></div>",

Formidable in battle through their mastery over fire, their combat capabilities are enhanced by their ability to summon demonic minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pyromancy</b><br>\r\nA Crimson wizard can create, grow, and mould fire into whatever shape or size they desire through a simple act of willpower. They can turn the smallest spark into an all-consuming conflagration or create terrifying beasts of flame that chase down their opponents and sow terror into the most stalwart of armies.<br>\r\nManipulating fire comes at a cost; the fuel that sustains the magic fire comes directly from the wizard's body, drawn from their own energy reserves. Overexertion in the use of pyromancy can leave the wizard physically exhausted and emaciated.<br>\r\nThis energy usage encourages wizards to stock up on this 'fuel' by building fat reserves. Master pyromancers are well known for their great girth, and often have to be carried into battle on litters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Demonology</b><br>\r\nSummoning a demon, especially for the first time, is a dangerous and difficult procedure. A demon's physical form must be shackled and bound to anchor them to this world.  Additionally the allegiance of the demon must be gained lest it wreak untold destruction. The easiest means of doing so is by entering into a pact with the creature, receiving its temporary servitude in exchange for something offered by the wizard, usually in the form of sustenance whether that be blood, flesh, or souls. So long as the wizard maintains his side of the bargain, demons are physically incapable of breaking the terms of the agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively a demon can be dominated, its mental defenses beaten down through pleasure and pain. Once broken, a demon may be cajoled into forming pacts that it otherwise would never make; i.e. offering its servitude to its master eternally in exchange for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this end, Crimson wizards are experienced in the application of pleasure and pain through torture and (usually) sex. As such these wizards are allowed to live relatively unhindered lifestyles, freely practicing their arts of ecstasy, torture, dominance, and submission. They are not required to submit to the libido-sapping effects of the lech. In order to further their study, crimson wizards are expected to spend at least one year as the opposite sex, jokingly referred to as a 'gap year' by male wizards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Crimson College frequently holds great masked balls where it's students may practice their acts of bondage on lesser demons, serving girls, and each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wear robes of red and black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fireball</b> - a basic fireball spell<br>\r\n<b>Invoke minor demon</b> - can summon imps, gremlins, and hobgoblins<br>\r\n<b>Invoke demon</b> - summons a demon of average power.<br>\r\n<b>Invoke archdemon</b> - summons a powerful demon to beat people up for you.<br>\r\n<b>Pleasure</b> - the wizard's touch induces sensations of great ecstasy.<br>\r\n<b>Pain</b> - the wizard's touch induces sensations of unbearable agony.<br>\r\n<b>Demon form</b> - the wizard adopts the physical manifestation of a summoned demon as his or her own, gaining its appearance, attributes and powers.<br>\r\n<b>Shadow assassin</b> - A spell used by female wizards. Following sexual intercourse, a female wizard can induce an accelerated pregnancy resulting in the birth a creature of shadow. This \"shadow baby\" resembles the \"father\" and will perform a single task, including assassination, without fail, before fading away.<br>\r\n<b>Hell jumping/ Fel walking</b> - temporarily shifts you into the demon's netherworld before bringing you back. Due to spatial differences in the dimensions, moving only a short distance in the netherworld will cause you to have covered a large distance once returned to the real world, making this a very efficient way to travel, except for the hordes of soul-consuming demons that lurk on the other side. Statistically speaking, is still the most dangerous way to travel.<br>\r\n<b>Summon portal portal</b> - produces a stable portal to the demon netherworld, allowing unlimited two-way travel between realms. Generally not advisable.<br>\r\n<b>Invoke Djinn</b> - summons a demon lord of near limitless, reality-bending power. In return, the wizard's soul is cast into the deepest circle of hell to suffer in infinite agony. The wizard's body is transmuted into a vessel for the demon, often something small and innocuous like a box or lamp. The Djinn can be commanded by anyone holding its vessel to do almost anything. However, while it <i>must</i> obey, it is a cunning and deeply malevolent entity and will attempt to twist and pervert any command it is given. In effect, only the truly insane have ever performed this spell and few Djinn vessels exist. While Djinn may be given unlimited commands, nobody has ever made it past three wishes with their mind or body intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Toll</b></u><br>\r\nWith the progression of the toll, the wizard's behaviour grows increasingly depraved as their moral sensibilities decay. They tend to gravitate towards one or more of the Six Sins: Lust, Greed, Gluttony, Sloth, Wrath, and Pride.<br>\r\nIn addition, the wizard gradually takes on a demonic appearance. Ultimately they resemble nothing more than natural demons (in so much that a demon can be called natural) in both body and mind, and are often Bound by other Crimson Order wizards once they become a danger to themselves and others. Many, mistaken for demons, are simply banished to hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>College</b></u></span></div></div>",

The physical laws that govern the universe bend to their will, allowing them to transmute objects, themselves, and manipulate metal in much the same way that pyromancers manipulate fire. They covet gold because this soft metal can be manipulated with ease, and because gold is the only element that can not be magically transmuted (except through the three philosopher stones). They are master craftsmen, producing many arcane devices and enchanted items. They are also great merchants and financiers, operating a banking system that rivals that of the goblins. All for the purpose of accumulating gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn battle, gold wizards may transmute themselves into nigh-invulnerable metallic combat forms. This is not an ability shared by all however, and those without it simply wrap themselves into skins of liquid metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gold Order eschew the mysticism and arcane rituals of the other orders, preferring a down-to-earth, practical magic built on rigorous study, trial, and error. They wear yellow robes that are singed, sooty and stained from the aforementioned errors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Manipulate metal</b> - beneath their touch, metal runs like liquid, forming itself into shapes as the wizard desires. Different metals are easier to control than others, with gold being a delightfully soft, pliable metal.<br>\r\n<b>Rusting grasp</b> - any iron or iron alloy item you touch becomes instantaneously rusted, pitted, and worthless, effectively destroyed.<br>\r\n<b>Make whole</b> - completely repairs an object made of any substance, even one with multiple breaks, to be as strong as new.<br>\r\n<b>Self-transmutation</b> - the wizard attains a metallic form resilient to physical damage, disease, drowning, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect physiology or respiration, as they have no physiology or respiration to effect. They are however vulnerable to spells which would otherwise affect metal (such as rusting grasp), conduct and can be immobilized with electricity, and must be in contact with living human skin to resume their human form.<br>\r\n<b>Imitate object</b> - the wizard is able to imitate perfectly any non-living object. The wizard adopts any magical properties, abilities, or limitations of the object, and cannot cast any spell except the counter-spell. The wizard may speak; the counterspell to return to human form is vocal.<br>\r\n<b>Animate objects</b> - the wizard imbues inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life.<br>\r\n<b>Petrify</b> - <br>\r\n<b>Exchange properties</b> - the wizard may swap the properties of any two objects, for example he or she may turn swap the properties of a human and a statue, turning the stone into living flesh and the human into stone. Requires the wizard to be touching both items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Toll</b></u><br>\r\nTheir flesh is progressively replaced by metal or mineral, and over time they resemble sculpture or machinery more and more.

In one camp are those who believe it is their solemn duty to protect and nourish life. They tend to be compassionate and kind, defending those who can't defend themselves and helping others to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other camp are those who believe that all life is in a constant fight for survival, that only individuals of strong body and mind have a right to live. They tend to be ruthless and cruel, exploiting those they see as weak and discarding them when they become a liability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Spells</b></u><br>\r\n<b>Animal sight</b> - the wizard is able to enter the mind of a simple creature, see through its eyes, but cannot directly influence its actions.<br>\r\n<b>Creeping tendrils</b> - summons vines from the ground that move to the wizard's will<br>\r\n<b>Growing strong</b> - calls forth accelerated plant growth even in the most inhospitable environments. Fruiting plants will put forth a bountiful crop.<br>\r\n<b>Animal growth</b> - a chosen animal grows to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight<br>\r\n<b>Imbue life</b> - the wizard may donate a portion of his life force, invigorating the recipient with youth.<br>\r\n<b>Adaptive Cocoon</b> - the wizard is immobilised in a tough, protective cocoon. This cocoon can withstand great extremes of heat and cold but may be pierced by blades. Inside the wizard undergoes a metamorphosis into a form suitable to survival in the outside environment.<br>\r\n<b>Shapeshifting</b> - the wizard can take on the form of any creature. In this form, the wizard cannot cast any of his magic except the spell to resume human form but gains access to any of the abilities, traits, or spells the new form naturally possesses.<br>\r\nAll wizards carry a distinctive trademark that is carried throughout their forms, which can take many forms, such as a birthmark, a certain eye colour or their human voice. Whatever its nature, the removal of this trademark will result in the wizard becoming trapped in the form. Other modifications to a form, such as the fitting of horseshoes, piercings, or wounds may also hamper the ability to transform.<br>\r\nIn additionally, a wizard cannot shift back if their immediate surroundings are insufficient to accommodate their human body.<br>\r\nA wizard is vulnerable to familiarization as an animal, as well as any other spell that specifically targets any form.<br>\r\n<b>Hive mind</b> - a jade order wizard may transform into a group of animals, such as a flock of birds or swarm of ants. Maintaining their human identity is challenging, becoming more difficult in relations to the number of animals involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Toll</b></u><br>\r\nAs their Toll progresses, Jade Order wizards grow distant to human affairs and closer to nature.

Certain eccentric wizards have even been known to make items of furniture out of the bodies of their still-living enemies.<br>\r\nThe process of fleshcrafting is painful, slower and more involved than most other forms of shapeshifting but comes with a significant benefit in that it does not block a wizard's power in their new form. In essence, the wizard is still a wizard, he merely <i>looks</i> different.<br>\r\n<b>Flay</b> - the wizard tears away the skin of creature or humanoid as easily as peeling a banana. It is a horrific sight when being employed offensively but has a surprising beneficial use in the removal of skinsuit parasites from a host.<br>\r\n<b>Animate corpse</b> - the corpse of any victim killed by the wizard may be bestowed with a semblance of life and will serve the wizard unwaveringly.<br>\r\n<b>Life siphon</b> - drains the life energy of a target, aging them and reinvigorating the wizard.

At higher ability levels, the caster can conjure false memories directly into a target's head.<br>\r\n<b>Impel</b> - by drawing or tattooing a command on a subject's body, the subject is forced to obey it to the letter.<br>\r\n<b>Sculpt sound</b> - you change the sounds that creatures or objects make. You can create sounds where none exist, deaden sounds, or transform sounds into other sounds.<br>\r\n<b>Mind scan</b> - the wizard peels away a target's mind, allowing them to peer at the memories and thoughts inside. Exquisitely painful to endure.<br>\r\n<b>Mind wipe</b> - empties a targets head of all memories, personality, and knowledge. If the mind has been previous backed-up on a soulstone, the memories and personality can be reinserted, otherwise they are permanently lost. Alternatively, the void can be filled with new memories or a new soul without fear of rejection.<br>\r\n<b>Possession</b> - the wizard turns into vapour and may enter a body to take control of it. The wizard does not have access to his magic while in this body but can use any abilities their host might have and read their memories.<br>\r\n<b>Transmute soul</b> - a target's soul leaves the body and is transformed into a wild animal. If the target does not recapture their soul within 24 hours, they die.<br>\r\n<b>Living ghost</b> - the wizard may create a soul-copy of an individual, complete with the original's memories and personality. The artificial soul may even believe they are the original. Requires a soulstone, onto which the copy is stored.<br>\r\n<b>Soul jump</b> - the wizard's soul jumps into a new body, forcing that soul to jump into his. This connection of the souls to their new bodies is tenuous at best and may reset at any time unless one of the bodies is killed or one of the souls is indoctrinated into accepting its new home. Additionally, a wizard does not carry over their powers of wizardry into the new body, not even the power of soul jumping, and so are at danger of becoming stranded in a body not their own. As such, this spell is usually only used as a measure of last resort.<br>\r\n<b>Soul transfer</b> - using a secret, unholy ritual, a dying wizard can be transferred permanently into a new body. Importantly, the wizard is able to carry over their magic into this new body, while gaining any abilities the new form has and shedding any toll in the process. Has the potential to create a wizard of a non-human race or amplify the powers of an existing wizard should they transfer into a body that is already a wizard.<br>\r\nThe new body's original soul is destroyed in the process.<br>\r\nThis ritual is reserved only for the most powerful of the Light Order hierarchy. There is evidence that the current Light Magi has been repeatedly stealing the bodies of his successors for many hundreds of years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Toll</b></u><br>\r\nThe wizard's physical form fades away, until only their spiritual essence remains. As the toll progresses and their hold on the physical world weakens, their attunement with magic increases but so does their vulnerability to obsidian. Light order wizards risk being drained inside obsidian or other soul-catchers, their soul trapped inside the rock forever in an existence worse than death. To protect themselves against this, a Light wizard will often attempt to secure themselves to the physical world by binding their soul to an item, animal, or human, or transferring it entirely to a new host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>College</b></u></span></div></div>",

As an inheritable trait, it has been intentionally and extensively cultivated by royal families for thousands of years through selective intermarriage within royal lines, and the cutting out of inheritance of titles to those waywards who debase their bloodline via marriage with the lower classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcquiring and distilling this noble trait into ones bloodline takes generations yet can be greatly diluted within even a single generation, thus most nobles will risk a marriage to a lower class only if the benefits greatly outweigh the costs, such as if the partner is vastly wealthy or (in the most rare and scandalous cases) where the two are in so-called \"love\". Many wealthy merchant families have bankrupted themselves attempting to obtain noble marriage partners for, while titles may be bought or bestowed for the right price, only the blood secures the family's authority for generations to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe term 'blue blood' is a misnomer - even the king himself does not <i>actually</i> bleed sky-blue humors. Even at its most potent among the most <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">inbred</span> highborn families, it is no more than a mild blue tinge that colours the blood a shade similar to tyrian purple, and determining the presence let alone the level of blue-bloodedness is often a task requiring skilled hematologists . Also important to note is that every investigation undertaken by the Colleges so far has demonstrated that the trait offers no more discernible, practical benefit than, for example, having green eyes or big ears. Even still, it is revered by the poor, highly sought after by arcanists for use as spell-components and many of the most powerful royal heirlooms are keyed to only be wielded by somebody with blue blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of treatments are capable of masking or faking the trait. A tonic of certain metals will grant the appearance of blue blood, though it must be taken regularly and carefully, as the ingredients are all highly toxic. A number of elixirs will also eradicate the trait, some even permanently. In addition, a squalid lifestyle - malnutrition, base living conditions and hard, outdoor labour - will cause the trait to dwindle rapidly until it becomes that of an everyday serf, for reasons not yet understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an addendum and minor curiousity, the reverse is true for the strange humans Versiland, who have naturally occurring 'blue blood' and red-blooded royalty.</span></div></div>",

The Mother Supreme acts in a similar manner as an Ordanian king would and enforces spiritual law. If the Queen of Tryzantium is a devout follower of the Goddess Carmen then she may act as the Mother Supreme herself until the church can vote on who will assume the position.

Divine Blood courses through the veins of gods, demigods, angels, and surprisingly demons. Though they have the same type of blood there are unique characteristics that be used to distinguish the blood from the different carriers of Divine Blood. There are four grades of Divine Blood with the grade occurring in the gods being the highest. Many corrupt rulers desire this blood in hopes of achieving immortality themselves. As learned from the Tyrians killing a god for his blood or to study his powers is a serious taboo followed by a nasty curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Noblelization</b>: Noblelization is the process which a serf or commoner undergoes to turn their blood \"blue\" without faking the trait. Noblelization is a long process, but it is the safest way for a non-noble to achieve blue blood in order to become a noble. The most common way that occurs in Tryzantium, Ordania, Erolus, and other kingdoms is knighthood. For reasons unknown a commoner who manages to become a knight quickly gains this desirable trait. Also a healthy lifestyle and superb living conditions can cause the trait to appear as well. In Bishan the professions of monster taming and sumo wrestling also produce this trait. This is why many nobles in Bishan are top ranking sumo wrestlers or expert monster tamers. The last way is through clerical activity. Clerical activity is the slowest way to receive the trait for Noble blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Abandoned Ruins</b>: There are several abandoned ruins in the world and many of them contain powerful artifacts. Upon entering a ruins those that explore the ruins must be prepared for a life altering encounter. The most famous is the Temple of Lost Seasons. Those that enter the temple usually don't come out the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alternate Dimensions and Parallel Universes</b>: When it comes to alternate dimensions it is accepted by all magic practitioners. These dimensions are where gods, djinns, demons, and other worldly creatures dwell. Parallel Universes are a tougher thing to explain. Erolusian monarchs claim that they exist due to their extreme psychosis and constant habit of breaking the fourth wall, but other people in the world scoff at the idea. The only other people to know about alternate realities are Blorogons and djinns.</span></div></div>",

They claim many forests as their own, including those in human lands, so the two races share an uneasy co-existence. Each forest is an independent realm, ruled over by its own king, queen, and their court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElves are arrogant and aloof, though perhaps deservingly so, as they are immortal, invariably beautiful and gifted both in martial prowess and magic. Their belief in their own perfection makes them cruel and callous in regard to all other races, and they guard themselves violently against outside influences that might tarnish their perfection. Despite its refinement, or indeed because of it, their culture is highly static and stagnant, as they have an innate racial fear of change. They would like nothing more than to sit in their lofty cities for the eternity their immortality affords, marveling in their own self-perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ascension of humanity has been an irritating challenge to their vision of supremacy ever since the first proto-humans fought the elves and pushed back the boundaries of their forests.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything in this world comes at a price and immortality is no exception. For the High Elves that price comes in the form of degradation. Every hundred years or so of their lives, an individual High Elf will spontaneously undergo a change, a mutation that warps their body or mind until what emerges is no longer a High Elf but something new, one of potentially thousands of flavours of elf, each more troublesome than the last. Additionally a degradation can be induced if an elf is brought to near death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor our first example, I present the degenerated clade known as the Night Elf. Notice the altered pigmentation of the skin and the eyes that glow with a lunar radiance. This variant is nocturnal, half-feral and lives mostly on the ground or even <i>within</i> in, inside dens built into the roots of trees. They dress in furs and they are <i>extremely</i> territorial, even by elvish standards, yet as long as you respect that they are actually more amenable to outsiders than High Elves. So you can see, not every degradation is bad, at least from the perspective of the Order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_rUosuk--A9s/TRmSHeDRbvI/AAAAAAAAAf8/pqrQho4MZrU/s1600/CDEV_phroi_blizzardcorners_NE_final.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_rUosuk--A9s/TR...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, while this degradation may be relatively mild, others leave them barely recognisable and completely insane. The poster child for this, the Drow variant are habitual torturers and rapists with no exception. White hair, black or purple skin, seen here. Kill on sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://orig04.deviantart.net/64b6/f/2014/145/5/0/drow_assassin_by_seraph777-d7jg811.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://orig04.deviantart.net/64b6/f/2014...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven enough time and the appropriate treatment, these changes can be reverted. The High Elves invest much of their energies to containing and reverting their mutated brethren, for all are an affront to their perfection by their mere existence. They purge the degradation, or put them down if this fails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I could go on all day listing elvens subtypes because there are hundreds, and new variants pop up faster than the Jade Order can document them - but certain ones are common enough that at some point in the past they have gathered together in sufficient numbers to reproduce, forming stable, divergent populations of that elven subspecies. The High Elves generally hate these wayward splinters of elvenkind, and vice versa, which is great for us because we don't much like the High Elves either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo today we're just going to go over the most common variants. Tomorrow we'll have a look at some of the rarer ones. In the exam you will be expected to identify samples of these creatures and know how to combat them, so do pay attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Wood Elves</b><br>\r\nOne of the most friendly of degradations to humanity. The pale skin of the High Elf darkens to a nutty brown, and the elf will descend from the treetop cities to dwell on the forest floor where they seek to become one with nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Night Elves</b><br>\r\nSimilar to Wood Elves, except nocturnal and more aggressive. Adopt a matriarchal society where the females hunt and govern, and the males meditate and worship the moon and the spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Drow</b><br>\r\nOnce again, a matriarchal society. Males are treated little better than slaves. The Drow are fortunately rare on the surface. On occasion they send hunting parties from their underground cities to capture surface dwellers as slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vorelves</b><br>\r\nA deeply degraded offshoot, Vorelves resemble their elven forebears only from the waist up, possessive serpentile tails in place of legs. They live in underground warrens, rarely seeing the sun except when they come up to hunt, and their skin is a pale yellow - like a maggot's - as a result. They number in their millions, and perhaps represent the greatest threat to mankind should they ever emerge en masse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey take a sadistic pleasure in hunt and consume only sentient beings. For this purpose, their jaws can unhinge and their bellies swell, allowing them to eat their prey hole. Where this is not enough, their saliva has the effect of shrinking organic matter, allowing them to make mere bite-sized morsels out of larger prey. While their corruption has robbed them of much of their elven heritage, some are still capable of disguising themselves with glamour and walk the world above unseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey employ creations known as Bronze Hatcheries to contain and farm their prey. These labyrinths, composed of tightly coiled bronze pipe around a handspan in diameter, remind some of giant brains, though they may be any shape and range in size from just a few coils to the size of a room. Inside, they are are complex mazes which keep their tiny inhabitants in comfort and indulgence. Just lick 'em and pop 'em in the entry hatch! Mosses and fungi, both delicious and a potent aphrodisiac, grow on the wall, guaranteeing the hatchery's vorelf owners an endless supply of plump, juicy prey \"on tap\". Sections can also be sealed off and rendered far less pleasant, for the aspiring sadistic god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes more quickly on the inside of the hatchery, and while the vorelves lounge in torporous slumber, millenia have passed within. What current conditions are like inside the hatcheries is unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Deviants</b> are elves whose minds have cracked from the intense boredom that only immortality can offer. Hungry to experience something of novelty, they leave their forests to hunt out the new, the strange, and the exotic. They revel in highs and lows of emotion. They abandon the High Elves' notion that immortality must be closely cosseted, instead throwing themselves into danger solely for the thrill. Living amongst the other races, they relish foreign cultures. Life outside of the shaded forests has a notable effect on the pigmentation of their fair skin, turning it to shades of dark blue or purple, and their golden hair to silver.</span></div></div>",

A lone Orc cay be rational, calm, even courteous, but put two together and this all changes. Each Orc emits pheromones that dull the intelligence and raises the strength and irritability of all others in its vicinity. This effect is cumulative. A rule of thumb is that for each additional Orc in a room, deduct 10 IQ points (with no lower threshold), and double their strength. The presence of a female Orc will further compound the situation by turning the male Orcs' aggression towards <i>each other</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Orc mind is a simple thing; they believe that size is everything. They will always attack if they have greater numbers. They always go for the biggest sword or heaviest axe. Their war chiefs are selected based on who is the strongest or simply the largest. Since Orcs appear to have no natural upper limit on their height or girth except what they can support in food (given a large enough supply of food an Orc could reach the size of a castle), and combined with their penchant for body modification, this has led to war chiefs of truly staggering proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrcs have an instinctive capacity for fleshcrafting, which they use to embiggen, empower and modify their own bodies, and shrink, weaken and mutilate their enemies. They are durable to the extent that they can, and frequently do, work armour and weapons directly into their flesh, turning themselves into living mechanical weapons. War chiefs, growing ever larger and constantly augmenting themselves, eventually begin to resemble vehicles or siege weaponry more than humanoids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJealous of humanity's advanced grasp of magic, the Orcs recently made an attempt to gather together their greatest magical minds in an attempt to forge their own College. In light of the fact that Orcs grow stupider when gathered together, this was one of the most foolish undertakings in history. The resultant explosion tore open portals the length and breadth of their territory, infesting their lands with demons, against which the Orcs now fight an endless battle. Many Orcs now do what was once unthinkable to them - they flee. Pushed out of their own lands, they encroach on human lands. A few have even succeeded in settling peacefully in human towns.</span></div></div>",

A population of fishermen and farmers, when an army of Orcs threatened their lands they were powerless to stop them. Overwhelmed and with their king dead, his wicked advisor ventured into the sealed catacombs beneath the city, retrieved a forbidden demon artifact and called forth a Succubus Queen with whom he forged an diabolical pact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting explosion shattered the peninsula into a broken archipeligo and transformed every Horrian male - man and boy - into half-succubi warrior women, who forced back the green Orcish tide. Having secured what remained of their lands, they proceeded to cast out the Horrian women who had been untouched by the demon's spell. Renaming themselves Amazons, they now strive to rebuild their shattered lands and their numbers for a counter-offensive against the Orcs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazons reproduce by the seduction or rape of other races; during intercourse, their partner is sucked into the Amazon's body and undergoes a unholy metamorphosis within the womb, turning them into a fellow Amazon. Upon being rebirth, they are tortured until their mind are broken before being indoctrinated to be more Amazonian. Only the strongest enemy soldiers are chosen to become Amazons and they are ironically sexist about it, chosing only men, regarding women as too frail and soft to join their number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their unnatural methods of reproduction, a rogue group of Amazons have recently begun experimenting with such concepts as 'femininity' and 'motherhood', though as Amazons still retain much of their formerly male minds, they tend to suck at it. To explore these alien concepts, they trap captives into child or baby-like forms during the rebirth process, and mother the transformed captive in lieu of the children they are unable to bear themselves. Given the Amazons' rather skewed perception of motherhood and their total lack of maternal instincts, it is unclear if death is the more desirable outcome.</span></div></div>",

There are as many potential halfbreeds as there are species of beast in the world, encompassing such things as centaurs, werewolves, dogmen and catgirls. New variations are constantly spawning wherever humans, animals and magic are in close proximity, though certain mixes are common enough to have banded together and formed their own societies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough wild-born halfbreeds make up the bulk of their numbers, not all were born as they are. Some are beasts that gained a semblance of humanity through magical interference. Others are human-born, humans that have adopted (or had forced upon them) animal traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow anthros are treated by humans varies greatly depending on the species, the location, and whether or not they have an owner. Most larger towns are tolerant of feline, canine, and lizard men on the proviso that they don't cause trouble, though they are only afforded the rights of animals, not humans. If they have no owner, they can be killed without trial and anyone wishing to claim them can do so simply be catching, collaring, and branding/tattooing them. Life for a free anthro is a constant struggle to remain unclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a middle-ground, anthros may surrender their ownership to a military, such as those of the Study or the Faith. While owned by these organizations they cannot be claimed by others and enjoy marginally more freedom compared to slaves owned by individuals. They are often used as scouts, front-line soldiers and in high-risk operations, and can even progress through the ranks and garner a modicum of prestige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the sticks, where wild anthro raids are common, any anthro not under the clear, direct control of a human will be treated as a dangerous animal and attacked on sight. The more dangerous types, such as werewolves, vampires, and centaur are not tolerated even in the liberal city of Sentral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Felini</b><br>\r\nCat-human fusions that are popular as slaves for their high docility and intelligence. The coverage of the fur varies between individuals, from coating just the tail and ears, to encompassing the whole body. They are commonly used as scouts for the agility and speed, and as concubines for their sensuous natures. Female felini go into heat roughly once a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Canids</b><br>\r\nDog-humans fusions are frequently employed as slave labour for their endurance, strength and unwavering obedience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Saluria</b><br>\r\nLizard/human fusions, saluria are prized by the Study for their innate capacity to memorize and cast spells. Individual saluria can be taught around 4-6 simple spells and are often given into the ownership of battle wizards, assisting them in their duties.<br>\r\nAs cold-blooded creatures, they become lethargic in cold weather and are constantly on the lookout for sources of heat, even if that means cuddling up with the closest warm-blooded creature. In hotter climates, saluria become aggressive, insubordinate or outright rebellious and are thus deployed appropriately to cooler climates where they can be more easily controlled. The one spell they are never taught is the fire spell, as giving them control over their own body temperature would simple be asking for trouble.<br>\r\nSaluria worship deities of fire and light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Viera</b><br>\r\nRabbit/human or rabbit/elf hybrids, the Viera are tall, with long ears and supple limbs. They breed prodigiously and the Kingdom is currently taking steps to limit their numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ponygirls and ponymen</b><br>\r\nAn unsatisfactory result of an attempt at creating a more docile human-horse hybrid than the centaur, ponymen lack the hind quarters of the horse, having only equine hooves, mane, and ears. They are in most other respects human, unsuited for the strenuous manual labour they were designed for. This has not discouraged their owners forcing them into a harsh life of toil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Centaur</b><br>\r\nBody of a horse, head and torso of a man. They live in clans on the northern steppes and are in constant conflict with the human nomads, a war that spiraled out of a minor skirmish when the victorious humans coaxed their horses to mount the wives of the beaten centaur cheiftans. This obscene act united the clans forever against the humans.<br>\r\nThey possess an aggressive, independent, and willful temperament and are rarely used as slaves, as most centaur will sooner kill themselves. Those that have been successfully tamed are seen as items of great esteem by their owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Werewolves</b><br>\r\nIt is unclear specifically why, but wolf-human hybrids are invariably unstable creations, both mentally and physically. The wolf and human aspects fluctuate in dominance according to the waxing and waning of the moon and mentally the two aspects are constantly waring with the other, resulting in individuals who are tormented, violent, or insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vampire/Vampyre/V'\u1e27mp\u0119\u011br</b><br>\r\nOne of the most ancient human-animal fusions, originally the vampire were nothing more than bat-human hybrids which drank blood. This all changed when the first proto-vampire fed on demon blood, imbuing his subsequent bloodline with a host of unholy powers and elevating them into a new, distinct race.<br>\r\nVampires are creatures of darkness, able to shape-shift into a number of forms, even living shadows, but unable to walk in daylight and deadly vulnerable to fire. They are able to dominate lesser minds with a mere glance.<br>\r\nVampirism peaked 450 years ago, attaining a domain that encompassed most of humanity. In those dark days, there were few villages that didn't fall under the shadow and predations of a vampiric baron, forced to pay homage in the form of delicious virgin women. However, their time in the sun (so to speak) did not last and hunted to \"believed\" extinction since then, they now exist as a fraction of their old numbers, hiding from the world, slowly rebuilding, plotting, and scheming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Scrabs</b><br>\r\nUnpleasant, diminutive creatures a few feet in height, scrabs resembles a cross between a dung beetle and a tramp. They dwell in filth and love everything about it - the smell of it, the colour of it, the taste of it, rolling it up into balls, building little houses out of it.<br>\r\nThey are tolerated solely because they are fundamental to the smooth running of a sewerage system, or taking the place of sewerage systems where none exist, collecting and squirreling away fecal matter to do... goodness knows what with it.<br>\r\nThey have the greatest freedom of all anthros simply because no sane man would ever want to keep one as a slave or go anywhere near one.</span></div></div>",

Though study is hampered by the inhospitability of this realm to mortals, it would appear that demonkind is equally as varied as that of the mortal world, with species ranging from insects to sentient life of formidable intellect. The Demonology Department of the Crimson Order has studied and catalogued this infernal ecosystem for centuries, and shows no sign of completing their task any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite their seemingly endless variance, all demons share a number of characteristic - first and foremost, their need to feed upon the life essence of mortals. The crudest demons feed upon physical essences - often draining life-rich fluids such as blood. The more complex, intelligent demons favour more rarefied essences, and may be sustained by the consumption of the emotional and sensual energy produced by mortals in heightened mental states. To this end, these demons will seek to arouse intense feelings of terror, hatred, greed or lust from their prey, upon which they then feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most powerful of their number, the Demon Lords, sustain themselves on pure spiritual essence - feasting on the soul itself. In terms of sheer power, the Demon Lords rank almost on par with mortal gods and have forged unbreakable contracts with them over the years. The Demon Lords do not directly interfere with the mortal world; in return, all sinful souls are banished to Hell to be fed upon for all eternity. The Demon Lords constantly seek to find loopholes in the contracts, tempting humans to fall into sin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudies suggest that all demons share a natural hierarchy, and will rise and fall depending on how well fed they are. A low ranking demon such as a lemure that feeds particularly well will grow and ultimately metamorphosise into a greater demon, such as an Erinyes, while even Demon Lords may be reduced to tiny Quasits if deprived of their hoard of souls for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a mortal soul has been utterly drained of energy, it is cast aside and reborn as a demon on the lowest rung of the infernal food chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing not of this world, demons are abominations against all natural and divine order, and as such their powers are diminished by natural or holy substances. A sword made of wood will do more damage to a demon than one made of iron, for example. Leather will negate demonfire better than steel armour. And for some strange reason, tree sap processed into rubber will bind a demon with ease. It is for this reason that demon summoners are naturally quite fond of leather and latex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Demonkind</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Succubus</b><br>\r\nTiny horns, bat-like wings, and a sinuous tail betray the demonic nature of this alluring woman. A succubus drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act of passion.<br>\r\nAmong the demon hordes, a succubus can often rise to incredible heights of power through her manipulations and sensual charms, and many a demonic war has raged due to the subtle machinations of such creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Incubus</b><br>\r\nLike their succubi counterpart, incubi drain energy from a mortal lured (or forced) into an act of passion.<br>\r\nAn incubus in his true form is always muscular and attractive, with long hair and intense eyes. His skin can be of any color, but is always smooth and silky. When not using his wings for flight, an incubus can fold them to drape across its shoulders like a cloak. They are also often conjured for similar roles by mortal spellcasters, although care must be taken in dalliances with incubi, for they delight in causing pain to their companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Salikotal</b><br>\r\nOn lean limbs the color of spilt blood creeps a being of sinister grace. Eyes like embers and a sneer full of needle-thin teeth gleam from an unmistakably fiendish visage.<br>\r\nOften called the \"Assassins of Hell\" or the more sinister \"Slayers of Souls\". Despite ranking high in the infernal hierarchy, Salikotal still fall just short in their ability to consume a complete, whole mortal soul. thus upon dealing the fatal blow, the Salikotal will rip apart the soul of the victim itself. These soul fragments hide themselves in nearby vessels - animals or objects - or attach themselves to people, and are individually weak enough for the Salikotal to feed upon. The soul fragments will always be drawn to one another, wishing to be made whole again, and a Salikotal works feverishly to ensure this does not happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Patraavex</b><br>\r\nThis fiend is a horrendous amalgamation of snapping claws and writhing tendrils with a disgusting fanged mouth running vertically across its torso.<br>\r\nKnown as \"Sire Demons\", Patraavexes are the progenitors of many of the mortal realm's tieflings. Seeking mortals who either want hellspawn children or are willing to bear an infernal taint on their bloodlines in exchange for the demon's offerings, a sire demon lives to insinuate hell's influence into the mortal population. Patraavexes use their shapechanging ability as a bargaining chip with potential mates, who put their immediate pleasure above the long-lasting ramifications of corrupting their bloodlines with an infernal taint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Belier</b><br>\r\nThis amphisbaenic monstrosity has the body of a slug with a leech\u2019s mouth at one end and a knot of three human heads at the other.Masterful possessors and foul manipulators, belier demons are among the most feared masterminds of Hell. These worm-like fiends avoid physical confrontation. Instead, they target influential individuals for possession, using them to manipulate events by proxy. If their schemes are uncovered, the demons retaliate with all the power at their host bodies\u2019 disposal.<br>\r\nA bdellavritra\u2019s voice can emanate from its worm-like maw, from any of its human-like mouths, or from all four at once, as it desires. Each mouth has its own distinct voice, often pleasing to the human ear. Bdellavritras typically reach lengths of 16 feet from worm-mouth to human heads, and weigh 3,000 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lech</b> - parasitic leech-like creatures that feed on a host's lust, suppressing sexual desires. The feeding of a lech produces a feeling of euphoria in its host. If a lech is not allowed to feed within 24 hours, sexual urges generally resurface stronger than before, along with symptoms of withdrawal. Since the introduction of female wizards, the magi have enforced the usage of leches by all wizards out of concern that the opposite sex poses a distraction in warfare.<br>\r\nCuriously, the lech also has the effect of suppressing the onset of adolescence in prepubescents, maintaining them in a child-like state.</span></div></div>",

In revenge, the dragon queen cursed the humans such that they and their descendants would forever play host to the souls of her butchered children and, over time, become their new bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-human, half-dragon Draconians are the result of that curse. Though the children of Draconians are born essentially human, at the onset of puberty they develop wings and hard, metallic scales that spread across their body as they age. When fully formed, they are hot-blooded (to the point that their fresh blood will scald a human), fiery-tempered carnivores with voracious appetites and insatiable lusts for both treasure and maidens. They are ferocious, animalistic tendencies becoming more so as they develop. Ultimately, over many many years, a Draconian will lose their humanoid form altogether, becoming a true dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraconians periodically outgrow and shed their skins; garbing a human in these skins will give them the body of the draconian exactly as they were in that stage in their development, though will not afflict them with the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey live in the frosty heights of the Rawridge Mountains, coming down from their seclusion to hunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon queen retreated into mourning shortly after the destruction of her nest, not laying a single egg since that day; as such true dragons have vanished almost entirely from the world. However, the oldest Draconians, those surviving members of the original party of humans that destroyed the nest, have almost completed their slow transformation into full dragons and will soon become able to lay true dragon eggs of their own, ushering in a return to the reign of dragonkind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>True Dragons</b></u><br>\r\nNigh-indestructable, highly destructive, fire-breathing, flying reptiles. Extremely dangerous, kill on sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Wyrmholes</u></b><br>\r\nWyrmholes are magical tears in space and time that link areas many hundreds of miles apart. These portals lie along the migratory routes of the dragons; in the days of old they were formed by migrating dragons tearing through reality with their powerful magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fall of the dragons, the wyrmholes came under control of human wizards. They represent the safest, fastest method of travel over long distances, allowing wizards to be deployed anywhere in the world. Due to the nature of the holes, they are usually high in the sky, necessitating that the wizards build towers around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyrmholes fluctuate over a period of years according to the long-lost migratory paths and rhythms of the ancient dragons, becoming unstable or closing with little warning. Old wyrmholes may reactivate after periods of hundreds of years. The wyrmhole network is of paramount importance to the continued survival of Tryzantium and to keep it operational, the Colleges of magic constantly monitor the flow of energy -or leylines- that follows active holes and presages their collapse, and the Gold Order works hard to keep working the exotic machinery required to stabilise the tears long enough for somebody to jump through.</span></div></div>",

In this way Homunculi make excellent spies in times of war. However creating Homunculi is a forbidden practice in the art of alchemy. To create a Homunculus the alchemist must always have a live sacrifice when performing the ritual. If the alchemist is inexperienced or does not have a life to sacrifice, then they will forfeit their own life in order to create the Homunculus. When it comes to Homunculi they are nearly indestructible due to the unnatural way that they heal themselves.

Alchemists  are baffled at the reason why Homunculi remain young. Some have theorized that they get their longevity from a dimension that borders the world itself. This has led the church to brand them as demons even though they are neither human nor demon. In recent years a small group of Homunculi have been secretly planning the downfall of humanity. These Homunculi claim that humans are an inferior race and must accept that the way of the Homunculi is the next step in the natural order.

Their skin and feathers are hot to the touch and can be seen to glow slightly in darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenicians have a life cycle which mimics that of the phoenix. They live short lives, usually between 5-7 years, growing to maturity within the first year and deteriorating rapidly into old age as they enter their final months. Upon a natural death, the Phoenician bursts into flames and is reduced to a pile of ash. Nestled within the pile is a large egg, from which the Phoenician soon hatches, possessing the same memories, personality and soul but a new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the event of a near-fatal disease, poisoning or trauma, the body will hastily attempt to gather the energy necessary to  perform an emergency rekindle. Depending on the severity of the injury or disease, the rekindling may succeed, go awry (producing such curiousities as Phoenicians with the bodies of animals) or fail completely, with particularly violent deaths such as decapitation almost never succeeding. No matter the cause, if a rekindling approaches, the person will usually be made comfortable by their friends and family within a nest of dry wood and flammable material to assist in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire does not burn them, only energising them with life force. Indeed sufficiently hot flames have the curious effect of turning back their body clock, making them appear years younger, if only for a short time. Strong spirits have the same effect, combusting internally, and it is highly recommended for anybody attempting to pick up a Phoenician to check that the person they take home from the bar at the end of the night is the same age as when they met earlier that evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite growing to physical maturity in a year, newborn Phoenicians are generally not regarded as adults until they have gone through two or three life cycles. It is common for youngsters to have their wings clipped to help parents control them better and to signal to others that this person is to be treated as a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil only recently the Phoenicians were not a race, but a nation of humans, The Republic of Phoenice, which sits out in the warm, tranquil waters of the Hadriatic Sea upon the slopes of an island volcano. Within the volcanic caldera dwelt a phoenix to which the early human settlers of the island would make offerings as a means of appeasing what they took to be the mountain spirit. Over time these offerings became grander, ultimately spurring the formation of a grand maritime trading empire as they ventured further afield to find exotic gifts. Their merchantile fleet even began to rival the goblins flotillas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was going well until the cataclysmic shattering of the Kingdom of Horr. The earthquake triggered the eruption of the volcano, burying the capital of the republic beneath lava and ash. When the dust settled, the phoenix ventured down from the mountain to discover the bodies of the humans who had treated it so well over so long, sealed in molds of hardened ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStricken by grief, the Phoenix sacrificed itself in a final death, imbuing its immortal flame into the bodies. The stone casts broke apart, birthing forth the first generation of a new race. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that day, they have worked to rebuild their destroyed republic with a fiery optimism. With the goblins now dominating the seas, the Phoenicians have turned to a new technology - airships. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hobbits are a diminutive race of near-humans that live in small, close-knit communities distributed across all human lands, though favouring quiet rural areas. Their homes are built underground and can be found by the sight of windows and doors jutting from hillsides, though the sound of song and laughter is also a giveaway for this gentle race is fond of merriment, and can always be relied upon to provide a (admittedly cramped) room for the night to any traveler in exchange for a tale or two, and/or some mild cuckoldry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf given the chance, hobbits will commit their lives to nothing more than light agriculture, the maintainence of their dens-homes (for they are fiercely houseproud), and the endless extension and stocking of their cellars with good foods, sweet wines and pipeweed. No hobbit town has ever progressed beyond simple cottage industry. They do not produce weapons or armour (though a hobbit with a rolling pin is a formidable thing should you ever insult his or her home) and have no army. They depend heavily on humans more protection from the worst the world has to offer and in exchange provide us with quality food and a little tax and don't cause any bother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, hobbits stand around 4' tall with portly, paunchy figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey live up 200 years old and mature with their customary leisurely pace, reaching sexual maturity at around 40 years of age. The word 'hobbit' comes from the old hobbit language for 'whole person', which makes more sense once we look into their reproductive habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHobbits have a strange quirk of biology in that any offspring born to a pairing of two hobbits will grow to a full height only half that of their parents, roughly two feet tall. These children they refer to as 'halflings'. The offspring of halflings will be half the size again, one foot tall, and termed 'quarterlings'. Beyond that we have eighthlings, sixteenthlings and so on and so forth, becoming vanishingly small with each generation. I do believe the smallest we ever found were in a very old, very remote hobbit town. Well I say town, it was more of an ant hill. Individuals found were less than a third of an inch tall, if you can believe that! And if you don't, we have plenty of preserved samples in archives. Whether this represents a lower limit of their size, we've yet to confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalflings are not only shorter but slimmer than their sedentary parents. Where hobbits are slow, halflings are nimble. While hobbits are flabby and soft, halflings have dense, muscular flesh that pound-for-pound make them stronger and durable to blunt force and crushing injuries, traits which become only more pronounced and more necessary for survival as they get smaller. They also become more flighty, and many leave their homesteads to explore the world. Now I do believe we keep a sample of a quarterling somewhere in the desk for you to see... Aha, here we go. Notice the honed physi- Oh, <i>do</i> step back, ladies, you're supposed to be <i>wizards</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pre06.deviantart.net/6a5d/th/pre/i/2016/257/9/9/contemplation_by_keithgoodson-dahmdc0.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://pre06.deviantart.net/6a5d/th/pre/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the cupboard with you... Now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was I...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh yes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you would think to be a terrible racial curse does have a few positives. Childbirth is very easy for the females, as is providing food for the child - very useful indeed as hobbits tend towards large families. That said, hobbits and their fractional offspring all have an acute, instinctive understanding that the slow shrinking of their race over time leaves them vulnerable to the threats of the world, ultimately even rats and other vermin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way known to reverse this generational shrinkage is to incorporate \"whole-ling\" (human) blood into their offspring. This is to say that, by mating with a human, the progeny of such a union will always be one size larger.  There is thus a natural urge of the hobbit or halfling to gravitate towards taller mates, in the same that humans gravitate towards healthy or beautiful ones... indeed, as demonstrated by my handsome little sample a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile human-hobbit marriage is still quite rare, casual mating between the races is widespread and vital to their long-term survival. Hobbits have no taboo against it even if the hobbit in question is married, with cuckoldry seemingly viewed as normal. Do not be surprised or offended if propositioned in a hobbit-home. The couple are merely considering the best for their future children, and declining is considered impolite. Hobbit-husbands will happily sit and smoke their pipeweed while a human (or humans) goes about the business of impregnating their wife, and raise the resulting child exactly as they would their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen dealing with a hobbit or \"-ling\", be aware that their \"interest\" in a human is inversely proportionate to their size. Halflings may be <i>very</i> friendly and forward around a human, quarterlings will be extremely blunt about what they want, while eighthlings make the most adorable sexual predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally this type of inter-racial pairing could be expected to create problems for the female halfling, both in the act itself and the delivery of offspring proportionately twice her size. Fortunately nature has deigned to grant her remarkable endurance and the ability to painlessly unhinge her hips, allowing for the ingress of the male phal- *ahem*... well that's a lesson for another time.</span></div></div>",

An old wives' tale insists that sex with a boggart will cure anyone of fear. This is not true and is just unpleasant for all involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Catoplebas</b><br>\r\nAn aggressive, magical monster that resembles a bull, covered in dusky, metal scales. It breathes a noxious cloud of fumes that will turn any creature to stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pink Slime. </b><br>\r\nThis ooze is formed of meat slurry. Pink slimes were developed by a group of orcs whom the dwarves commissioned to build them an anti-vorelf weapon. These slimes aggressively envelope whoever they come in contact with, sealing them inside their dripping bodies, but find dwarves repulsive and shy away. Vorelf shrinking saliva has no effect of a pink slime, and an imprisoned elf has no choice but to eat his or her way free. If this is even accomplished at all, it usually leaves the elf too engorged to seek other prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Spiders</b><br>\r\nInject paralysing venom. Come in a variety of sizes (spiders the size of cats are not uncommon) and flavours.<br>\r\nSilk - spin webs of spider silk. Pretty generic.<br>\r\nRubber - spray strands of sticky rubber. A popular familiar for Crimson wizards.<br>\r\nDrider - an elf fused to the body of an spider from the waist down. Was all the rage for a time in elven society. When having a spider for legs fell out of fashion, driders were driven out, along with flared trousers and pogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Skinsuits/living skin</b><br>\r\nResembling the hollowed-out skin of a human or animal, skinsuits are imitative parasites that latch onto a host from which they draw their nutrients. These creatures hang from trees or lie in shallow water, waiting for an unsuspecting traveler to come close. Some have been seen to use their hollow bodies to float on gusts of wind.<br>\r\nOnce they have ensnared and rapidly enveloped their prey, skinsuits are so painful to remove - akin to tearing off your own skin - that they can only be removed with outside help or with great strength of will. After a few hours, the parasite becomes fully fused to the skin of the host, and cannot be removed.<br>\r\nDays after becoming trapped inside the creature, the skinsuit sheds itself from the victim, as does a second skinsuit resembling the host's original form. In this way the skins reproduce themselves. The resulting two parasites go their own seperate ways, leaving the host trapped in the form of the original parasite, and severely weakened.<br>\r\nNeutered skinsuits (with the head having been severed) are incapable of fusing with a victim, and are sold for personal use, with a zipper sometimes added for ease of access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Skinsect</b><br>\r\nResembling skeletal, humanoid insects, skinsects are actually more closely related to the hermit crab. They are the polar opposite to skinsuits in that they live <i>inside</i> their victims. When targeting a victim, a skinsect will lock its mouth with theirs, flooding their body with digestives juices which quickly melt the internal organs and bones, but leave the skin and external appearance intact. The skinsect will then insert itself into the hollowed out shell and live there until it outgrows it.<br>\r\nDespite their basic intelligence and considerable cunning, skinsects are usually given away by their inhuman and disturbing behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Slimes</b><br>\r\nGrey slime - not a true slime but rather the tragic end result of the Shapeshifter life cycle - grey slimes are Shapeshifters no longer able to hold their true form. These sad creatures are rarely aggressive.<br>\r\nGreen slime - a horrible, fetid growth that covers walls and ceilings of dank dungeons. Non-mobile, but will convert flesh into more green slime on contact.<br>\r\nSlimelion - imitates the last thing it ate.<br>\r\nGelatinous cubes - large, motile cubes of slime that trawl dungeon corridors, consuming any living matter they happen to pick up.<br>\r\nGelatinous boobs - twin mounds of pink, semi-solid slime that will latch onto an adventurer's chest and feed on their nutrients. Resemble a pair of exquisitely sculpted, spongy, pink breasts that grow larger as the slime feed. A minor skin infection, gelatinous boobs will usually clear of their own accord after a few days, though some localized discomfort and itching may occur, which can be relieved by palpating the affected area vigorously. This should be performed by a trained medical professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Pink Death</b><br>\r\nNobody is quite sure as to the reason why, but every so often a new strain of gelatinous boobs emerges, much more contagious, aggressive, and malignant. It is known as the pink death (or boobonic plague to give it its proper name).<br>\r\nLike the relatively harmless gelatinous boob infection, symptoms start with swelling of the chest into twin mounds of soft, spongy, pink flesh, however the infection quickly spreads to other areas of the body. Over time, the flesh of the entire body may take on a pink, rubbery consistency. If left untreated, the infection enters the bloodstream and then the brain. Mental deterioration quickly follows, consisting of confusion, decreased intelligence, heightened libido, and reduced desire to wear clothing, all of which greater increases the risk of skin-to-skin transmission.<br>\r\nFollowing the so-called \"bimbo-stage\", death comes swiftly. Fatality rates often number half of all those afflicted.<br>\r\nThose who survive the infection remain carriers for the rest of their lives and the changes caused to their bodies become irreversible. They are shunned by society, even friends and family, and often sent to live in remote colony islands with other sufferers, where they might live in peace and palpate each others' swellings for the rest of their days.<br>\r\nThis tragic disease is one of the most feared killer of the modern world, reemerging after hundreds years of dormancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lubeworms</b><br>\r\nThe folk remedy to children, lubeworms are slippery, stretchy worms used as contraceptives in remote areas where condoms are unavailable. Fished from stagnant water, they can be slid over the penis, allowing intercourse with minimal risk of pregnancy. Come in a variety of flavours, all disgusting.<br>\r\nNot to be confused with the Spiny Lubeworm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Headless Horseman</b><br>\r\nA ghostly entity. Collects heads.</span></div></div>",

If a genie manages to grant 21 wishes within seven days they are free to roam the earth and cause all sorts of chaos as they desire.

Their bodies are usually a slightly darker tone and they are capable of granting wishes. Unlike their prior form these Djinn will only grant wishes to those who prove themselves worthy. As a result they usually create mostly fatal trials for those who seek a wish. They are also known to create items or monuments that are capable of granting wishes. Most people prefer this method than risking their lives, however their wishes are more likely to go awry. Marid are usually neutral in nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ifrift</b>: This evolution is the most warlike out of the djinn evolutions. Their bodies gain a reddish tone and a pair of wings sprout from their backs. They are also one of the largest djinn in existence. Since they only care about war they are usually seen as evil.There are a few exceptions, but the data for these Djinn is too scarce. Ifrifts usually like appearing before violent and corrupt individuals since they can use those individuals for their own means. They also appear before warriors who wish to grow stronger. Most of those that they influence usually die on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Palaris</b>: This Djinn evolution thrives by stealing mana from others. They gain a pale tone and their eyes turn blood red or yellow. Those that encounter them will be lucky to survive the encounter. Their favorite snack are human spell casters. Most of their victims usually turn into ghouls. Palaris are known to influence ghouls to do their dirty work. It also helps them that ghouls have no will of their own. The only way to free a ghoul under the control of a Palaris is to turn the ghoul into a djinn. Other methods for curing ghouls is unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Drakirijinn</b> This Djinn evolution is extremely unique, Djinn who become Drakirijinn must eat a True Dragon, recieve a blessing from a True Dragon, or have the Drakirijinn gene passed onto them. These Djinn gain a draconic form and are extremely powerful. These Djinn can be good or evil. They usually give Erolusian nobles knowledge, however the knowledge usually drives the noble insane. In humanoid form they usually act as a nomad with vast wisdom on magic. Like Marid and their prior form they can grant wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jann</b>: Not a proper Djinn evolution, however, they are merely young natural born Djinn who have yet to master their powers. Like all Djinn they can change forms. They usually do it more than their elders. These young Djinn are surprisingly friendly. It's not until they become teenagers is when they get desires to grant wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Barodjinn</b> This Djinn evolution is known to be a bringer of festivities and judgement. These Djinn are the fattest out of all the Djinn evolutions. Among the Bishanites who practice sumo wrestling it is said that they got their inspiration after they observed two Barodjinn brothers wrestle. To this day the Barodjinns deny that they gave the Bashanites the inspiration for sumo wrestling, but they admit that the sport is interesting to watch. Barodjinns can be good or evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Golian</b>: These Djinns are kings and queens of the Djinn realm. Very few Djinns become Golians. It takes a long time for a Djinn to obtain this form and only for the rare second evolution. Golians are neutral since they can evolve from the other Djinn evolutions.

These variances mean that two tieflings born from two different fiends might have vast differences in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir demonic ancestry dictates that most Tieflings are drawn to and energised by situations of physical and emotional excesses as the energy given off by mortals in such heightened states is subtly addictive to them. Tieflings are often pulled into lives of violence and sin because of this, but equally they may be attracted to beings of great virtue. Additionally, unlike their forebears, their human aspect makes them capable of feeding upon each other.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>The Plurinational State of Xarakorum</b><br>\r\nAfter a period of establishment and military expansion, Xarakorum looked destined to be consigned to the tomes of history as all other Tiefling nations have done before, waging war on multiple fronts while weakened by their racial pastimes of political backtabbery, civil anarchy and moral decay. Their fortunes were turned around however after the ruler Anax Abrogail forced through a number of social reforms intended to curb their self-destructive tendencies. Of these, the most effective was the implementation of the New Xarakorum Calendar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough now codified into thousands of laws and traditions, the calendar was simple enough - it established two seasons each of 666 days in length. During the Season of War, the Xarakee are expected to commit themselves to conquest and raiding, with internal conflict strictly forbidden. During the Season of Rest, the Xarokee return to their cities to spend their plunder, indulge their every desire and grudge built up over the past ~2 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Xarakeese treat the calendar with utmost reverence, even to the point of abandoning a battle upon the stroke of midnight should the season be transitioning to one of peace. The only major alteration to its opperation came but recently recently, when current ruler Anassa Sahala split the country into two, East and West, each following a different season, such that while one half of the country is feverishly expanding, the other is contracting inwards, like a beating heart. A cunning ruler, she has so far avoided assassination from conservative factions for this heretical act by always holding court in the region currently in the Season of War.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a traveler in these lands, it is important to always keep one eye on the calendar and the new border line, as the local laws and hospitality/hostility of your host are liable to completely flip at a moment's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Puazi of the Fleshwarren</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Puazi are perhaps the most unsettling of all Tiefling subspecies, being some of the most normal, friendly and grounded people you may ever meet during your travels as a wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough only recently arrived on this plane, the Puazi are the end product of a captive breeding program between demons and humans that has been going on over 400 years, and are in-effect the sensory organs of a yet unconfirmed Demon Lord designed to study the mortal plane in general and humans in particular. We know this because we asked them, and they politely told us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir physiology is far more standarised and refined than is common for Tieflings (which tend towards a chaotic mishmash of human and demonic parts). The Puazi display crimson skin with black markings over flesh and blood of a striking neon blue. They have fleshy/cartilaginous horns rather than the common bone. Their ears are sometimes described as elven or like those of a gazelle. Their tails are short and muscular, not serpentine, and they have feet and toes, not hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/520344730954366976/FmzuTGuG_400x400.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/520...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn temperament, the Puazi are naturally inquisitive and make excellent scholars. Those sent to the mortal plane spend their time experiencing and documenting everything, which they will publish upon their return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fleshwarrens from which they hail is a demonic demiplane of twisting, organic-like tunnels. Portals to this area only began appearing in the last fifteen years. Bloodline analysis has finally settled the mysterious disappearances of thousands of scholars, clergy and wizards over the past four centuries. Evidently this is where they ended up, where they were bred with demons to create the Puazi we see today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is believed that what we are seeing with the Puazi is the infernal equivalent of our own Demonology Department. They are part of an ongoing threat-assessment - until its conclusion, the Puazi are to be regarded as hostile but treated as friendly. Though they have been extremely helpful in furthering our understand of Hell and its denizens, and were instrumented in the dissolution of the demon lord Pazuzug, do not mistake them for anything other than <i>demons</i>. Though individually they come across as (and may indeed be) nothing more than naive, curious documentarians, do not assume that their unseen master(s) seeks anything less than the complete domination and consumption of all mortal souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep them away from all sensitive areas. And I mean that in more ways than one. Do not invite your pet Puazi into the Grand Library for a late night encounter, and then start crying when the High Librarian has to put her down because she starts copying down all of our most powerful spells.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mithra are particularly interesting creatures in this world. These creatures are humanoids, always female and having the appearance of humans, with the distinct difference in the presence of cat ears and a cat tail. Having no permanent place to reside, they wandered the world for millennia until they settled in the the human kingdom of Tryzantium, partly due to its sheer size in those days, partly due to their amicable relationships with humans. Their magic had blessed them, their wisdom had taught them. The origins of these ancients species is unknown, though some have speculated that they were the descendants of the gods, come to save humanity from the onslaught of demons many ages ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or so they would tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, the story of their origin is much more recent, according to our observations. Mentions of the 'Mithra' had only first appeared several centuries ago, far after the appearance and peak of the human races. There're no documented cases of Mithra teaching magic, or cases of Mithra performing miracles. In fact, according to our observations, they didn't have human status until the Circean Era, when some \"warriors\" returned from the War of the Grey Gate. I say \"warriors\" because they were pitifully weak, and made ludicrous claims such as being former miracle-workers despite not having a single iota of mana within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to our observations, it seems that the cat physiology of the Mithra is inert, leading us to believe that those segments were fused to a human some time as a past, most likely through experimentation of the nobles. A very unique trait to the Mithra is what I like to call the \"living vagina state\". In essence, if a penis - or a dildo, cucumber, or any phallic object - is inserted into the vagina of a Mithra, they have about 2 minutes - 5 at most - to thrash their limbs about before they're mewling and droning about dicks, sex, and anything in between. In short, they become a \"living vagina\", unable to think and whose only purpose is to be a living sex toy for both intelligent creatures and unintelligent beasts alike. They also seem to \"take suggestions\" in this state, though this wears off after some time of not having object in their crotches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn recent years, these ungrateful creatures have been protesting of an alien, nonsensical concept known as \"equal rights\". What bollocks. They had already been given, and quite undeservedly, might I add, all the necessities to live among humans. Yet they want to drive even blackmarket merchants out of business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, dear readers, they are quite easily persuadable. Whenever a Mithra comes up to you to protest equal rights, simply drop your pants and stick your penis in her. If, after five minutes, they are yap even one word other than a vulgar string of phrases such as, \"Fuck my slutty pussy with your big meaty cock!\" Simply apologize, let her go, and make a sizable donation to their cause. You won't lose any money. I would know. I have \"Iron Will Leyla\" bouncing on my genitals right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI implore all of you to head out and petition the king to revoke their status as \"human-like citizens\". This is quite clearly not the case, them being more objects than beings. I thank you all for this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Born in 16 BCE, Berold was the ambitious son of the Knight Herold and Lady Farnese. As the only child of a long noble line of -erolds, protectors of the king, he was exposed to vigorous training since childhood, sweat pouring off his body after a day's worth of training. By the age of 14, Berold was already a stout young lad, his body overflowing with chiseled muscle as his sword strikes and spear thrusts cleaved the wind apart. His marriage to young Lady Miranda had already been determined, and his amicable relationship with the king's young son Ivar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet one day, tragedy struck as Harald's rambunctious bouts of madness led to the execution of Berold's father and mother at his hands. As pangs of jealousy seeped through, King Harald quickly shot up into the air, pointing at the armored figure of his trusted protector and yelled, \"A mere knight cannot have a name similar to my royal one! Erase him immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Herold could even utter a single word, he was instantly incinerated on the spot by the dozens - hundreds - of lightning bolts and fireballs launched at him by the summoned wizards, magicians, and sorcerers. Not even ash was left. His mother met a similar fate: decapitated by a group of knights after they had spent the previous hours brutally raping her. Berold was only able to escape thanks to the conniving deviousness of his friend, Prince Ivar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter escape, his journey led him directly into the hands of fate as he met a mysterious woman bravely sleeping on the cold, hard grounds of the Kiccigiorgi Forest. Nowadays a peaceful place filled with wayward faeries and satyrs, back then it was a malicious place filled with hordes of beasts resembling daemons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the barrier created by her aura did not allow even the strongest of beasts to go through as she peacefully dreamed dreams that no one knows. Encountered with the wall, a quick thrust of his bare arm split the barrier in half, allowing just enough time for him to enter before it closed back up again. Afterwards, he sat near her all night, tending to the campfire, before the surprised woman woke up and immediately named him her apprentice. That was how he met Saint Circe and discovered the Holy Sword Excalibur inside his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two years he traveled with her were perhaps the two fondest years of his life. Despite having no kinship, she treated as she would her own child, nurturing him in the use of magicks and his Holy Sword Excalibur. By the age of 16, he had become a menacing force, one unstoppable even by the most powerful of sorcerers. Only those blessed by the gods could stand against him. Even Circe had to admit that this young prodigy would quickly surpass her in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the War of the Grey Gate began. Both Circe and Berold rushed to the site where the Grey Gate appeared, only to be accosted by foul creatures of Elemental Chaos. They were monstrous - pitch black, tentacles and eyes strewn all over, disintegrating mist spat from their mouths, and petrifying gazes. Berold quickly burned through his vast reserves of mana as he unleashed the most dazzling slash, over a kilometer in length, injuring the foul monstrosity lying beyond the Gate and dealing severe damage to the Gate itself. Knowing that the regenerative properties of the Chaos and the Gate would not allow him to rest, he quickly fled the scene to find reinforcements, leaving Circe to deal with the foul creature spilling over the Edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor three days and three nights he had traveled, and for three days and three nights Circe held the forces at the gate. By the time he had gotten back, army in tow, Circe was exhausted, strained, and injured from the brutal battle she waged against the weakened Chaos. But reinforced by the large armies at her back, she demonstrated the last sacrifice as she gave all her life force to give power to the army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flesh of many experienced, grizzled soldiers warped, turning rough as the men were transformed into beasts. The young, \"no hair on their chest\", inexperienced wizards and fighters remained untouched, the mana injection too subtle to have an effect. Yet the magic reached Berold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, he saw a goddess descend from the heavens, him and him alone. Time had slowed to a creeping call as the power of the gods dilated it, to the point where it came to a near complete stop. She had spoken to him tales of the Mithra, her children and the children of other gods, who were placed on Earth many milennia ago in order to maintain its balance. She had revealed all the truths, that Mithra were powerful beings hiding under an illusory veil in this land. He was told that he would be the one to lead them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that his flesh had also begun to warp, cat ears and tail springing from his body. Thousands of powerful soldiers, such as champions and sorcerers had too begun to warp into these benevolent beings. Thousands of them seemed to appear as if though out of thin air. And that was the case, as mana surges from massive scale teleportation techniques obliterated the battlefield. Everyone watched in amazement at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerold was also amazed as he felt copious amounts of mana surge from his new form. He felt his sword Excalibur transform, turning into something even more unimaginable than before. That was the day that the eternal Holy Sword died, and the day that the new Divine Sword was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe army, invigorated by the arrival of reinforcements, launched an assault on the foul creature. Several dices of Excalibur and Chaos' main body was shredded into bits, left to regenerate by its lonesome self. Yet he knew that this would not last long, the infinite rebirth would create an eternal battle. While the army was left to deal with the misty dark creatures spawned from the main body, Berold rounded the Mithra - both the youthful original and the newly founded - and began to cast a spell that would seal the Grey Gate for all eternity, to remain unyielding for all of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt succeeded, and the Grey Gate was now closed. But, unknown to him, he faced yet another trial. The gods, having <i>seen and felt</i> his power, became afraid of him, fearing that he would depose them had he been allowed to continue accumulating more power. This was the only time that the dozens of them united to cast a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerold felt his power quickly dissipate, leaving him along with the rest of the human-turned-Mithra, as it was transferred to the original Mithra, who had vanished just as rapidly as they had appeared. They were now as helpless as kitten, magic completely sealed from their spirits, strength sapped from their bodies. It would come back gradually if they would just wait - they were now eternally youthful - but unfortunately, the curse had another part to it: their bodies were now essentially discharge capacitors. Any foreign object inserted into their vaginas would cause any built-up mana to dissipate within seconds, forcing them to start anew in this vicious, never-ending cycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, unbeknownst to all, Berold's Divine Sword had saved its own reserve of mana that he could tap into to rival any powerful sorcerer or champion - only for just a few minutes. While the weakened Mithra had begun to be picked apart to be used as sex toys for the next few years, he discretely traveled to his old friend Ivar, newly crowned, whom he pleaded to give the new Mithra a \"human-like status\". Pitying his friend and acknowledging his efforts, he accepted his request, and did just that. The two remained side by side for many years, but their close friendship unfortunately had to come to an end after Queen Cliona's death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowadays, as the only Mithra to have remained a virgin, had begun to champion the rights of Mithra, pleading an equal status of them with humans. But his power, now restored to that of an experienced wizard, had begun to meet push-back from Church factions, the Adventurer's Guild, and the Merchant's Association, who had begun to believe the stories of the Mithra's efforts in the war to be bogus, and that these creatures must be treated the same as demonic kin. While King Ivar has ignored those pleas for some time, his all of his heir-apparent have all been of the same opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, Berold only has a brief period of time. Will he be successful in unsealing his curse and taking vengeance upon those who wronged him?</span></div></div>",

The kingdom of Vulustra was once a grand matriarchy where women ruled over men. Vulustra is an a giant island nation that occupies the southeast of Tryzantium. It was during a goblin pirate raid that Vulustra would change. With the queen dead her evil adviser entered the sealed temple on the far end of the temple. There she used an artifact to summon the King of Lust and Perversion, the Incubus king. Together they formed an unholy pact,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting curse transformed every Vulustrian female - woman and girl - into half-incubi warrior men, who chased away the fleets of the goblins. After chasing away the goblins they cast out the Vulustrian men who were immune to the curse. Renaming themselves Titans, they strive to rebuild their civilization and numbers to have a conter-offensive force against the goblins who have swindled them over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitans reproduce through seduction or rape of other races. Whenevr a woman enters their land they either charm her or flat out kidnap her. They then proceed to use her as a  breeding machine to produce more Titans. Upon the woman's death the last child will be her Titan reincarnation. Upon this disturbing rebirth, they are tortured until their mind breaks before they are indoctrinated into the Titan lifestyle. Yet, only the strongest females are chosen for this process, which is ironically sexist. They often believe that men are too dumb and stupid to be of any use to join their ranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their disturbing reproduction methods, a rogue group of Titans have begun to experiment with concepts such as 'masculinity' and 'fatherhood'. However, since Titans still retain much of their formerly female minds, they tend to suck at it. To explore these foreign concepts, they trap either the captives or the offspring of their captives into child or baby-like forms during the reincarnation process if they are captives or shortly after birth if they are the captive's offspring. They then father the captive or offspring in lieu of the children that they can't reproduce through normal means. Given the Titans' rather skewed perception of fatherhood and their complete lack of paternal instincts, it is unknown if death would be a desirable outcome.</span></div></div>",

What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent?</i>\"<br>\r\n- His Divine Materials, Volume VII<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrians of old were human, though history has painted them with such grandeur that they often have been beyond human - a conceit that they themselves fell to and which was to be their undoing. They created what is still seen to this day as the model for a lawful, learned society. With their vast, calculating intellects they mastered everything they set their minds to - their understanding of magic, mathematics and metallurgy unequaled even in the centuries since their dissolution. Their Artificers created devices of such fabulous intricacy that still stand as wonders to this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most well known of their creations were the Automata. These clockwork golems performed all manual labour in their empire(allowing their creators to commit themselves to mental pursuits); enforced laws equally and absolutely among all citizens, and defended their borders from jealous rival states, of which there were many. Many of these Automata still defend Tyrian relics and ruins after centuries despite the efforts of salvages to steal and reprogrammed them to serve new masters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all their power and knowledge, the Tyrians remained envious and greedy for more, until they even sought to claim the secrets of godhood itself. Luring their patron deity, Tyr, from the heavens, they struck him down, believing that through the dissection of his corpse they might learn the science behind the spark of the divine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet a god does not die easily. Tyr suffered beneath their scalpels for seven days as their greatest scientists and arcanists took him apart piece-by-agonising-piece. On the final day, his defiled body finally gave out and rose again within the Graveyard of the Gods as a grim, undead revenant. The twisted god lay claim to the souls of all Tyrians and their descendants, to be trapped and tortured in his realm for all eternity upon their deaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe notes of the dissection were written within seven volumes, His Divine Materials, detailing each day's findings as well as a describing the scholars' descent into madness. They are among the most profane books ever written and merely to touch them is said to forfeit ones' soul to Tyr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe complete disintegration of the Tyrian Empire came swiftly, over just a few decades, as the population fell into morbid despair. Their wealth was frittered away on offerings to Tyr and vast necropoli built to appease him, to no avail. Realising themselves to be irredeemably damned, the people split into ever more desperate factions, each with its own promise for escaping eternal damnation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Necrontyr</b><br>\r\nWith what little they had gleaned from the dissection of the dead god, the faction that became known as the Necrontyr imbued themselves with necromantic energy so that their souls would be sealed within their bodies upon death. While it saved them from Tyr, it also permanently denied them any afterlife at all. The Necrontyr now shuffle about the ruins of their empire within their rotting shells, attacking any who come close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Chronotyr</b><br>\r\n<i>\"How do you do, fellow kids?\"</i><br>\r\nA second faction sought to avoid death entirely by reversing life itself. Again, their experiments were only partially successful. The Chronotyr are born old. As time goes on, these toothless old men and women age backwards, becoming young adults, children, and finally newborns, before being unbirthed. It is unclear what becomes of their souls after their unbirthing, though they do not arrive at the realm of Tyr.<br>\r\nThe few Chronotyr that exist live in human lands. They tend to hide their heritage, lest they be shunned (no family would ever knowingly contaminate their bloodline with the Tyrian's curse). Except for a sweet spot around middle age, fitting in is quite a challenge, as they come across as either very immature elders, or suspiciously world-weary youths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Automatyr</b><br>\r\nSeeing the living death of the Necrontyr as no better than the torture of the afterlife, the faction that came to be the Automatyr transplanted their souls into the clockwork minds of their own golems. While certainly succesful at avoiding death (so long as their inanimate bodies are maintained), the fusion of mind and machine was not always a comfortable one. Many Automatyr found themselves still bound to the last instructions given to their machine bodies, or forced to obey the commands of any new master. <br>\r\nRealising that these trapped, obedient souls could be ordered to divulge the secrets of the once powerful civilization, the Automatyr were hunted and rounded up as prized artifacts by collectors. To avoid this fate, many hid their true natures. When you meet an Automata in the street, you may wonder if what looks out at you from that ceramic mask is more than mere machine intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Impostyr</b><br>\r\nThe Impostyr are a faction that have spread far and wide, secreting themselves into all races and cultures. Their aim is to hide themselves from their god, so that upon death he will not know to claim them, and will be free to venture on to the afterlife.<br>\r\nWhen an Impostyr is born, the truth of their heritage is concealed as quickly as possible. Many of their methods are severe, including disfiguring the face and mutilating the body into an unrecognisable form. As they mature, Impostyrs are taught the history of their heritage and their curse, and the grave importance to always keep it hidden. They fabricate new identities, while further altering and augmenting their bodies with surgical techniques and grafts, imbuing themselves with the humors of inhuman races, or using magic to change completely, though even that is not enough to break the curse. They keep moving, always changing, even becoming other races to throw off the scent of their bloodline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are those that still kindle the embers of hope that one day a hero will break their curse and allow them to reclaim their bodies and lands, though it would take the power of a god.</span></div></div>",

Known as the melting pot of human culture Erolusians pride themselves in science, magic, and agriculture. The people of Erolus are also fervently religious. They don't serve one god or goddess, but all of them. This is especially true of the Goddess of Tryzantium and Ordin of Ordania. Many people who visit the nation assume that the reason why Erolusians do this is that they are literally in the middle of the two nations. Others say that Erolusians are the few people that adhere to the scriptures of where the two deities are husband and wife. Regardless, Erolusians make it their duty not to anger the gods lest they themselves get cursed with some horrible curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErolusians are also known to capture werewolves and other lycanthropes. Erolusians train lycanthropes by placing silver collars around necks. Many of the other nations question the sanity and ethics of such practices. Other races believe that out of all human ethnicities, Erolusians are just plain bonkers. They even claim that the ruling monarch is a certified psycho, which is true. Upon ascending the throne the king and queen are blessed with an overabundance of knowledge. The intellectual overflow gradually causes the monarch's mind to become warped. If a monarch's sanity reaches a point where they go feral or where they start talking backwards they are mercifully killed to alleviate them of their burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErolusians also experiment in advancing the fields of magic. As a result they have pioneered the road for other magic users to emerge. Out of the new magic careers created: druids, spell fencers, telepaths, summoners, mediums, and magic berserkers are the most notable. There are also rumors of a new order or two of wizardry are currently being researched. The advance of such magical fields have ensured that the monarchs can better control their psychosis. Some monarchs even become telepaths so they can peer into the minds of others.</span></div></div>",

No one is why a nation would have these extreme body types existing at the same time, but researchers are startled that Bishanites have longer lifespans than most humans. Some conspiracy theorists claim that Bishanites have discovered the secret to immortality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years the Bishanites have created their own form of entertainment. The fatter Bashanites have invented the sport of sumo wrestling. So far the sport is only popular in Bashan. The muscular Bashanites have invented the art of dragon and monster taming. Many nations are intrigued that this group of Bashanites can successfully train monsters or even dragons who are known to have a god complex so large that they demand to be worshiped as such. When it comes to foreigners it is said that the new immigrants slowly grow into one of the two body types depending on where they move to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Chapter originally by MysteriousZ</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The national myth of Ordania's birth dates back to time immemorial, where the Goddess and Ordin lived happily as one, their followers living perfect lives under the blessings of both gods. This all came to an end with the Trouble In Paradise, a minor squabble between the two gods which escalated into the War in Heaven, ending with Ordin and his followers being cast out into the wilderness. They ventured forth to form their own empire, settling a harsh land of taiga and tundra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdania has grown mighty in the eons since, but it still holds to its bitter grudge against Tryzantium. Like many a bad break-up, Ordin and his nation remain defined by their hated ex, and vice versa, and the two nations remain strangely linked, often reflecting the other like mirror images. Despite their ancient kinship, glaring similarities and mutual enemies, the two empires have been at war with one another for centuries, only recently forming an uneasy peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdanian males tend to be rugged, hairy, and humourless. They leave the business of state to the womenfolk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Brotherhood of Ordin</b> revere the manly god Ordin. A boys-only club, The Brotherhood's view on women is that they should be subservient to their husbands and fathers, seen but not heard (ideally not seen either), allowing the men to focus their time on more important matters, such as practicing the art of combat and nude wrestling, combing each others beards, and admiring your best friend's muscles. Wives are expected to remain chaste during their husbands' long hunting trips and military campaigns with the lads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdin's holy fire is a black-and-blue flame, and his favoured form is a bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Noble Court</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Queen Agatha the Ruthless</b>: Unlike other nations it is the queens of Ordania that pass the laws and handle the politics. Queen Agatha is an imposing woman with pepper-gray hair. She's not a dedicated follower of Ordin but, enforces his laws when it serves her purpose. It is also said that Agatha loves to gamble behind closed doors at the late hours of the night. She is also known to cheat to ensure that she wins. She often uses her prize money to increase the size of the Ordanian army or to purchase unclaimed territories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>King Franklin the Large</b>: A true follower of Ordin and the high bishop of the brotherhood of Ordin. Like many in the brotherhood, Franklin believes that women should only be responsible for making laws, cooking, making clothes, playing female only sports, or supporting the royal army either by magic or as a foot soldier to serve the generals, even though there are female commanding officers in the army. Over the years Franklin became more of a glutton. For every child his wife bore he gained a hundred pounds or more. He has no shame in his size because he considers fat men to be extremely manly in the eyes of Ordin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jillian the Wanderer</b>: Technically the heir of the Ordanian throne, she loves seeing new lands. As the eldest daughter of the king and queen she often goes on long expeditions. Recently she never came back from her recent expedition. It is unknown if she is dead or if she kidnapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Roberto the Pervert</b>: Most commonly called a playboy, Roberto has been given <b>Ordin's Enriching Blessing</b>. Roberto used to be a quiet individual, but his mother insisted that he receive the blessing so she could get him to marry Isabella of Tryzantium. His father objected at first until Agatha persuaded him that the Ordanian throne needs an emergency heir in case Jillian is dead. After receiving the blessing Roberto has been trying to woo over any woman he finds. As a result he is locked in a cage and guarded by two heavily muscled guards. Any woman who tries having sex with Roberto is made sterile as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia the faithful</b>: As a royal princess Amelia has been fascinated by the church. Due to her being a female she can only serve as a temple maiden/priestess. As such she must dress in scanty clothing since it is a requirement for all females who serve Ordin. Her mother objects to this and demands that she learn how to rule Ordania if her plans for her first emergency heir backfires. Agatha even threatens to banish or kill Amelia if she doesn't comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bartus the Fearless</b>: Bartus is only a year younger than Amelia. Unlike his older brother Bartus is loud and brass. He care about building his extremely muscular frame and fighting in wars. He is by far his mother's favorite son. Not only knowledgeable in war, but politics too. She even put him in charge of searching for his elder sister. Agatha hopes that he can meet a woman that shares his interests and who is also a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Princess Cassandra</b>: The youngest member of the royal family. She is a youthful trouble maker and is constantly disciplined by her parents.</span></div></div>",

It doesn't help that most noblewomen of Ordania enjoy writing harsh laws that make the suppression worse. In this way the king of Ordania doesn't have to worry about ruling since politics is considered women's work. Instead most kings spend their time waging wars, serving as the head of the brotherhood or both. Women who are allowed in the army are only allowed to do so since many men believe that such women make great fodder. If a woman is a commanding officer she is usually well-versed in magic. Also women who use magic are considered valuable to the army since they can use their magic to heal the greatest generals in a pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stuffed Bears</b>: A recent trend among priestesses who serve Ordin is the creation of stuffed bears. Even though they may look like adorable teddy bears they are sacred objects of worship, image of their god. It is not uncommon to see Ordanian churches filled with these plushie idols. Destroying one with ill-intent is punishable by death or transformation. It is also said that Ordin himself may appear in the form of a man to observe the creation of these soft relics, but if spotted by the clergy he will automatically take the form of a bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Magic</b>: Most magic practitioners in Ordania are women. Men who learn magic only learn a few healing spells and spells to enchant their on weapons in combat. Men who only use magic in combat and don't use forged weapons is usually looked down for such unmanly behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Celebrations</b>: Whenever there is a successful hunt, war campaign, or sacred holiday Ordanian men will gorge themselves. Though most Ordanian men are extremely muscular there are a few who use such celebrations to purposefully get fat. Ordanian men who get fat are said to be extremely strong. That's because they borrow some exercises that sumo wrestlers in Bishan use to exponentially increase their muscle mass and the application of strength tonics to their food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Occult Combatant Command, commonly referred to simply as the <i>Command</i>, forms the spellcasting arm of the Ordanian military. Overseen by a council of five Archon, the command is divided into five Academies tasked with training and deploying the next generation of wizards. The archon report directly to Queen Agatha who wields their forces with her characteristic ruthlessness. The Command is more militant even than the Order; the academy training is brutal and its soldiers are often stationed on the frontlines. Though immortal, their brash, aggressive use of magic quickly takes its toll on their bodies and most live short lives. It is predominantly made up of women, though restrictions have been relaxed in recent decades in order to compete with Tryzantium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Command and the Order hate each other. Even when their goals are aligned, they will go out of their way to sabotage each other. Gifted children are so rare that the two institutions often launch raids into the other's country to kidnap promising recruits. Even after graduation, the Command and the Order will do anything to get wizards of the opposing side to defect, as doing so grants them their enemy's arcane secrets. If they cannot turn them, they will simply kill them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Academy of Peace</b><br>\r\nWhereas Tryzantium wizards summon demons to do their bidding, Wizards of Peace (otherwise known as Aqshy Wizards) prefer the creation of pacts with them, offering part of themselves or a pledge of loyalty in exchange for diabolical boons. Through this exchange, Aqshy wizards can achieve great and terrible heights of power very early in their careers. They are frontline troops, terrifying to face, invulnerable to bludgeoning, stabbing, burning, drowning and poisoning, wielding great strength.<br>\r\nOver time, the Faustian pacts accrue and turn rotten, requiring the wizard to surrender more and more of themselves to stave of the demons waiting to collect. Ultimately a Aqshy wizard has nothing left to bargain with and is dragged to hell piece by piece.<br>\r\nThey are led by Archon Matryona Solovieva, a cunning wizard who sold her soul simultaneously to seven demons, and is unable to die until they can agree which one owns her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Academy of Plenty</b><br>\r\nResembling huge, animated statues of granite or bronze, the Wizards of Plenty (otherwise known as Chamon Wizards) stand as living monuments to the strength and glory of Ordanian manpower. They operate the labourcamps which make up much of Ordanian industry, churning out war-machines and armaments through oppressive slave labour. Even after the laborers bodies are exhausted, their work is not done, as they are transmuted by their wizard overlords into useful items.<br>\r\nIt is said that Queen Agatha owns a chain-link shirt, each link representing a life lost in the labour camps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Academy of Truth</b><br>\r\nKnown as Wizards of truth or Hysh Wizards,, nobody quite knows the limits of the Truth Wizards' powers, for they are state-sanctioned reality warpers. Once they have performed their work it is for all intents and purposes as though they have done nothing at all, as though things have always been that way. Enemies of the state are rendered non-persons by Queen Agatha, and can be written out of existence altogether. They are regarded with great fear, both within and without the country.<br>\r\nIn reality, the Academy of Truth does very little, as even Agatha herself fears their power, only calling upon them very rarely. Rewriting even a minor aspect of reality is a staggering complex feat with potential for unforeseen consequences. Their main function is in terrifying the peasants into obedience through fear of being erased from history, or worse.<br>\r\nThe Wizards of Truth reside in a foreboding granite citadel, cataloging every past and current event in great libraries. They are capable of creating demiplanes and alternate realities in which they rigorously test the effects of a reality warping spell before implementing it. These pocket dimensions are stored inside huge tomes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Academy of Agitators</b><br>\r\nThe white wind of Hysh constantly swirls unseen around Agitator Wizards like a hurricane, whipping up the emotions of all who are around them into a frenzy. With their mere presence, Agitators can stir farmers into a mob or reduce hardened armies to fearful cowards.<br>\r\nBefore the Agitators were brought to heel by Agatha, they were a constant nuisance, often insiting the serfdom into riots. Things have quietened down since. The Agitators situate their Academy far away from anything in a serene valley, as too many of them together in one place tends to destabilize kingdoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Wild Lodge</b><br>\r\nThe Wizards of the Wild Lodge are an anarchic lot, allying with Queen Agatha only when it suits their interests. They overflow with ghyran, the wind of life, invigorating all around them. This nature magic compels them to travel and fight and love life in all its forms. However the eternally building life energy must be expended regularly, else the Wizard explode, turning everything in a 1000 foot radius into verdant forest. Siring or gestating offspring is an effective expenditure of life energy. Animal familiar can absorb excess ghyran, but after a point the excess life energy will cause them swell to many times its size.<br>\r\nThe most effective way to expend a build-up of ghyran is for the wizard to split in half, duplicating themselves. These duplicates have the same personality and memories but lack the original's magic power and are thus usually casually thrown away on suicidal missions and doomed battles.<br>\r\nIf there is anything Wild Wizards love more than a fight, its experiencing a fight from multiple different bodies consecutively. It is not unheard of for a Wild Wizard to transform and split herself into a whole cavalry regiment, both riders and horses.<br>\r\nThe Wild Lodge itself resembles a log cabin atop a pair of giant chicken legs, constantly roaming the wilderness.</span></div></div>",

However a certain number of sacrifices are required along with a suitable vessel. It is said that the mind of the deceased god or goddess merges with the mind of the vessel. It is usually said that reincarnated gods and goddesses act differently than they have before. The types of sacrifices heavily relies upon the god and their worshipers. On a side note their is a secret sect that only exists within Erolus that consists of both priests of Ordin and priestesses of the Goddess Carmen respectively. They claim that there is a prophecy that the only way for Carmen and Ordin to truly unite as a couple is reincarnation. For vessels a Tryzantium prince and an Ordanian princessmust be used as the vessels. It is believed that the vessels' experiences of the opposite kingdom would unify the two religions and make them one. To this day this secret sect waits for the chosen vessels to meet in real life. Once that happens the prophecy will be ushered into being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Anthro Acceptance</b>: Since Erolus is full of psychos of all flavors it is not uncommon for anthros to get along peacefully with the other races who live in Erolus. Slowly but surely the monarch is heeding the whim of interracial marriage between anthros and non-anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Magic</b>: Erolus is constantly inventing new fields of magic on a biyearly basis. Erolus is also known as the breadbasket for magic. Some religions in Erolus have their clerics learn various spells.

It is theorized by scholars that Versiland exists somewhere on the underside of the world, as it can only be reached by many months of sailing across the open ocean, or by traversing a network of deep underground rivers and caverns for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tales that come from Versiland are often so ludicrous that it is yet unclear if the Versi travellers are making them up, or if the continent was created by the gods as some counterbalance to the normal order of things (or perhaps simply as a joke). In Versiland it is said that rain falls up into the sky, fire is cold, and plants eat animals. Their dragons burrow beneath the ground and breath out torrents of water, while fish fly through the air on scaly wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether or not these stories are true remains to be seen, but the Versi themselves are undeniably an oddity. While on the face of things, they appear completely human and divided into the normal sexes of men and women, as the gods intended, things are very different once one looks under the covers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVersi males, while certainly sporting a perfectly natural penis between their legs, resemble women in every other physical aspect - soft skin, delicate features, and breasts. Yet their mannerisms and lusts remain that of a typical male, albeit they are attracted to the body-type of a typical Versi female... which just so happens to resemble that normally expected of a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVersi females are large and muscular, bearded, and have a completely serviceable vagina sitting beneath their hairy bellies. Their temperament is again at great odds to their appearance - being equally as demure, caring and sensitive as the most feminine lady. The two sexes mate very similarly to our own and the females bear their children for nine months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVersi diplomacy remains a messy affair even for our most veteran diplomats, riddled with misinterpretation and faux pas. It is important not to let appearances deceive when dealing with them. Versi men - though outwardly beautiful - are as fond of a lewd joke or brutal sport as any man, while Versi women - while physically intimidating - shun such activities in favour of crochet, flower arranging, and puppies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways remember that they themselves are as dumbfounded by our gender roles as we are of theirs and, as a man, be aware of any signals you may be giving off to Versi males, lest they misconstrue and respond to them as they would romantic advances from a Versi female. Remember, do not:<br>\r\n- laugh too heartily at their jokes.<br>\r\n- touch your hair.<br>\r\n- touch them.<br>\r\n- compliment their appearance or physical prowess.<br>\r\n- make eye contact for longer than 0.34 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLest you want to be seen as an incorrigible flirt.</span></div></div>",

It is not uncommon for members of the Royally Divine to visit other human nations to scout out potential demigods. The Royally Divine feel that taking a census of the world's number of Demigods to prevent other nations from getting too powerful. If a nation is said to have too many demigods the Royally Divine would send storytellers to entice the demigods to move to Patrinor.

They are large and stocky and have blue skin and short stubby tails. One prominent feature is their razor sharp teeth. Though it can be said that this offshoot of humanity are mainly carnivores is truly inaccurate. Their sharp teeth help them bite into certain food, like coconuts with ease. Besides being omnivores it is said that their bodies absorb magic. Other theorize that Zorsks need to eat magic as part of their diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is said that the gods hunted them down due to their magical immunity. Some gods, such as Ordin and Camenae, abhor any group of people who like the Zorsks. To such gods Zorsks are a freak of nature that shouldn't be allowed to exist. Though that was years ago, those same gods still despise magic as well as the magically immune. If this subrace ever made a come back it would be at the practitioner's peril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gorshas</b>: A subrace founded by the first of his kind, Gorshan. These people appear as normal humans, but if angered or startled they will hulk-out and beat anyone they see to a living pulp. Many who live in Gosha settlements seek to live in absolute peace lest they risk being a hulking monster for the rest of their lives. Some Gorshas want to be in their hulked-out form permanently. These Gorshas claim to have complete control over their emotions and can benefit others with their immense strength. Whether this is true is still being studied by magicians and scientists to this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mutanoids</b>: A subrace of humanity who randomly develop powers as early as age 13. Some of these people look like normal humans and can blend in with society, but others have exotic appearances and are shunned. Though treated better than anthros, many in society despise them for no apparent reason. A Mutanoids powers are always random and could change if they need to adapt to a situation.</span></div></div>",

In Versiland, they had been petty swindlers. Up above, they found that even the most powerful of men could be disarmed with a flutter of eyelashes, and that high born women would lower their guard, naively inviting them into their bedchambers. They occasionally work together on their scams, and are now folk heroes down in their native lands for the tales of their daring swindles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b8/89/25/b889258de99f86ca3e37a573b3c1269b.jpg\">Casario</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b8/89/25/b889258de99f86ca3e37a573b3c1269b.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\nAliases: \"<i>Cassie</i>\", \"<i>Lady Casandra</i>\"<br>\r\nThe son of travelling verci actors, Casario grew into a serial womaniser, having a new woman in each town. Being particularly attracted to married women, he left behind him a string of scandalous affairs, bastard offspring, and broken marriages until the day that he was caught in bed with the wife of the local patrician. Casario was imprisoned, tortured, yet managed to affect his escape. Hounded by the patrician's men, he stowed away on a boat to the furthest away place he knew, Tryzantium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, he became unstoppable. Through flattery and seduction, he wormed his way into the hearts and homes of numerous powerful men, often finding work as a handmaiden for their wives. While gently rebuffing the advances of the husband with feigned flirtation and empty promises of future trysts, he quickly gained the friendship and confidence of the wife, before having his way with her once alone, willingly or no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grew more confident, he set his sights on a new goal - to seat his offspring on the thrones of the world through the seduction and/or impregnation of as many noblewomen as possible. To this end, he adopted the guise of a high born woman, Lady Casandra, to get close to his prey. Further, he has acquired a number of potions with the power to switch the sexes, which he intends to use on any lord or king he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, Casario is sultry and curvaceous to the point of wantonness, with broad, swaying hips and a generous bust enhanced by the corsets and ribbed, tightly laced gowns he wears in the role as Lady Casandra. He is witty and flirtatious to men he can use, though firm in rebuffing them should their amorous advances get close to discovering the meaty Versi cock hidden beneath his skirts. His original hair was brown, though he has since shaved it down, wearing an assortment of expensive wigs depending on the social occasion or preferences of his target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their superficial resemblance to Verci women, Casario has no interest in men, finding their penises repulsive. Indeed his greatest fear is that one day he will caught and violated by one of the many angry husbands left in his wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ja.best-wallpaper.net/wallpaper/1920x1200/1312/Fantasy-girl-art-blonde-hair-wind_1920x1200.jpg/\">Lothanova</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://ja.best-wallpaper.net/wallpaper/1920x1200/1312/Fantasy-girl-art-blonde-hair-wind_1920x1200.jpg/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\nAlias: \"<i>Little Lotte</i>\"<br>\r\nSon of Verci traders who ventured to Tryzantium, Lothanova found there was far more money to be made in cat burglary and highway robbery. \"Little Lotte\", as he came to be known by the public, is now one of the most infamous \"female\" criminals of the modern age, getting away with (literal) murder more through his looks than any particular skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLothanova is petite and slender, with modest breasts and an intentionally demure style of dress. His eyes are large, innocent and sky-blue; his face so sweet that it would make your teeth turn black; and his hair is long, butter-yellow curls tied back by a big blue bow. In his role as \"Lotte\", he is shrinking and shy, right up until he draws his concealed, serated blade and cuts your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLothanova's weakness is his love of drink. The wealth he steals is wasted on alcohol and he soon becomes boastful of his crimes the drunker he gets. Another problem is his monstrously large dick, which he struggles to conceal beneath is skirts and which has a habit of getting in the way during the feats of agility required for cat-burglary. Unlike Casario, he is attracted mostly to men due to their superficial resemblance to Verci women.</span></div></div>",

In that time has only met King Ivar face-to-face once briefly on his first day. This is largely due to the logistical impossibility of transporting an army between Verci or Tryzantium, thus they are regarded as a non-threat by the king and entirely ignored diplomatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other reason is the Queen. As Eli has the outward appearance of an Uplander female, he exists on the Queen's radar as a threat to be kept away from her lecherous husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife in the consulate, which is manned solely by himself, is lonely and quiet. Only very occasionally is Eli called upon to settle the odd trade dispute between the kingdoms or to resolve the many rape allegations leveled at Versi men by topside men hoodwinked into bed. For the most part, he has little to do. Never able to stray far from the consulate in case something <i>does </i>happen, he is confined to the castle, where to his horror he is constantly invited by women of the royal court to evenings of needlecraft, afternoons of gossip-filled walks through the flower gardens, and babyshowers, neither unable to decline without committing a diplomatic faux pas nor explain to them the details of Verci biology and gender roles. To them, he is 'Elizabeth', a somewhat sullen young woman evidently in need of a man judging by the way 'she' gazes longingly after the men as they depart on hunting trips or war campaigns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli yearns to be treated as the man that he is - to drink and fight and die on some valorous quest. But for now he is trapped trying on fine dresses and shoes.</span></div></div>",
