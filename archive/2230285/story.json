Although this wasn't his normal job, there were some formalities that had to pass by his supervision before being finalized. It was a Friday afternoon, and there was nothing that Daniel wanted more than to get this work day over with and head home to relax with his family for the weekend. The weather was supposed to be good from the weekend into much of the following week, and Daniel thought that this would be a great time to get out and spend some quality time with his immediate people. Unfortunately, he was still stuck in the office and had a few more hours to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Jones?\" a voice called from outside Daniel's door. \"Come on in\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was Ariana, or Ari, Ludgate, the most recent addition to the office as an intern. She had beautiful dirty blonde hair tan skin, and sweet, brown eyes. Although along with these visual details came some behavior issues. Ari was the stereotypical high school queen who enjoyed exercising her rights to behave the way she wanted, and although working in a rather professional environment, typically wore either a tank top or crop top with either denim shorts or leggings. Normally, Daniel took little notice to her informal attire, but sometimes he had to butt in when she took her looks to too large of an unprofessional level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I was just wondering if I could get some extra compensation in my next paycheck\" Ari inquired. Daniel disappointingly shook his head. \"I've noticed you have been working a little extra as of late, but unfortunately the company isn't in a position right now to issue any extra bonuses in pay to anyone. Once I get the go ahead, though, I'll se what I can do\". Ari begrudgingly huffed and retorted \"Well, I don't see why you can't do something about it right now, you're the boss here\". Daniel had dealt with Ari plenty of times before and had grown used to her sometimes snobby persona. \"I'll see what I can do, Ariana\". Ari once again huffed and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more hours of frequent meetings with his receptionist, Rachel, or his second-in-command, Carla, Daniel's day was finally over and he was more than ready to get out of there. Filing the rest of the papers on his desk into the cabinet nearer to the door, Daniel got his things ready and was going to leave his office and the building when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   A sudden bout of dizziness hits Daniel and he staggers for a moment in his office. Not knowing what happened or why, he immediately took his seat to catch his breath. After a few more moments, Daniel eased up a little bit and he thought that he was better and was able to get back to leaving. Unfortunately, as soon as he stood up, Daniel collapsed. When he collected himself and got up, though, Daniel noticed something was wrong. He was smaller. Whatever problem he felt apparently led to him shrinking down to no taller than a foot and a half. Daniel frantically looked through his pocket to find his cell phone so he could call his wife, but he left it on his desk which was now a good three and a half feet taller than him, too high for him to reach. Daniel then went to the open door of his work area and looked out into the rest of the office to see if there was anyone still there. Fortunately for him, it looked as if nearly everyone working in the office was still there, and Daniel went out to get someone to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closest person to Daniel was Carla, who's office was set right next to his. Although him and Carla didn't have the greatest professional or personal relationship, so maybe she wasn't the best person to go to. Across the room from Daniel's area was Rachel, who was still compiling a few things on her desk, getting ready to go. Standing near the receptionist's desk was Ari, who was on her phone probably texting her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Does Daniel decide to go with any of these three women or does he decide to go with another coworker who was still in the office?</span></div></div>",

Once he made it outside the builidng; however, there was a sudden and more severe hit of uneasiness and Daniel collapsed. He soon recollected and got back up, but something was different. He was smaller. Daniel did a quick 180 to see if anyone else had made it out of the building yet, which none had, but he heard the footsteps echoing from the hallways within which told him that people were on their way. Contemplating what to do, Daniel quickly came up with the decision to go to someone else's car and wait out their arrival so that they could possibly help him. He then went to the nearest car, which was a 2008 Ford Explorer, and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone too long after Daniel had arrived at the car, people begin shuffling out of the building and Daniel looks up to notice one particular figure heading his way. It was Ari. Daniel had mixed feelings. Ari had always been somewhat of an entitled brat in the office and moreso recently because of her want for an extra pay bonus. He had no idea how she would react to find her boss as tiny as he was. Before she got too close to him, Daniel swiftly moved up onto the step of the vehicle and began jumping up and down to get Ari's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ari!\" Daniel yelled, \"Ari! Down here! It's Mr. Jones! I need help!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust over the edge of her phone, Ari noticed something moving on her car step. Turning her phone off and sliding it into her back pocket, Ari knealt down to get a closer look at what the thing was and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Jones?!?\" Ari cried. \"What happened to you?\". Daniel shushed her, telling her to keep it down. \"I have no idea. When I left my office, I felt a little uneasy. Then when I got outside the building, I collapsed and all of a sudden, I'm barely six or seven inches!\" Daniel bellowed. Ari couldn't process the situation. \"So you just ended up like this?\". Daniel nodded. A smirk crept across Ari's face. \"That's very interesting. Well, now that you're so helpless, why don't I take care of you and we can discuss a little cash bonus heading my way, does that sound good?\" Ari asked. \"Like I said bef-\" Ari cut Daniel off and grabbed him. Opening the door to her car, she placed him on the armrest of the drivers' seat and hopped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ari, are you crazy? I need medical help as soon as I can!\" Daniel cried out. Ari just chuckled. \"And I will be more than happy to take care of that after we discuss the terms of my next paycheck\". Daniel shook his head. \"I can't talk about that right now, there are more pressing issues in my life!\". Ari huffed and shrugged. \"Then I guess you're just going to have to come back home with me then. I'll let you make it up to me there\" she explained. She started the car and backed up with a jerk, sending Daniel tumbling off the armrest onto the seat, right next to Ari's thigh. She giggled. \"Grab on tight, it's going to be a bumpy ride for you, boss man\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Daniel along the way back to Ari's house?</span></div></div>",

Saying goodbye to his coworkers, Daniel left the building and made it to his car, very relieved that it was Friday and that he was only a drive home away from a weekend of relaxation and family time. Putting his car in gear, Daniel pulled out of the parking lot and drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got home, Jennifer was preparing dinner and the girls were in the living room, watching television with a couple of their friends who were over for a sleep over. Daniel walked to the kitchen and embraced his wife for a second, then went upstairs to change into something more comfortable. By the time he got downstairs, dinner was ready, and all the kids and Jennifer were at the kitchen counter, dishing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so beat from this week\" Daniel spoke to Jennifer, \"all I want to do now is to just kick back in the recliner and-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy! After dinner would you come out and watch a movie with us?\" Rylee, the middle child, asked. Daniel sighed and chuckled. \"As long as I'm able to take my recliner for a spin, absolutely\". The girls cheered and both Jennifer and Daniel laughed. After that, Everyone finished dishing and sat at the table for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Dad,\" Lily, the eldest, mentioned, \"we got this new device off of Amazonia today and I think I can take it in to get extra credit for my Science class on Monday\". Daniel tiredly nodded. \"That's great, hon. What does it do exactly?\". Lily shrugged. \"Well, we're not sure exactly. We thought that maybe tonight we could go outside and test it out on something\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But didn't you want to watch a movie?\" Daniel inquired. Lily nodded. \"Yeah, but we thought we could do this beforehand. I don't know what it is, but I think it's cool\". Daniel looked to his wife who gave him a giggle and he begrdugingly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole group then had a rather nice dinner and the girls were rushing through it to test out the new device they got. Once Daniel and Jennifer finished, what exactly did they do to test out the deivce?</span></div></div>",

Listen, Gracie and Rylee both have events up at the high school, do you think you could get home to have dinner with Lily? I'm sure she would appreciate it\" Jennifer explained. Daniel nodded. \"Sure, no problem. Should I get something going when I get back or do you already have it all mapped out?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all covered, I made meatloaf, you just have to preheat the oven to 350 and wait for a half hour to ready it up\" Jennifer outlined. \"The girls and I should be back home by eight or nine\". Daniel once again nodded in understanding. \"Okay, sounds good to me. I'll be waiting for your arrival\" he laughed. Jennifer chuckled, then the two walked out of the office together then went to their separate cars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way home, Daniel began to feel funny. His head was spinning and he was getting butterflies in his stomach. Regardless of these strange symptoms, Daniel was able to make it home okay and without harm. The symptoms only got more severe from there, though, as he stepped out of the car onto the driveway. Noticing Daniel was a little wobbly, Jennifer offered him assistance before she took Rylee and Gracie to their activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel, you look clammy, are you okay?\" she questioned. Daniel shrugged it off. \"I'm okay, just feeling a little dizzy is all\". Jennifer shook her head. \"No, hon, you need to rest. Here, come have a seat on the deck\". She took his arm and helped hoist him onto the deck of the hosue and sat him on a beach chair they had out. \"Before I leave, I'll get you some water, okay? And if you need anything else or if something goes wrong, just text me or call out for Lily, okay sweetie?\". Daniel chuckled and nodded. Within a few moments, Jennifer was back with his glass of water and then she took off. Daniel didn't take long to drink the whole thing, then laid back hoping that this would go away soon. And technically, he was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Daniel?</span></div></div>",

However, something was off. The beach chair he was sitting on was now massive, seemingly the size of a field. Daniel came to the quick realization, though, that it wasn't the chair that had grown, it was him that had shrunk. That must have been what the dizziness and butterflies were signaling. Daniel had no idea what exactly happened or how this even worked, but he didn't care about it that much. Right now, he had to get to Lily and get help. Unfortunately, the drop from the chair to one of the legs of the chair and make a beeline for the front door. Before he could make a move, though, Daniel heard the door open and turned to look what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to the front door, Daniel saw Lily in her bathing suit with her phone in hand, on a call with a friend. Even though it was nearing five in the evening, the weather was still holding good at around 75 degrees with clear skies, so Lily thought it would be nice to come outside and tan. Unfortunately for Daniel, Lily was too distracted by her phone to notice him as she began walking her way to the beach chair which he occupied. Daniel jumped up and down, waving his arms, doing whatever he could to get Lily's attention, but it was no use. When he looked up and saw the tight black bottoms of Lily looming over him, Daniel made a break for the edge of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Daniel even made it halfway to the edge, Lily had made her descent onto the chair and sat on Daniel, leaving him plastered under her right cheek, half of his body on the bottoms and the other half on her skin. Even though Daniel left a little sensation for Lily, she thought nothing of it and continued her conversation with her friend. Surprised that the initial impact and pressure didn't kill him, Daniel was stuck. Now under his own daughter's derriere, Daniel had no choice but to wait out the teen's lengthy conversation and hope that at some point, he would get a break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, Lily squirmed around in the seat as she talked, smearing Daniel all across her tan skin. It didn't take long for the heat to kick in, both for Lily and Daniel, and sweat began pouring onto Daniel as it loosely fell down Lily's skin. Although the few moments that Daniel had to endure under Lily were grueling, they soon finished as Lily turned onto her front, giving Daniel some fresh air and a chance to escape. Without hesitation, Daniel quickly peeled off Lily's butt, and contemplated what his next move would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Daniel decide to do?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Daniel Jones: A 41-year old office executive, Daniel has light skin, medium brown hair with blue eyes and a well-built physique which makes him look ten years younger. A loving father and husband, there\u2019s nothing he enjoys more than spending time with his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer Jones: A 42-year old supply chain manager, Jennifer has dark skin and black hair with soft, brown eyes. Similar to Daniel, her good looks and matching body make her look much younger than she is. A very caring wife and mother, Jennifer still enjoys messing around with Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily Jones: A 17-year old senior at Dupont High School, Lily is the oldest of three Jones daughters. She has medium dark skin and takes after her mom with her black hair, brown eyes, and matching body. Lily loves her whole family, but sometimes feels like her younger siblings get more attention and love and only wants to have some one on one time with her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRylee Jones: A 15-year old sophomore at Dupont High School, Rylee is the cheekiest of the Jones children. She gets all her traits but her skin from her dad, with medium brown hair, blue eyes and a fit body. Rylee loves to pull pranks on her family, especially on her parents, but most of all her dad. She is quite the athlete, being elite on her school\u2019s basketball and softball teams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie Jones: An 11-year old sixth grader at Dupont Elementary, Gracie is the youngest and clumsiest of the three sisters. She has brown hair and brown eyes, getting the best of both worlds in terms of her parents\u2019 looks and since she\u2019s so young, an underdeveloped body. Although never meaning any harm, Gracie can often be a klutz and cause some sort of conundrum somewhere in the house or at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell Johnson: A 39-year old office employee, Russell, a subordinate of Daniel\u2019s, is also a great friend of his and they often get together after work to go to a bar or somewhere together to hang out and destress from the workday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla Rollins: A 32-year old brunette with dark brown eyes, Carla is Daniel\u2019s second-in-command, but even though she is required to report to him, Carla often doesn\u2019t listen to him unless corporate is present. She is jealous of Daniel\u2019s position and would be more than happy if something happened that allowed her to take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel Blomquist: A 35-year old receptionist, Rachel is Daniel\u2019s major support when days get hectic. With light blonde hair and a bombshell of a body, Rachel is one of the most attractive in the office. Although she knows that Daniel is married and has kids, Rachel still has something of a thing for him and if an opportunity presented itself where she could have him, she would take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriana (Ari) Ludgate: An 18-year old intern, Ari is essentially Daniel\u2019s assistant most days and gets him what Rachel is unable to when it\u2019s necessary. She has dirty blonde hair and tanned skin and behaves like the stereotypical rich, popular girl from school. Even though she can be a snob sometimes, Daniel thinks that Ari does her job relatively well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel Grande: A 51-year old shipyard worker, Laurel is the Jones\u2019 neighbor to the east and has her own kids who are already off to college. Although living next to the Jones family for several years, she likes to cause trouble and always has a complaint towards something Daniel or Jennifer has done. She also has a large rear end matched with a rather gifted rack and takes walks in leggings and a tight t-shirt to show off her assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna Lehigh: A high-strung fresh-out-of-college flirt, Donna recently began renting the other house next door to the Jones family and has taken an interest in Daniel. Although a little over ten years younger than him, Donna doesn\u2019t care. Whenever she can, Donna tries to use her wonderful looks of wavy brown hair, tan skin and brown eyes along with her knockout body to seduce Daniel into having some fun with her, but Daniel remains immovable and keeps his loyalty to his family.<br>\r\n</td>",
