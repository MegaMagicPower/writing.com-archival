Wanted to ask if you wanted to come with me to the public pool with me today, They're offering a discount today and I thought you could relief some stress by swimming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing who was on the other end, Bella would sigh heavily as she thought about Trisha. She was one of her few friends outside of the Evergreen Forest, but she seemed to stay consistently at a 7'0\" height while she herself has changed in height with every visit.

Behind them was a note with what the customer wanted the epitaph to say. The note read: \"Martin Albert Windlemon. Beloved Grandfather and Librarian. June 7th, 1944 - August 8th, 2020.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest in Piece, Marty.\" Jack said to herself. \"Whole town's gonna miss ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the pictures and note down, Jack went over to what she liked to call her \"mine\", the storage area where she kept stones that would soon be shaped into headstones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonemasonry hadn't been Jack's first choice of job. She had wanted to be an engineer, but took multiple classes to cover her bases in case that didn't work. Sure enough, it didn't. Jack's stonemasonry classes, though, came into use when the original Stonemason of Blue Hills Cemetery retired. And thus, here she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rubber powers actually were quite helpful here too. Stretching her arms, she wrapped them around a large piece of marble, and lifted with all her might. She was slightly stronger, but not by much. Lugging the piece of rock out of the \"mine\", Jack set in on her reinforced work station, grabbed her chisel, made her hand grow large, and got to work on shaping the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got about part way through when she heard the door to her workshop open. She was about to shrink her hand down until she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack! You in here?\" The voice yelled. A voice belonging to one of the only two people who knew about Jack's secret power. That person was...</span></div></div>",

It was done in a generic, Japanese bob-cut. A melon pin was tied in her hair, either out of irony or general love of the fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ciao</i>~ Jackie!\" Yuki called out. Jack stretched out her hand to give her friend a handshake. Her boobs jiggled in enthusiastic shaking. <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\nYuki was another of the town's weirdos that somehow stayed hidden away from public eye. The stonemason had discovered the woman one lonely night, which in turn allowed Jack to discover she wasn't freak in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki's story was quite different than Jack's though. Working for Mrs.Abernathy, the town's largest--in more ways than one--debutante,Yuki felt a subtle envy for the other workers there. Who seemed to also suffer the town's weird affliction. Yuki,being the only normal person there,decided to join the in-crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only wanted them to get a <i>smidge</i> bigger.\" Yuki told the stretcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a doctor who wasn't a few days drive out of town, Yuki expected him to give her bust a nice boob job. Instead, she received knockers half her size. She of course complained to the man, who told her she needed the funds for their removal. Already out of cash for the first operation, Yuki did her best to scrounge up more for her second.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-------</div><br>\r\n\"I don't think that's hello.\" Jack told the Japanese woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is.\" Yuki replied with a slight shrug.

It'd be so nice to be out in public again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd love to show off my powers in public, but I get the feeling people would freak.\" Jack replied. \"You'd think all these changes would be more out in the open, but nope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki shrugged, and pulled her cell phone out of her cleavage. \"Well, at least I have some extra carrying space.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked back at Yuki. Yuki's massive bust filled up her entire lap when sitting, and came up to her chin. Though heavy, they kept a perfectly round shape thanks to the implants. While she knew Yuki's issues with them, Jack did love the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had gained a love of huge breasts in college. She had no interest in sex or romance at all, but there was just something about giant boobs she liked. In her off-time, she browsed the internet for stories of huge breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, that's not why I came here.\" Yuki said. \"I actually wanted to see if you wanted to come over to my house after work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Jack asked, turning back to the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki smiled. \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

She'd gotten part of it finished, and she hoped to have at least half of it done before she had to leave. Thankfully, since she had a policy that she needed at least a week to finish a tombstone, she had plenty of time. So, she got back to work, chipping away at the stone.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Jack had indeed managed to get half of the stone shaped into an open book, but it was time to close shop. Setting her tools aside, she left her workshop and locked it. Looking around to make sure no one was watching, she stretched her arm like a grapple, latched onto a nearby tree, and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took Jack a few minutes to reach Yuki's house, bounding across the rooftops. Thankfully, she managed to avoid other people. Landing right in front of Yuki's door, she was about to knock before it swung open.
