She was one of her few friends outside of the Evergreen Forest, but she seemed to stay consistently at a 7'0\" height while she herself has changed in height with every visit.

June 7th, 1944 - August 8th, 2020.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest in Piece, Marty.\" Jack said to herself. \"Whole town's gonna miss ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the pictures and note down, Jack went over to what she liked to call her \"mine\", the storage area where she kept stones that would soon be shaped into headstones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonemasonry hadn't been Jack's first choice of job. She had wanted to be an engineer, but took multiple classes to cover her bases in case that didn't work. Sure enough, it didn't. Jack's stonemasonry classes, though, came into use when the original Stonemason of Blue Hills Cemetery retired. And thus, here she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rubber powers actually were quite helpful here too. Stretching her arms, she wrapped them around a large piece of marble, and lifted with all her might. She was slightly stronger, but not by much. Lugging the piece of rock out of the \"mine\", Jack set in on her reinforced work station, grabbed her chisel, made her hand grow large, and got to work on shaping the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got about part way through when she heard the door to her workshop open. She was about to shrink her hand down until she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack! You in here?\" The voice yelled. A voice belonging to one of the only two people who knew about Jack's secret power. That person was...</span></div></div>",

It was done in a generic, Japanese bob-cut. A melon pin was tied in her hair, either out of irony or general love of the fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ciao</i>~ Jackie!\" Yuki called out.

The stonemason had discovered the woman one lonely night, which in turn allowed Jack to discover she wasn't freak in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki's story was quite different than Jack's though. Working for Mrs.Abernathy, the town's largest--in more ways than one--debutante,Yuki felt a subtle envy for the other workers there. Who seemed to also suffer the town's weird affliction. Yuki,being the only normal person there,decided to join the in-crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only wanted them to get a <i>smidge</i> bigger.\" Yuki told the stretcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a doctor who wasn't a few days drive out of town, Yuki expected him to give her bust a nice boob job. Instead, she received knockers half her size. She of course complained to the man, who told her she needed the funds for their removal. Already out of cash for the first operation, Yuki did her best to scrounge up more for her second.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-------</div><br>\r\n\"I don't think that's hello.\" Jack told the Japanese woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is.\" Yuki replied with a slight shrug.

Yuki's massive bust filled up her entire lap when sitting, and came up to her chin. Though heavy, they kept a perfectly round shape thanks to the implants. While she knew Yuki's issues with them, Jack did love the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had gained a love of huge breasts in college. She had no interest in sex or romance at all, but there was just something about giant boobs she liked.

She'd gotten part of it finished, and she hoped to have at least half of it done before she had to leave. Thankfully, since she had a policy that she needed at least a week to finish a tombstone, she had plenty of time. So, she got back to work, chipping away at the stone.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Jack had indeed managed to get half of the stone shaped into an open book, but it was time to close shop.

It was just to give sound into a silent store. The rainstorm outside with the wind howling was not a comforting sound. So Missy, who got off in about three hours, did her best to occupy herself within the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConverted from a 1830's townhouse, 'The House of the Hill' DVD/Tape store was one of the town's local landmarks.Somehow still being able to bring in more than enough folks to keep the business afloat.Normally very comly, the outside weather made it the darkness of some parts look like the emptiness of space.The interior had become quite foreboding, certain areas had faulty wiring which caused the lights to flicker or caused strange noises to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy occupied herself by reorganizing the basement, where all the old videos were. From DVDs to cassettes to tapes, it always seemed that somebody in town wanted to buy from here. Ironically the deep basement was one of the less terrifying parts of the old house. With actual lights that were still on and a small boombox to hear music on. On her butt, Missy piled together movies into their respective genres before she categorized that into what technology they were made for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this, I may try to do the attic.\" Missy said to herself once more.She then remembered the strange memorabilia up there and decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had come into town a little over a month ago and took her job in the store two days before this point. The brunette with a ponytail was slowly becoming more accustomed to her job though she still found certain peculiarities of the place. For one, she was told never to question the people who came in with gigantic clothing, like coats or skirts or even at one time a wetsuit. The other thing she was told was to never question the contents of the four red box in the basement. Not because it was weird, but because it contained...quite lewd material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy had already saw the cover of one of the videos and she had turned a bright red. So the woman vowed never to do so again unless told. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I think I got the horror section done now lets....wait,what's this?\" Missy spoke. She picked up a blocky tape and looked at the cover. On it was a supermodel looking woman with red lips, red hair,and green eyes. The only conservative part of herself was the oldstyle puritan hat she wore. Everything below was longcoat that flashed a bodysuit that was just three pieces away from becoming a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComedically, the woman wore one of the most determined expression Missy had ever seen on a woman's face. She scratched her head in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van Helsing's Horror Pack\" Missy said. \"Includes:The Fullest Moon,The Blue Lagoon's Deeps, Countess Dracuela, Frakenstein's Wife,Ms Jekyll and Miss.Hyde,The Invisible Woman, Haunting of the Manor,Mummies,and The Phantasm of the Opera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped it around to stare at the back. Images showed scenes from what appeared to be a Hammer film,with its signature grainery appearance of the 1930's to 50's. But a woman so lewdly dressed would probably never fly during those days,so what was this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity getting the better of her,Missy went over to the TV that was placed down in the basement-so that clients could see if their disc or tape still worked-and plopped it inside. She went through all the motions until she eventually saw the opening screen.</span></div></div>",

Almost as if it was a stronger mirror of the outside world, the land of wherever the setting was located was currently going through a deluge.Floods came crashing through the forest's trees. The moon's silver beams were the only lighting in the entire place,though that was soon eclipsed by the shining lights of a carriage's lantern. It's lights pierced the water fog and the shadowed forest it drove through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost there Miss.\" The driver, a deep voiced man, spoke to whomever was the current occupant of the carriage. The horses whined in distress from the rain,yet still they continued onwards. Soon the shot of an old, gothic castle came into view. The carriage was dwarfed by the size. Even with barely any knowledge of architecture, Missy noted how utterly absurd the size was. The entire thing was more of Versailles palace than a gothic stronghold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill it drove through the foreboding gates, inside the courtyard or was it stadium field, were small houses and taverns. Some folks were watching the rain pour down, while others watched their children play in said rain. One or two looked towards the carriage,but none seemed to deem the vehicle any note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it stopped the doors to the carriage slowly creaked open to reveal the titular Van Helsing. Who was still clad in her almost-bikini. Yet this didn't stop her slow strut outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you dear driver.\" She spoke to the man. The torrent seemingly not muting her own voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome Professor,I'll be hitching the horses then.\" He replied.With that, he drove off, leaving the scandalously dressed woman alone.Her attire was so out of place compared to the 18th century peasants, that Missy softly chuckled in response.</span></div></div>",

Van Helsing walked through this small group, who regarded her with suspicion. Missy assumed it was because she was a stranger, but Missy still couldn't help but notice the complete disconnect between the normal 18th century outfits, and Van Helsing's scandalous outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Van Helsing entered what looked like a tavern filled with people. The owner, a burly man with a large beard, only briefly looked up from the bar-top, before returning to cleaning it. Van Helsing walked up to the bar, and sat down. The owner looked up again, and grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll it be, miss?\" The owner asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Information.\" Van Helsing replied. \"I want to know all there is to know about the Countess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the sound in the tavern died as everyone stared at Van Helsing. Some looked afraid, others angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, you want no business with the Countess.\" One of the bar patrons said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and why is that?\" Van Helsing asked. She was met with silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, lady.\" The bar owner said. \"The Countess is not a person to trifle with. No one in the village dare go near her castle. If ye really want to go to her, though, take this.\" He then pulled out a wooden stake from behind the counter. \"A stake of Hawthorn wood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing looked at the stake, before taking it. She simply nodded before leaving the tavern. She then opened her longcoat and put the stake in a pouch next to three others of the same kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart girl.\" Missy muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene then faded into the entrance of the castle. Van Helsing used the large gargoyle knocker on the door.</span></div></div>",

A creak of the iron doors made Van Helsing step back a little. A small, round and cute face peaked from the crack. Brunette hair tied into a neat bun with a general demeanor of joyful service. The personality one got if they'd served someone for many years without barely a peep of disagreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who might you be?\" The servant politely inquired. Van Helsing coughed and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van Helsing. Professor Sarah Van Helsing; PhD and all the other alphabets in the English language. I'm here to see your mistress, there has been rumors of a dark force on your lands. May I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small brunette looked at Sarah for a moment before she nodded and smiled. She pushed the door open, which was surprising given how heavy it looked,so the Dutch woman could go inside.Van Helsing stepped in,around the front area of the castle were fifteen or so people speaking with one another. Elsewhere she could hear the faint echoes of a more...rambunctious party going on in the castle. Whether it was from the east of her or the west, Van Helsing could not say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady's annual party.\" The brunette stated. \"She loves to host events that run the line between scandalous and formal,almost like a reflection of herself.I almost forgot:R.M Renfield at your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenfield bowed to Van Helsing, who nodded in turn. She scanned the area to see the figures around her, the professor saw how different yet unified they were all dressed. They wore masks of animals, though they seem to stop at around seven different beasts. Those being:the cow, the raven, the goat,the lion, the pig,the mule,and the boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guests clothes also seemed to be quite chaotic, but if one looked a little closer, could see a unifying color scheme. Pieces of red,yellow,green,purple,blue,brown,or orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting concept.\" Van Helsing noted. Renfield puckered her lips in thought until she realized what Van Helsing was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes,each of those animals and colors are references to the mortal sins that men can enact.The front area of this abode is a lobby for rest. The rest of the wings are devoted towards the pleasures that each sin carries,all except my lady's tower that is, though some do get to explore it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And hopefully you'll shall see it too Ms.Van Helsing.\" A voice said. Van Helsing turned to her left and saw what was quite possibly the most ridiculous thing she had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy stared open mouth at the incoming figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was ethereal beauty with raven hair done short, yet alluring. Her skin was pale to the point where in some of the lighting she seemed almost blue. Her face had just the right amount of exoctisicm where one could only tell she came from the eurasian connected continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet these weren't her most eyecatching pieces, instead both Van Helsing and Missy were drawn towards the count's bulbous breasts. They were practically stuffed into a little black dress, which would've been quite beautiful on the woman, if she didn't possess her pair of bazongas. They covered her entire upper chest and reached almost as wide as her shoulders. Gold trimmings were located around her cleavage as though they weren't noticeable enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Countess Draculei.\" Renfield spoke in a hasty tone and bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings my fair servant, come help me guide Ms.Van Helsing here towards a much more...lively area. I feel as though some merriment would be needed in our coming talks.\" Draculei replied. Van Helsing still stared bug-eyed at the large boob woman.</span></div></div>",

But those were out of the corner of her eye, since Van Helsing couldn't seem to take her eyes of the Countess's bulbous bust. It jiggled and swayed with each step the Countess took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the three arrived at a large green room, filled with trinkets from other countries. Van Helsing assumed this was the Envy room. Renfield stood by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraculei moved to a large green couch and sat down, her bust resting neatly in her lap. She motioned for Van Helsing to join her, which the professor did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, to what do I owe the honor of the great Sarah Van Helsing visiting my home?\" Draculei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard tell that this land is besieged by creatures of darkness.\" Van Helsing answered. \"Ghouls and demons attacking the townsfolk. I would like to offer my services to rid this land of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy rolled her eyes as she watched the scene unfold. It was obvious Draculei was one of those creatures. She just wanted to scream at the screen and warn her, but she knew it'd be no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. I've heard those rumors.\" Draculei replied. \"It is quite ghastly what's been happening. I'll gladly take your services. I'll see to it you have a room here to deal with these... creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Van Helsing replied, eyes still glued to the Countess's massive bust. The Countess noticed this and chuckled.<br>\r\n\"They are quite marvelous, aren't they?\" Draculei said, hefting up her bust. \"They began growing some time ago. I must admit, I simply adore them. They are quite soft to the touch. Would you like to feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, it seemed like Van Helsing would take the offer, but she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you. I should retire for the evening. If I am to rid your home of these creatures, I need to be well rested.\" Van Helsing said. The Countess seemed somewhat sad at her offer being turned down, but dismissed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall have Renfield take you to a room.\" Draculei said, before motioning for Renfield to do just that. As Renfield led Van Helsing out, Draculei watched, smiling.</span></div></div>",

Missy watched as the woman moved like greased lighting and stepped right back into her bikini armor. Although,this one was colored green instead of her usual read. Now that she thought of it, where was Van Helsing's travel bag?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, Van Helsing walked out of her room. All across the hallways were strung out guests with gaping mouths with dribbling wine. Van Helsing grimaced at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't mind the guests, they'll be out partying once more.\" A woman who appeared to be more comly dressed than the animal wearers spoke. Van Helsing's eyebrow raised up. The woman was a mirror of Draculei, in terms of body proportions. Her bust wasn't as monstrous as her mistress,but they passed the realm of normal possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alina at your service.\" She bowed which gave ample view of her cleavage. Van Helsing nodded in acknowledgement.The busty woman gently held her hand out to guide Van Helsing out of the cramped corridors. The two soon stepped into the red room of wrath. What appeared to be a cockfighting ring was placed gently in the corner, while on the other side was a ring for bare knuckle brawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for your accommodations, all the other wings were booked\" Alina spoke. Van Helsing ruffled her hat for a bit as it smacked against a random hand stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, I am just thankful your mistress has given me temporary shelter.\"Van Helsing responded.The two slowly made their way out from the red room and crossed into a corridor,though all the curtains were up,which made Van Helsing look at Alina for an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning hangovers.\" was all she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then walked right and passed an ornate door to be greeted by a small garden. It was surprisingly humble for the large castle-mansion, until Van Helsing realized that it was just another thematic area of Draculei's dwelling. If she had to guess, there were six other gardens just like this.With a pop, Van Helsing looked over to see Alina with a large parasol blocking the sun from her. How she got a parasol so fast, when the professor knew she didn't have one before, Van Helsing didn't bother to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Alina!\" Draculei called out. \"And good morning to you Van Helsing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gargantuan parasol blocked the sunlight from Draculei. Still the size strained to cover the well endowed woman, any bigger and it would too cumbersome to be moved at all. The mistress of the castle sat in a chair while Renfield served water to some other lounging guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a tour of my home to see any kinks in my defenses?\" The countess spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gruff 'yes', Van Helsing walked forth towards the countess.  Alina followed behind with some frugal steps under the sun.</span></div></div>",

That was something Van Helsing certainly noticed. They had just left a garden with hedges and statures depicting a fierce battle, which Van Helsing guessed was Wrath, and they were now entering a garden with statues of beautiful women of various body shapes in provocative poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm to assume this is Lust?\" Van Helsing asked, keeping her eyes on the garden itself. She knew that if she looked at Draculei, she'd never take her eyes of the Countess's enormous bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Of all the sins, Lust is my personal favorite.\" Draculei answered. \"Beauty is something I quite value, and a sin represent that fits me quite well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing did not reply to that. She simply continued to look at the garden. She noticed several servants milling about, but they all seemed... odd. The male servants were quiet and emotionless, while the female servants all seemed more lively. What's more, the female servants all were buxom as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle tour took the three into a library. It was enormous, and filled with books from various countries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've traveled quite a bit, and have amassed a rather impressive collection of tomes. Perhaps they could be useful in your... work here.\" Draculei said. There was silence for a moment, before Draculei suddenly moved in front of Van Helsing. Once she did, Van Helsing's eyes instantly fell on Draculei's bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies. I actually quite enjoy the attention my chest gets.\" Draculei said. \"Alina, you may go.

This seems like several lifetimes worth, even I can't believe you filled these hallways by yourself.\" Van Helsing spoke.

Guests from the greed wing.\" Draculei whispered. A few woman worked with these guests, almost as if they were scholars in a academic stronghold. One woman though stood out amongst them. She had a great large bust, more grapefruit shaped than the other bosom filled women. In size she was smaller than both Draculei and Alina, though no lest supernaturally busty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solveig, hello dear.\" Draculei said to the woman. \"What guest do we have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lord Beaumont. A Frenchman I believe.\" Solveig spoke with a hint of a Norse accent upon her tongue.The lord did not wear a raven's head but instead a completely yellow robe like a Grecian. He seemed too entranced by his book to recognize the mistress of the manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm. Tell the poor fellow you'll be out for a bit.\" Draculei stated. Solveig nodded and talked to the man besides her. He waved her off and so Solveig got up to attend to her lady's need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My servant Solveig meet Van Helsing,Van Helsing meet Solveig.\" Draculei stated.

The professor prodded around the section as she searched for her required texts. To her surprise Draculei's selection about the local area comprised a total of over twenty different books to Van Helsing's guess. She licked her lips for a moment and brought out three of them. With a swift tuck under her arm, the professor had chosen her first few objects of study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be off Solveig.\" Van Helsing said. \"Tell your master I'll be in my room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Solveig stated, with a bow that jiggled breast meat, the woman waved Van Helsing away. The professor stalked out of the hallway and moved back towards her room. Her pace was somewhere between a run and a walk, so in essence, a speed walk.It seemed though the professor had taken a wrong turn as her eyes looked around to find herself within a blue room. Bottles of wine and rubber were placed haphazardly around the room. Men and women wore blue pieces or had cow head's placed upon their crowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman dance on a table and Van Helsing's eyes widened in surprise.She wore the most provocative clothing ever, so much so it would've been less scandalous if she was nude. The general material of it was silk. Even Missy with her modern tastes blushed in embarrassment. In a time where showing ankles was considered sensual, this piece went above and beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the only thing, her breasts were enormous.They eclipsed Alina's and Solveig by a wide margin, with only the countess beating the woman out. It must've been painful for her to move this much, yet the ginormous bust woman still danced away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's with this movie and boobs.\"</i> Missy blushed while she pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi Lads and lassies, Ole' Magdalene is going to do another jig.\" Magdalene,evidently, declared. With a gentle rumpshack, she did an crotch thrust and began another dance. Van Helsing huffed before she moved out from the den of carnal pleasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back into another hallway, Van Helsing did her best to formulate a way back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" A voice coughed behind her. The Dutch woman turned her head to spy a woman in what appeared to be a Polish styled men's clothing. It didn't quite fit into it well do to the woman's prodigious bust;Van Helsing's best estimates placed her between Alina and Solveig in size. Unlike the two of them the woman seemed to want to make her breasts seem smaller than they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Dagmara.\" The woman stated, her brown hair cut short yet feminine.There was a certain tone in her voice though, much more colder than the other two servants were. \"How may I assist you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I would like to be taken back to my room, I have books you see.\" Van Helsing stated. Dagmara raised an eyebrow but continued on. She asked for Van Helsing's wing,and once answered, barely took a second before she took the professor's hand. With great strides the two shot off until eventually they both arrived back at Van Helsing's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank-\" Van Helsing looked around but didn't see a trace of the Polish woman.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps there was something on the creatures in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes ticked by, Van Helsing became truly fascinated with the history of the area. It seemed the area, the Carpathian Mountains, were once under the rule of another noble, a count. But he had perished at some point, and the manor came into the ownership of Countess Draculei. Though oddly, Draculei's own history seemed missing from the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing also read that the area was a breeding ground for vampires, attacking livestock to keep themselves feed on blood. With this confirmation, Van Helsing closed the book, and grabbed the next book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes turned into hours as Van Helsing read everything in the three books. It was well into the night, and Van Helsing decided it was time to start looking around the manor, to make sure no monsters attacked the people within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her room, she began walking the halls of the manor. She could still hear the sounds of partying going on in the various rooms. She decided that if they were still partying, they must have been safe, so she ignored the rooms and went out into the night.</span></div></div>",

There was the feeling however that the partying would soon subside as the hour grew longer. Van Helsing didn't care much though for this display of human thirst for blood when there was more supernatural thirst still abound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready having visited the lust room, Van Helsing decided she wanted to see some other places in the manor. It being so big, her walk down the hallways felt like they took forever. Missy swore she saw a loop just to make the travel feel even longer than needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much more of this movie is there?\" She questioned. The real life woman picked up the remote to see she was only an hour and twelve minutes in. With only another hour and thirty minutes to go. She paused the video and went up to the store to get some snacks she knew the owner left behind. Outside the storm continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut let's not concern ourselves with her.Back in Van Helsing's timeframe, the professor moved her way until she neared the sloth room. There men and women in pieces of orange with mule masks and insignias walked lazily among each other. The faint smell of hashish and narcotics could be divined through the air. Van Helsing closed her mouth and nose and quickly moved out into its garden, which was by far the largest she could see. It dwarfed the wrath and lust room in size as though it was declaring \"can you walk end to end of my quarters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing saw in one corner three ladies of unnatural paleness to their skin.One had pale-blonde to her locks, another raven,and one startling white.With the signature bosm filled bodies of the countess' court, Van Helsing wouldn't mind them that much. If not for the fact that the white-haired one seemed to be intent to lay on top of two comfortable looking cushions. Which the other two didn't want to sit on themselves and in fact drove away any drugged out guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing walked casually over to them to listen in on their conversation. she sat down onto an unoccupied cushion near the trio and did her best to appear wanting for some hemp or opium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you stayed out that long in the sun, could you believe your punishment if you got any bigger than you did? What the master would've thought? You're lucky you shrunk down to this size.\" One of the two women spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for my carelessness, my sisters, I seemed that the drugs took quite a hold of me as well as my prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite right. Hopefully by another hour you'll get even smaller, until then we'll have to keep a watch on any of the prey who thinks you'll make a good cushion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Prey? I dare think I've found my beast,or in this case,beasts</i> Van Helsing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finding everything alright lass?\" A voice declared. Van Helsing looked up to see two twin spheres eclipsed her view. The wobbled back to reveal the smiling face of Magdalene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite alright,just listening in on the nights wing.\" Van Helsing did her best not to stare at the three, yet it seemed that Magdalene had a keen sense of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi yeah those three over there, oof, troublemakers they are. Yet they do their jobs well.\" The Irishwoman stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And may in fact be creatures of the night.\"</i> Van Helsing thought once more. </span></div></div>",

The gasping water released ghastly sounds.It set the mood quite well, plus the sound of a wolf howling didn't do much to diminish the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe traveler looked upward towards the moon and revealed itself to be the scantily clad Van Helsing. Her eyes dark with a fierce intelligence, though again, in her pseudo-bikini she wasn't that intimidating. With a bleak blink at the camera, Van Helsing charged passed the bog with her horse. In the background the sounds of wolves grew more and more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a snarl crashed into the scene and the speeding shape of a dark beast came rushing out of the thicket behind the bog. Van Helsing,with hawk-like reflexes, threw a dagger at the form. A yelp of a dog echoed before the dark shape rushed back into the overgrowth. Now that she thought of though, Missy wondered what wolves were doing so near a bog. Unless they do live near bogs, in which that case, nevermind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing, meanwhile, didn't seem to contemplate the ecology of wolves. She edged her horse further along the path in an effort to create more distance between her and the pack. A thunder of growls filled the area behind Van Helsing as she rode forth. She soon caught eye of a blinking torch, which made Van Helsing smile in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that mood was soon broken by the sound of the wolves behind her. She cried out in desperation while her horse breathed heavily. The light soon materialized larger and Van Helsing could see the small township in front of her. With a hearty crie,she pushed her stallion to the limits until it passed the torch and ended up in the middle of town. Just as fast, Van Helsing turned around with her saber to slice through any canine attacker. None came though, through deduction of their paw patterns that Van Helsing saw,the professor could see how their steps looked as though they retreated. It was as if something scared them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need to keep tabs on that situation.\" Van Helsing mused to herself.</span></div></div>",

There was a panning shot of a massive river, surrounded by trees. Thanks to her geography classes, Missy was able to identify it as the Amazon River.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene then faded to a boat on the river. Standing right at the bow of the ship was Van Helsing herself, still clad in her almost-bikini armor. Missy couldn't help but chuckle at this.

The duo were soon followed by a mix of men in women, which swelled the pair into a group of seven. The group walked across the sand, the jungle sounds echoed in the shade caused by the canopy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they arrived at a camp half-way destroyed. Tents laid wrecked with pieces of broken canoes embedded in some of them.Twelve or so men laid bandaged and moaning. Four nurses worked vigorously to keep them in fair conditions. A burly looking man sat on top of a barrel. Evidence of heavy drinking was scattered around his impromptu seat. He gave the group a hardy wave of acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, you must be th-\" his words were suddenly stopped by a hiccup.\"The problem solver our foreman hired.James Morris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr.Van Helsing.\" said woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing shook the man's hand and introduced the male scientist as Dr.Maia. A few exchanges of words came from between the trio before they came to the main problem. Around them, the two groups of the uninjured workers and the boat people helped one another out.With the campsite workers going down to the boat to unhook cargo while the boat folk checked on the wounds of the bandaged people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see the effects of whatever attacked us, now how can you help find the cause?\" James questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the first thing I have to do James is see what this beast is.\" Van Helsing asked. \"Now can you describe the beast on the night it attacked you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beasts\" James stressed. \"<i>Plural.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was more than one?\" Dr.Maia questioned. James nodded and proceeded to explain what had happened for the last week or so.One worker named Yuri had spotted the largest creature he had ever seen.'So huge it could eat a man whole' he described it. Curiosity getting the better of some of the men, they walked to shore only to be greeted by a smaller beast that was still a foot taller than the tallest worker they had on duty. It thoroughly thrashed all the men there and left soon after. The next time, the men decided to try and trap the larger monster. With carefully placed fishing nets at each point in the river that was large enough to allow such a big beast in, they waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I swear on God's name, we caught that blubbery beast!\" Jame declared.Yet once they canoed out to drag it back to camp,the second beast had somehow allowed the fatter one out. They were of course attacked, and while deadly on land, the water monster proved much more of a combatant in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith three men heavily busted up in the tryst, they had miraculously canoed back to camp and ran towards dryer land. But they were followed, the smaller beast grabbed ahold of the vacant canoes. It launched them like cruise missiles and landed into multiple tents with the shrapnel hitting many more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which has now left us in this current predicament.\" James finished.\"It has only come back three time since then, but thankfully it only injured one or two men per appearance. Lucky me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing rubbed her chin in thought once James' tale had been spoken.</span></div></div>",

Misty smiled to her girlfriend and waltzed over with her great big bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perv myself like this?\" She asked. The Chinese woman laid her bust across the smaller, yet still large boob, woman on the bed.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nAt another part of town one woman flex her body as best as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold.Holddd!\" Lana screamed out. Her tree-trunk thighs and calves did their best to keep in the air. Her hips strained because of how much pressure she was putting on them. Her foot was pointed like an arrow to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked like plush fat that could easily be used as pillows, but Lana knew that their was muscle strong enough to crush watermelons in her legs. Unfortuantley,she wanted her old flexibility back,not these ridiculous things she had now.The former dancer gasped in relief and in frustration as her balance was lost and she was dumped onto her bum. Which itself had grown a little larger yet was dwarfed by her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God darnit.\" She laughed out. The fat thigh woman had come somewhat to terms with her changed body. Still she wanted those old dance moves she could do when she was smaller. The woman laid down for a few more moments and then pushed herself upwards to get a drink from her small fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce one of the world's most famous dancers, or at least in the top thirty, Lana had since laid out of public sight. Her swollen thighs,monster calves,and earthquake hips not being something she was proud of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The convention is soon and I want to look at least capable of what I could do before.\" The woman mumbled while she drank from her bottle of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The university is considered the highest class of the entire region, while the town is considered the most perfect blend of cool forests and calm river beaches. With a population of over two-hundred thousand, and with a rising populace to boot, it seems that town's popularity is ever on the rise. But there have been some concerns with the town's populace. Like how two-thirds of anybody ages seventeen to thirty-two have suffered some <i>minor</i> physical mishaps. Maybe its something in the water, or the air, maybe its the science building acting up, or maybe its that old chemical plant leaking into the fields.
