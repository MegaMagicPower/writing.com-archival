As she would hop back onto the ground though, the woman would hear a ringing from her phone, and as the woman would pull it out, she would check out who was calling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey It's Bella, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Bella, it's me Trisha! Wanted to ask if you wanted to come with me to the public pool with me today, They're offering a discount today and I thought you could relief some stress by swimming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing who was on the other end, Bella would sigh heavily as she thought about Trisha. She was one of her few friends outside of the Evergreen Forest, but she seemed to stay consistently at a 7'0\" height while she herself has changed in height with every visit. However, she had never really shown up below 5 feet to Trisha, which worried her a bit on what she would think if she saw her that small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you coming or no?\" </span></div></div>",

Behind them was a note with what the customer wanted the epitaph to say. The note read: \"Martin Albert Windlemon. Beloved Grandfather and Librarian. June 7th, 1944 - August 8th, 2020.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest in Piece, Marty.\" Jack said to herself. \"Whole town's gonna miss ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the pictures and note down, Jack went over to what she liked to call her \"mine\", the storage area where she kept stones that would soon be shaped into headstones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonemasonry hadn't been Jack's first choice of job. She had wanted to be an engineer, but took multiple classes to cover her bases in case that didn't work. Sure enough, it didn't. Jack's stonemasonry classes, though, came into use when the original Stonemason of Blue Hills Cemetery retired. And thus, here she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rubber powers actually were quite helpful here too. Stretching her arms, she wrapped them around a large piece of marble, and lifted with all her might. She was slightly stronger, but not by much. Lugging the piece of rock out of the \"mine\", Jack set in on her reinforced work station, grabbed her chisel, made her hand grow large, and got to work on shaping the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got about part way through when she heard the door to her workshop open. She was about to shrink her hand down until she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack! You in here?\" The voice yelled.

It was done in a generic, Japanese bob-cut. A melon pin was tied in her hair, either out of irony or general love of the fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ciao</i>~ Jackie!\" Yuki called out.

The stonemason had discovered the woman one lonely night, which in turn allowed Jack to discover she wasn't the only freak in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki's story was quite different than Jack's though. Working for Mrs.Abernathy, the town's largest--in more ways than one--debutante,Yuki felt a subtle envy for the other workers there. Who seemed to also suffer the town's weird affliction. Yuki,being the only normal person there,decided to join the in-crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only wanted them to get a <i>smidge</i> bigger.\" Yuki told the stretcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a doctor who wasn't a few days drive out of town, Yuki expected him to give her bust a nice boob job. Instead, she received knockers half her size. She of course complained to the man, who told her she needed the funds for their removal. Already out of cash for the first operation, Yuki did her best to scrounge up more for her second.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-------</div><br>\r\n\"I don't think that's hello.\" Jack told the Japanese woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is.\" Yuki replied with a slight shrug.

Yuki's massive bust filled up her entire lap when sitting, and came up to her chin. Though heavy, they kept a perfectly round shape thanks to the implants. While she knew Yuki's issues with them, Jack did love the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had gained a love of huge breasts in college. She had no interest in sex or romance at all, but there was just something about giant boobs she liked.

She'd gotten part of it finished, and she hoped to have at least half of it done before she had to leave. Thankfully, since she had a policy that she needed at least a week to finish a tombstone, she had plenty of time. So, she got back to work, chipping away at the stone.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Jack had indeed managed to get half of the stone shaped into an open book, but it was time to close shop.

Her hand searched around her nightstand with tepid confusion until she finally got a hold of the brew. She lifted towards her mouth,but with forgetful care, spilled some onto her own brown skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes.\" She quickly placed the coffee down followed by her laptop. With a napkin she got right next to her coffee, Vanessa wiped down her gigantic breasts. Two large things that covered about a foot in front of her. Feeling a wetspot under her, Vanessa got up to reveal to the world an equally large ass. They jiggled tightly in her jeans,well,more like mega-jeans. The Egyptian woman looked down at where she sat once before to see a thin coffee stain there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit. These sheets need to be washed. And I just put them on too.\" Vanessa moaned. She swayed her way to her closet to resheet her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman known as Vanessa Zaki suffered a strange condition. After her puberty it seemed that whatever curve fairy that controlled the world of woman's assets had forgotten to give a stop to Vanessa.Her T&amp;A were generally great when she wanted to attract some handsome boys in her small town in Egypt,but due to the stigma there,she had to be sent over to her uncle's when she got too big.America was a much more interesting place compared to Egypt's landscape, and even better,she could easily hide her body in the winding paths of a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even then her body caught up to her. She thankfully finished college before her body had gotten too the point where she was ridiculous in proportions, but she knew that it was inevitable.So after a quick goodbye to her uncle, Vanessa searched for a place to hide her body. Great Tracts had caught her eye,and with some clever disguises that she made for herself, Vanessa had managed to talk herself into a small home and job at the local news station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the woman, Vanessa was currently in the middle of typing on her paper until a thought popped into her mind. Maybe she should go out and see what the place was all about. She had only been here for two months, it didn't hurt to explore the place. She did that when she was younger, seeing the strange new part of America would've gave her younger self a big 'ole smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although, I did do that when I was smaller.\" She bemoaned.</span></div></div>",

But she was still quite shy about her ever-growing figure, so she decided that it would be best to wait until night came around. She had heard that Great Tracts was much quieter at night, for reasons unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind set, she looked at her clock. 7:44. Not bright, but still not exactly \"dark\". She chose to wait until 8 to actually head out. That, and the news report she was working needed to be turned in first thing in the morning, so she really did have to get it down now.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n8 finally rolled around, and Vanessa had just managed to finish the report. Satisfied, she got out of her chair and went to her closet. She grabbed the biggest coat she could, one that would properly hide her cartoonish curves. Putting it on, she went to her front door, and put on her shoes. After grabbing her house keys, she finally left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad to have waited until nightfall. Aside from no one seeing her curves, night always seemed much more peaceful to her. It was comfortably quiet, the night was cloudless, allowing Vanessa to see the stars, and the air was nice and cool. It was always nice to go for a walk at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she lived in the Farshine District, Vanessa decided to start her walk just wandering the streets of the district. There were a few shops and a park, so perhaps she could check those out. She had heard the shops stayed open late. So, picking a random direction, she began walking.<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nIt was only a few minutes into her walk that she came across the first person. She had managed to find her way to a small convenience store, and was considering getting something to eat when she saw someone step out carrying a few bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person was a pale young man, more then likely one of the nearby university students based on his beard and sweater. The odd thing was that he was unusually short. In fact, he was about 3 feet tall. Vanessa had never seen someone that short before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he left, Vanessa entered the store herself. Quickly making her way to the snack foods, she picked up some chips and a few chocolate bars. As she did, she looked over at the alcohol, and saw another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an Asian-American woman, probably in her 20's, and she had what were possibly the largest breasts Vanessa had ever seen. They easily had to be three times the size of Vanessa's own bust. Based on their nearly perfect spherical shape, she had guessed they were implants. But why would someone get implants so large?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman went to the counter to pay for her booze, and after she left, Vanessa paid for her booze and left. It was there she saw the third and final person of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was another woman, Native-America from the looks of it, and slightly older then the huge boobed woman. She was on the opposite side of the street as Vanessa. The odd thing about was her immense stomach. It looked like a beach ball was under her dress. Vanessa occasionally saw a bump come from it, making her realize the woman was pregnant. Just how many kids was she having?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa decided she wanted to check out the park, and made her way in that direction. It took her a half-hour to reach it, and when she did, she sat on a bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, she heard a voice call out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, I think this wallet is yours. You left it at the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Vanessa saw the...</span></div></div>",

She wore a flowered maxi skirt along with a red tubetop hidden behind a equally red jacket. All this did nothing to disguise a gigantic belly which hung below all of this. It was huge, almost like a genetic disorder. More mass than what should be humanly possible for a woman her size, even though she was around one-hundred and eighty centimeters tall,give or take. It was large enough to reach the woman's shoulders and far enough that the woman looked to try and compensate for its size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..thank you as well.\" Vanessa did a small bow with her head and reached over to grab her wallet. Her breasts strained against her coat,which made Vanessa note to buy a larger one for herself once she got the chance. She looked over the wallet which had a cute scarab beetle on it. Stereotypical when one considered where she'd come from, but she loved the tiny insects even though she hated most other bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh. My brain isn't all there, I think its the weather.You feel the same,Miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wickely. Erica Wickley.\" She said. Vanessa's eyebrow angled itself at the lady's name, she would've thought it would be something strange. Though Vanessa was named by her parents due to their love of how it sounded phonetically. Anyways, Vanessa stared closer at Erica's face in curisiotiy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica's had a hawkish nose, not unlike her own,but much thinner in some respects. It crowned her beauty. Her hair was cut short,though not to a boyish extent. Her eyes were almond shape, but had another thing mixed in there. Most likely because she was a mix of two races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse.\" The deep, yet seductively feminine, voice of Erica spoke. \"Are you alright Miss Zaki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was startled for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica, face like a stature,pointed at Vanessa's wallet. The Egyptian lady groaned at her own social faux-pas. Erica didn't seem to mind though,she just stared at Vanessa,calm as a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you new to the town?\"The Native woman said it without any hint of displeasure. \"If you'd want I could show you around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please don't take time out of your life for me, I can't have an expecting mother do such a task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark frown crossed Erica's face,and for a moment Vanessa thought she hit a nerve. But Erica regained her more flaccid stoicism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please, I'll be fine. It would burden my conscious if you got lost and I could've helped you.\" Erica kindly lended Vanessa a hand,the full-coated woman hesitantly took it. With that the two began to walk</span></div></div>",

Her eyes looked around her room, her small cabinet of anime figures posed in their corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her eyes in dazed confusion. A bit of drool dripped down onto her breast. Nobody would've thought the normally clean and proper woman could look so slobbish,but here she was. Yuki rubbed the side of her right breast,a itch had formed there. Her boob jiggled for a bit from her scratching. When the feeling had left, Yuki dazedly smiled. She yawned another yawn as she got up from her bed. She crashed down onto the floor with a yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddang boobs, I do this ever other day.\" Yuki yelled. \"I had you both for three months now, why can't I remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small hand, Yuki did her best to pull herself back onto her feet. Apparently in her operation she was given a steroid of some sort that allowed her body to not rip itself in two. With that being said, she didn't want breasts that would rip herself in two. She just wanted to go from a B-cup to a D-cup. Not a B-cup to,by her own estimates, a cup that could've fit three heads in. Now back on her feet Yuki shuffled for a bit until she regained her composure. She wiped her mouth and fumbled with her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bathroom where are you?\" She groaned out. Yuki walked bobbing all the while to her bathroom. She landed her breasts on her sink. Another yawn escaped her mouth's confines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh man, nips.\" She joked once she saw her bare chest. Yuki opened a cabinet,grabbed a brush, and began her daily routine. Finished about an hour later, Yuki the proper one was back at it again. She walked into her kitchen,which connected to her loft. Bare chested still Yuki prepared a bowl of cereal to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her off day today and she felt way too placid to prepare actual breakfast.

She groaned a little from the sharp pain she received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my bras would come.\" Yuki spoke.All of her current size bras were being cleaned right now. She had to get everything custom made from a store a mile or two outside the town's limits. Heck most of the women she knew had to get their clothes from that store. Back onto topic, Yuki decided it would be best if she wore no undergarments at the moment besides a pair of white laced panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on a nice pair of jeans, Yuki went back downstairs to start her day off. She walked out of her door and almost faceplanted into the ground. Only by her quick reflexes did she not drop down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep forgetting about that little drop.\" Yuki bemoaned. A neighbor of her's jogged by and gave the Japanese woman a wave. Thankfully,through rumors and Yuki's own talks, the implanted woman didn't need to explain her sudden buxom self. Yes,she did cause eyes to wander onto her, but unlike others of equal busty boobs,Yuki's breasts were easily explained. Though of course people asked why she was so big and that in turn made Yuki have to tell them about her mixup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the first thing on my agenda?\" Yuki told herself.

A yawn followed by her brushing her black locks out of her face gave the woman a nice shift into her normal routine. The bed beneath her creaked while she moved herself onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body jiggled like waves of an ocean. The woman grabbed a hold of a picture at the side of her bed,it was her ten years ago. At twenty-five years old, she was slim and bright eyed. Now,well,she still had the bright eyedness but the slim part had given itself up years ago.She was over four-hundred pounds,though her fat seemed to have wormed its way to certain spots. Her body had also been reinforced which allowed her to keep away from most medical complications. Sadly it seemed that the she was still gaining fat at a noticeable rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs.Abernathy waddled her way over to the bathroom to prepare herself. While she undressed from the scraps of clothes she considered pajamas,she pressed a red button at the side wall.

They had to build the place around Corrine when the contractors were halfway done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished, Corrine's aunt then had the entire place furnished to suit her nieces needs and even hired a maid to help around. Which caused Corrine no end to her embarrassment. It felt like she had a babysitter again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine yawned to announce her daily awakening. Her right eyebrow rose in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I get bigger again?\" She asked. Her blueberry body suffered an ever so slight expansion,a random event that made Corrine ever so larger each day. Some days she grew four inches around,while others barely a centimeter. She did know she used to be around six feet in diameter,now she was ten feet two years later. The plant eggheads didn't say when,or if,she stopped growing. And Corrine feared she just keep getting larger and larger forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggggh.\" She moaned out. A knock at the door made her head turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Lane?\" The voice of Nia,her aunt's hired maid,came from behind it. \"Do you need any help at this moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine smacked her lips together before she spoke.</span></div></div>",

It was just to give sound into a silent store. The rainstorm outside with the wind howling was not a comforting sound. So Missy, who got off in about three hours, did her best to occupy herself within the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConverted from a 1830's townhouse, 'The House of the Hill' DVD/Tape store was one of the town's local landmarks.Somehow still being able to bring in more than enough folks to keep the business afloat.Normally very comly, the outside weather made it the darkness of some parts look like the emptiness of space.The interior had become quite foreboding, certain areas had faulty wiring which caused the lights to flicker or caused strange noises to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy occupied herself by reorganizing the basement, where all the old videos were. From DVDs to cassettes to tapes, it always seemed that somebody in town wanted to buy from here. Ironically the deep basement was one of the less terrifying parts of the old house. With actual lights that were still on and a small boombox to hear music on. On her butt, Missy piled together movies into their respective genres before she categorized that into what technology they were made for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this, I may try to do the attic.\" Missy said to herself once more.She then remembered the strange memorabilia up there and decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had come into town a little over a month ago and took her job in the store two days before this point. The brunette with a ponytail was slowly becoming more accustomed to her job though she still found certain peculiarities of the place. For one, she was told never to question the people who came in with gigantic clothing, like coats or skirts or even at one time a wetsuit. The other thing she was told was to never question the contents of the four red box in the basement. Not because it was weird, but because it contained...quite lewd material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy had already saw the cover of one of the videos and she had turned a bright red. So the woman vowed never to do so again unless told. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I think I got the horror section done now lets....wait,what's this?\" Missy spoke. She picked up a blocky tape and looked at the cover. On it was a supermodel looking woman with red lips, red hair,and green eyes. The only conservative part of herself was the oldstyle puritan hat she wore. Everything below was longcoat that flashed a bodysuit that was just three pieces away from becoming a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComedically, the woman wore one of the most determined expression Missy had ever seen on a woman's face. She scratched her head in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van Helsing's Horror Pack\" Missy said. \"Includes:The Fullest Moon,The Blue Lagoon's Deeps, Countess Dracuela, Frakenstein's Wife,Ms Jekyll and Miss.Hyde,The Invisible Woman, Haunting of the Manor,Mummies,and The Phantasm of the Opera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped it around to stare at the back. Images showed scenes from what appeared to be a Hammer film,with its signature grainery appearance of the 1930's to 50's. But a woman so lewdly dressed would probably never fly during those days,so what was this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity getting the better of her,Missy went over to the TV that was placed down in the basement-so that clients could see if their disc or tape still worked-and plopped it inside. She went through all the motions until she eventually saw the opening screen.</span></div></div>",

Almost as if it was a stronger mirror of the outside world, the land of wherever the setting was located was currently going through a deluge.Floods came crashing through the forest's trees. The moon's silver beams were the only lighting in the entire place,though that was soon eclipsed by the shining lights of a carriage's lantern. It's lights pierced the water fog and the shadowed forest it drove through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost there Miss.\" The driver, a deep voiced man, spoke to whomever was the current occupant of the carriage. The horses whined in distress from the rain,yet still they continued onwards. Soon the shot of an old, gothic castle came into view. The carriage was dwarfed by the size. Even with barely any knowledge of architecture, Missy noted how utterly absurd the size was. The entire thing was more of Versailles palace than a gothic stronghold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill it drove through the foreboding gates, inside the courtyard or was it stadium field, were small houses and taverns. Some folks were watching the rain pour down, while others watched their children play in said rain. One or two looked towards the carriage,but none seemed to deem the vehicle any note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it stopped the doors to the carriage slowly creaked open to reveal the titular Van Helsing. Who was still clad in her almost-bikini. Yet this didn't stop her slow strut outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you dear driver.\" She spoke to the man. The torrent seemingly not muting her own voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome Professor,I'll be hitching the horses then.\" He replied.With that, he drove off, leaving the scandalously dressed woman alone.Her attire was so out of place compared to the 18th century peasants, that Missy softly chuckled in response.</span></div></div>",

Missy assumed it was because she was a stranger, but Missy still couldn't help but notice the complete disconnect between the normal 18th century outfits, and Van Helsing's scandalous outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Van Helsing entered what looked like a tavern filled with people. The owner, a burly man with a large beard, only briefly looked up from the bar-top, before returning to cleaning it. Van Helsing walked up to the bar, and sat down. The owner looked up again, and grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll it be, miss?\" The owner asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Information.\" Van Helsing replied. \"I want to know all there is to know about the Countess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the sound in the tavern died as everyone stared at Van Helsing. Some looked afraid, others angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, you want no business with the Countess.\" One of the bar patrons said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and why is that?\" Van Helsing asked. She was met with silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, lady.\" The bar owner said. \"The Countess is not a person to trifle with. No one in the village dare go near her castle. If ye really want to go to her, though, take this.\" He then pulled out a wooden stake from behind the counter. \"A stake of Hawthorn wood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing looked at the stake, before taking it. She simply nodded before leaving the tavern. She then opened her longcoat and put the stake in a pouch next to three others of the same kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart girl.\" Missy muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene then faded into the entrance of the castle.

A creak of the iron doors made Van Helsing step back a little. A small, round and cute face peaked from the crack. Brunette hair tied into a neat bun with a general demeanor of joyful service. The personality one got if they'd served someone for many years without barely a peep of disagreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who might you be?\" The servant politely inquired. Van Helsing coughed and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van Helsing. Professor Sarah Van Helsing; PhD and all the other alphabets in the English language. I'm here to see your mistress, there has been rumors of a dark force on your lands. May I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small brunette looked at Sarah for a moment before she nodded and smiled. She pushed the door open, which was surprising given how heavy it looked,so the Dutch woman could go inside.Van Helsing stepped in,around the front area of the castle were fifteen or so people speaking with one another. Elsewhere she could hear the faint echoes of a more...rambunctious party going on in the castle. Whether it was from the east of her or the west, Van Helsing could not say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady's annual party.\" The brunette stated. \"She loves to host events that run the line between scandalous and formal,almost like a reflection of herself.I almost forgot:R.M Renfield at your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenfield bowed to Van Helsing, who nodded in turn. She scanned the area to see the figures around her, the professor saw how different yet unified they were all dressed. They wore masks of animals, though they seem to stop at around seven different beasts. Those being:the cow, the raven, the goat,the lion, the pig,the mule,and the boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guests clothes also seemed to be quite chaotic, but if one looked a little closer, could see a unifying color scheme. Pieces of red,yellow,green,purple,blue,brown,or orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting concept.\" Van Helsing noted. Renfield puckered her lips in thought until she realized what Van Helsing was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes,each of those animals and colors are references to the mortal sins that men can enact.The front area of this abode is a lobby for rest. The rest of the wings are devoted towards the pleasures that each sin carries,all except my lady's tower that is, though some do get to explore it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And hopefully you'll shall see it too Ms.Van Helsing.\" A voice said. Van Helsing turned to her left and saw what was quite possibly the most ridiculous thing she had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy stared open mouth at the incoming figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was ethereal beauty with raven hair done short, yet alluring. Her skin was pale to the point where in some of the lighting she seemed almost blue. Her face had just the right amount of exoctisicm where one could only tell she came from the eurasian connected continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet these weren't her most eyecatching pieces, instead both Van Helsing and Missy were drawn towards the count's bulbous breasts. They were practically stuffed into a little black dress, which would've been quite beautiful on the woman, if she didn't possess her pair of bazongas. They covered her entire upper chest and reached almost as wide as her shoulders. Gold trimmings were located around her cleavage as though they weren't noticeable enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Countess Draculei.\" Renfield spoke in a hasty tone and bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings my fair servant, come help me guide Ms.Van Helsing here towards a much more...lively area. I feel as though some merriment would be needed in our coming talks.\" Draculei replied. Van Helsing still stared bug-eyed at the large boob woman.</span></div></div>",

But those were out of the corner of her eye, since Van Helsing couldn't seem to take her eyes of the Countess's bulbous bust. It jiggled and swayed with each step the Countess took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the three arrived at a large green room, filled with trinkets from other countries. Van Helsing assumed this was the Envy room. Renfield stood by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraculei moved to a large green couch and sat down, her bust resting neatly in her lap. She motioned for Van Helsing to join her, which the professor did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, to what do I owe the honor of the great Sarah Van Helsing visiting my home?\" Draculei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard tell that this land is besieged by creatures of darkness.\" Van Helsing answered. \"Ghouls and demons attacking the townsfolk. I would like to offer my services to rid this land of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy rolled her eyes as she watched the scene unfold. It was obvious Draculei was one of those creatures. She just wanted to scream at the screen and warn her, but she knew it'd be no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. I've heard those rumors.\" Draculei replied. \"It is quite ghastly what's been happening. I'll gladly take your services. I'll see to it you have a room here to deal with these... creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Van Helsing replied, eyes still glued to the Countess's massive bust. The Countess noticed this and chuckled.<br>\r\n\"They are quite marvelous, aren't they?\" Draculei said, hefting up her bust. \"They began growing some time ago. I must admit, I simply adore them. They are quite soft to the touch. Would you like to feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, it seemed like Van Helsing would take the offer, but she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you. I should retire for the evening. If I am to rid your home of these creatures, I need to be well rested.\" Van Helsing said. The Countess seemed somewhat sad at her offer being turned down, but dismissed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall have Renfield take you to a room.\" Draculei said, before motioning for Renfield to do just that.

Now that she thought of it, where was Van Helsing's travel bag?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, Van Helsing walked out of her room. All across the hallways were strung out guests with gaping mouths with dribbling wine. Van Helsing grimaced at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't mind the guests, they'll be out partying once more.\" A woman who appeared to be more comly dressed than the animal wearers spoke. Van Helsing's eyebrow raised up. The woman was a mirror of Draculei, in terms of body proportions. Her bust wasn't as monstrous as her mistress,but they passed the realm of normal possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alina at your service.\" She bowed which gave ample view of her cleavage. Van Helsing nodded in acknowledgement.The busty woman gently held her hand out to guide Van Helsing out of the cramped corridors. The two soon stepped into the red room of wrath. What appeared to be a cockfighting ring was placed gently in the corner, while on the other side was a ring for bare knuckle brawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for your accommodations, all the other wings were booked\" Alina spoke. Van Helsing ruffled her hat for a bit as it smacked against a random hand stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, I am just thankful your mistress has given me temporary shelter.\"Van Helsing responded.The two slowly made their way out from the red room and crossed into a corridor,though all the curtains were up,which made Van Helsing look at Alina for an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning hangovers.\" was all she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then walked right and passed an ornate door to be greeted by a small garden. It was surprisingly humble for the large castle-mansion, until Van Helsing realized that it was just another thematic area of Draculei's dwelling. If she had to guess, there were six other gardens just like this.With a pop, Van Helsing looked over to see Alina with a large parasol blocking the sun from her. How she got a parasol so fast, when the professor knew she didn't have one before, Van Helsing didn't bother to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Alina!\" Draculei called out. \"And good morning to you Van Helsing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gargantuan parasol blocked the sunlight from Draculei. Still the size strained to cover the well endowed woman, any bigger and it would too cumbersome to be moved at all. The mistress of the castle sat in a chair while Renfield served water to some other lounging guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a tour of my home to see any kinks in my defenses?\" The countess spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gruff 'yes', Van Helsing walked forth towards the countess.  Alina followed behind with some frugal steps under the sun.</span></div></div>",

That was something Van Helsing certainly noticed. They had just left a garden with hedges and statures depicting a fierce battle, which Van Helsing guessed was Wrath, and they were now entering a garden with statues of beautiful women of various body shapes in provocative poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm to assume this is Lust?\" Van Helsing asked, keeping her eyes on the garden itself. She knew that if she looked at Draculei, she'd never take her eyes of the Countess's enormous bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Of all the sins, Lust is my personal favorite.\" Draculei answered. \"Beauty is something I quite value, and a sin represent that fits me quite well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing did not reply to that. She simply continued to look at the garden. She noticed several servants milling about, but they all seemed... odd. The male servants were quiet and emotionless, while the female servants all seemed more lively. What's more, the female servants all were buxom as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle tour took the three into a library. It was enormous, and filled with books from various countries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've traveled quite a bit, and have amassed a rather impressive collection of tomes. Perhaps they could be useful in your... work here.\" Draculei said. There was silence for a moment, before Draculei suddenly moved in front of Van Helsing. Once she did, Van Helsing's eyes instantly fell on Draculei's bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies. I actually quite enjoy the attention my chest gets.\" Draculei said. \"Alina, you may go. I wish to speak with Van Helsing in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina nodded, before turning and leaving the library.</span></div></div>",

She was suitably impressed by the countess' efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your family help in collecting all of these artefacts? This seems like several lifetimes worth, even I can't believe you filled these hallways by yourself.\" Van Helsing spoke. Draculei gave the hunter a small smile at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that,now come, let's see if I have anything for you to look upon.\" The pale beauty said. \"Besides myself of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing nodded,and with some enthusiasm, walked forth into the vast library. With some interest she could see a few guests studying the tomes here. They had the heads of ravens with yellow patterns, ribbons,and other accoutrements on their person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrmm. Guests from the greed wing.\" Draculei whispered. A few woman worked with these guests, almost as if they were scholars in a academic stronghold. One woman though stood out amongst them. She had a great large bust, more grapefruit shaped than the other bosom filled women. In size she was smaller than both Draculei and Alina, though no lest supernaturally busty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solveig, hello dear.\" Draculei said to the woman. \"What guest do we have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lord Beaumont. A Frenchman I believe.\" Solveig spoke with a hint of a Norse accent upon her tongue.The lord did not wear a raven's head but instead a completely yellow robe like a Grecian. He seemed too entranced by his book to recognize the mistress of the manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm. Tell the poor fellow you'll be out for a bit.\" Draculei stated. Solveig nodded and talked to the man besides her. He waved her off and so Solveig got up to attend to her lady's need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My servant Solveig meet Van Helsing,Van Helsing meet Solveig.\" Draculei stated. The two exchanged pleasantries.\"Van Helsing please let my servant help in your search. I need to find a better dress for myself. I'll still be around here, so just give me a small ring of the bell and I'll come and meet you two once more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Draculei walked off leaving the two behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does she mean she'll be around here?\" Van Helsing spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there are many compartments around the library which allows men and women to quickly undress themselves and call upon   different clothing.That and for some nice peace and quiet if they so choose.\" Solveig said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't they have enough peace here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be surprised how many folk want to please themselves in more private offices. Especially since this library has the largest horde of erotic fiction in Europe or at least the top ten.\"Solveig said with some pride which made Van Helsing look upon her with shock. \"Now come then, let's find your books.\"</span></div></div>",

The two made their way through the erotic literature section (which was utterly massive), and entered a section dedicated to creatures and monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are.\" Solveig said. \"I hope that you will find something here that will be of assistance to your work. If you have any questions, you may ask me or any of the other servants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one thing I wish to understand.\" Van Helsing said. \"I've noticed that many of the women here are exceptionally buxom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes.\" Solveig replied. \"The mistress has very... particular tastes, as it were. To her, large breasts are the epitome of beauty. Anything less the head sized is unacceptable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how exactly did these women become so buxom?\" Van Helsing asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that is my personal secret.\" The voice of Draculei answered. Van Helsing turned to see the Countess, now clad in a tight purple dress that reached the floor, hiding her feet. Her prodigious bosom was still on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Van Helsing said, once again unable to remove her eyes from Draculei's bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to make sure you located the books you need.\" Draculei said. \"I've informed my servants that you are to be given free reign of the manor for your job here. I must, however, say one thing: the east tower is my personal quarters, and unless I invite you there, you are to not enter it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy scoffed as she watched the scene unfold. That was incredibly supicious, so Van Helsing would have to pick up on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable.\" Van Helsing replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Now, I have other matters to attend to. Please enjoy the library. And though I understand your work, I do suggest something from my erotic section.

The professor prodded around the section as she searched for her required texts. To her surprise Draculei's selection about the local area comprised a total of over twenty different books to Van Helsing's guess. She licked her lips for a moment and brought out three of them. With a swift tuck under her arm, the professor had chosen her first few objects of study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be off Solveig.\" Van Helsing said. \"Tell your master I'll be in my room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Solveig stated, with a bow that jiggled breast meat, the woman waved Van Helsing away. The professor stalked out of the hallway and moved back towards her room. Her pace was somewhere between a run and a walk, so in essence, a speed walk.It seemed though the professor had taken a wrong turn as her eyes looked around to find herself within a blue room. Bottles of wine and rubber were placed haphazardly around the room. Men and women wore blue pieces or had cow head's placed upon their crowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman dance on a table and Van Helsing's eyes widened in surprise.She wore the most provocative clothing ever, so much so it would've been less scandalous if she was nude. The general material of it was silk. Even Missy with her modern tastes blushed in embarrassment. In a time where showing ankles was considered sensual, this piece went above and beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the only thing, her breasts were enormous.They eclipsed Alina's and Solveig by a wide margin, with only the countess beating the woman out. It must've been painful for her to move this much, yet the ginormous bust woman still danced away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's with this movie and boobs.\"</i> Missy blushed while she pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi Lads and lassies, Ole' Magdalene is going to do another jig.\" Magdalene,evidently, declared. With a gentle rumpshack, she did an crotch thrust and began another dance. Van Helsing huffed before she moved out from the den of carnal pleasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back into another hallway, Van Helsing did her best to formulate a way back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" A voice coughed behind her. The Dutch woman turned her head to spy a woman in what appeared to be a Polish styled men's clothing. It didn't quite fit into it well do to the woman's prodigious bust;Van Helsing's best estimates placed her between Alina and Solveig in size. Unlike the two of them the woman seemed to want to make her breasts seem smaller than they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Dagmara.\" The woman stated, her brown hair cut short yet feminine.There was a certain tone in her voice though, much more colder than the other two servants were. \"How may I assist you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I would like to be taken back to my room, I have books you see.\" Van Helsing stated. Dagmara raised an eyebrow but continued on. She asked for Van Helsing's wing,and once answered, barely took a second before she took the professor's hand. With great strides the two shot off until eventually they both arrived back at Van Helsing's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank-\" Van Helsing looked around but didn't see a trace of the Polish woman.</span></div></div>",

It seemed the area, the Carpathian Mountains, were once under the rule of another noble, a count. But he had perished at some point, and the manor came into the ownership of Countess Draculei. Though oddly, Draculei's own history seemed missing from the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing also read that the area was a breeding ground for vampires, attacking livestock to keep themselves feed on blood. With this confirmation, Van Helsing closed the book, and grabbed the next book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes turned into hours as Van Helsing read everything in the three books. It was well into the night, and Van Helsing decided it was time to start looking around the manor, to make sure no monsters attacked the people within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her room, she began walking the halls of the manor. She could still hear the sounds of partying going on in the various rooms. She decided that if they were still partying, they must have been safe, so she ignored the rooms and went out into the night.</span></div></div>",

There was the feeling however that the partying would soon subside as the hour grew longer. Van Helsing didn't care much though for this display of human thirst for blood when there was more supernatural thirst still abound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready having visited the lust room, Van Helsing decided she wanted to see some other places in the manor. It being so big, her walk down the hallways felt like they took forever. Missy swore she saw a loop just to make the travel feel even longer than needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much more of this movie is there?\" She questioned. The real life woman picked up the remote to see she was only an hour and twelve minutes in. With only another hour and thirty minutes to go. She paused the video and went up to the store to get some snacks she knew the owner left behind. Outside the storm continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut let's not concern ourselves with her.Back in Van Helsing's timeframe, the professor moved her way until she neared the sloth room. There men and women in pieces of orange with mule masks and insignias walked lazily among each other. The faint smell of hashish and narcotics could be divined through the air. Van Helsing closed her mouth and nose and quickly moved out into its garden, which was by far the largest she could see. It dwarfed the wrath and lust room in size as though it was declaring \"can you walk end to end of my quarters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing saw in one corner three ladies of unnatural paleness to their skin.One had pale-blonde to her locks, another raven,and one startling white.With the signature bosm filled bodies of the countess' court, Van Helsing wouldn't mind them that much. If not for the fact that the white-haired one seemed to be intent to lay on top of two comfortable looking cushions. Which the other two didn't want to sit on themselves and in fact drove away any drugged out guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing walked casually over to them to listen in on their conversation. she sat down onto an unoccupied cushion near the trio and did her best to appear wanting for some hemp or opium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you stayed out that long in the sun, could you believe your punishment if you got any bigger than you did? What the master would've thought? You're lucky you shrunk down to this size.\" One of the two women spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for my carelessness, my sisters, I seemed that the drugs took quite a hold of me as well as my prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite right. Hopefully by another hour you'll get even smaller, until then we'll have to keep a watch on any of the prey who thinks you'll make a good cushion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Prey? I dare think I've found my beast,or in this case,beasts</i> Van Helsing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finding everything alright lass?\" A voice declared. Van Helsing looked up to see two twin spheres eclipsed her view. The wobbled back to reveal the smiling face of Magdalene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite alright,just listening in on the nights wing.\" Van Helsing did her best not to stare at the three, yet it seemed that Magdalene had a keen sense of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi yeah those three over there, oof, troublemakers they are. Yet they do their jobs well.\" The Irishwoman stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And may in fact be creatures of the night.\"</i> Van Helsing thought once more. </span></div></div>",

The gasping water released ghastly sounds.It set the mood quite well, plus the sound of a wolf howling didn't do much to diminish the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe traveler looked upward towards the moon and revealed itself to be the scantily clad Van Helsing. Her eyes dark with a fierce intelligence, though again, in her pseudo-bikini she wasn't that intimidating. With a bleak blink at the camera, Van Helsing charged passed the bog with her horse. In the background the sounds of wolves grew more and more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a snarl crashed into the scene and the speeding shape of a dark beast came rushing out of the thicket behind the bog. Van Helsing,with hawk-like reflexes, threw a dagger at the form. A yelp of a dog echoed before the dark shape rushed back into the overgrowth. Now that she thought of though, Missy wondered what wolves were doing so near a bog. Unless they do live near bogs, in which that case, nevermind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing, meanwhile, didn't seem to contemplate the ecology of wolves. She edged her horse further along the path in an effort to create more distance between her and the pack. A thunder of growls filled the area behind Van Helsing as she rode forth. She soon caught eye of a blinking torch, which made Van Helsing smile in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that mood was soon broken by the sound of the wolves behind her. She cried out in desperation while her horse breathed heavily. The light soon materialized larger and Van Helsing could see the small township in front of her. With a hearty crie,she pushed her stallion to the limits until it passed the torch and ended up in the middle of town. Just as fast, Van Helsing turned around with her saber to slice through any canine attacker. None came though, through deduction of their paw patterns that Van Helsing saw,the professor could see how their steps looked as though they retreated. It was as if something scared them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need to keep tabs on that situation.\" Van Helsing mused to herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once the boat breached on the sandy shore, Van Helsing was gently brought down by the scientist looking fellow. The duo were soon followed by a mix of men in women, which swelled the pair into a group of seven. The group walked across the sand, the jungle sounds echoed in the shade caused by the canopy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they arrived at a camp half-way destroyed. Tents laid wrecked with pieces of broken canoes embedded in some of them.Twelve or so men laid bandaged and moaning. Four nurses worked vigorously to keep them in fair conditions. A burly looking man sat on top of a barrel. Evidence of heavy drinking was scattered around his impromptu seat. He gave the group a hardy wave of acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, you must be th-\" his words were suddenly stopped by a hiccup.\"The problem solver our foreman hired.James Morris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr.Van Helsing.\" said woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing shook the man's hand and introduced the male scientist as Dr.Maia. A few exchanges of words came from between the trio before they came to the main problem. Around them, the two groups of the uninjured workers and the boat people helped one another out.With the campsite workers going down to the boat to unhook cargo while the boat folk checked on the wounds of the bandaged people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see the effects of whatever attacked us, now how can you help find the cause?\" James questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the first thing I have to do James is see what this beast is.\" Van Helsing asked. \"Now can you describe the beast on the night it attacked you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beasts\" James stressed. \"<i>Plural.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was more than one?\" Dr.Maia questioned. James nodded and proceeded to explain what had happened for the last week or so.One worker named Yuri had spotted the largest creature he had ever seen.'So huge it could eat a man whole' he described it. Curiosity getting the better of some of the men, they walked to shore only to be greeted by a smaller beast that was still a foot taller than the tallest worker they had on duty. It thoroughly thrashed all the men there and left soon after. The next time, the men decided to try and trap the larger monster. With carefully placed fishing nets at each point in the river that was large enough to allow such a big beast in, they waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I swear on God's name, we caught that blubbery beast!\" Jame declared.Yet once they canoed out to drag it back to camp,the second beast had somehow allowed the fatter one out. They were of course attacked, and while deadly on land, the water monster proved much more of a combatant in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith three men heavily busted up in the tryst, they had miraculously canoed back to camp and ran towards dryer land. But they were followed, the smaller beast grabbed ahold of the vacant canoes. It launched them like cruise missiles and landed into multiple tents with the shrapnel hitting many more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which has now left us in this current predicament.\" James finished.\"It has only come back three time since then, but thankfully it only injured one or two men per appearance. Lucky me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVan Helsing rubbed her chin in thought once James' tale had been spoken.</span></div></div>",

She decided the best place to start was near the water's edge, so she made her way back to the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached the bank of the river, she began looking around to see if she could find a clue. Almost immediately, she did see something: a set of footprints. Two in fact. One seemed to be leaving the water, the other entering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Van Helsing kneeled down to look at them, she noticed that the prints out of the water were deeper in the ground then the ones entering it. She started to assume that it was the heavier creature, until she noticed that both sets of prints looked exactly the same, minus how deep they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she recalled the description of the two creatures given to her, she thought of pufferfish, and how they can inflate to ward of predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps the two creatures are actually the same creature, but able to inflate.\" Van Helsing mused. \"But why would the creature attack the camp, I wonder.\"</span></div></div>",

The woman did wonder why such a show would have such a kiddish opening when it was,at least, a teen rating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate that they I can't just use the internet to look clips up.\" Missy spoke aloud. The show,which did syndicate around the country,for some odd reason didn't have the full series online. It ended on episode twelve on season two. And Missy,who was both a resident of the town and a frequent traveler across the country,never seemed to encounter anyone with a smidge of thought about the rest of the series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" She would tell these people. \"It ran for ten seasons! Hour long each. There must be some clips of these episodes online!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I know the show exist but I don't think there's an extra eight seasons of it. The SFX must've cost a fortune as well as those hot broads in it.\" One particular conversationalist responded. Missy frequently huffed at that,but it seemed that anybody outside the town never saw the last eight seasons.She even tried to find a copy of the entire set online,to her surprise,there wasn't one made. There were wiki pages of the show,but just like before,it only talked about seasons one and two.Missy did her best to capture the footage on TV but that endeavor proved to be fruitless. Only seasons one and two seemed to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman thought she had gone mad until she stumbled across a large pile of the copies at her job. Stuck under a copy of some halloween films,Missy asked her boss to take one home. Mrs.Kazinski,the kind old lady,graciously allowed her the prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did every source I could find said you weren't made.\" Missy spoke to her copy while she drove home. Over the weakened she binged the series rapaciously. She had five discs,each one with two seasons on it. Finished with her first, she placed in the second disc.Scared she wouldn't see anything, Missy was surprised that the contents of the disc were true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a third season! And the first four episodes covered all the second season's loose plot threads. With the fourth episode ending on the defeat of the group's main antagonist, Alexi Lancaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, then what was the rest of the series about?\" Missy asked when she finished. Feeling a little empty, she made a bag of popcorn and waited for the fifth episode to play,which is where we left off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the familiar title screen play, pure late 90's to early 2000's sensibilities showed. Edgy designs and sensual dances from the main girls showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it faded to black,two figures stood in the familiar cavern lair of The Might Alliance. They seemed to be in a heated argument. Missy quickly recognized who she saw.</span></div></div>",

Her helmet,a mix between a spartan's helmet and a knight's faceplate,was placed neatly on her gigantic crescent shape. Her face,a stoic mask of watchfulness,did its best to watch ever corner of the screens. Her right index finger tapped the crescent with rapt attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were watching every single drone,news feed,and link to confirm one thing. One obsessive thing that Sentinel felt took years from her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dead Alexi, you're dead.\" She mumbled. It had been three days since the defeat of her ever present phantom. The one who had killed her sister,and her aunt,was finally gone. Their reach across the state was slowly crumbling. Whatever heirs to Alexi's legacy were doing their best to keep the corpse alive. A small part of her gleefully thought of those foes hounded by the hands of law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at her door caused her to jump a little in shock. She turned to see the clam eye,and almost ethereal,beauty that was Power.<br>\r\nHer face always seemed half-way asleep,which gave her a gentle aura around her. Even though Sentinel knew Power could easily knock down a building with one single punch using only her shockwaves.Sentinel among the top ten people in the world who could possibly defeat her. And even then Sentinel didn't know if she would make it out in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with all that, Power wasn't in anyway frightening. She was just too calming to be around that the thought she could hurt a fly would've been absurd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sentinel?\" Her melodious whispery voice spoke. \"I could feel you in the next room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSentinel also noted that the woman was an empath due to her lineage from a long dead alien colony species. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Flight,empathic understanding,super strength and inviability, near unquenchable stamina,and temporary energy constructs. Damn I wish you were just a little more aggressive.\" </i>Sentinel bemoaned. The waif,well she wasn't that thin,mostly did her best to never truly unleash her,well,power. Instead acting as a pacifistic negotiner until shit truly hit the fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm fine Power. I just feel like a weight had been lifted from my back. I just, I don't feel right though.\" Sentinel explained. \"I wanted to see Alexi's face once I got them good in my gigantic hands. I wanted to wring him dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower floated over to her leader,and first friend,with a open hand. She sat down on Sentinel's grey crescent shaped desk. The alien ubermensch,the prime result of over thirty species,waited besides her friend. Sentinel gave a choke of anger while she was calmed by Power's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gone Shelly.\" Power quietly spoke. Sentinel reacted to her real name and choked out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but...but.\" Sentinel unconsciously grew a foot,while unknown to her the heroine's bottom blimped. Power,not knowing that, used a smidge of her own strength to give the grown woman a squeeze. Her chest tingled,but Power didn't feel anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want some dinner?\" Power asked. Sentinel nodded and the duo walked out of the monitor room,unaware to their 'minuscule' changes.</span></div></div>",

The African-American hero was completely absorbed in her work at the moment. Her light-blue bodysuit was covered in grease from the previous things she had been working on. Her black-and-yellow hair was done up in a bun to keep it out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked, she didn't hear the door to the lab open. Strangely, though, there seemed to be no one entering.

Standing behind Generator was Fade. The Japanese-American stopped laughing and wiped some tears from her eyes. She was wearing a grey bodysuit and a pair of goggles. She kept her black hair long. Unknown to Fade, there was a bit of pudge on her otherwise slim frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I just wanted to get your attention.\" Fade said. \"Everyone's still worked up over Alexi's death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.

Just usual, run-of-the-mill lunatics.\" Fade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenerator sighed as she siphoned some electricity from a nearby outlet, not noticing her belly swell slightly.

I still surprised that Makai Corps didn't run them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Japanese woman did a few mock kicks to indicate what she wanted to do with those men. Her small paunch and plump thighs jiggled a little. Generator didn't notice the fact while she readied her own body. She did some stretches to work out her kinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, going to go to Northernwood to investigate this case involving a lost robotic turtle.\" Generator spoke as though that was normal. \"So if you want to look into that as well, I would be happy for you to tag along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nerdy turtles aren't for me,Gen. You can ask Thatway or Bluey for that.\" Fade said. Generator nodded at her teammate's response. The duo then walked out the lab's door and down the corridors of their base. They soon arrived into a garage of epic proportions,though Missy swore that it was CGI in the background. It was probably a set for the foreground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFade got on a skateboard,because apparently the writer/producers loved ninety's edge,with a small jump. The board flipped in the air right until Fade came down onto it with a loud thud.Either they used a stunt actress,CGI,or Fade's actress was actually that good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenerator,meanwhile,seemed to prepare herself. She huffed in a few gulps of air. The heroine pointed down, a flash of electrical power came from her hands. It raised her in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy was quite surprised by the show's CGI, it still looked realistic even when compared to current year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenerator shot off,while Fade followed behind. The duo travled out from their cavern while the city loomed in front of them. After ten minutes of banter,which Missy cringed at, ninety's banter man,the two split up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFade,on her skateboard mind you,made her way to the Eastend. A place that seemed to be in disrepair with its derelict buildings and rot. Fade looked around,took a small huff, and folded her board in half. It was half its size,Fade seemed to hold it like a shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it 24th and Main or 24th and Mulberry?\" Fade said. She tried to remember where the rumors were located. \"This is Eastend I'll probably find an unrelated crime occurring even If I can't find my gangsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Fade continued onwards into the rundown locale. Her aimless walk soon bore fruit though, her goggles which had an X-ray function could see three shady looking guys inside of a warehouse. Generator's algorithm made quick work identifying who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John The Hammer, Lawrence Ballikai, and Bruno Giovana.\" Fade spoke. She turned invisible. With that she walked into the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene soon switched to show the other members doing their own thing until it shot right back to Fade. Missy watched Fade with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something different about her?\" She asked.</span></div></div>",

White cabinets mixed with blue highlights,such as the carpet and small chandelier,gave the room a winter vibe. Heiress to the Caesar Family, Blue Ice had grown up surrounded by expensive things. Though that soon changed when Alexi had come, only her brother and her were spared. With every single resource she could gather, the broken heiress searched long and hard for some power source. Finally received her powers from an experimental mutagen,with these new abilities, Blue Ice could gain revenge on the person who killed her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich then resulted in her own humiliating defeat,though soon after she met the women who would one day bring down Alexi.Now,three days later, Blue Ic-no Sarah Caesar was left adrift.True she still wished to be a hero,but what about her civilian life?

The duo's breasts were the large spheres of boob flesh that it would take more than four hands to completely cover just one tit. The couple didn't mind how small their space was though, it made their nightly escapades much easier. Although they did knock each other off the bed in one case of rough foreplay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its six Misty.\" Cecelia chimed from the bed with a groan. Misty did a small wave, her hoodie soaked with sweat as well as her bust. The two things created a small river of water between themselves. Held together by a special bind, Misty's breasts were packed as close as possible. With a quick tug at her sides, Misty's angled her face away from her bosom so she wouldn't be hit by the slight recoil her breasts did when they were released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep telling you this is the best time for me. No one can see me run around.\" Misty replied. Her breaths caused her breasts to briefly expand larger before they shrunk back down. \"Getting ready for that little convention being held.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need to get ready, its not like a competition or anything. All you have to do is blab and not perv yourself in front of everybody.\" Cecelia groggily stated. Misty smiled to her girlfriend and waltzed over with her great big bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perv myself like this?\" She asked. The Chinese woman laid her bust across the smaller, yet still large boob, woman on the bed.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nAt another part of town one woman flex her body as best as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold.Holddd!\" Lana screamed out. Her tree-trunk thighs and calves did their best to keep in the air. Her hips strained because of how much pressure she was putting on them. Her foot was pointed like an arrow to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked like plush fat that could easily be used as pillows, but Lana knew that their was muscle strong enough to crush watermelons in her legs. Unfortuantley,she wanted her old flexibility back,not these ridiculous things she had now.The former dancer gasped in relief and in frustration as her balance was lost and she was dumped onto her bum. Which itself had grown a little larger yet was dwarfed by her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God darnit.\" She laughed out. The fat thigh woman had come somewhat to terms with her changed body. Still she wanted those old dance moves she could do when she was smaller. The woman laid down for a few more moments and then pushed herself upwards to get a drink from her small fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce one of the world's most famous dancers, or at least in the top thirty, Lana had since laid out of public sight. Her swollen thighs,monster calves,and earthquake hips not being something she was proud of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The convention is soon and I want to look at least capable of what I could do before.\" The woman mumbled while she drank from her bottle of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The university is considered the highest class of the entire region, while the town is considered the most perfect blend of cool forests and calm river beaches. With a population of over two-hundred thousand, and with a rising populace to boot, it seems that town's popularity is ever on the rise. But there have been some concerns with the town's populace. Like how two-thirds of anybody ages seventeen to thirty-two have suffered some <i>minor</i> physical mishaps. Maybe its something in the water, or the air, maybe its the science building acting up, or maybe its that old chemical plant leaking into the fields.
