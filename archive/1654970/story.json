Then I waddled to the bathroom to do my business and a few minutes later I was out of the bathroom with my housecoat.  As I waddle to my kitchen, I couldn't stop my mouth watering for some chocolate cover ice cream pickles flavor hot drink(Coffee in our world).  As I open my fridge I notice I ran out of c.c.i.c.p.f.h.d.(it a mouth full huh?).  So I desired the real thing and grab a bowl of chocolate cover ice cream pickles and waddle to the table and started to eat it like a pregnant woman eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen my roommate came waddling over to the table and drinking the last c.c.i.c.p.f.h.d. and smile while I have chocolate on my mouth and pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mike like that drink?  You know that was mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.  I forgot that this drink was yours and you notice that I'm pregnant with quints.\"  Then he pointed his belly, that when I notice that he was licking his lips like he was In the mood again.  Then he waddle to me and started to lick the chocolate off my belly and I felt he was making love to me like last night.  Then he stop and he turn on the news, I was bum out of having fun with my breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the news said the mayor Victoria Rockwell had expanded a new law making male pregnancy workout unsegregated so they can join woman pregnancy workout.  The Babies-maker warriors won the last night pregoball game by winning 12 points.  No new birth entered the hospital for a month now.  That when I turn the news off.  Then it was time to go out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got dress and waddle to the elevator and then my next door neighbor Mitchel Boom who was waddle into the elevator in her police uniform.  She was in a hurry and she told me there a code 12 outside our apparent doors.  I look confused then she told me that someone in labor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I saw a ambulance outside the door pulling 2 pregnant woman in the back doors and driving off.  Then Mitchel new partner ask me who I am?  I reply....</span></div></div>",

You can call me Dara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" and I'm Jessica jenkins, call me jinx, four months pregnant with twelve babies and I'm happy to start to waddle and be as big as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so, what's a number twelve about? I thought paramedics could handle birth alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"they can when they don't have too big weights to lift, last one was pregnant with 17 babies, think about how heavy she was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" a new guiness record for our town as I can see, we have one of a breeding town! So that's why she was allowed in hospital without having to wait for a month to birth. Isn't it great that doctors have to prescribe drugs to pregnant people about to deliver in their ninth month to delay it until their appointment, personnally, I love to think I'll birth when they tell me to with mike to help me through, I would be able to live with a baby stuck between my legs, unable to get outI...\" I finished with an evilish smile \" and, birthing home can be soooooo dangerous with nine babies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will birth the babies when the OB/GYN will tell me to, not earlier but maybe later...\" Mitchel said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"me too...\" jessica said \" it was nice to meet you, Dara!\" she said as the elevator reached her level<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"for me too, if you feel like it, we could meet after your shift and...

Those pills are the only things that stop both men and woman from going into labor until you have a appointment with the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won last night pregoball again, if you keep that up you can get us the Golden Belly Cup.\"  Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea.  It can't hurt to have a 9 feet babies making belly that is also a wall for the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they laught of that because I'm the only guy in the entire pregoball league.  Then I notice that I have to go to the pregoball league head office down town.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get a ride with you to the pregoball HQ.  I sigh your bellies for you for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth officers look at each other and both answer \"Take me to dinner and it's yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I take both of you to dinner tonight.
