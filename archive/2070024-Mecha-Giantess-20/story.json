The U.S. Government wanted to build a new weapon that can tip the wars in their favor if they have any, but then a girl known as Asuki, who is the daughter of the US General came up with an idea to create a giant robot that can adapt appearances and is fit with the most advanced weapon systems in the world. They liked the idea so much, that they begin designing it, however soon a criminal activity in the New York City took the life of Asuki. She was killed when she noticed a robbery and attempted to call police. Her dad wanted to save her life, so what he did is that he took her mind and put it in a chip with a few adjustments, and insert the chip inside the robot. Asuki was reborn into a giant robot form of herself. At first she was scared of her new found height and powers, and even the bikini only appearance as it revealed too much of her, but soon she got used to it. She then started to love her new self. She is a good and kind friend, but also really shy and reserved. A lot of fans of her love her, and she loves them back, but she feels that there is something missing in her new life as a Mecha-kaiju!

She stood 5'4 had b-cup breasts, went to school daily, studied hard, hung out with her friends, there was really nothing special. That is until one day Asuki had an accident. While rushing to school on a Monday morning Asuki ran to the train station, she was going to miss her train to school if she didn't make it in time. Not watching where she was going however Asuki tripped and fell onto the tracks being killed by the train...or so it would have been. With her remains originally being shipped to her family, somehow, unknown to Asuki her brain and spinal cord not only remained intact but had not been implanted into her new form. It felt, pretty cool actually to Asuki to be this massive and powerful being, despite being a combat mech. It was also odd too but she got used to it. To her it was like an anime and this did prove to her that Japan loved their giant robots. But now she wasn't just here for Japan, she was here for the world. And while she knew she couldn't save EVERYONE. She'd sure try.</span></div></div>",

She had to live inside her massive mansion for all of her life and never got to go outside. Thanks to her parents being rich, she has everything she ever wanted, but all she wants to do is go outside one day and make a friend, and not having to be homeschooled all the time and alone. When her parents go out for several months for their work with little time to talk or hang out with their daughter, the couple decided to create a giant robot using state of the art technology that would act as Haruka's protector, nanny, friend, etc. Soon came born Leumya, the Protection Bot. Her parents introduced her as if she would be her nanny during those months, but little did Haruka know that this was a robot that her parents made for her so she wouldn't be lonely all the time. Also, it's big, powerful, and well.... Good looking. At first Haruka was totally stunned and surprised, and a bit afraid thanks to Leumya being a giant robot and being able to have her own personality and such but, let's get onto the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka Silverton: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/sarugetchu/images/5/51/Helga.png/revision/latest?cb=20130228064012\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/saru...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanna do her, or do you wanna make your own characters?</span></div></div>",

The filter kept the air out allowing her to breath. She already hated today, the mask itself reminded her that she was a freak. That she'd never be loved, etc. This was often her mindset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Mistress.\" She heard Leumya's voice in her head. Leumya was outside sitting on her knees. Haruka could see her from the window. Leumya was always so bright and cheerful. Then again perhaps that was just her programming. The two had a mental link established between them due to a chip inside Haruka's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning...\" Haruka mumbled softly. Leumya smiled. She knew her mistress was depressed but she had an idea. After breakfast which was fed through a tube Haruka went over to Leumya's controls. \"I hope you don't mind me taking control...\" Leumya didn't have a choice but Haruka considered Leumya to be her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not M'lady but...\" She now had a massive grin. \"Why look through the monitor on your desk when you can see through my eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...don't I already do that? I have a first person view here.\" Haruka was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no M'lady you misunderstand.\" Leumya stood up as her white qi pao fulttered in the soft breeze as her black heels dug into the ground. \"You'll have to trust me on this however...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka rarely trusted anyone due to being seen as a freak. But Leumya...she felt somewhat comfortible with, despite being afraid. Leumya held out her hand as the wall opened up to allow her hand to fit inside the room.</span></div></div>",

After all. I was programmed with that remote control. I have however destroyed that too. I do not want anyone taking over us both. Try it out M'lady.\" Haruka willed Leumya to walk forwards and she did. She willed her to stomp and she did. She willed herself to grow, to shrink back, she tried out Leumya's weapon systems. It was just like having a normal body...if she had powers or something. But now she was a machine, sharing a body with her only friend.<br>\r\n     \"Leimya, can you take control back?

When they go to the rest mode, Leumya and Haruka then shuts their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dream State Mode</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Haruka then wakes up in some sort of empty Japanese like city, wearing her brownish skirt and black shirt, but without the air mask.

Leumya was now seeing what Haruka see, does, and feel, just like her friend a moment ago. \u201cMaybe it be nice to see what you can do with that power of yours. Besides, I can understand staying in a mansion and having to deal with all those medical stuff kinda make you angry, so why not let some of that anger out on our play city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is what I intend to do. It feels awesome to now be powerful now.\u201d Haruka smiled just as she wills Leumya to the miniature city which has several buildings and plenty of vehicles that were also miniatures as well. Her parents built the city so that Haruka and Leumya can play one way or not, as Haruka likes seeing Leumya rampaging. And luckily while her breathing equipment allows her to go outside to see her rampage in person, she prepared remaining inside for safety reasons. Once she got into position, Leumya started her rampaging by proceeding to stomp some cars with her foot, causing them to be flatten and exploded on contact. Leumya was then suddenly flailing her hands and then emitting a Mechagodzilla like roar just as she hits a building with her hand, damaging it a bit. She then proceeded to then grab the building from the bottom and then throw it at a few other buildings, knocking them all out. Leumya then fired lasers from her eyes to blow a few buildings as well, and then she finishes the last building with a butt crush, and when all said an done, she then emits another roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka then spoke. \u201cThat was the most incredible feeling I ever felt in my life. So sick of being inside my mansion all those years and not having anyone around besides you and the various staff, makes me did what I did just today. You know, it feels great to go on a rampage here to get my mind off things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume it does, but may I ask, you don\u2019t intend to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, I wouldn't do it for real, but I am just tired of being so sick all the time so I just needed this. I can get used to being big, but it\u2019s also because of that, that I am now no longer human, so I end up being a freak in another way, but if anything I prefer being a giant robot than a sick girl. But there is one important question I should ask you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that? Leumya said just as Haruka wills the robot away from the site, which then disappears in a flash virtually. </span></div></div>",

She knows Haruka was miserable was deep down all her life thanks to her sickness, like being forced to wear a mask all the time and have tubes transfers food into her body all the time, and not having anyone to visit her at all and being home schooled, well anything that makes her pretty mad at the world, but deep down Leumya cared about Haruka, even though she is self aware and programmed with a chip inside Haruka\u2019s head to be her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mean she seemed like she was the perfect friend for Haruka as she is smart, friendly, good looking, is armed to the teeth with advanced weaponry, and most important of all, she was des igneous to be big in size as a special insurance for Haruka\u2019s safety. Her parents were so heartbroken that she was sick with this condition that she has that her parents just work all the time with occasional phone calls and visits to Haruka, as they don\u2019t want to see her suffer. That explains why her parents created Leumya for Haruka. They were incredibly rich, so they can provide Haruka with the best care possible, but they fail at what was most to them, but they still love her in-spite of that. Leumya was introduced to Haruka when she was 7 years old btw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeumya full on origins however is truly unknown with some stuff like technology, but there was something about Leumya that Haruka has yet to figure out. Leumya is self aware, and the more she watches Haruka and bonds with her, the more that her \u201cobsession\u201d develops. Haruka doesn\u2019t know it yet, but Leumya in her head desire Haruka to be hers and hers alone. Not like evil, but usually when someone else comes to visit, Leumya would get a bit overprotective, even insisting that Haruka is fine, even going as far as scaring them one way or another. Somehow, word goes around that there is a giant robot monster haunting some house or what not, and Haruka has to talk to her sometimes. Even when the parents check on Leumya, nothing seems to be wrong... but then the question is then ask. Haruka was willing Leumya to walk around the area, and then Leumya then ask this question to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSide note: Leumya sometimes acts like a monster when she scares people off, as being big places a kaiju Mode in her. She isn\u2019t evil, but is a monster enough to send a point.</span></div></div>",

Besides, I am like a mother you never have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, true on that in a lot of ways. But yes, I do remember you on that day being introduced to me. I was like 7 years old when I meet you, and I remember being a bit scared and puzzled of how my parents built you the way you are and what not, but... it was because of you that I opened up a bit. I know I spent most of the time at the house, but occasionally went out with you several times (equipment and everything), and besides, you are perhaps the closet thing I ever have to a friend. I mean you cared for me and what not. And I am grateful for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am happy that you said that to me, and it makes me happy to be at your service. Say, what memory do you remember me most for, as I can see the memory of how you and I meet one day, where I was like truly gigantic like 200ft, and your love for monster movies and what not... or that one memory back two years ago, where you and I had some fun, like where you watched me rampage in the virtual city, or how you saw me take on some monsters in our favorite games, or how we play dress up and all that cute stuff.

On December the 1st 2050 an unknown object entered the earth's orbit. Upon first inspection, NASA concluded that this was a meteorite comprised of a previously unknown material, furthermore they calculated it's trajectory and discovered that it would land in the United States, specifically West Virginia. After the area is evacuated the meteorite lands, completely eradicating everything in a 40 mile radius around the point of impact. After several hours the meteorite cracked in two revealing a gigantic alien creature. It was oddly human, but at the same time it had features from other earthly animals ( imagine something along the lines of a monster girl).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll attempts to communicate failed as anyone who got close was swiftly destroyed by the creature. Then the alien started making a B line to New York city. The giant beast was eventually subdued halfway through, but not before she trampled several smaller cities on her way. The world was cheering at their victory, but it wouldn't last for long as NASA soon discovered that a large number of very similar meteorites were heading toward earth. Several scientists at the U.N. decided that the best way to fight giant half monster/half girl monsters from space is to create their own giant half robot/half girl protectors. And so, the U.N. and the worlds largest companies scrambled to each create a mecha giantess. Such companies are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u00dcber corp.</b><br>\r\n<b>Base of operations:</b> Germany<br>\r\n<b>Aesthetic:</b> Industrial, bulky with a strong emphasis on efficiency. Large yellow plates with many cables and hydraulics showing in between.<br>\r\nThe colossal \u00dcber corp international is the leading producer of heavy duty mining equipment. Their motto is \"Bigger is better\", that school of thought is best seen in their marketing campaign. They promise the public that their mecha giantess will be so large that she will dwarf the alien invaders. Of course great size alone is often not enough to win a confrontation, and if the giantess is really as large as they advertise she might just cause more collateral damage that the aliens she fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hemtec</b><br>\r\n<b>Base of operations:</b> the U.S.A.<br>\r\n<b>Aesthetics:</b> Sleek, and white texture. Large emphasis of prettiness and flair instead of function.<br>\r\nOnce a pioneer in the information industry, Hemtec has started to emphasize on looks rather than function in the recent decades. In order to boost their sales even more they declared that they would be manufacturing their own mecha giantess. Hemtec has guaranteed to make her their most stylistically appealing and innovative product yet. While she might be frail, Hemtec has access to some of the most advanced weapon systems and AI in the world, which they states is enough to even out the odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Koloss</b> <br>\r\n<b>Base of operations:</b> Russia<br>\r\n<b>Aesthetics:</b> Dark, muted colors, mainly army green. Bulky design that is sometimes described as \"evil looking\". they tend to cover everything in soviet era symbols.<br>\r\nThis newly founded organisation is funded in large part by the Russian government. In a move that angered the U.N. they pledge to create the most well armed weapon in existence in order to protect the motherland from any invaders, be they alien or from earth. Some of Russia's finest engineer and scientist have come together to complete this objective. In turn the AI is very basic, as it's goal is to stop the invaders at all cost, no matter the collateral damage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>B.U.L.W.A.R.K.</b><br>\r\n<b>Base of operations:</b> The U.S.A.<br>\r\n<b>Aesthetics:</b> Futuristic and almost gundam like design. Covered in red, blue and white, adorned in stars and eagle motives. <br>\r\nThis U.S.A. funded organisation was formed shortly after Koloss, with the intent to be it's undoing. In the few months both companies existed a strong rivalry has formed and the U.S and Russian relations have reverted back to a cold war like arms race. B.U.L.W.A.R.K. Promised to make a giantess whose armaments would surpassed the Russian'a attempts. In order to boost the nation's morale they plan to program the AI to be as patriotic as possible (think Liberty Prime levels of patriotism)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which one of these mega corporations finishes the Mecha Giantess first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

HQ, a man by the name of Jonas Morgenstern was preparing for an interview. The young representative of \u00dcber corp. had arranged an interview with a journalist affiliated with one of the largest news companies in Germany. The subject being the newly constructed Mecha Giantess. Right now he is talking to his superior via phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember Klaus, you must answer truthfully but you must not share exact information, no exact heights, exact weight or exact materials. Be vague, but not too much. After all people will be less hyped to see it her action if they already know everything about her.\" said the voice on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes don't worry. I've been practicing the entire week for this. I promise i won't completely blow it. \" Klaus said jokingly. A few knocks were heard and Klaus then said \"Gotta cut your lecture short, the interviewer is coming in\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man fixed his tie, put on his best confident face, cleared his throat and he finally told his guest to enter. The woman that entered was dressed smartly and carried a small notebook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's a pleasure to meet you in person Mr. Klaus, I'm Julia and i'll be asking you a few question regarding \u00dcber corp.'s newest project.\" the woman said as she took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you too Julia. Now let's not waste time and begin the interview.\" Klaus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. First question, How do you plan to call her?\" Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her official name is Anna, named after the CEO of \u00dcber corp.'s daughter\" Klaus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Question number two, your company promised to make the Mecha Giantess truly colossal, to quote your CEO \"So massive that she will dwarf the invaders. Is that the case and exactly how big is she?\" Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Julia i'm sorry to disapoint you but i'm not allowed to discuss the exact size but i can explain it to you. You know that monster that landed in the U.S.A. 5 moths ago? Well Anna will be much bigger.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Question number three, What kind of weapons will she have?\" the woman asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Germany has very tight weapon control, we could get the permit if we wanted but it would take at least two years and we need her ready and operational asap. We managed to find a way to bypass this problem. Giant robotic arms to matter how heavy or fist like do not count as weapons but as mining equipment, for which we've had a permit ever since the company's creation. It might seem inefficient but we've hired the best martial artists in the world to help program the ultimate fighting AI.\" Klaus answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess i should also mention that we built in several large pieces of mining equipment onto her. This is in order to improve her overall usefulness.\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Question number four. Can you share any pictures of Anna?\" the reporter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus sat there for a moment, thinking out his next move. His superior told him to not share exact information, to be vague but not too much. Well he did leave the exact level of vagueness to Klaus so... to hell with it. Klaus had some pictures of her laying around that would make for some great newspaper material, his boss would be angry but the risk would be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually i have some pictures of Anna over here.\" the young man said, as he opened his drawer. he picked up a few photos and he presented them to Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn all of the photos there were some people, trucks and other equipment that made it easier to imagine just how colossal she was. The humans alone looked like ants compared to her towering metal body. ( she looks something like this \"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/264/317/962.jpg\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the risk that you're taking Mr. Klaus. One last question, when should we expect her to make her public appearance?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should be ready by next month.\" Klaus said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your input Mr. Klaus. It was a pleasure to work with you.\" Julia said as she got up from the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure was all mine Julia.\" Klaus said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe report and the pictures served to greatly boost \u00dcber corp.'s popularity. Klaus did receive a very stern talk from his superior for disobeying orders, but he did receive a raise in the end. A moth later Anna made her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she do then? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The \u00dcber corp. construction department has decided to combine standard machines. As a basement for Anna the are using now a giant bladeless bulldozer which has some kind of metal T-formed bar of 25m height and 10m weight. Attached to each side of the t-formed bar is a giant robot arm around 20m in length with five-fingered robot hand, which fingers are around 2m long. In the middle of the T-formed bar is a hydrolically raised glassed drivers cabin. While Anna is not in use the cabin is at the ground, but can be raised up to a height of 20 metres. Inside the cabin are just two pedals and a bicycle like seat with a 20cm big vibrator attached to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first look around Julia wondered about the vibrator and if it has some technical reason, besides that there are strange engineers working at \u00dcber. corp. <br>\r\n\"Well, before you ask\" said Klaus \"It has some DNA-sensors inside to ensure that Anna is only steered by a female. You might remember that it is important to understand your enemy and as the aliens are female we guessed that a woman would be best in fighting them. Besides the driver can give commands to the machines by movements of her hips.

On that exact day, the president of Russia ordered an inspection of the facility and the giantess. The inspector was no other than Leonid Krakov, Senior Lieutenant and close friend of the president. Right now these two influential men were taking an elevator to the deepest part of the facility, where in a large hangar the giantess herself was being stored. The eerie silence accompanied by the mechanical noises from the elevators were interrupted by the Lieutenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of the facility is in tip-top shape Asimov, But i am yet to see the main attraction.\" said Leonid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you Lieutenant. Things have been going quite smoothly, we were planning to be finished in 8 moths but it seems that we underestimated the funding we would receive.\" the scientist noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that this speed didn't come at the cost of quality, after all Mother Russia is counting on you to defend her. This is a great honor and no expenses should be spared, be it armor, weapons or the AI.\" said the Lieutenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to say this but i might have to disappoint you a little, Lieutenant. You see when we were installing the AI we left most memories almost completely blank. Sure she might reason and act like an adult but she still has a lot to learn about this world and humanity in general.\" said Asimov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May i remind you that you're making a weapon, not some oversized child\" said Leonid in a stern and disapproving manner.\"I just hope that it was worth it to severely damage all of our international relations for her.\" he sighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Lieutenant, She is very prepared to defend the motherland, you'll see.\" said Asimov, trying to reassure Leonid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more silent minutes the elevator finally stopped at the deepest level. The doors of the elevator creaked open, revealing a large brightly lit room. The room was filled with bustling scientist and engineers who were running test and conducting last minute checks. But in the piddle of the giant room on a large podium like structure stood the giantess. She was monstrously large, almost touching the ceiling of the room. Her body was like that of a human, her head had long hair and her face was gorgeous. Her hand were a stark contrast to her womanly body, they were akin to large metal gauntlets: bulky, army green in color with a large red star in the middle, ready to deliver punishing blows to the aliens that dared to attack the motherland. Her legs resembled her arms in design: Again Army green but with the Russian coat of arms imprinted on the kneecaps. She was truly a sight to behold and the Lieutenant would agree, were he not busy staring in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's... She's beautiful!\" said Leonid trying not to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like her Lieutenant, but i'm afraid you haven't seen the best part yet. Do you notice the small cracks on her entire body? Those aren't defects, those are panels. During combat they are going to fly open, revealing dozens of tucked away heavy ordinance: machine guns, missiles, cannons anything you can imagine.\" Asimov declared proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fit of sheer joy and pride the stoic Lieutenant delivered a tight hug to Asimov.<br>\r\n\"The moment this beauty sets foot on the surface, those damn Yankees will turn red in shame!\" cheered the Lieutenant as he squeezed the scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that appears to be so... but uh... you're crushing me...\" said Asimov. Leonid immediately came back to his senses, he recoiled backwards and tried to adopt a more professional expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please excuse me Asimov. I will report back to the president now. I'm sure he'll be just as happy as i am.\" said Leonid <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an honor to have you as a guest. Send my best regards to the president\" said Asimov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, i almost forgot to ask. She has a name right?\" asked the Lieutenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well her official name is VDF-37 but i have programmed her to respond to the name \"Katyusha\" answered the Scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that both men headed in different directions. The Lieutenant headed to the elevator but Asimov headed toward the giantess in order to finalize the project and turn her power on for the first time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That is when the Kaijuin Company is born, to make Mecha monsters. Not to destroy, but to defend their city and their neighbors from those monsters. Unlike the other companies, they will be making more than one giantesses for their battles to better defend their cities and the world. They get along well with all other companies other than Koloss, mainly do to distrust. Also unlike other companies, they won\u2019t be making them just for war, as the company is exploring other possibilities for profit and to use the Mecha girl monsters. Most of their monsters are based on Kaiju films but with humanoid appearances, plus with attractive women, etc. Not only are they really well built, but also has advanced AI, state of their art weapons, slick design, and adaptability given the fact they use various monsters for inspiration. Rumor has it that they will be opening a theme park on an remote island that will feature them as attractions. We will just have to see how that turns out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe can make more companies or new story idea.</span></div></div>",
