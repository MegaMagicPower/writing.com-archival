            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up one fine morning as the sun shines in through the bedroom window. You let out a yawn and then feel the soft white ground around you. You had been sleeping on your wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s butt cheek. Even today you find it hard to believe it. Maggie Reaver, the sheriff of Dreadberry was your wife. Of course, she was a 1000ft tall lioness who couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even be hurt by a nuke, but you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t complaining. You look up at the mantle and smile. You see your wedding photograph, a photograph of your sister and a photograph of your daughter as a baby. You breath deeply and then you hear a noise that sounds like a thunderstorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell you were close, it was actually Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snoring. She was still asleep. You however knew of a sure way to wake Wifezila up. You climb up Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long hair, a journey take takes twenty or so minutes. Not only was Maggie so impossibly huge, but she was a rather fat feline, making her practically a mountain to you, but that meant there was more Maggie for you to love. You make it to your wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear and start to scratch it, turning her thunderous snoring into an even more thunderous purring. Once you have Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention, you jump in front of her enormous eye as it opens up. You hang on tight to Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyelid as the lioness giantess gets up. Maggie sits up in bed and smiles at you. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMorning Neil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey Maggie, how\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my queen of beasts doing today?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maggie lets out a laugh and then brings you down to her level to kiss you. This in turn coats you with a rain of lion drool but after twenty years you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, your large lioness wife takes you into the shower. For this, she mainly just rubs you with soap and uses you as a sponge to clean herself, not that you particularly mind. Once the shower is over, Maggie has breakfast on the table. She sets down a plate of pancakes and breaks off a piece of one of hers for you to eat. As you and Maggie are eating, you hear tremors and smile. That would be your daughter Sapphire coming down. You must admit, you were surprised you even got Maggie pregnant to begin with. And even more surprised when Sapphire turned out not to be a Nemean lion. She was a mer-lion. Maggie assured you that was due to her own mixed ancestry. Given the original Nemean lion was an offspring of Echidna, you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t question it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMorning Mom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Sapphire as she takes her seat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMorning Dad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You see that Sapphire has her math book open and is studying. Your daughter got the best grades in her class and you were so proud of her. But she tended to stress out over tests and you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appreciate it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSapphire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maggie says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many times have I told you not to bring your textbooks to the breakfast table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Mom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d groans Sapphire. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMs. Tavi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planning a pop quiz and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to be ready for everything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You smile and shake your head as you feel your giantess daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thumb. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSapphire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy cuddly little colossus. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the smartest cat I know, right after your mother of course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maggie lets out a laugh before she serves Sapphire her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see both your wife and daughter tearing into the sauropod sausages and shrug your shoulders. Sharing a breakfast table with two giant lionesses with big appetites might seem unnerving to most, but you were used to Sapphire and Maggie. You actually found Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s carnivorous appetite to be part of her charm and it looked like Sapphire was becoming more and more like her mom everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028What happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think I can handle getting the paper. You kiss your wife\u2019s big toe and walk out as both Maggie and Sapphire looked on in concern. \u201cMom?\u201d asks Sapphire. \u201cIs it a man thing or a human thing?\u201d Maggie simply gives an unamused look your daughter\u2019s way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you should be careful, but you\u2019ve lived in Dreadberry for so long that you don\u2019t really show much fear. Of course you gotta admit, there could be some dangerous monsters, especially Meagan, that vulpine ex of yours. You dated her before you met Maggie and she was fun at first, but she became possessive and didn\u2019t even let your own family get close to you. You felt like a prisoner back when you were living with her, so you broke up with Meagan. To say Meagan didn\u2019t take it well would be a gross understatement. She\u2019s still bitter after all these ears and warned you that if she even saw you again, she\u2019d swallow you whole and since she lived directly across the street from you, she\u2019s tried it and often. You wish you had never met Meagan. Fortunately she\u2019s too scared of Maggie to try anything with your lioness wife present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk down and see the paper in site you begin to wonder if you\u2019ll even see the neighbors so early in the morning. There was one you\u2019d rather avoid. Her name was Raven and she was a banshee who moved into the neighborhood back when Sapphire was still in elementary school. You and Maggie tried to be good neighbors and welcome her into Dreadberry but Raven was smitten with you at first sight and wanted you to divorce Maggie and hook up with her. Maggie has had to threaten to lock that banshee up several times but Raven still has her eye on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut some neighbors weren\u2019t so bad. There was that werehyena Summer from next door. Of course, Summer was a big grouch, but she was friendly to humans and didn\u2019t eat any of them. Summer however has been in a bad mood ever since her older sister got married. You heard that it was a gay wedding and that Cree\u2019s bride was a werejackal. You don\u2019t know what factor it was that made Summer so upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, then there was Summer\u2019s other neighbor, Flora Flanders, or as Summer called her \u201cStupid Flanders\u201d. That spriggan girl was very sweet and cheery, to an annoying degree. It was impossible to upset her, but you endured it. But that girl looks on the bright side so often that she doesn\u2019t see that Cattleya and Meagan despise you and wish you harm. Flora is the kind who would invite criminals to a house party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a neighbor you really got along with, your sister Meryl. Meryl actually lived in Dreadberry before you did. She moved to the monster world after she rose from her grave as a giant skeleton. It\u2019s amazing that there was anything left for her to revive given that she was killed in an explosion. You were also surprised that she met somebody before you met Maggie. Your brother-in-law Flint the golem. Flint had to be the only in-law you had that didn\u2019t drive you crazy. Meryl should be jogging by any minute. You wonder why she bothers given she has no fat or muscles left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the last of the neighbors on your block was the one you don\u2019t really know that well. Her name was isis and she was a serpopard, a leopard with a snake\u2019s neck. You didn\u2019t even know her last name or if she had one because she was the most reclusive monster you\u2019ve ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon reach the newspaper and start dragging it back inside. You had been working out so you\u2019d save Maggie the trouble. But then you saw a shadow approaching. It was one of the neighbors, but who?</span></div></div>",

She looked down at you with a mischievous glint in her eyes and her arms resting behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello, 'little' brother.\" Meryl greeted you in a sing-song, teasing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sighed but smiled at her. \"Hey, Meryl. Still finding that joke funny, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course. Have you learned nothing from our childhood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You shrugged in defeat. \"Fair enough. So, how you doing today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meryl bent down to speak closer with you. \"Alright. Is it ok if I go inside with you? I need to borrow something from Maggie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You grinned slyly at her. \"I don't know. That 'little' joke is still stinging a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meryl gave you the puppy dog eyes. \"Oh, come on. Please, big brother sir..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n On the one hand you were enjoying playing around with your sister. Just like old times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll bring the paper in for you.\" Meryl folded her hands in a begging position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But on the other hand. You were getting tired from pulling the giant paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright. But only because I like making you do stuff for me.\" You said sitting on the paper and waiting for pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meryl giggled and nodded as she pick up the paper, with you on it, and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello, monsters!\" Meryl cried as she enter the kitchen with you sitting on her bony shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Maggie smiled at her. \"Morning, Meryl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Morning, Maggie.\" Meryl replied cheerfully. \"I was wondering if I could borrow some threat. Emerald tore a bit of her wrist on a nail. Nothing major.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n If you had heard that same sentence 20 years ago and didn't know Meryl's daughter was a Ragdoll monster, you may have been freaked out a 'torn wrist'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure thing. Sapphire, dear. Can you grab Meryl a spindle out of the closet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ok, mom.\" And your daughter left on her mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meryl gentle picked you off her shoulder and handed you over to Maggie with the paper. As you stepped onto Maggie's paw you saw her give you a small crooked smile. That's when it struck you that there would be much teasing over your 'Newspaper Adventures' later. For now, though, Maggie was more interested in the newspaper. She placed you on her nose so you could read along with her. The head line story caught your attention at once...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> On the front page the head line was titled, \"Mon Cons Escape!\"<br>\r\n \"What's this?\" You ask Maggie.<br>\r\n Your lioness wife unfolded the paper and began reading the front page aloud while Meryl sat down.<br>\r\n \"Last night, around 3am, the monster prison Under Gloom, experienced its first break out in the facility's history. More than 60 inmates broke out of their cells and over powered the guards on duty before heading out of the underground building and onto the surface. Fortunately, the local police forces reacted quickly upon word from the prison's warden and as of now nearly all inmates have been recaptured and returned to their cells.<br>\r\n \"However, 2 people are still unaccounted for after the breakout. Security Guard Lisa Darkholme and an as of yet unidentified male prisoner... See page 5 for more.\"<br>\r\n Maggie opened to page 5 and looked over it quickly. Once done she closed the paper and placed it on the table with a sigh.<br>\r\n \"Not much after that, just something about a possible inside job. They're starting an internal investigation into it. Nothing about who the escaped prisoner is or any real info about him at all. It's really annoying.\"<br>\r\nMeryl piped in.  \"Maybe he's so dangerous they don't want anyone actively looking for him.\"<br>\r\n Maggie just shrugged. \"All I know is that now I'm going to spend all day answering 911 calls now. I'll have to hunt down every strange guy from here to Europe before long.\"<br>\r\n Maggie then got a weird look on her face that slowly turned to a wicked grin. \"Then again, it might give me the best chance to lock up the trouble making Banshee.\"<br>\r\n \"Maggie!\" Meryl cried in shock. \"That is a huge abuse of your authority!\"<br>\r\n \"Calm down.\" Maggie said through a fit of laughter. \"I was half joking.\"<br>\r\n \"Which means your half serious.\"<br>\r\n \"Maybe.\" Maggie replied innocently as she looked off into space letting the wonder images of herself leading that banshee to lock up play out in her head.<br>\r\n The whole time this was going on in your kitchen, you were miles away and years in the past. The story of an unknown escaped monster worried you and pulled an old memory out to the open. Something about the whole situation screamed 'DANGER' to you. As you looked at the title page again, that memory came back suddenly and you dived into it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Dimly lit caverns marked your walk. The smell of blood and death was all around. Turning a corner you found bodies of both humans and monster, twisted and broken, laying all over the ground. Their faces told of the horror they witnessed as they unleashed their silent screams.<br>\r\n You passed through the door way and into the massive center room. There he stood, a man dressed in black tall and proud over his latest kill. He turned at your approach and your heart quickened. His lips are dripping red as they lift into a mocking smile, and his glowing orange eyes lock on you. He opens his mouth and laughs, a cold pitiless laugh that make the hair on your neck stand on end. You are terrified and angry at the same time. Rage over comes fear and you charge this monster with a war cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ow! Neil easy on the fur.\" <br>\r\n Maggie's sudden cry of pain snapped you back to attention. You noticed you had grabbed a hand full of the fur on Maggie's nose and pulled. You let go quickly and apologized while rubbing the spot you pulled on.<br>\r\n \"Oh god, I'm so sorry Maggie. Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n \"Yes,\" Maggie said calmly. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n \"Sorry, it's just the idea of a monster criminal on the loose scares me a bit.\"<br>\r\n \"It's alright, I understand. But what do you have to worry about? Under Gloom is miles away, and there's no reason for him to come out to these parts. You're worrying yourself over nothing sweetie.\"<br>\r\n Maggie smiled so sweetly at you, you couldn't help but return it. But you also couldn't relax, not internally. You hid your worry from Maggie and just sat silently on her nose for a while longer.<br>\r\n She was right of course...if this was a normal monster. But the chance of it being HIM was low. After all the trouble you and the others went through to stop him, they wouldn't just let him escape...right?<br>\r\n Thankfully Meryl pulled you from this unnerving thought. \"So, Neil. You said you're off from work tomorrow, right? Want to come over and visit me for awhile?\"</span></div></div>",

Now she's extremely bitter about it and holds a grudge against you for it. You stay silent and discreetly hide behind the paper. \"I already know you're there Neil. Besides, I know your scent by heart.\" she says a little coldly. You step into the open and wave at her. \"Good morning Meagan! How are you doing?\" you say. She just folds her arms and looks down on you with a straight face. \"Oh I'm fine, still single in case you were wondering.\" she answers. You try to end the conversation and get away. \"Oh, sorry to hear that.\" you say. \"I hope you find someone soon. Well I better get back inside, Maggie's waiting you know.\" That last statement makes her frown, but it turns to a smile, as if she's had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't want to keep your WIFE waiting now would I?\" Meagan says while still smiling. You decide to forget the paper and just go back in, but Meagan's paw is descending upon you. You try to evade it but she easily catches you. \"But since you feel bad for me, I think you can help me out.\" she says as she lifts you to her face. She moves slowly, making sure you get a good look at her body on the way. She's still beautiful, with a nice big body and some great breasts. She's just a little crazy. \"Uh what did you have in mind?\" you ask. Her eyes narrow and her bushy tail begins swishing from side to side, like she's angry and happy at the same time. \"Well I think the best way to cope is to to confront the source of my frustration.\" she says. You begin struggling but she squeezes you between two fingers to make you stop. You have a bad feeling about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Meagan, I think you have a right to be mad, but-\" you say before she interrupts. \"You're damn right I have a right to be mad! I loved you more than anything else! I provided everything for you and you leave me for some mangy cat!\" she almost yells. You don't want to provoke her but hearing her talk about Maggie like that sets you off. \"Don't talk about her like that! I loved you too, but you were just too possessive! I couldn't even speak to my own family!\" you yell before thinking. Meagan bares her teeth and growls at you, squeezing you once again. \"You just don't know how good you had it!

Its not the first time Maggie's had to confront Meagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to help move things along you try to think of something. You try to think about your surroundings and then get an idea. While Meagan is trying to get away outside you reach out toward her butthole and jam your hand inside. Meagan yelps and her hands fly to her butt. Maggie narrows her  eyes and steps forward. \"Trouble?\" she asks. In a flash she whips the fox around and sticks her paw down her pants. After a second feeling around she pulls you out between two claws. \"Thanks honey.\" you say. It feels so good to get some fresh air! Maggie sticks you between her boobs and glares at Meagan. She grabs the werefox by the throat and pulls her in close. \"I should arrest you for kidnapping.\" she spits out. \"Neil is my husband, so deal with it.' Meagan looks as if she wants to say something but stays silent. Maggie trows her to the ground and walks away. \"If you do this again you won't get away unharmed.\" she says. Meagan is on the ground rubbing her throat. Its a good thing she has fur because there are definitely bruises from Maggie's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maggie enters your home she takes you out and sniffs you. \"Bleh, you smell like fox butt.\" she says. \"Thanks for getting me out of there. I love you.\" you tell her She smiles and Sapphire walks in. \"Dad!\" she exclaims and rushes over. \"So she had him after all?\" she asks. Her mother nods as she gets a whiff of you as well. \"Where was she keeping you?\" she asks. You and Maggie look at each other. \"Uh...somewhere cramped.\" you say. After that Maggie takes you to your bathroom and takes your clothes off. After giving you a thorough scrubbing she plants a huge kiss on you. Then the three of you have dinner. \"Gee, Ms. Meagan doesn't let stuff go huh?\" Sapphire asks at the table. \"You don't know the half of it.\" you tell her. After dinner you and Maggie decide to turn in and tell your daughter good night. What next?</span></div></div>",

Before you can relax however you feel something nudging you. You look to see Maggie's gigantic claw prodding you. \"You don't think you're going to sleep do you?\" she asks. You try to push her claw away but it doesn't even budge. \"Honey, I've had a rough day.\" you tell her. Your lioness wife grabs you between two claws and lifts you to her face. \"I've been worried sick about you all day. Now I'm going to get a little relief okay?\" she says, emphasizing that last word. You see that she has a wild look in her eyes. Looks like you're getting it on tonight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie puts you back on her breast and forcefully guides you to her nipple. \"Well?\" she asks sweetly. You smile with a sigh. You love that woman. You walk up and grab onto her nipple with all your might. Your wife moans and grabs the breast you're on. This causes you to lose your footing and you grasp the nipple even harder. She fidgets and begins playing with her other breast. Before you know it one of her hands is playing with her privates. Taking the initiative you begin to climb her nub, giving her pleasure as you get higher. When you reach the top you begin licking and biting the tip. Maggie bites her lip and eventually snatches you off of her boob. \"Time to get on with it.\" she says lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one swift move Maggie flips over onto her belly and drops you onto her back. \"You should start moving.\" she says. You know what she's getting at and make your way down her back to the fleshy mountains that are her butt cheeks. When you reach them you climb one but Maggie gives her a ass a shake, sending you tumbling down between them. \"Sorry sweety.\" she says with a giggle. You roll your eyes with a smile and walk through the valley of her ass. When you reach the end you reach down and caress her hole. \"Oooh...\" she moans softly. You proceed to massage it and then stick you hand inside. Maggie jumps a little, sending you tumbling down. Your hand pops out and you land on the mattress. Your wife flips back over and you find yourself between her legs staring at her massive pussy. \"Okay, time to tend to the other hole.\" she says and holds it open with one hand. You walk up and enter her vagina. When you're in deep enough you get to work. After being married so long you know exactly how to please her. When she reaches her climax you are pushed out and she picks you up. \"Thats better.\" she sighs and lays you on her boob. The two of you then drift off to sleep. The next morning...</span></div></div>",

You let out a sigh as you approach the salon. \"I'm going to dread going into work today,\" you say. \"Prima and Atlanta are going to kill me for not coming in yesterday.\" \"Neil,\" says Maggie. \"Don't worry. I called them and told them what happened. Apparently they hired a new girl yesterday. A beautician fresh out of college.\" Sapphire then closes her book. \"I've heard of that. Ms. Howler said that it was her sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize something. \"A werewolf?\" you ask. \"There's gonna be a werewolf working with me today?\" \"Dad,\" says Sapphire. \"Relax. You know that Ms. Howler hates humans. She wouldn't hurt a fly. Maybe it's the same with her sister.\" You really hope so. It isn't long before Maggie takes Sapphire to school and drops her off before driving down the street towards the Primordial Earth Salon, Spa and Saloon.\" Maggie adjusts her cowgirl's hat before picking you up and walking you into the spa. Just as you thought, Atlanta was steamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where in the great bottom hell were you yesterday, you little bug?\" says the leviathan woman. \"I was stuck in my ex's ass, Atlanta,\" you say. \"Cut me some slack.\" \"Don't give me that crap, Reaver,\" says Atlanta. \"Next time you skip work, don't bother coming back.\" Maggie growls at Atlanta to intimidate her. \"Neil had a rough day, yesterday, Atlanta, so I suggest that you treat him right.\" Atlanta gulped and stepped back. Prima at the time was busy setting up a few mannequins to advertise hair styles. \"I apologize for Atlanta, Sheriff Reaver,\" the mammoth woman says. \"She's just mad that she had to go a day without tyrannizing your husband.\" Atlanta stuck out her tongue and then walked to the other side of the salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I heard,\" you say. \"You hired a werewolf girl.\" Prima nodded her head and held up her trunk. \"Yeah, I was going to introduce you.\" You and Maggie look forward and you see a the werewolf, Colleen's sister, walking forward. She was a black and white werewolf who sort of looked like a hybrid between a wolf and a dalmatian. Not only did she have spots all over her body and hair, she was just as fat as Colleen and like her sister, she wasn't wearing clothes. \"Hello,\" says the wolf woman in a cheery tune. \"You must be Neil. I'm Blanche.\" You and Maggie look in surprise to see that Blanche's eyes were so wide that you could almost swear they looked like they could come out of her head. Then those eyes look down at you and you look nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Maggie seems pretty confident with Blanche. \"Pleased to meet you, Blanche,\" says Maggie. \"I'm Neil's wife, Maggie Reaver, Sheriff Maggie Reaver.\" Blanche seems actually surprised that you're married to the sheriff but then she smiles and shakes hands with Maggie. \"Neil,\" says Prima. \"I want you to work with Blanche today on the clients' hair.\" Maggie then hands you to Blanche and tips her head to the wolf girl giantess before kissing you. \"I'll pick you up after work, Sug.\" Says your lioness wife. \"See you later, Maggie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maggie walks away, Blanche walks up to the styling chair and starts getting everything ready as she sets you down on the table. You're not sure if you trust Blanche but she's Colleen's sister, so she's most likely harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything more on the matter, the bell on the door rings and you hear your first customer of the day come in.</span></div></div>",

Seeing as you were on the table and too small to reach the door and that it would take a while for you to reach the door, it's not like you could do anything but wonder. \"Was Maggie expecting company today?\" you ask yourself. Then you hear the sound of a key. Whoever was coming in the door had a spare key to get into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume that it must be a relative. You pray that it isn't Fiona or worse, Cattleya. But before you can say anything, you see who enters into the house. From the looks of it, she was a 900ft tall wereleopard and a rather fat one at that, albeit not as fat as Maggie. She was wearing a pair of round red sunglasses and had gold-reddish hair reaching down to her big booty. She was wearing a pair of jeans and a blue shirt with a Thundercats symbol. \"Oh no,\" you groan. \"Sable.\" Sable Reaver was Maggie's cousin and not one of your favorites of her extended family. That leopard giantess was a screwup to put it lightly. She couldn't hold a job and was the clumsiest monster you've ever met. What the hell was she doing here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess Maggie's not home,\" says Sable as she walks in. \"I wonder if Neil's here. Darn, Mama said that Maggie might be able to give me a job at the precinct. I hope it works out better than that job at CFP. Stupid Sable, you forgot to plug in the fridge. One little mistake and you get the place shut down. Doesn't look like Neil's here eith...\" Before Sable says anything else, the leopard giantess accidentally bumps her hip into the lamp at the side table and smashes it on the ground. \"Oh, damn.\" Says Sable. Sable bends down to clean up the lamp but in the process bumps her head on the coffee table and yells in pain as she accidentally knocks it over and sends you flying into the couch with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're recovering, you see Sable's massive ass in front of you. The leopard woman's ass isn't as big as Maggie's but you can see her zebra striped panties as she puts the table back in position and cleans up the mess. \"Damn,\" she says. \"I hope that lamp wasn't that expensive. I better sit down before I do any more damage to Maggie's furniture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp and realize where she's going with this, so you try to run away as the shadow of the leopard woman's ass descends upon you and soon you find Sable plopping her fat ass on the couch, causing you to slip into her butt crack as the leopard woman presses down on you. You let out a muffled groan as you're pinned under your wife's cousin's massive booty. It's not as bad as Cattleya's ass, but you still don't like being trapped under any ass unless it belongs to Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only hope that klutz feels you under her booty.</span></div></div>",

You hope she gets up so you can at least get some air but that doesn't happen. \"I'll just watch some TV.\" she says. \"If I don't move from this spot I can't break anything.\" You sigh and resign yourself to the long wait. Every so often she shifts her ass or wiggles it around to get comfortable. Being stuck under her cheek, you get pushed further in each time. Fortunately you don't suffer from any friction burn. This has happened with Maggie so many times that she  bought a couch that's so soft it won't hurt if you get sat on. That, coupled with Sable's soft ass keeps you from harm. That doesn't make it any less comfortable though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours pass and you're still underneath Maggie's cousin. The door opens and your wife walks in. When she sees Sable she is surprised. \"Sable?\" she asks. The leopard sees her cousin and jumps up to give her a hug. \"Maggie! Its good to see you!\" she exclaims. Maggie returns the hug with a smile. \"Its good to see you too, but what are you doing here?\" she asks. \"Oh! I came to visit, but no one was here, so I decided to wait.\" she answers, then looks toward the broken lamp on the floor. \"Sorry about the lamp.\" Maggie sees the broken lamp and sighs. Of course Sable couldn't show up without breaking something. She walks over and starts cleaning it up when something occurs to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Neil?\" Maggie asks. Sable tilts her head in confusion. \"What do you mean?\" No one was here when I came in.\" she says. Maggie puts two and two together and sighs. \"Sable, turn around.\" she says. Sable obeys and Maggie searches her generous ass. Sure enough, she spots your tiny form plastered to her left cheek. She reaches down and peels you off gently. \"You okay, honey?\" she asks as she gives you a kiss. \"Yeah, thanks for finding me.\" you say. It didn't take her long to find you since this has happened before. Whenever Sable comes around Maggie ends up checking her ass, boobs, mouth, and on one occasion her vagina. That leopard is really clumsy. Sable turns around to face you. \"Sorry Neil!\" she says. \"Its fine, Sable.\" you tell her. She tries to pat you on the head but ends up hitting Maggie's paw, sending into her boobs. Maggie sighs and begins fishing you out of her cousin's cleavage. \"So what brings you here?\" she says as she has her hand down her shirt. \"Oh, thats right!\" Sable exclaims.

Well, saw the movers but I didn't actually see the neighbors themselves. Other than the fact that one of them is a plus-sized female monster.\" Maggie took a bite of some lasagna before speaking. \"Barbara Anne said that she already met them. Apparently they're a mixed species couple; human husband and monster wife. But she didn't tell me what kind of monster the wife was. I just hope it's not a naturally ill-tempered monster or we're gonna have trouble.\" Sapphire then ate some lasagna herself before speaking. \"I wonder if they have any kids.\" \"Well,\" you say. \"If they do, Sapphire, you'll have to be diplomatic. After all, you are the sheriff's daughter. But your mother has a point. It would be very bad if the neighbors and us didn't like each other.\" \"What are you worried about Neil?\" says Maggie. \"The worst neighbor we have is a tie between psychotic ex and that home wrecking waste of ectoplasmic slime.\" You let out a laugh before thinking to yourself. \"Not to mention a certain mean ****ing kitty cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you're riding on Maggie's shoulder as she's holding a tin of fresh lasagna. \"I hope you know what you're doing Maggie,\" you say as your giant lioness wife is walking to the new neighbor's house. \"What if they don't like lasagna?\" \"Don't be so negative Neil,\" says Maggie. \"The only problem I see at the moment is that they're next door to Meagan.\" You both pass by Meagan who is sitting in a lawn chair in a bikini and sunglasses and reading the paper with that brace on her neck from where Maggie choked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before Maggie knocks the door and you're about to meet the cross-species couple that will be your new neighbors.

After a few more seconds past by, the sounds of foot steps immediately catches you and your ginormous wife's ears. \"speak of the devil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorway soon opens wide only to reveal an orange colored phoenix woman garbed in a solid black short sleeved shirt and denim jeans that hugged her thighs quite tightly. Her appearance surprisingly looked somewhat like that of a rocker or serious heavy metal enthusiast hinted by the rather short flame colored hair and leather bands wrapped upon her feathered wrist. Upon her shoulder was a rather skinny light tanned man wearing a simple white t-shirt and loose shorts. While he didn't carry many of the rocker like traits compared to his wife, his slightly styled hair and rather calm stance took him as an overall easy laid back person. Overall though, you have absolutely no clue whether these new neighbors would be allies or a complete problem to the neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hello there!\" Maggie greets the two with a large smile on her face. \"Just came to stop by and welcome you to the neighborhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, that's awfully kind of you.\" The Phoenix women smiles as her voice carried a hint of English accent in it. As Maggie presents the tin of lasagna to the ginormous Phoenix, she gingerly takes the sides and nods her head in a thankful manner. \"Smells delicious from here.\" the man says while gazing down at the dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Maggie Reaver and this here is my husband Neil.\" she says as her finger points straight at your rather tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you.\" you reply while giving a friendly wave at the man adorned on the phoenix's shoulder. With a smile, the man quickly returns a wave back to you two in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Adena Blaze.\" The Phoenix introduces herself as her beak points towards the human besides her head. \"and this here is Brick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you two.\" Brick says having the slightly same accent as his ginormous wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze at Adena and Brick, curiosity seems to get the best of your mind as you can't help but ask one main question. \"so, are you two...rock enthusiasts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enthusiasts?\" the two say in unison in a rather confused tone before gazing down at each other dumbfounded. Within seconds a bout of laughter escapes the new neighbors as they try their best to catch their bests. \"we're not only so called rock enthusiasts.\" Adena says with a smile. \"nope! we're musicians.\" Brick finishes as you and Maggie take a quick glance back at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Musicians?\" Maggie asks as her attention quickly returns to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Adena nods. \"Me and Bricky here have been in the music scene for quite some time now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you stammer quite surprised by the reveal. \"So you two have a band?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Brick answers with a shake of his head. \"Just me and my dear hot Adena.\" he says as Adena gazes down at her beloved human with loving eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh me love.\" she coos as she gently ruffles the top of Bricks hair only to cause you and Maggie to chuckle slightly at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, we hope you two enjoy it in the neighborhood.\" you say as Brick and Adena nod their heads in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure we will Neil.\" Brick says as both you and Maggie bid the newcomers farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, they seem pretty nice.\" you say as Maggie began to make her way past the road. \"that they do, and who knows? maybe their music will drive away Meagan.\" She chuckles. \"yeah...but hopefully they won't become an issue to the rest of the neighborhood.\" you say unsure if your new neighbors would crank up the volume all the way up to eleven in the middle of midnight. Once you and Maggie make it back home, you both explain your encounter with the newcomers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?... they're rockers?\" Sapphire asks a bit bewildered by the explanation as you and Maggie nod your heads in response<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and apparently the two are a sort of band.\" Maggie adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh...what are their names?\" Sapphire asks as her head cranes slightly to the right curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Phoenix's name is Adena, and the human's name is Brick Blaze.\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaze?...you mean the Blaze's!?\" Sapphire shouts in extreme surprise by the reveal of the neighbors identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah...why? do you happen to know them Sapphire?\" Maggie asks as her brow raises slightly from her daughters stupefied reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"of course! those two are-\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Surprisingly Flint is in a bad mood and holding his head and yelling. No surprise since there's loud enka music playing next door that's working on his nerves. If he had nerves. \"Turn off that racket! You're driving me crazy! It's been ten freakin' hours already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Meryl are watching as Flint is yelling out the glass patio door, only for his shouting to be drowned out by that loud music. Meryl lets out a sigh and takes a swig of bottled water. You don't know why she bothers as you watch the liquid literally go through her bony body. \"It's happening again,\" says Meryl. \"Two new neighbors moved in next door. Real party animals.\" \"From the sounds of it,\" you say. \"Wait, did Flint say ten hours? It's only nine in the morning! You're kidding me!\" You could see why Flint was mad. You didn't know whether or not golems needed sleep so you can't tell if the big guy's sleep deprived but he's still mad nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me about this?\" you ask Meryl. \"I could've told Maggie and gotten that rave shut down.\" \"Flint said he didn't want to bother Maggie,\" says Meryl. \"He's been trying to ignore it but he's about to crack. The new neighbors are a couple of oni and you know how they can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a crashing sound and a beer bottle from next door was tossed out and it hit the patio door as it broke and spilled beer all over. This caused Flint to yell some words it's best aren't written down. \"Burgess!\" you yell. \"Flint has quite a colorful vocabulary.\" \"Yeah,\" says Meryl. \"You would not believe what comes out of his mouth when Emerald's at school.\" \"Dammit Meryl!\" yells Flint. \"That's it! No more Mr. Nice Guy! I'm going to give those &amp;$*@ing oni a piece of my mind.\" \"Wait, wait, wait!\" You say as Flint is almost out the door. Flint turns his stone head to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting upset isn't going to do you any good. I think I should come along to try and settle this through conversation, not confrontation.\" \"Neil's right, dear.\" Said Meryl. Flint lets out a sigh and places you on his shoulder before walking out. You see the neighbors have the lights on even though it's sunny outside and that there are at least seventeen people at that rave. \"You gotta be kidding me,\" you say. \"It's been this way all morning.\" \"You don't know the half of it.\" Says Flint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you reach the front door. Flint rings the doorbell but even he can't hear it over the noise and then resorts to pounding the door. It's not long before the door opens and reveals... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well this is unbelievable on all possible levels that you can imagine. To be really honest, it is quite rare for a human being in general to be married to a monster that is the size of buildings, living in a neighborhood that is full of monsters that size, so it is fare that it is rare that a human like you is captured by an ex-girlfriend monster, and is taken to an unknown location. Meagan surely has something planned up for you, and you really don\u2019t want to know. God you hope Maggie forgives you later if she finds out that you are cheating on her, although you actually never intended to cheat on her at all since you are currently at this moment forced to. You tried to say something to her, but since she\u2019s got you covered in her hands, she might not be able to hear you, but you try it. \u201cYou know, if you actually want to eat me right now, why don\u2019t you just do that and be done with me?\u201d you said to her, although you aren\u2019t asking for debt, but to reasons why and where she is taking you. She continues to run until she happens to see some sort of a beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are nearly there.\u201d She said excitedly, just as she is getting prepared for her exciting day. She eventually touches the sands of the nice and beautiful beach, however the people is an entirely another story, and boy is it another story. She sees that all of the monsters around her, like weresnakes, weregorillas, gargoyles, some dragons that actually use 4 legs, or just better in general, any inhuman monster that she can think of are just plain flat out nude. She likes this sight of nudity around her. They are times where she can just think of the possibilities that can happen. This is a complete nude beach, as soon as she got onto the sand; Meagan then releases you onto the sand floor, what you saw is something you didn\u2019t wanted to see at all. \u201cWe are here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, oh no\u2026 oh no\u2026.. oh no\u2026\u2026 oh no\u2026\u2026 oh no\u2026..  at least I know now that I will never allow my daughter to come here, otherwise she is surely grounded..\u201d  You said just as you look to see all sorts of inhuman creatures, like one gargoyle that is pink but has her entire body exposed in the sun, and she is even getting a tan as well. Her body also smells like it has been not only roasted, but also stinks as well, as you can tell that she didn\u2019t shower at all. You actually puked just upon smelling her, and Meagan laughs as if she is going to try to make you suffer in every single way. \u201cNow do you see what I brought you here? I really think that you and I can start bonding back with each other, and perhaps try to go back to the things that it used to be, and also so I can get some tasty revenge.\u201d Meagan laughed just as she means to get revenge on you. She is right, you did cheated on her, but at least it wasn\u2019t for the reasons that you would come to expect in real life or those reality shows, for mostly hot sexy looks. You try to turn your head away and try not to look at the breasts, vaginas, or any of that stuff that the other monster girls have at the moment, but Meagan laughs. \u201cJust what I thought, you are a big coward; no wonder why you chosen Maggie, or should I say, a filthy whore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is no whore, she is a loving and caring wife, and I would never willingly cheat on her at\u2026\u201d you tried to yell up to the fat bitch Meagan before her she shows her teeth right then, scaring the crap out of you, and even makes you reconsider what you just say. \u201call. Look, I just don\u2019t want a problem at all okay. I have my life where it is going right now, and you have your own life to worry about.\u201d You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you saying something like that?\u201d Meagan says with a evil glare on her face just as she shows her teeth again, and that makes you want to reconsider, and trying to tell her in the nicest way possible is the best option that is sadly not available at the very moment. Still, it is worth a try. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be with someone like me. I am surely way better that that useless\u2026\u201d Meagan shouted right at you just before you completely got fed up with her insults towards your life. As a husband you have to stand your ground, and you would never in your life cheat on Maggie, so it was about time you stop being a coward and stand up for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT IS ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d you shouted right at her face and then spit right on it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to yell this. But I AM SICK AND TIRED OF YOU OF CALLING MY WIFE A BITCH!!!!!!!!!! SHE ISN\u2019T A BITCH, AND THAT IS WHY I LEFT YOU, AS SHE SAW ME FOR HOW I AM, AND I SAW HER FOR WHAT SHE IS, AND THAT IS IN A PERSON, YOU JUST WANT ME TO BE WITH YOU AS YOU CARED FOR ME ALL THESE YEARS, WELL YES I LOVE YOU, BUT I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF YOU TRYING TO INTERRUPT MY LIFE WITH MAGGIE, SO WHY NOT YOU JUST SCURRY ALONG WITH YOUR ONE TAIL BEFORE I HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE RIGHT UP ON YOU, AS I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF YOU TREATING ME LIKE I AM YOUR BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d you shouted with all the rage and anger in yourself as you have had it with her. \u201cSO PLEASE, I DON\u2019T WANT ANYMORE PROBLEMS, JUST LET ME ENJOY MY LIFE. BESIDES, WE ARE STILL FRIENDS.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Meagan is slightly confused but then she feels somebody tapping on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Meagan.\" Says a hostile sounding voice behind your ex-girlfriend. Meagan nervously turns around and looks in fear at Maggie growling at her and staring down at her with rage. Meagan is too scared to even speak. \"Put my husband down.\" Warns your lioness wife. Meagan complies and puts you on the newspaper on the ground before Maggie grabs her by the chin and causes her to gag. Maggie then proceeds to beat the everliving crap out of Meagan before tossing the werefox to the ground. Maggie even stomps on Meagan's fat stomach for good measure and makes the vulpine giantess groan as you watch from the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your last warning, Reynard!\" growls Maggie to the defeated fox on the ground. \"If you try anything again, if you so much as lay one finger on my husband, it's the stoney lonesome for you! Understand!?\" Meagan growls and weakly nods her head as she lays in pain on the sidewalk. \"I'll be watching you, you canine creep,\" says Maggie. \"Remember, not one finger.\" Maggie shows her claws to further warn Meagan about the consequences before letting out a roar. Meagan weakly gets up and retreats towards her own lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie purrs in victory and then picks you up to put on her shoulder and holds up the newspaper. \"Thanks, Honey,\" you say as you kiss Maggie in the cheek. \"Meagan was that close to eating me that time.\" Maggie purred. \"Well, don't you worry, Baby,\" she says. \"Meagan knows she could never beat me in a fight.\" You both share a laugh and walk inside, leaving Meagan to stagger back into her house.</span></div></div>",

You told Raven your idea: you would curse Maggie so that every time she hears a \"Your Mom's so Fat\" joke, she does the action in the joke and gets fatter.

You'd think getting the stuffing beat out of her for the umpteenth time would teach her what happens when she messes with my man.\" You rub Maggie by the ear as she purrs. Sapphire gets into the passenger's seat of the car and Maggie is about to enter the car herself when she hears Meagan shout \"Hey fatass!\" Maggie turns her head and then growls because as soon as Meagan has her attention, she proceeds to toss a water balloon that makes a direct hit in your wife's face. Meagan then pulls down her lower eyelid as she sticks out her tongue at Maggie and then runs back to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie lets out a growl and you hold on tight to her hair. \"You're extremely lucky I have to take my daughter to school, you malcontent mutt. When I get back, I'm going to put you in the pound.\" Maggie turns on the car and drives away. \"That was surprisingly bold of Meagan,\" you say. \"Usually she doesn't directly attack you, Maggie.\" Maggie spits out some of the water and then shows her teeth. \"You're right. I wonder what that little canine creep is up to.\" Sapphire shrugs her shoulders. \"Don't look at me. I wasn't around when the beef started.\" \"That's for sure,\" you say with a laugh. \"Without that beef you wouldn't be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as soon as you and Maggie drop Sapphire off, there's already trouble. \"Get away from me, Creepshow!\" yells a voice that sounds a lot like Pearl. \"Come on, Sirtis. You might never get this lucky again.\" Sapphire looked out the window and growled. Pearl appeared to be harassed by a purplish-pink skinned incubus with long insect like horns. From the looks of it, he was the same height as Pearl and therefore half as big as Sapphire. \"It's that jerk, Arrow again,\" mutters Sapphire. \"That lousy pervert. I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind.\" Sapphire gets out of the car to confront her friend's assaulter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl.\" You and Maggie both say. The incubus has Pearl by the wrists before he turns around to see Sapphire angrily looking down on him. Arrow is clearly afraid. \"Let go of Pearl, Arrow,\" says Sapphire. \"Or else.\" \"Or else what, Reaver?\" asks Arrow. \"You'll sit on me, fat cat.\" Sapphire shows Arrow her claws. \"So I'm fat,\" she says. \"Big deal. I'm only going to tell you this once. Leave Pearl alone or I'll turn you over to my mom. The sheriff in case you forgot.\" Of course, incubi are not easily intimidated and Arrow gives a scoff. \"That fat cat makes you look like a twig.\" \"What was that?\" asks Sapphire with a growl. It was there, you were about to see the effects of Raven's potion on Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, Sapphire. Yo Mama so fat....\"</span></div></div>",

Lucky for this troglodyte that we have class.\" \"You know I'm right, Sapphire!\" yells Arrow smugly. \"You're already nearly as fat as she is right now.\" Sapphire just tried to ignore Arrow. \"I'll admit,\" says Sapphire. \"Mom isn't the skinniest monster I've ever seen, but that's no reason to be nasty about it.\" \"You should see my cousin Fate,\" says Pearl with a scoff. \"She probably weighs even more than your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Meagan's nasty spell was about to take effect. Maggie and you were driving down the street in the car as you were sitting on Maggie's shoulder. \"Maggie,\" you say. \"I thought I heard that incubus kid making fun of your weight back there.\" \"So what?\" asked Maggie. \"Like I care what someone things of my weight. I have to make a quick stop, Neil. There should be an ATM right around here. Aha.\" Maggie parked the car and then walked up to an ATM machine that was right next to a restaurant that looked like it was closing down. It was a restaurant that appeared to have a lemon shaped roof. \"Condemned,\" you say. \"Looks like they're finally tearing down the Big Lemon.\" Maggie walked right up to an ATM machine at the side of the restaurant. \"I heard. Ever since that incident with the scarab the health inspector found in his burger.\" \"Well you can hardly blame him, Maggie. It wasn't even cooked properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie then took out her debit card and then tried to use it to get money out of the ATM. However, she dropped the card and couldn't see it past her large stomach. \"Dammit!\" yells your lioness wife.\" You hold on tight to Maggie's hair as Maggie bends over and tries to find her card. \"Aha. There's the cheater. As Maggie reaches for her card, she accidentally brings her butt up against the Big Lemon and you hear the sound of wood breaking. \"What the?\" you ask. Maggie picks up her card and leaps back, further hitting the building with her titanic booty and this causes what's left of the support to come down and the entire restaurant falls back with a loud crash. \"Holy crap!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie turns around and looks in surprise. \"What just happened?\" she asked. \"Uh, Maggie,\" you say. \"I think my favorite part of you just demolished the Big Lemon.\" Maggie then blushes in embarrassment. \"Thank Zeus that it was scheduled to be demolished today anyway. That's odd. That building shouldn't have been able to be toppled so easily. Is my butt really that big? Oh well.\" As Maggie was tending to the ATM machine, she had no idea that her butt appeared to be swelling and her green leotard was looking more painted on than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you and Maggie had arrived at Maggie's office to see that Irma had a truck tire stuck around her head and obscuring her eyes as she was trying to paint the side of the office. \"Don't ask.\" Said Irma as she walked away. Maggie then looked around. \"I wonder where Jolene is,\" she said. \"It's not like her to be late.\" Irma managed to pull the tire off of her head and as she looked at Maggie she was surprised. \"Did you gain weight, Sheriff? Your ass looks bigger than it usually is.\" Maggie just turned and glared at Irma to tell her to leave her alone. You look back and realize that Irma had a point. \"She has a point, Maggie,\" you say. \"You've been eating a lot of brachiosaurus lately. Maybe you are getting bigger.\" You then smile at that fact. \"That would be totally hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Jolene was arguing with Flint who was in handcuffs. \"Jolene, what are you using for brains! I was just dropping my daughter off at school.\" \"Oh yeah?\" asks Jolene. \"Is that why you traveled with your blinker on for ten minutes.\" Maggie rolled her eyes as you looked in surprise to see your sister's husband in cuffs. \"Hey, Flint.\" You say. \"Jolene,\" says Maggie. \"Please release my sister-in-law's husband.\" Jolene let out a hiss and undid the cuffs. \"What the hell did your mother do to you?\" asks Flint. Jolene gave a gasp. \"You bite your stony tongue!\" \"Don't blow your top, Jolene,\" says Flint. \"And speaking of mothers, Maggie, yours said a rather nasty thing about Meryl yesterday.\" You were not amused by that. It's one thing for Cattleya to be mean to you, but to be mean to your younger skeleton sister was another thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie let out a sigh. \"Calm down, Flint. You know my mom hates humans, and monsters that used to be humans.\" \"Well that mother of yours is nothing but trouble. She asked what I could possibly see in Meryl for not having any meat on her. She's one to talk about meat. Your mother is so fat...\"</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, it was already schedualed for demolition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Flint laughed. \"Seriously? Hey, maybe if being a sheriff doesn't work out, you can take a job in construction. As the wreaking ball!\" He said between laughs. On that, he walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie rolled her eyes, and started for her office, you in tow. Just then, she heard Irma sigh. she turned to look at her. Irma was staring out a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Maggie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's going to rain. And I had plans to go walking on the trails later.\" Irma replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rain? I though the weather report said it'd be clear today?\" You ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie shrugged. \"You can't always believe weathermen. Remember last year? We tried to go camping on what was supposed to be a sunny day, then that freak snowstorm hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how does a snowstorm hit in June?\" You ask. Maggie just shrugs and heads to her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went by normally, save for the unexpected rain, which turned into a downpour half-way through. Since you couldn't go to work in this weather, Maggie called the salon to tell them you weren't able to be in today. So you just helped Maggie out. When the day was over and everyone left, Maggie grabbed a yellow raincoat of the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to your blue one?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last week, Sapphire needed it for a science project, and that project caught fire and burned it.\" Maggie replied, putting on the coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I forgot.\" You say, as Maggie puts you in one of the coats pockets. Maggie then walks out of the station and heads for her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAXI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie turned at the voice and saw the human-turned-succubus Lee Gin running towards her. She was wearing a red raincoat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for stopping.\" Lee said when she got up to Maggie. \"Can you take me to-\" She looks up and sees that she's not in front of a taxi. \"Oh, sorry Maggie. With that coat and through this rain, I thought you were a taxi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie raised an eyebrow. \"Ok, well, do you need a ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my car overheated and I left my cell phone home.\" Lee explained. I'm meeting a friend at the 9to5 Diner. Can you drop me off there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Maggie replied, and the two of them got in Maggie's car. You were in her pocket the whole time, but you could feel something. It was like her coat was being streched out. When you looked up at your wife, you swore she looked a bit fatter again. You were confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Neil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and see Lee looking at you from the passenger seat. You wave back. \"Hi Lee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie takes you out of her pocket and puts you on the dashboard. From here, you saw your wife better. She did look slightly fatter, though only in her belly and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's your daughter doing?\" Maggie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, though she got in a fight today with someone. She would't tell me who. Apparently, this other was mocking me, so she fought back with one of those, what are they, Yo Mama jokes.\" Lee explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Maggie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she told me she said, 'Yo Mama So Fat...'\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though, I'm literally too thick-skinned for it to bother me. In fact, if I was anything like the kind of twig Donna is, I wouldn't be so lucky.\" With that the succubus blew a kiss and Maggie rolled her eyes. \"Give me a break. Some idiot tried to pull one of those stupid jokes on Sapphire earlier and my sister-in-law's husband said a rather unpleasing one about my mother.\" \"Not that it was undeserved.\" You say under your breath. It was at that moment, Maggie drives up to the 9 to 5 diner and at that moment the rain stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" said Lee. \"What do you know? Thanks, Maggie. I really appreciate this.\" Lee then takes out her makeup kit and starts to apply lipstick. \"I thought you were meeting with a friend.\" You say. Lee puckers her lips. \"I am, a very friendly friend.\" Before you could say anything, Maggie's ears twitch because she hears something strange. \"Huh?\" asks your lioness wife. \"What's wrong, Maggie?\" you ask. It was at that moment, flames came down from the sky. \"Good grief!\" you yell. Maggie looks closer to see that the flames coming down were actually meteors. \"Oh no.\" Groans Maggie. Maggie then yells as every last meteor proceeds to come down from the sky and bounce off of her rather large stomach as they land harmlessly on the ground. Lee looks in absolutely shock and even drops her lipstick. Once every last meteor has been deflected, Maggie rubs her stomach. Being a Nemean lion, the meteors falling couldn't have hurt her indestructible skin, but what happened had to be very uncomfortable. \"Heavens to Betsy,\" says Lee. \"A meteor shower. What are the chances?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you say in shock. \"What are the chances?\" Maggie lets out a growl. \"Today is turning out to be really crummy,\" she says. \"First Meagan hits me with a water balloon, then I demolish a building with my ass and now...\" Lee raises an eyebrow. \"You demolished a building with your ass. Damn, I wish I could do that with my ass. Then I'd get twice as much action.\" Maggie scoffs. \"With your kind of action, it's a wonder that you don't have more than just Donna. First it was that incubus that turned you into a demon and then it was a downwards spiral.\" Lee just wiggled her ass and waved her demon tail. \"And one I've grown accustomed to. Heavens to Betsy! I almost forgot. I'm going to need you to pick up Donna from school. Would you be a dear?\" Maggie nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Maggie is walking to the car, you hear a ripping sound and see that Maggie's cleavage appears to be outgrowing her leotard that is tearing at the neck hole and her stomach appears to have gotten so much bigger than you can see her navel through the leotard. \"Something wrong Neil?\" asks Maggie. You just shake your head. You really don't want to tell your wife that she's fat...ter than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Maggie arrives and finds Sapphire waiting with Lee's daughter, Donna Gin. Donna was the last thing anyone expected of a succubus. Sure, she had her mother's gray skin and light blue hair and horns, but Donna was scrawny, flat-chested and 300ft tall. She also wore swirled glasses like you'd see in an anime. The fact was that Donna was a nerd, the last thing anyone expects a succubus to be. Donna was also a timid wimp as she hid behind Sapphire when Maggie came forward. \"Hi, Donna,\" says Maggie. \"Hi, Sapphire. How was school?\" \"Awful,\" says Sapphire. \"That stupid Arrow kept harassing me all day.\" Maggie gives a growl. \"I am going to have to have a word with that incubus's parents about his behavior.\" Donna holds her head down. \"He said some awful things about my mom.\" \"Yes,\" you say. \"We know about the meteor joke.\" \"Not just that,\" says Sapphire. \"He harassed Pearl again and said something awful about Ms. Sirtis.\" \"Shit\" Maggie groans under her breath quiet enough that Sapphire can't hear her. You knew for a fact that Pearl's mother, Fortuna may have been pear-shaped but she was nowhere near as heavy as Maggie or Lee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he say about Pearl's mother, exactly?\" asks Maggie. \"He told Pearl,\" said Sapphire. \"You Mama so fat...\"</span></div></div>",

Can you believe that? It wasn't even funny. It was just dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie frowned. \"No, it's not. Believe it or not, I've heard better. Why don't we just get going. Donna, you're mom wanted me to pick you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded and headed for the car, Sapphire and Maggie coming up from behind. She then notices you on Maggie's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... um... you must me Sapphire's dad.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. It's nice to meet you, Donna.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiles sheepishly. The four of you get in the car and drive off, you on the dashboard. You get about halfway home when you come up to a bridge under construction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! I forgot they were fixing this.\" Maggie said, and started to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Bill! Get the crane ready! We've got a wide load coming through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie immediatly hits the brakes, sending you flying into the windshield. You're dizzy, but fine. Maggie rolls down the window and glares out at the person who spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny, Ted. I've been through enough today.\" Maggie angerly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Mags. It's just a bit of fun.\" Ted, the idiot werewolf who made the joke, said. \"Construction gets boring after a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ted!\" Bill, Ted's ghost friend, yelled. \"Quit yapping! Foreman Rufus wants to talk to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! See ya, Mags.\" Ted says. Maggie rolls her eyes and drives off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up shakily. You look at your wife and are surprised. You could actually see her boobs and belly growing, ripping her leotard more. You couldn't figure out how she wasn't feeling the rips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what did you mean by 'Been through enough'?\" Sapphire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This day has been bizarre. First, Meagan hits me with a water balloon, then my ass knocks down the old Big Lemon, then it starts raining for no reason, then Lee mistakes me for a taxi, then some metero's bounce of my stomach. Nothing's been making sense today.\" Maggie explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the four of you reach your home. Everyone steps out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Ms. Reaver?\" Donna asks nervously. \"Do... do you mind if I stay the night? My moms going to be out all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie smiles. \"Of course you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk up to the front door, you see some teens down the sidewalk. They seem to be arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you can see her legs on her driver's license photo.\" One says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Another replies. \"Well, Yo Mama's so fat...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, at least now that the soil is wet I can finally plant my Atlantean wild blossoms. Make yourself right at home, Donna. I'm gonna be busy in the garden.\" As Maggie walks out back, Sapphire can't help but stare at her. \"Is it just me?\" the teenage mer-lioness thought to herself. \"Or does Mom look even fatter than she usually is.\" Sapphire looked back at her own rather large butt as she scratched the side of her head as Donna sits down on the couch and turns on the television before she screams as the Shocker appears on the television. Sapphire quickly changes the channel to something more pleasant. \"Sorry,\" says Sapphire. \"Shocker's Tales is Dad's favorite show. He loves these thriller anthologies.\" Donna just huffs before Sapphire starts changing the channel again and again before she sees something and winces. \"Oh man, I hate this show. Ruined perfectly good superheroes for this junk. Ah, here's something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sapphire and Donna are busy watching TV, Maggie places you on a rock as she bends over to plant her Atlantean wild blossoms. You have a good view of your favorite part of your lioness wife, namely her titanic rear. \"Now,\" says Maggie. \"This looks like a good spot.\" Maggie picks up the glowing blue flowers and smiles as she begins to plant them. Next door, Summer is returning from work and is exhausted. Although you had no idea what the werehyena giantess actually did for a living. \"Ugh,\" says Summer. \"What a rotten day at work.\" Maggie smiles. \"You should take up gardening, Summer. It's very relaxing.\" Suddenly there was the sound of a propellor. \"What the heck?!\" yells Maggie. Summer looks out and drops her jaw. \"Good grief!\" You look up and then shut your eyes as Maggie grunts. Sure enough a helicopter had landed on top of her gigantic ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire and Donna run out to investigate and sees the helicopter piloted by Meryl. \"Aunt Meryl?!\" asks Sapphire. \"What are you doing?\" Meryl gives a grin on her skeletal face. \"Hi, Sapphire. Hi, Neil. You'll never guess what happened. I just got a job that requires a helicopter's license. Guess my big brother will be eating his words about that license being useless. By the way, where's... oh my!\" Meryl turns around to see her helicopter on top of Maggie's ass and Maggie's eye is twitching in pure frustration. \"Oh, sorry about that Maggie.\" Your skeletal sister gets back into the craft and then moves it off of her sister-in-law. If Meryl had any blood left, you swear she would be blushing. You don't see it but across the street Meagan is laughing at Maggie's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, even after the copter had been moved, Maggie sits up as her ass appears to expand and Donna gasps. \"Good grief.\" Says Sapphire. Finally, Maggie hears a loud tearing sound and turns around to see that her leotard had torn apart from the back of the neck down and revealed her Thundercat panties that look tight on her larger than usual ass. Maggie's eye twitches again and she even bites her lip. \"Maggie,\" you say in concern. \"Are you feeling okay?\" Maggie at this point is so frustrated that she scratches the fence and causes Summer to nervously back away. \"I'm fine, Dear,\" says Maggie uneasily. \"Just having a really terrible day. I just have one more thing to say. If I hear one more \"Yo Mama\" joke, just <i>one</i> more joke, I am going to MALICIOUSLY TEAR SOMEBODY APART!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna hides behind Sapphire and shivers as Sapphire herself is scared stiff. \"I better get dinner ready. Mom, I think maybe a good meal will put you in a better mood.\" Maggie just lets out a groan. Summer was walking back inside when she heard the voice of somebody she least wanted to hear. \"One, Two, Hey me do, Neighborina.\" Summer lets out a sigh and turns to see that chipper spriggan, Flora Flanders, the bane of her existence. \"Flanders,\" says Summer. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" Flora smiled. \"My mother is coming over this weekend and I want to introduce her to all my friends. Here's a photograph of her.\" Summer lets out a grunt before she sees the photograph of Flora's mom and is surprised. \"Good grief, Flanders,\" says Summer. \"I've seen some big boned fairies before but this takes the cake.\" \"What do you mean, Friend Summer?\" \"Look at this photograph. She's huge. Yo Mama so fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie's eyes pop upon hearing this and her eyes begin to twitch. \"Oh shit.\".</span></div></div>",

Yo Mama so fat, when she stepped on a scale, it said 'To Be Continued'.\" Summer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's still kind of mean, friend Summer.\" Flora said. \"But I will admit, it was kind of funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie at this point was seething with anger, so you had to calm her down. \"Maggie, sweetie, calm down. Look, I'll see if Sapphire can make your favorite: brachiosaurus stew. How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie breathed and calmed down. \"Yeah, that sounds nice.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could reply, you both heard a crashing sound. Maggie races into the house, grabbing you and putting you on her shoulder, only to see Donna cowering behind Sapphire. Looking, you see a part of the wall had broken and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphire, what happened?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I was just going to show Donna to guest room, when part of the wall just fell.\" Sapphire says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie goes over to pick up the wall piece. When she does, she sees a picture underneath it. When she picked up the picture, she saw that it was of her on the day she was promoted to Sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember that day.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie does smile, then places the picture on the coffee table. As she does, Sapphire picks you up off of Maggie's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, can I talk to you?\" Sapphire asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what is it?\" Say reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire lowers her voice so Maggie won't hear. \"Has mom noticed she's getting... bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. \"No, I don't think she has. It's weird. All day, these odd things have been happening, and every time, I see Maggie getting fatter. It's the weirdest thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sapphire turn to Maggie. Sure enough, her ass was getting bigger again, turning her Thundercats panties into a Thundercats thong. You were worried. As much as you loved your wife's size, this was odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe dinner will be normal.\" Sapphire said.<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\nAnd she was right. Dinner went fairly well. Sapphire made Maggie brachiosaurus stew, while everyone else had pteridactyl marinara. After dinner, Maggie went into the bathroom to wash up while you stayed at the table with Donna and Sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, not to be rude, but was your mom always this big?\" Donna asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's always been a big woman, but lately she has been growing.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone can continue, you hear your wife from the bathroom. \"Neil! Sapphire! Could you come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire picks you up and heads to the bathroom. Inside, you see your wife is standing on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need?\" Sapphire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, on a whim, I decided to step on the scale, but I can't see it. Can you look and see what it say?\" Maggie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sapphire nod and kneel down to see the scale. What you saw confused you. The scale read \"To Be Continued.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Maggie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it says 'To Be Continued'.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie pinches her nose. \"Just what I needed. An insulting scale. Our scale only shows numbers. Heck, our scale isn't even electronic. How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" You say. You then look up and see your wife's belly growing. You just couldn't figure it out. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie sighed. \"I'm going to take a bath. Maybe that will calm me down.\" Maggie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sapphire nod and leave the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, what just happened? Our scale can't do that.\" Sapphire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew.\" You reply.<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Maggie was lounging in the bathtub. She had decided on a warm bubble bath, and she was glad she did. For the first time today, she felt calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, though, Meagan was peeking through the open window in the bathroom. She smiled. Things were going just as she had hoped. Grinning, she placed a tape recorder on the windowsill, pushed play, and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie's eyes shot open when she heard those dreaded four word: \"Yo Mama so Fat...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh, that's it! It's fox season!\" However, as Maggie is about to go after Meagan, she grunts. \"What the?! Oh no!\" It would appear that the evil curse had struck yet again and Maggie's bulk had expanded to the point where she was stuck in the tub. \"Oh ****!\" yells your lioness wife. Meagan can't help but laugh at Maggie's predicament as she's struggling. \"When I get out of here, Meagan, I'm going to skin you alive, you fleabag!!\" \"Better a flea bag than a beanbag, Fatcat!\" yells Meagan right before she pulls down her eyelid to taunt Maggie and runs off. Maggie lets out a loud and angry growl but then groans because she realizes exactly how helpless she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neil!\" she yells. \"Sapphire! I'm in the middle of a crisis!\" Sapphire carries you into the bathroom and gasps to see Maggie stuck and naked in the tub. \"Oh my gosh.\" You say. Maggie then glares at you and Sapphire. \"Not a word from either of you.\" She says. It isn't long until Sapphire calls in Flint, Meryl, Summer and Flora to help get Maggie out of that situation. \"Good heavens, Maggie,\" says Summer as she hammered a pulley into the ceiling. \"And I thought my sister was morbidly obese. You don't look like you can even walk. Ouch!\" Flora was hammering in the pulley system as well but was blindfolded. \"Flanders,\" mutters Summer. \"You idiot. Take off your blindfold.\" \"I can't, Macbeth,\" says Flora. \"Sheriff Reaver is naked.\" Summer is surprised but then growls in frustration. \"I'm naked all the time and that doesn't seem to bother you, you stupid Flanders!\" Maggie was beyond humiliated as Flint and Meryl hooked her up into a harness. \"I've never seen anyone gain so much weight so fast,\" says Flint. \"What have you been eating, Maggie.\" \"Maybe she's infected with nebutori,\" says Meryl. \"Not that I'd ever have to worry about it.\" Meryl let out a laugh as Maggie gave a sour look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna walks up behind Sapphire as she's watching what's happening. \"Your mom isn't having a very good day is she?\" asks Donna nervously. \"And she's not in a good mood. I didn't know she was so ferocious.\" Sapphire gives a growl but then lets out a sigh. \"It's just one of those Mondays,\" says your titanic daughter. \"But this seems over the top. Everything's going insane and every time it happens, Mom gets bigger.\" Sapphire was all too right. As Flint and Summer were pulling on the pulleys and lifting Maggie you see that your wife would probably weigh at least 4 tons had she been human-sized. Her feet looked minuscule on her enormous legs. \"I like big women,\" you say to yourself. \"But this is ridiculous. Why is Maggie getting so fat so fast? It doesn't make any sense.\" \"Steady, Flint,\" said Maggie. \"Steady.\" However, the ropes break and Maggie lands with a crash, creating a hole in the bathroom floor leading into the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother Doomsday!\" yelled Meryl. \"Maggie? Are you alright?\" \"Do I <i>look</i> alright to you, Skull-Face?!\" Maggie is struggling to get up off her back in the basement as she roars angrily. As Maggie is struggling, Summer looks around. \"Hey, where's Flora?\" Maggie finally manages to get out and reveals Flora, flattened but still alive, on the floor underneath her. \"Flora!\" yells Summer in out-of-character worry. Flora groans as she lays on the floor in pain. \"That's gonna hurt tomorrow.\" This doesn't do much good for Maggie's self-esteem. \"Sapphire,\" says Maggie with a sigh. \"Please call the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Flora is taken away in an ambulance (and Summer leaves to make sure she's alight), Maggie is forced to cut the curtains off to stitch into a makeshift leotard. She's ordered Sapphire and Donna to plug their ears while she rants about what happened. \"Every single mother****ing time I've hear those ****ing four-letter words, \"Yo Mama so fat\", something ****ing bad has to ****ing happen!\" \"Calm down, Maggie,\" you say as you try to maintain your footing on Maggie's right boob. \"Calm down!\" Meryl and Flint could only stare at how titanically fat Maggie had become. \"And I thought she was a blimp before,\" says Meryl. \"She's going to end up like Ambrosine Peinture if this continues.\" \"There's still that wrecking ball option.\" Jokes Flint. \"And there's still that job listing for cinderblocks if a certain golem doesn't shut his trap,\" replies Maggie. \"First the Big Lemon, then the rain, then Lee, then those idiot construction workers, then that sister-in-law of mine and her ****ing helicopter job, then the wall, then the scale and now this minotaur shit! What the actual....?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maggie,\" you say. \"Calm down. You're extra mad this time.\" Maggie snaps her jaws angrily. \"These things only happen after I hear those four dreaded words. The most recent offender being that lousy ex of....\" Maggie then realizes something and becomes very enraged. \"Meagan! I should've known! This mess started when that damn fox threw that water balloon at me. This must be some kind of a curse.\" Before you can say anything, you slip into Maggie's squishier than usual cleavage as she waddles off angrily, tearing the doorway a new one in the process. \"This won't end well.\" Said Meryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip into your wife's fat and grunt as Maggie waddles across the street to see Meagan raking leaves while her chimeric dog is busy sleeping away. \"Reynard!\" shouts Maggie at the top of her lungs. Meagan sees the lioness who is at this point 5 times bigger and bulkier than she is and smirks. \"Well, if it isn't the lard of the jungle.\" Maggie growls at her vulpine nemesis. \"I don't know whether to arrest you, shoot you or smother you to death with my rolls. You put a curse on me, you mutt!\" Meagan gives a smirk. \"Well it serves you right, you man-stealer.\" \"Don't give me that crap, Meagan. You blew it with Neil. Instead of moving on, you have to be an asshole. I'm going to pummel you so severe that you'll need a machine just to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold that thought, Moggie,\" says Meagan smugly calling Maggie by a rather unflattering nickname. \"But Yo Mama so fat....\"</span></div></div>",

At that, Meagan takes off running, with Maggie following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibrations from Maggie running actually throw you out of her cleavage and up near her head. Freaked out, you manage to grab a strand of Maggies hair and hold on tight. As you do, you look around and see an awful sight: Maggie's footsteps actually are making the neighborhood shake. Trash cans are falling over, car alarms are going off, and you swore you saw cracks in the pavement from where Maggie stepped. This was getting out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Maggie runs out of energy and has to stop. You let go of her hair and, luckily, land on her shoulder. You look at your wife and see that she's blown up again. She now looks like she'd weigh 8 tons if she were human. She was panting heavily.

Jolene and Irma can only stare as their boss is futilely trying to get back on her feet which have all but been swallowed by her massive thighs. Jolene even pokes Maggie slightly in the stomach before Irma slaps her and shakes her head at her. \"Uh, boss,\" says Jolene. \"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you can't move on your own.\" Maggie lets out a growl. \"Doesn't look like it. Damn that Meagan. I'm completely immobile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie then grunts and you duck into your wife's ear as her deputies try to push her. Of course, Maggie is at this point so heavy that Jolene and Irma are grunting as it takes all the effort they have just to move the bloated feline a single inch. \"Odin's beard,\" groaned Irma. \"She's ten times heavy than before. What's left of my back feels like it's going to break any minute.\" Jolene was panting and extended her forked tongue. \"Geez, Sheriff. I know you're a big eater and the women in your family are built like sumo wrestlers but what did you eat to get so big.\" Maggie gives a growl. \"Nothing. That idiot Meagan placed some weird curse on me that makes me grow larger whenever somebody makes a joke that starts with, \"Yo Mama so Fat\".\" \"Oh,\" says Jolene. \"Like Yo Mama so fat, her stomach blotted out the sun.\" At that exact moment, a large shadow was cast over Jolene and Irma and Maggie had gotten even fatter to the point where she was almost spherical and you slip and fall into your wife's breasts as you groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie gives a glare. \"Irma, I'm going to clobber you when this is ov...AAAAAA!\" Maggie yells as she slips and starts rolling down the street. \"Oh my gosh!\" yells Jolene.

Maggie has crashed right through the wall of the house as Donna and Sapphire look in surprise. Maggie groans as she tries to reposition herself. \"Sapphire,\" she says. \"Donna.

It was your next door neighbor, the werehyena, Summer Macbeth, in all her naked muscle bound glory. From the look on her face she wasn't in a good mood, not that she ever was. Still she would never harm a human, so as she's picking up her own newspaper, you decide to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Summer!\" you yell up to her. Summer turns and looks down on you. \"What's so good about it Neil,\" she replies. \"Don't poke the hyena. I'm not in the mood for chatting today.\" You stand up your newspaper as Summer starts walking back towards her house. That was when Summer's other neighbor, Flora the spriggan pokes her head over the fence separating their yards. \"Hi diddly-deena, neighborina hyena!\" shouts Flora in her chipper mood. \"Wonderful day we're having Macbeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer was not particularly fond of Flora nor her cheerful demeanor and looks at the fairy with disdain. \"Uh-oh,\" says Flora. \"Someone's grumpy. Come on Summer, a smile's a rainbow you wear on your face.\" \"Shut up Flanders!\" yells Summer rudely. Summer spots a large rock in her yard and you look on as she picks it up and tosses it at Flora. However, Flora catches the rock and smiles. \"Why thank you Summer,\" she says. \"This will make a fine addition to my rock garden.\" Summer growls and grabs her ears in frustration before she stomps into her house. \"Trespassers will be shot!\" shouts Summer. \"Especially trespassers who are dead to me!\" She slams the door so hard you're forced to cover your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold up your newspaper that is much bigger than yourself and rub your chin. Summer seemed to be in a particularly bad mood today. You wonder if something was bugging her since she was even grouchier than she normally is. Maybe you should check up on her. She may be in a bad mood but Summer didn't harm humans. She didn't even eat meat. Then again, it's not any of your business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're still curious.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's true that Summer was always somewhat grumpy, but she seemed extra grumpy today and you decide it would probably be a good idea to check up on her. As the giant were hyena stomps in the front door, you slid under her fence and then run up and duck underneath her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you do, you yell out and move to the side as the hyena titaness nearly steps on you. Summer then looks down and realizes you're there. \"Dang it, Neil,\" she says grumpily. \"I could've stepped on you. Don't you think you should go home now? Maggie will be worried if you don't come back soon.\" \"I'm worried about <i>you</i>,\" you say. \"You're acting grouchy, even for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer then lets out a sigh. \"Fine,\" she says. \"It's my sister.\" \"Your sister?\" you ask. You heard about Summer's older sister. Her name was Cree and she lived in Fearfield. You thought that their names were kind of funny since the names were Cree and Summer, like that actress. Ironic given their species as hyena based monsters. From what you heard Cree was the last monster you'd want to meet. She was a psychotic creature who put Meagan to shame. Maggie said that Cree worked in a prison and her job was to beat up any prisoner that acted up. A job she enjoyed way too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to a photograph of Summer and her sister. From the looks of it, Cree was the same height as Summer but had deep brown fur and red hair worn with large Tomboyish sideburns. Also, in contrast to Summer's muscular amazonian figure, Cree was almost as fat as Maggie was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Summer explains. \"Cree is gonna be in town for a few days because of our parents' anniversary.\" \"That doesn't sound too bad.\" You say. \"Oh yeah?!\" snapped Summer. \"She's bringing Aurelia!\" You then see the problem. Aurelia was Summer's sister-in-law and Cree's wife. You don't know what she looks like but you heard that she was a were jackal. For some reason, Summer just plain <b>hated</b> Aurelia and has been mad at Cree for a decade for marrying the jackal woman. In fact, Summer's hatred of Aurelia dwarfed her hatred of Flora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea why. Perhaps Summer didn't approve of same sex marriage and her behavior was due to homophobia. Or perhaps Summer's dislike from Aurelia came from racism. Some species of monsters don't like other species; vampires and werewolves didn't always get along, gryphons had an aversion to pegasi and unicorns and frost giants and dark elves apparently don't get along since you heard Irma once make a condescending remark about dark elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer growls just thinking about Aurelia and grits her teeth as you step back and she punches the wall. \"Why did Cree have to marry that one-eyed bitch!\" \"Whoa! That's a strong word for you to say given your...\" \"I'm not a dog, Neil,\" says Summer. \"I can see the confusion but hyenas aren't really canines. That's beside the point. I do not want that Anubial bone muncher in my house! And I suggest you go home if you know what's good for you. I'm a vegetarian but Cree and Aurelia, they'd eat you alive in a heartbeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there's a knock at the door and you hide under the couch as Summer walks to open it. But who is at the door when Summer opens it?</span></div></div>",

She's wearing a Victorian ballroom dress and you never really see her feet because she floats everywhere. The floating is the reason you didn't hear her coming. You think about dropping the paper and hiding but her eyes lock with yours and you know she's seen you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Neil!\" she says brightly as she floats closer to you. \"Hi Raven.\" you say with a sigh. She bends down and puts her face close to you, the suddenness of it making you jump back. \"Having a good morning?\" she asks while batting her eyes. As usual she's starting to flirt with you. You'll admit she's very attractive, but you're married. You've tried to explain this to her but she just won't accept it and thinks she can steal you from your wife. \"Its going okay I guess. Just getting the paper.\" you answer. \"Well how about instead the two of us have a little morning walk?\" she asks. She walks her fingers over to you as she says this. Even though its just her hand you have to look up at it. \"No thanks.\" you reply and keep dragging your paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you fall over as the paper is snatched away. You look to see that Raven is holding the paper with her arms crossed. \"I guess you can't get the paper now.\" she says innocently. \"Come on Raven.\" you say annoyed. The banshee does a twirl in the air and smiles. \"Come on? Where are we going?\" she asks slyly. Giving up you head to your door to get away from her. Unfortunately Raven's not ready for you to go and flies in front of you. \"Ah ah ah...\" she says as she snatches you up.  \"We should get going.\"  She gives you a smooch as you struggle in her grip. She begins to float away with you in hand, whistling happily as she goes.</span></div></div>",

Isis was a monster known as a serpopard, an Egyptian monster resembling a leopard with a serpentine neck.

That was an awful thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you gulp and decide to be a good neighbor. \"Good morning Isis!\" you yell.

Well, regardless, you are at least glad she didn't eat you... or worse. Shrugging, you proceed to drag the newspaper back inside. After crossing the hallway, you hear a commotion, Maggie was probably on the phone, agitated. You were about to go ask her what happened when a wide blur just dashed past you towards the door. As you stood there, mouth agape and hand raised, stupefied, your daughter peeks from the kitchen, looking surprised herself. \"W-wuh... what was that all about?\" you asked the teenage mer-lion as she came into full view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad? I think Mom is going to be very busy today. Something about a serious situation down at the precinct. She said it was very important.\" Sapphire walked to you and picked you up, gently. The look on her face was that of worry. \"Is she going to be okay?\" Rubbing her finger soothingly, you give her a smile, putting her at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, hun, I'm sure Maggie can handle it, she's a nemean lion, she'll be alright.\" putting on a mocking yet stern face, you put your hands on your hips and look at the titanic teen. \"Now then, isn't it time for you to head on to school?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, but Da~ad! I woke up early! At least let me finish my breakfast!\" and with that, the two of you chuckled and walked back to the table, so she could finish her sizeable meal and you could have yourself your morning cofee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed as a blur, you accompanied Sapphire to school, dropped her off, took a cab to your job, since Maggie took the car with her, and managed to get there on time for your shift. Atlanta gave you some minor trouble as usual, something about the television at the salon not working and you having to go inside it to see what was up. Fortunately, Prima had to step in before something bad would happen to you, the last thing she wanted was for her only decent employee to get fried by a short circuit. For your credit, though, you managed to do everything they asked, and got out of it relatively unharmed, so no problems there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing, however, could prepare you to what was coming in the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you made it back, in the early evening, you arrive to find Sapphire waiting for you, she always arrived first, and normally she would've entered the house by now. Odd, she seemed worried. Seeing you arrive lifted her spirits, and she walked up to you and picked you up, rubbing your tiny self against her fuzzy cheek. \"Hey kiddo, how was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, did you hear the news?\" when you shook your head in the negative, and explained that the TV at the salon was busted, Sapphire got even more worried. \"They announced it at school, some government agents went there, something about an 'outbreak' at the precinct!\" she was getting too anxious, so you did what you could to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, easy, girl. Deep breaths. Okay now, what's this about an outbreak at the precinct?\" you ask, your tone serious. Taking a few breaths to calm herself, your giant daughter explains the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They interrupted the classes to tell us there was an outbreak at Mom's workplace and they had to take precautionary measures. They also brought some medics and nurses to the school, all male for some reason, and had us inoculated with some antivirus or something.\" as she finished and let you ponder the news, she sheepishly asked \"...Dad, is Mom going to be okay?\" Giving her a reassuring half-smile, you gesture indoors, and the two of you proceed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter setting down her backpack and sitting on the large sofa, she places you in her shoulder and you rub her neck. \"Honey, I've told you, didn't I? Your mother is tough, she can handle herself pretty well when she's in a pickle. That is not to say I'm not worried about her, I am, believe me, all I'm asking is for you to have some faith in her. She's the town's Sheriff, remember? Here, let me tell you something that happened a while back, when she first began working there, she-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a car parking in front of the house forced you to stop your story short (you were just about to start it, too), and both you and your daughter turned your heads to the door. There were muffled voices outside, two of them, feminine, but slightly deep. Sapphire looks at you perched up in her shoulder, tense. \"Is that Mom?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud, heavy steps filled the hallway as the door opened, and in walked your wife and a weretigress you recognized as Prussia, the town's Marshall. Your wife huffed and panted, as well as Prussia, as she noticed you and your daughter. \"Hi Neil. Busy and awful day, you wouldn't believe it.\" Seeing your shocked faces made the town Marshall chuckle, whereas your wife only sighed. \"Just let me sit down, I can explain all of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, 'all of this' was referring to how huge the two adult felines have gotten. Maggie plopped herself down on another couch, her unitard barely holding together, as her bulk had increased exponentially, her gargantuan belly covering her whole lap with flab, her massive thighs and butt spreading out like butter on the double seats, and her huge cleavage poking out from the leotard, having gone a few cup sizes. Her arms were now pillowy and even her fingers had become poofier. Her double chin, which gave her a round, but lovely face, had swelled even more, and you could notice another chin forming under her second chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrussia merely leaned against the wall, groaning as she tried to cross her arms over her titanic bosom, her predicament the same as your wife, except she had a lot more in the chest department than Maggie, her cowgirl outfit full of visible tears and openings. You could've also sworn she was slightly taller, and by extension, Maggie as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shocked silence filled the living room, but Sapphire gradually worked up the courage to ask the question that was boiling in your head. \"M-Mom? What ha-happened to you and Ms.Kipling?\" Maggie gave you both a reassuring smile, and patted her sizeable dome of a stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey... Dear... there was an outbreak of nebutori at the precinct. Someone was caught by Prussia here smuggling illegal items, and while she was... '<i>distracted</i>'...\" she glared at the weretigress, who in turn began whistling a made up tune, looking away.\" the crook managed to slip a vial of that junk into her shell. After they escorted her to her cell to deal with the proceedings and called me, she made a makeshift smoke bomb with some more tools she had <i>slipped</i> past the inspection. When I arrived and they were about to take her in for questioning, she blew the damn thing up, and escaped. She is now at large.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we... we're stuck like this, large. The whole precinct, plus some more folks who were there, were affected. I still can't quite get how that no good, dirty, sneaky excuse of a kappa managed to escape without even suffering the effects of this crap!\" Prussia growled in a low voice. Her voice roused you from your shocked stupor, and you turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why are you here as well, Prussia?\" She was about to retort something snarky, but Maggie cut in quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had a little... accident with the car, Neil. It's currently undergoing repairs. I... ugh, I kinda grew when I entered the car to give that kappa chase. Prussia was kind enough to offer a ride back here, since I can't walk that far without having to catch my breath, and her car is roomier and sturdier than ours. And now she is about to leave, aren't you?\" once again, she gave the striped feline an frigid glare, to which the obese Marshall mumbled a low 'yeah'. Without even turning to look at you three, she muttered a goodnight and left, surprisingly not slamming the door on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire got up, walked towards Maggie and set you down on her (now flabbier) shoulder. You began rubbing her fur, and she purred at your contact. \"It's gonna be okay, dear. Sapphire and I were worried sick when we heard the news, but at least you're safe and sound.\" the young mer-lion nodded. Maggie kept purring, until suddenly her eyes shot open, and she stared at Sapphire, panic practically written all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No no, Sapphire, I just remembered, you have to get away from me, nebutori is highly contagious!\" her outburst startled you and your daughter, surprisingly affecting you more than the youth herself. With a shrug, she rolled up the sleeve of her left arm to show a spot with a bandaid on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I was inoculated at school. I don't think I'm going to be infected anytime soon. I don't think it will last forever, but the school is taking precautions to prevent this from spreading. Or so we were told.\" at this, you remembered what Sapphire told you earlier. Maggie calmed down after hearing this, but was still agitated. \"It's been a long day, Mom, Dad. I think we all need to get some rest, this is just too much to take in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphire's right, hun, a hectic day deserves a nice meal. Although...\" you eye her adipose-filled belly before continuing. \"...we might have to make a larger portion this time.\" Maggie just grunts in annoyance, and you playfully rub her shoulder with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your touch calming her down, and Sapphire starting to set the table for dinner, your bloated wife just sighed. \"...this is going to take <b>a lot</b> of getting used to...\"</span></div></div>",

It took her most of the dinosaur meat and rice you had in the fridge to make a curry dinner that would be large enough to satisfy your much more bloated than usual wife's enlarged hunger. Dinner was okay, except for the fact that one point where Maggie wasn't paying attention to what she was eating and forced you to bite her on the tongue to prevent her from eating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, you're standing on Maggie's shoulder as she's waddling up towards your bedroom. She is panting with each step because the nebutori has done a number on her stamina. She even inhales and exhales. \"You alright, Mom?\" asks Sapphire. \"I'm okay, Sapphire,\" says Maggie. \"This is just a side-effect of the nebutori. From your height, you're looking down in shock. You remember Sapphire as only being 100ft shorter than Maggie, but from your position Maggie looked like she was twice as tall as Sapphire. Given Maggie was 1000ft tall before the nebutori infected her, that was saying something. You'd even say that Maggie's ass was more than twice as big as Cattleya's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Maggie as she bends over and kisses Sapphire. \"Good night Sapphire.\" \"Good night, Mom,\" says Sapphire. \"Night, Dad. Oh, by the way, how long will it be until they can find a way to cure the nebutori.\" Maggie lets out a sigh. \"I don't know,\" she says. \"The ingredients for the cure are hard to come by and if just one monster is left with the disease, it will start all over again. It could be weeks before things get back to normal. Whatever you do, do not miss a shot of anti-virus, Sapphire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Maggie said worried you. Your wife could be like this for weeks. You had a thing for SSBBWs like Maggie was even before getting infected, but this was going to take some getting used to. It takes Maggie effort to squeeze her bulk through the bedroom door and even cracks the wall as you nearly fall off your lion wife's shoulder. \"I'm too tired to take my leotard off, Neil,\" says the ginormous feline. \"I just want to get some...\" \"Uh, Maggie.\" You say. Maggie ignores you and gets on the bed to make a discovery. She was now wider than the bed to the point where she could fill it all the way up and the moment she lays down, the legs break off and the bed is flat on the floor. Maggie just lets out a sigh and picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which part of Maggie are you sleeping on tonight?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laying belly-down in the middle of Maggie's (much softer) breasts, you look at your corpulent wife's face: she was inhaling and exhaling deeply, still winded from climbing up the stairs in her bloated state, and her eyelids were half open, yet something about the fullness of her cheeks and how a triple chin seemed to be forming underneath her second chin, to even how much thicker her lips were, made your heart beat a little bit faster. Apparently, she wasn't sleepy enough, as she caught you staring at her silently. \"Neil, honey? What's wrong? I told you, I'm fine, just... tired.\" she mutters, finishing with a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look adorable, dearest.\" you blurt out, half conscious of what you just said. This surprised the lioness, her eyebrows arching upwards, but only for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, no. Not tonight. I'm tired, I'm huge, and not really in the mood.\" she said somewhat sternly. You blink, then raise yourself with your arms, clearing the misunderstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'm just saying, even with you being this large, you look adorable.\" this seemed to work, as she looks away with a huff. \"Like, really cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush you. I know you're just trying to cheer me up.\" her expression softens a bit and the corners of her feline mouth curl into a smile. \"You said the same thing when we first started dating, remember? I wasn't even as big as I was before this dumb outbreak.\" she was right. Back when you first began dating, Maggie had been 'generously endowed' at best, with wide hips and a bubble butt, and a moderate cup size, but it was only after marriage and her pregnancy that her midriff began to enlarge, with her bosom and bottom as collateral damage. Even after gaining all that weight, you remained loyal to her, and you even let her in on your preference for large ladies. She didn't mind it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, much as I like thick ladies, you're the only one for me, and you know it.\" you say as you press and rub your face onto her chest fur. Even though Maggie rolled her eyes at your actions, she still managed to purr loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... you're such a smooth talker.\" she groaned. Feeling a tad mischievous, you start motorboating on her fur, tickling her and making her laugh. This of course, makes her flab shake and jiggle uncontrollably, forcing you to grab hold of her fur so as not to fly off. With a chuckle, the two of you wish each other goodnight, and drift off to sleep. Maggie was the first one to go, and you followed shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came, and as usual, you were the first to wake up. Sitting up and rubbing your eyes, you yawn loudly and wonder if everything that transpired yesterday had been a dream. One look at the sleeping lioness tells you it wasn't, she was still as bloated as yesterday, after the nebutori incident. Well, you didn't really mind her looks, but her stamina and strength had taken a blow, and that was cause for concern, even if it was temporary. Your thoughts are interrupted by a loud yawn, meaning Maggie had woken up as well. You turn to her and smile, while she just lazily grabs handfuls of her bellyfat and groans, annoyed. \"I wondered if everything that happened yesterday had been a dream, guess you did too, huh?\" you rub her chest fur as you said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... so not going to work today...\" you cock an eyebrow at that remark, but before you could ask her about it, she continued, mumbling. \"...wouldn't even be allowed to, even if I wanted to go. Not until I'm cured.\" standing up now, you inquire her further about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so, you mean, everyone at the precinct is... suspended?\" seeing Maggie nod her head slowly, making the flab on her chins jiggle like pudding, you can only mutter in disbelief. \"Holy cow... but, if no one is there, who's going to uphold the law or go on patrol?\" one of your wife's flabby fingers gently strokes your head, in reassurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. I didn't mention it yesterday, as it was late and I just wanted to lay down and sleep this off like a bad hangover, but Hailey made a few calls as soon as she heard about the nebutori bomb that blasted kappa unleashed, and now we got ourselves some 'temporary replacements'. Since it only affects females, they're all guys. Let's just hope they don't screw up our offices and things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in short, everyone was on a forced vacation. Figures. Same deal with the nurses and doctors appearing at Sapphire's school, knowing the Mayor of Dreadberry, she was taking this whole ordeal seriously, even if she hadn't been infected. Yet. \"So, that means you're staying home, today.\" you say as she raised one meaty hand to pick you up. You climb on, and she plants a big kiss on you, leaving you drenched in her drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neil, don't worry, I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sure did hope so, as she got out of the ruined bed and waddled slowly to the door.</span></div></div>",

Maggie stops to catch her breath. \"I take it nebutori is a lot like having an all-day hangover.\" You say. Maggie let out a moan. \"I wouldn't know. This is the first time I've had it. Oh.\" Maggie leans so hard, the last step snaps in two. Maggie then lets out a sigh and sniffs the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem that Sapphire is already cooking breakfast. \"Oh,\" says your daughter. \"Good morning. I figured that Mom would be too tired to cook so I decided to go grocery shopping as soon as I got up. Found some tupendactylus eggs and allosaurus steaks for a good price.\" \"You're a good daughter, Sapphire.\" You say as Maggie sits down. However, you both scream as the chair breaks underneath Maggie's even more mountainous that usual ass. It the process you get knocked into Maggie's eye and stand up as it stares at you and causes you to slip and fall down the eyeball as Maggie stand up and grumbles. At this point, her ass is so big she could just sit on the ground. You decide to play it safe this time as Maggie is scarfing her steak and eggs. You decide to eat some pieces of steak off Sapphire's place, in case your more ravenous than usual wife accidentally devours you. From the looks of it, Sapphire was smart and made her mother's portions nearly three times as big as her own. Sapphire looks in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Kiddo,\" you say. \"Your mother said it was contagious, not permanent. She'll be find as soon as they're able to make a vaccine.\" \"I don't know, Dad,\" says Sapphire. \"Before I went to bed, I looked up nebutori on Ghoulgle. The vaccine only stops them from getting bigger but the weight has to be lost manually.\" \"Why can't you look at web images of boy bands like other girls your age?\" you ask in annoyance. \"I do.\" Moans Sapphire. You then feel footsteps and Maggie is guzzling an entire gallon of milk from the fridge having eaten every last scrap of her breakfast. From the look of it, she was still hungry and even took to eating raw eggs. \"I take it increased hungry is another side effect of nebutori?\" you ask. Sapphire nods her head as Maggie hears a ripping noise. She turns around to see that her leotard had ripped up so much that it was reduced to a thong with her upper body stark naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie lets out a growl of annoyance. \"Thanks for breakfast, Sapphire,\" she said. \"Listen. I'm not gonna be able to take you to school today. I'm way too tired and bloated to drive even if the car wasn't being repaired.\" \"That's okay, Mom,\" says Sapphire. \"Pearl is giving me a ride. She told me her dad was in the hospital right now.\" \"Hospital?\" asked Maggie. \"Nebutori doesn't effect men.\" \"He's in the hospital with a broken pelvis.\" Says Sapphire. \"Ouch,\" you say. \"Looks like Fortuna's too much for David to handle these days.\" Maggie has to bend over and shake her arms as she tried to bend over to kiss Sapphire goodbye. Sapphire stands on a chair to reach Maggie's face. \"Have a good day at school sweetheart.\" Says Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire walks out the door and then Maggie lets out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

It's me, Maggie. I'm sorry to bother my favorite sister-in-law but I need you to drive your brother to work. I'd do it myself but I'm too tired from the hangover that is this nebutori. Thanks, Meryl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long until Meryl walks in and sees Maggie so bloated that her stomach is covering the entire coffee table as she's laying down on the couch. \"Yikes,\" says Meryl. \"That sludge works fast. For once I'm glad that my flesh was blown to a crisp.\" Maggie lets out a moan. \"You're lucky to be nothing but bones, Meryl,\" she says. \"I'm sorry to drag you out of bed.\" You kiss Maggie on her lower lip before she hands you to Meryl and soon Meryl is driving you to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought Maggie was fat before,\" said Meryl. \"If her ass gets any bigger, she could use it as a floatation device. Bet you like that, big bro.\" \"Very funny, skullface,\" you say sarcastically. \"I just hope that this isn't permanent. She'll outgrow the house at this point.\" \"Unfortunately,\" says Meryl. \"The ingredients for nebutori are hard to come by. It could be a month before this mess is straightened out.\" You shiver. How big would Maggie get in a month? In that time, it would even be possible that Sapphire could be infected. Before you can think any further on the matter, Meryl brings you to your workplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Salon, Doz is so bloated that she is trapped in her bar and her stinger is over the table while she is trying to reach the tap under her big boobs. Prima and Atlanta are just as bloated. Prima's fat was now mostly in her stomach and her pants looked like they were coming apart. Atlanta's long neck was so bloated that she hardly had a chin and her breasts were so far she was dragging them across the ground with her fattened tail and ass in the air. \"Well, look who's finally here,\" says the leviathan woman. \"This is a fine kettle of fish.\" \"Don't pick on Neil, Atlanta,\" says Prima as she accidentally broke the big mirror with her large girth. \"This had nothing to do with him.\" Atlanta picks you up as you wave goodbye to Meryl and then places you on a large massage table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it I'm on massage duty today.\" You say. \"That's right,\" says Atlanta. \"And with how bloated every woman in town is, that's all you're doing today.\" You let out a sigh. You're really gonna get a workout today. All you can do now is wait for the first customer.</span></div></div>",

You look and see that it is Michelle, a Mngwa FBI agent who came to town on a mission, and has since moved in. You saw that the nebutori had really hit her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the way her body distributes fat, her upper body was unaffected. But her lower half was another story. Her thighs had bloated to tree trunk size, and her hips jutted seven feet out. But it was her butt that dominated her frame. Already massive, it had bloated immensely. It was now as tall as she was, and three times as wide. You were amazed she even got through the door. It was resting on a wheeled board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Neil.\" Michelle said once she got over to the massage table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Michelle. You alright?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

Then she looks at the table, and then at her ass. \"Um, can someone help me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrima waddled over and, grabbing Michelle's butt, heaved with all her might as Michelle climbed up. She managed to get on, though the table was creaking under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like you to do just my back. No sense in making you work on something so mountainous.\" Michelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and began massaging her back. She smiled in delight.

Hunching over to catch her breath, the Baku woman known as Ibuki Todoroki, one of the towns' reporters, wheezes a faint 'Hi' and proceeds to shift her ponderous bulk and even more ponderous backside over the table. Standing in the corner, you can only ponder to yourself if your suggestion to Prima to have the massage tables reinforced will work now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did, fortunately. There was a low groaning sound coming from the table's legs, but it otherwise held the woman's weight. With a sigh, and a crack of your knuckles and neck, you get ready to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Meanwhile, back at home====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie felt imprisoned.<br>\r\nWorse, she felt imprisoned in her own body fat, no less. Trying to get up from the couch was difficult enough, and it left her winded before she even took so much of a single step. Still, she had to, if only to get herself cleaned up and get something to entertain herself with, so that is why after a few minutes of waddling and accidentally bumping into furniture here and there, she freshened up, and decided to watch some film Neil had rented some days ago. Taking the DVD out of the casing with her sausage-like fingers, the lioness carefully placed it into the player's slot, sat back down on the couch (murdering it once again) and exhaled sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ugh... of all things, why did... it have... to be nebutori...\" grabbing a large handful of her stomach, she pouted. \"...and to think I used to be such a looker, too.\" sighing, she leaned back and watched the intro credits roll in, feeling a small hunger pang in her belly. \"Ooh noooo... you are NOT going to bother me today. Period.\" she mumbled as she rubbed her stomach, trying to calm it. Looking down, though, the nemean lioness realized how much larger her chest was as well, and with her right hand, she cupped it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, maybe Neil will enjoy these...hmm.\" she purred. Guess this wasn't a total loss, she was sure Neil would love how much bigger and fuller her twins were. All of a sudden, she felt a different kind of hunger stir in her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, this day just can't go any faster.\" Maggie groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Back at the salon====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toiled labouriously, running back and forth along a flabby naga's back rolls, as she sighed in bliss, all the while answering Ibuki's incessant questions. It was to be expected, this was a huge scoop for her, no pun intended. And there was the fact that she was a regular here, too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this all happened because an officer of the law wasn't paying attention during a critical moment?\" she asked, taking notes every now and then. You rolled your eyes exasperated, you avoided giving names because you knew it would probably return to bite you in the ass, or rather, Prussia would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, it was just a lapse in judgement, it happens to everyone.\" you reply with a few grunts, trying hard to keep yourself focused on the client's massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's run this by me one more time, to see if my notes are correct...\" you were just about to groan explosively, but fortunately it didn't come to that, since Prima did it for you, catching the baku's undivided attention. Waddling towards the reporter, your wooly boss crosses her flabby arms over her even flabbier chest and raises her trunk in a menacing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough, Todoroki. My employee is busy, and he's trying to do his job. I will not have anyone distracting him, not during his shift.\" mentally thanking your boss for covering for you, you run along the rolls with renewed vigour, elliciting a squeal of pleasurable delight from your client. Ibuki, for her part, just makes a pleading face and pouts, trying to pull the 'puppy eyes' look on Prima. \"No buts. You got your massage done, now off with ye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, the baku reporter just stuffed her notes into the pocket of her too-tight jacket, and proceeded to depart the salon. Atlanta just waved her head, jiggling the fat in her neck. \"You do know she'll just write a column about the service here, right? Bad publicity is not good for business.\" Prima just shrugged, and moved towards another client nearby, to chat with her. And you, you were left to run back and forth along your clients rolls, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you were getting a workout, and ironically, you weren't even in need of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was affected by the nebutori too. Her neck was so thick that it was like an entire mountainside, her butt looked as big as Maggie's was now and her breasts had swelled to H-Cups. She was butt naked as well, wearing nothing but a pair of earrings on her large pointed ears. \"Isis?\" asks Atlanta in surprise. \"Isis never comes to the salon.\" Prima even trumpeted in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard waddled her bright orange and yellow spotted body as her tannish hair waved around. She let out a slight growl as she walked up to the table you were at. From the looks of it, she was bigger than Prima and looked as though she could crush three monster-sized cars easily. You shiver as she lowers her long neck and head to her level and sniffs you. \"Hello, Mr. Reaver,\" says Isis in a young sounding high-pitched childish voice. \"So this is where you are during the day.\" You were surprised. Isis actually spoke and she had a surprisingly squeaky voice.\" \"Uh,\" you say. \"Hello... uh... Isis was it.\" Isis nodded her long neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrima and Atlanta were just as surprised seeing as they themselves never heard Isis talk either. Isis was just swinging her tail that at this point looked like a noodle stuck to her massive ass. Isis then blinked. \"I usually don't like to socialize,\" says Isis. \"But I'd like to hear more about you, Mr. Reaver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Isis laid down on the table...</span></div></div>",

It was Raven Callahan Dark, a pale skinned and voluptuous banshee girl. Her green hair gleaming with pink, purple and blue highlights like some kind of Mad Hatter. Raven was hourglass-shaped but when you saw her, you saw that the nebutori bloated her out to monstrous levels. Her already large breasts were already past the H cup level and resting on a mildly bloated tummy while her ass was so big it could take up an entire bus stop and then more. Normally Raven wore a Victorian era ballroom dress but today she was wearing a blue leather bikini with plastic skulls at the nipples and crotch. You could see her full body for the first time and to your surprise, while she does have knees, there is nothing visible underneath. Must've been a function of being a ghost/fairy type monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Neil.\" Says Raven in a singsong voice that makes all the windows shake and crack. Not surprising since she was a banshee. You let out a groan. \"Raven.\" You say. Raven then turns around and shakes her even larger than usual badonkadonk right over you as she gives a sultry smile. It was almost touching your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, Maggie was watching the DVD you provided and was eating a rather large fish when she suddenly shivered and let out a growl. \"I don't know why,\" says your bloated lioness wife as she scratches at what's left of the couch. \"But I'm feeling a disturbance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head as Raven blows a kiss. Raven was one of your least favorite neighbors. She was always flirting with you and didn't care that you were already married. It's gotten to a point where Maggie has had to threaten the banshee with violence multiple times to get her to leave you alone. \"What do you want Raven?\" you ask. \"BESIDES me!?\" you remember to shout at the last minute the moment Raven opens her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw,\" groans the SSBBW banshee as she hovers in the air over you, her breasts nearly touching your head. \"Come on. Can't we have a little fun.\" \"Raven,\" you say. \"You know perfectly well that I'm happily married.\" \"Come on,\" says Raven. \"That fat cat is still a carnivore and with the nebutori, her appetite is on overdrive. She might even eat you.\" \"You're one to talk about appetites,\" you say. \"Now did you come for a massage? Something tells me I'm going to be real busy today and I don't have time for your shenanigans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven floats in the air and then seizes you as you grunt and she squeezes you like a toy between her sausage-like fingers. \"Oh,\" she says. \"I came for a massage alright. I came for the works.\" You let out a sigh. This was going to be a long day.</span></div></div>",

You don't know if it's because she's a fay or because she's a ghost, but it makes you uncomfortable as Raven laughs being <i>very</i> comfortable with your current position. \"Alright my little Neil,\" says the lustful and titanically obese banshee. \"Get started.\" You let out a moan but then you hear a crashing sound and turn your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie had showed up, in spite of her immobilizing bulk and was trying to squeeze her way through the door, although your lioness wife found it difficult to get her enormous ass in through the door frame. She was growling as she eyed Raven. \"Uh-oh.\" Said Atlanta realizing this means trouble. Maggie grumbles and wiggles her enormous ass to break down the wall as she waddles in. You couldn't believe it. At this point, Maggie and Raven were both so obese that had they been human size, they would each weigh four tons. Maggie presses her belly against Raven's own and you slip off of Raven's back and down into the area between your wife's gut and Raven's gut. You look up in fear at both Raven and Maggie glaring at each other. Maggie is so mad with Raven that she shows her her sharp and terrifying teeth. \"You home wrecking pile of ectoplasmic lard! Caught in the act!\" Raven gave a smirk. \"It's not my fault your husband works here.\" \"Then how come you've never come into the salon before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie and Raven glare and you find your foot wedged between their stomachs and have to hold back their breasts to save yourself from being squashed. The two of them had actually broke the three barber's chairs in the salon and made Atlanta scream as she ducked and pressed her own big butt against a window and broke it. Prima waddled out to try and stop what was going on. \"No,\" she said. \"No fighting here. Especially not in your condition.\" \"Shut your trap, Prima!\" yelled Maggie and Raven at the same time. You lose your grip and are sandwiched between Maggie and Raven's breasts and the two of them seem to have not realized this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven gives a smug grin and shakes her breasts. \"Okay, fine, I was in here to try and make Neil realized that he'd be better off with a big beautiful banshee than a planet of feline blubber like you. How do you like them apples Moggie?\" You gulp. A moggy is another word for stray cat and Maggie HATED being called that word. Your lion wife lets out an angry roar. \"It's Maggie!\" she yelled. \"Not <i>Moggie</i>! Maggie! And for the record, I don't see how anyone can fall for an undead Madeline Hatter! Go back to Wonderland, Raven, before I send you there the hard way!\" Maggie held up her fist in order to try and get Raven to back off, but Raven just smiled smugly. \"Why you petty, fatass creep. For a Nemean Lion, you have very thin skin.\" \"And <i>you</i> have a very fat head! Care to try for a fat lip!? You begin to sweat in fear since this was not likely to end well. Both Raven and Maggie tackle each other and you scream as you\u2019re sucked between rolls of lioness and banshee fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Raven grabs Maggie by the hair and prompts Maggie to bite the banshee in the breast right before Raven slams her enormously fat knees into Maggie\u2019s groin area, Maggi is pushed back and knocks down everything from the makeup counter as Prima bends over to try and pick it up, only to be blocked by her own mountainous fat. \u201cGeez!\u201d yelled Prima right as she is nearly bludgeoned by Raven\u2019s ass. Maggie is at this point trying to claw Raven in the back but the rolls of Raven\u2019s fat are way too thick. Raven then tries to smother Maggie\u2019s face with her breasts but Maggie bites Raven again and then spins around to try and pin the banshee to the wall with her rear, causing the wall to crack, right before Raven unleashes a scream that forces Maggie to cover her ears as the windows shatter. Atlanta watched and bit her lip. \u201cPerhaps now is not the best time to tell Prima I forgot to pay the insurance bill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie and Raven are at this point trying to choke each other as they push their girths against one another, all the while you were trapped between somebody\u2019s obese rolls. You had no idea whose or on what part of them but all you knew was that it was probably safer right here. Maggie and Raven then start to pant from exhaustion and then Maggie realizes something. \u201cNeil!\u201d she yells. \u201cWhere\u2019s Neil.\u201d Raven gasps as well and both your wife and your stalker search around their obese bodies to find you. The good news was that you were still alive, but trapped in a prison of lard and sweat and you were tossed around so much during the cat fight that you have no idea where you are. Just where where you stuck to?</span></div></div>",

You could feel the vibrations of their searching through your fleshy prison. You glance and for the most part are greeted by wall to wall fur. You can barely make that out however, due to how dark it is around. In fact, the only reason you can see at all is the rather small ray of light coming from in front of you.  It is hot, damp and dark and definitely not to your liking. You try to wiggle around, attempting to pry yourself loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Maggie and Raven are still searching themselves. Maggie, however, stops when she feels a tickling sensation around the front of her belly. Her eyes widened in shock but then lets out a relieved sigh. With a good amount of effort and a grunt, Maggie is able to reach the front of her belly and carefully pick you out of your prison. She bring you up to her face, visibly nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right, Neil?\" She asks, voice small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I'm good. Nothing broken.\" You breath out. You look over your shoulder and see that Raven is so engrossed in tryiny to find you that she hasn't noticed that Maggie found you just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing can ever be simple, can it?\" You ask turning back to your wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie gives a tired sigh, \"I guess not. Sorry about that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's o-\" You were cut off by an all too familiar voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Neil! You're ok!\" Raven said, smile on her face.

You have to push back Maggie's white furry stomach and Prima's woolly brown furry boob to prevent yourself from being crushed. Atlanta rushes and pushes Raven to the side, accidentally smashing the massage chair with her enormous booty in the process as her pants rip, revealing the leviathan had gone commando. Atlanta blushes and puts her hands to her butt as she grunted while at the same time pinning Raven to the wall with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a beauty parlor!\" yells Prima. \"Not a wrestling ring!\" Maggie lets out a growl. \"That hussy started it trying to steal my husband.\" \"Oh yeah,\" scoffs Raven. \"That stray cat mother of yours hates him. He'd be better off with somebody who wouldn't take him so close to a dangerous bitch.\" Maggie holds out her claws as Prima holds her back. \"Sheriff!\" she yells. \"Control yourself!\" Atlanta grumbles and then tried to pull her shredded pants up. \"Oh wonderfun,\" the sea dragons growls. \"All we need is for Uma to show up. I think that I've had enough cat fight for one day. Sheriff, take your pipsqueak-sized husband and go. Neil, I will give you a raise if you get the **** out of here for the rest of the day!\" \"Atlanta!\" yells Prima. You and Maggie are both surprised. \"But my shift isn't...\" Atlanta hisses angrily and shows her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven gives a shriek that causes the window to break. \"He was in the middle of giving me a massage.\" Maggie gives a smirk as she places you on her shoulder. \"Too bad,\" she said. \"Find your own husband, Raven.\" Maggie then showed Raven her huge butt that is at this point four times as wide as she is tall. \"Hail to the queen of beasts, banshee.\" Raven grumbles and ghosts through the wall as Maggie takes you and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrima glares at Atlanta. \"Atlanta,\" she said. \"We needed Neil. Do you have any idea how many monster girls are going to be in for massages after this nebutori rush? Especially ass massages?\" Atlanta grit her teeth. \"I don't like this any better than you. My ass is almost as big as the sheriff's mother's! My kids were using it to play handball last night! <i>Handball</i>!\" Prima trumpets and rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ride on Maggie's shoulder as she waddles down the street. \"Looks like you get out early, sweetie,\" says Maggie. \"Geez, that Raven has a lot of nerve. I have half a mind to send that banshee a cake made out of iron.\" You slide down Maggie's back and smile as you massage her ass as she waddles. \"Well,\" you say. \"This just gives me time to practice my tools of the trade on my favorite feline booty.\" Maggie gives a purr. \"Flatterer.\" Maggie then grunts because you give her a light spanking and then she purrs. \"You can't wait, can you?\" \"Hey,\" you say. \"You knew I was an animal when you married me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie then smiles. \"Well, that will have to wait. Kitty's hungry. Let's break for lunch.\" You quickly scurry onto Maggie's shoulder. \"So, what's on the menu, Maggie.\" Maggie gives a purr. \"I happen to know a place that serves portions fit for a queen.

I decided to give it the once over.\" You look up and are dumbfounded. The restaurant in question was shaped like the coliseum of Rome and it was painted in the colors, green, white and red, like an Italian flag. You read the sign and you already can't believe it. \"The Roman Holiday? An Italian restaurant in Dreadberry. It looks fancy, Maggie. Most of the time the fanciest restaurants around here are the ones that have reusable utensils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Maggie just moves her bloated body forward, signaling to you that it was lunch time and looks in the window. \"We're in luck, I was expecting this place to be mobbed like every other eatery in Dreadberry after the nebutori hit. Looks like monsters that like out in the country have gotten used to greasy spoons.\" Maggie gives a purr and then waddles inside. Or more accurately, she tries to, only to get her massive belly stuck in the door frame. \u201cOh come on!\u201d yells the titanically obese lioness. Maggie grunts and growls and manages to bend the door frame only for her to take no less than one step forward and get her even more titanic booty stuck as well. You fight back the urge to laugh at your wife\u2019s predicament as best as you could but you clutch your chest as Maggie wiggles her behind and further bends the frame of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie lets out a sigh before walking up to the biggest table the restaurant had. She plops her enormous keister into six chairs that are absolutely murdered under her mass. \u201cOlympus above,\u201d mutters your lioness wife. \u201cAnd I thought my butt was big even before the nebutori struck, but that\u2019s because it was genetic. Now it\u2019s big enough to make my mother\u2019s look like a pimple.\u201d You slide down Maggie\u2019s hair and then rub one of her ginormous cheeks and motorboat her fur as she laughs. \u201cNeil,\u201d she says. \u201cTone it down, you animal. This is a restaurant.\u201d \u201cSorry about that, Maggie. Just having a little fun.\u201d Maggie tries to reach around her butt that was now well up to her shoulders as she tries to find you and you jump onto her enlarged finger just as a waiter appears to take your order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis waiter is a very scrawny stone gray-skinned incubus with a bald head, bright red horns with a scar going from his  neck to his thigh. He was dressed in a red, green and white tanktop and shorts and he gasped at the sight of such a titanic monster in the restaurant. From the looks of it, the incubus was less than 1/4 of Maggie\u2019s current nebutori induced height. Maggie glares at the incubus. \u201cIt\u2019s rude to stare. You do realize that the entire town is infected with nebutori.\u201d The incubus gives a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, right, ma\u2019am. Welcome to the Roman Holiday. Sorry. It\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t been getting a lot of customers lately. Especially none so large.\u201d Maggie scratches her many chins with her claws before speaking. \u201cBelieve me, kid,\u201d she says with a smirk. \u201cWith all women in Dreadberry so impossibly huge with that illness going around, this restaurant will explode.\u201d \u201cTrue,\u201d says the very nervous incubus. \u201cUh, what will it be for the... two of you?\u201d The incubus notices you on Maggie\u2019s shoulder and you give him a look. He doesn\u2019t seem to be a fan of humans. Maggie just gives a smile. \u201cGive us 15 pans of lasagna.\u201d You give a laugh. \u201cAnd 2 Polter Colas.\u201d you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the incubus leaves, you give a scoff. \u201cLasagna? Really, Maggie?\u201d Maggie then gives a scoff. \u201cOh grow up. He\u2019s more partially to pizza these days.\u201d Suddenly Maggie\u2019s cell phone begun to ring. You dive into her cleavage and then dive beneath the rolls of fat until you find Maggie\u2019s cellphone. It\u2019s holding up the folds, conveniently keeping you from getting crushed as you crawl through the fleshy and furry ground and then check the caller ID and find out that it was Sapphire. \u201cHuh.\u201d You slide the phone to answer it. \u201cHey, Dad,\u201d says Sapphire. \u201cYou would not believe what just happened at school...\u201d \u201cSapphire. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in history class?\u201d \u201cHistory was cancelled and we have a free period.\u201d \u201cAnd why did history get cancelled?\u201d Sapphire let out a scoff. \u201cIt turns out Ms. Khamen is afraid of needles. She refused to take the anti-serum for the nebutori and paid the price. Her bandages exploded\u201d Sapphire let out a laugh and you roll your eyes. \u201cWhatever you do, Sapphire, don\u2019t miss a shot. The last thing we need is for you to get infected too.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of which, how\u2019s Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel some flesh pressing down on you before you answer. \u201cShe\u2019s gotten bigger and she got into a fight with Raven and got me sent home from work early so we stopped off for some lunch.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hear thunderous footsteps coming through the door. Both you and Maggie look to see who walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the bent door was the succubus Lee Gin. The nebutori had really hit her hard. Her breasts had blown up to about triple Z's. Her butt and hips were twice as wide as the door (making you wonder how she got in). Her arms and legs were twice as thick. But her belly dominated her frame. It had to be about 1400 feet wide. It also looked like she had 4 chins. She was even less clothed then usual, wearing a tiny pink bra with bats on it, and barely visible pink shorts. She also had her hair in a ponytail and was wearing sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a look around the restaraunt and spotted you two. Smiling, she waddled over to your table and sat down, almost breaking 7 chairs. Up close, she looked bigger then Maggie. Slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how are you doing today?\" Lee asked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annoyed.\" Maggie replied. \"You sound happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?\" Lee said. \"So far today, this fat has gotten me numbers from 7 men. I'm surprised you two aren't more happy. I'm mean, look at your ass, Maggie. I'm sure you and Neil will be VERY busy tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed. \"OK, changing the subject...\" You blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee looked at Maggie's shoulder. \"Oh, Neil. Didn't see you. Shouldn't you be at work?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got sent home. Maggie and Raven had a fight.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee laughed, making her whole body shake. \"I wish I had seen that!\" She said. \"Anyway, I just got a call from Donna. Her art class got cancelled. Apparently Colleen didn't get one of her shots in time and is now too fat to move. She had to be taking home in a flatbed. After I eat I'm heading over to her house. She needs me for something. Not sure what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, she motioned for a waiter. A male werewolf with tan fur about your age walked up. \"Yes, ma'am?\" He said in a British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee looks at the menu. \"Waiter, give me 40 Pterodactly Kababs, 50 breadsticks, 40 pans of lasagna, 20 garlic bread loafs, 10 Hauntling Cola's, and your number.\" She says, practically purring the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf blushed. \"Yes, ma'am.\" He said happily, and went to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee grinned. \"See what this fat can do?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Maggie both rolled your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more talking...</span></div></div>",

If you need anything else, just yell. Oh, I'm Victor, and the werewolf is Ivan. Just yell our names if you need us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Maggie said. Victor smiled and turned to leave. Ivan, however, stayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the view?\" Lee said teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ah, I mean, yes, I mean-\" Ivan stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Look all you want.\" Lee purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.

We make you a gigantic buffet filled with at least one of everything we make. If you can finish it in under two hours, next time you come in, your meals free.\" Ivan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering the way we are right now, we might need that. So we'll give it a try.\" Maggie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun. I'm in.\" Lee said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I'll let the chefs know. Once your done with this, we'll bring it out.\" With that, Ivan went to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can do that?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neil, me and Lee are blimps now. That giant buffet probably won't even make a dent in our hunger.\" Maggie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe when this is over, I'll bring Donna here. She needs some meat on those bones.\" Lee said. Just then, her massive body started to wobble. She reached down into her cleavage and pulled out her cell-phone. Looking at the ID, she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Donna, I was just talking about you.\" Lee said. \"What? What about Roland? He is? Right. Fine, call me when you get there. With who? Right. Ok, bye.\" Lee hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did Donna want?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently my brother Roland doesn't want her in town. He's worried she'll get infected. He was also so protective. So he and his wife are taking her to their home a couple miles away. And before you ask, his wife is an animated skeleton. Also, she said she's taking someone named Jade with her.\" Lee explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade? That's the Cactus Cat Sapphire's tutoring, right?\" You ask Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie nodded. Then she turned and started eating. Well, eating wasn't the right word. Inhaling was more fitting. Lee was doing the same. You watched in amazement as the two enormously obese women ripped their food apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time...</span></div></div>",

The three of you turned to look, and were astounded by what you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing rolled into the restaraunt was Colleen. And Lee was right when she said she missed her shot. If Lee and Maggie were big, Colleen made them look like toothpicks. She had grown about 300 feet taller, her head reaching the ceiling. Not that you could see her head behind her mountainous breasts, which were both the size of Lee's belly. And speaking of belly, Colleen's were gargantuan. It was twice the size of Lee's belly, and as tall as Maggie used to be before she was infected. Her arms and legs had bloated so much that her hands and feet were swallowed up by them. She was sitting on a board with wheels on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColleen was wheeled up to your table and turned so she could see you. It was then you saw that two men in hospital uniforms were pushing her. It also gave you a good view of Colleen's ass. It had blown up to the same size as her breasts. You could also see her face. It looked like she had 5 chins, and her cheeks were incredibly bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColleen slowly turned her head and saw you three. \"Hey guys.\" She said. Even her voice sounded fatter. \"Guess I couldn't avoid this illness. I can' move at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can see that.\" Maggie said, dumbfounded at Colleen's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan walked out of the kitchen. \"You're challege meal will be out sho- OH MY WORD!\" He shouted, seeing Colleen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the waiter?\" Colleen asked. \"I'll be taking 8 servings of everything on your menu. And make sure the booze is strong. If I'm going to be immobile, may as well be drunk and immobile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The challege buffet I am bringing out already has everything, but we'll increase the amount.

So you and Maggie decided to pass the time watching TV. She was sitting on the couch (which her ass completely immersed due to the nebutori) and you were on her right boob while you and her were both eating popcorn from the bowl resting on her stomach. You figured that with you around to keep Maggie distracted it would give the pantry a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were watching Shocker Tales, your favorite horror TV show. On the screen was the host; The Shocker, an undead red werelizard with a white mustache and large horns running down his back. From the looks of it, he was spinning a lasso and was at what looked like a haunted rodeo since he was wearing a cowboy outfit. \"Looks like Mr. Gates forgot the first rule of insurance fraud,\" says the Shocker on the television. \"There are some loose ends you can't leave, hanging around.\" The Shocker let out a laugh as he held the lasso like a noose. \"Which brings us to our double feature that you'll see after the commercial. It's a Wicked Western I like to call, \"Fatal Sundance\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie lets out a groan as her stomach oozes onto the coffee table. \"This is what you watch when I'm not home? Who is writing this show? I mean, faking your death is the worst insurance fraud scam I've ever heard of. How is a dead man supposed to collect on his life insurance?\" \"Maggie,\" you say. \"It's only a horror anthology.\" Maggie takes a handful of popcorn before speaking again. \"That's no excuse for the Shocker. Who writes his lines? Everything that comes out of his mouth is a cheesy pun. And that makeup job is terrible.\" You let out a sigh and shrug your shoulders. \"I think it's a good show. I mean, it's not like the victims don't have it coming. You should've seen the episode where a man offered to buy his friend's brain and it went downhill fast.\" Maggie let out a groan.\" You couldn't argue with your giant naked wife, so you lay back on her rolls until you hear a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maggie? What's going on? What's with all those mean-looking strangers at the station?\" Who on Earth could be unaware of this crisis.</span></div></div>",

That chain-smoking minotaur conspiracy theorist. You let out a groan. She\u2019s no doubt going to give you both an earful about what she thinks is going on. Maggie then gasps because she realizes something. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said. \u201cLily.\u201d Lily knocked on the door before she stomped to light herself a cigarette. \u201cMaggie?\u201d she asks. \u201cAre you in there? You weren\u2019t abducted by aliens were you?\u201d \u201cGo away, Lily!\u201d yells Maggie. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to come in here?\u201d Lily just gives a look of suspicion. \u201cWhy?\u201d asks the skeptical cow. \u201cWhat are you hiding in there?\u201d \u201cNothing!\u201d you yell. \u201cLily,\u201d says Maggie. \u201cI\u2019m not really in the condition for having visitors.\u201d Lily just gave a scoff. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you naked before, Maggie. I know the deal, you two are running a cloning lab in there. Don\u2019t move. I\u2019m coming in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Maggie both gasp before Lily presses her hoof against the ground and then tackles the door to break it. Maggie lets out a growl. \u201cYou have to be ****ing kidding me. That\u2019s the third door this month. Lily, you idiot! Stay out of here! I\u2019m warning you?\u201d \u201cIs that a threat?\u201d asks the minotaur giantess as she blows out some smoke. \u201cWhat exactly are those strangers in the precinct for. I smell coverup.\u201d \u201cLily!\u201d you yell. \u201cGet out of the house! You\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d Lily gives a smirk. \u201cI knew it. I can smell a cloning lab for miles away.\u201d You let out a groan. That idiot cow is going to stumble into something she\u2019ll regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d says Lily. \u201cWhat exactly are you.... hiding?\u201d Lily looks at Maggie\u2019s fattened form and is surprised. \u201cGee, Maggie,\u201d says Lily. \u201cI know all brides let themselves go but it looks like you\u2019ve been eating nothing but plesiosauruses for six months straight.\u201d \u201cLily!\u201d yells Maggie. \u201cGet out while you can! I have nebutori! Don\u2019t you watch the news!\u201d Lily gives a scoff. \u201cI\u2019d rather watch the truth. Not what the government says is the... wait, you have nebutori?\u201d Suddenly, Lily begun to twitch and felt her skirt snap. The cow giantess was obese before but now she was getting fatter and fatter. Her udder was even expanding in size as her butt expanded and now was only slightly smaller than Maggie\u2019s. Her stomach bulged out and shattered the coffee table as her breasts expanded next and her jacket looked tattooed on as the minotaur giantess sprouted a triple-chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie rolled her eyes as you crawled down her stomach and then looked up at the cow woman who was now just as obese as your infected wife. \u201cHi, Lily.\u201d You say. Lily just spanked herself and watched her fat ass ripple as her tail looked really small. Small enough that it looked like it could simply be twisted off. Lily just let out a sigh before she snugged out her cigarette in her butt crack and lit another one. \u201cYou could\u2019ve told me sooner.\u201d Maggie let out a groan. \u201cSit down.\u201d Lily did that and murdered the easy chair as she continued to smoke. \u201cYou know, Maggie, they put nebutori in bottled water. The company has a pact with the big and tall women\u2019s shops and the government. They want to make us obese and lethargic to keep us in the kitchen. That\u2019s their twisted plan.\u201d At this point, Maggie and Lily\u2019s bellies are so big that they\u2019re touching and you look at Lily\u2019s enormous udder. It looks ready to leak. Although, Lily\u2019s milk was completely inedible due to her constant smoking. How that minotaur didn\u2019t have cancer by now is a mystery she should be examining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cThis is going to be a big surprise for Angus. Then again, he\u2019s probably more concerned whether or not this junk hit Moxie. I hope his pelvis gets vaporized.\u201d Lily then lets out a sigh. \u201cFemale minotaurs are all fat,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is something new.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Lily.\u201d Groans Maggie. Lily just gives a scoff. \u201cHey. At least I have a big strong man back home. Uh, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with having a husband you can use to clean your ears with.\u201d You cross your arms at that comment. \u201cWell, big surprise for you,\u201d you think. \u201cYour husband probably threw out his back if the nebutori reached a certain gremlin.\u201d Maggie just turned up the volume. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you like Shocker\u2019s Tales, Maggie,\u201d said Lily. \u201cI remember this episode. Fatal Sundance. It\u2019s one of my favorites. That\u2019s the one where the rancher\u2019s sons are forced to look for their....\u201d \u201cOh, Zeus,\u201d says Maggie. \u201cA fight over the will. Those stroeis are predicable. How does that even count as horror? I\u2019m changing the channel.\u201d You then climb up Lily\u2019s fat back up to her ear. \u201cPlease tell me you tape Shocker\u2019s Tales.\u201d You say to the enlarged minotaur giantess. However, Lily just ignores you and you slide down her back and run across her ass cheek before jumping back onto Maggie\u2019s thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Maggie,\u201d says Lily. \u201cI\u2019m starving. That\u2019s another thing about nebutori. The people who put in in our water and taking bribes from the fastfood industry.\u201d \u201cShut up with your idiotic theories, Lil. But you\u2019re right.\u201d \u201cGood luck finding anything to eat, Lily,\u201d you say. \u201cMaggie ate everything that wasn\u2019t nailed down.\u201d Lily just took out her cellphone. \u201cHey, Maggie, takeout's on me. What would you prefer for lunch? Pizza or tacos?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Unlike her daughters, Cattleya was a type of monster called a splinter cat, a woodland feline monster know for its hard skull. Cattleya was a brown furred feline creature creature with a humanoid white face along with furred white hands that resembled glows. She had the ears of a lynx albeit with a fluffier tail. Cattley's hair was long and brown with a white streaked ponytail resembling a cat's tail and a pair of similarly colored sideburns. She was on the plump side but not nearly as much as her daughters. Being a splinter cat, Cattleya had an enormous ass, one that made Maggie's and Fiona's look small by comparison. Aside from her wrinkled face, she looked surprisingly well for her age. At 800ft tall, she was shorter than either of her daughters or her granddaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated Cattleya and Cattleya hated you. She was one of those monsters that believed humans were only useful as food and was appalled at the idea of her younger daughter marrying one, even after twenty years. In fact, she despised you the moment Maggie made the mistake of introducing you and was hissing at you as she gave Maggie away at your wedding. She even tried to eat you once. Thank goodness Cattleya's hatred of you didn't extend to Sapphire. But the only question was, what was that busybody doing here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie bites her lip. \"Mom,\" she says. \"Whatever you do, don't come in here. You'll be sorry.\" \"And why is that?\" asks Cattleya rather suspiciously. \"Don't you read the paper?\" you ask before mumbling under her breath. \"You old crabapple.\" \"I'm surprised <i>you</i> can read at all, parasite,\" says Cattleya growing angrier with you. \"What did you do to my Maggie!? Whatever's going on, I know it's somehow your fault!\" \"I had nothing to do with it, fatass! Go away!\" \"Neil!\" yells a horrified Maggie. Cattleya lets out an angry feline hiss. \"I'm coming in.\" Your mean mother-in-law says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then smile fiendishly. \"Neil?\" asks Maggie. \"Why are you smiling?\" You let out a laugh to yourself. If there was anyone who deserved to get infected by nebutori, it was that pain in the neck that's been making you miserable for two decades. You feel tremors and Cattleya is walking inwards. \"Maggie?\" asks your mother-in-law. \"Where are you?\" Cattleya walks in to see her bloated daughter on the destroyed couch and looks in surprise as Maggie gives a nervous look. \"Maggie,\" says Cattleya. \"You look horrible. And I thought Fiona let herself go. What the hell have you been eating?\" \"Mom!\" yells Maggie. \"Get out quick! I've got nebutori!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just give a sly look at Cattleya as she gives a look of horror. \"Good grief!\" yells your mother in law. Cattleya then screams as she holds her stomach in pain. Her already massive ass was getting larger and tearing away at her brown one-piece dress and from the looks of it, her stomach and breasts were following suit. You let out a laugh at her misfortune while Cattleya glares at you with her teeth showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Cattleya is...</span></div></div>",

You didn't like when she visited. Sure she isn't as bad as your mean ****ing mother-in-law, Cattleya but Fiona is always stalking you despite the fact you're married to her sister. It wasn't her fault. That asshole Fang openly cheated on her and divorced her on Valentine's Day. Because of that, Fiona was also morbidly obese, even moreso than Maggie (prior to the nebutori of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went to check on you and see if you and Neil were doing alright.\" Maggie gives a look of horror. It would appear that Fiona didn't know about the nebutori. And from the looks of it, Maggie was twice as big as Fiona by this point. \"Fiona!\" yells Maggie. \"Do NOT come in here! You'll be sorry!\" \"Wait,\" says Fiona. \"I just remembered where you keep the spare key, little sister.\" \"No!\" you and Maggie both shout.\" But it was too late, Fiona forced her way in and was looking around. \"Maggie?\" she asks. \"Are you in here? Is Neil in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona walks her way into the living room and looks in surprise at her now blob-like sister taking up the entire couch. \"Prometheus chained to the Zeus-damned mountain!\" yells your manticore sister in law. \"And I thought I was out of shape. Maggie, you're a mess. What have you been eating.\" \"Fiona!\" yells Maggie. \"You idiot! Get back! I have nebutori! Stay away!\" Fiona looks in confusion as her eyes are focused on you wedged between Maggie's rolls. \"Poor thing,\" she says. \"Don't worry, Neil. I'll get you out of there.\" Fiona pulls you out and winds up touching Maggie in the process. \"Oh,\" you groan. \"Now you've done it, Fiona.\" Fiona then recalls what Maggie said. \"Oh crap.\" She mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona groans and grabs her already large stomach as she drops you onto her left boob and you're forced to grab your sister-in-law's cleavage flesh and hang on as her stomach expanded and pressed against Maggie's. Fiona's hips were also bulging and tear apart her shorts and panties while her face puffs up to the point where you can see all her hundreds of teeth at once. Fiona's wings look even more minuscule as her scorpion tail starts to bulge out as well and her tank-top practically explodes as she roars in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds, Fiona is... </span></div></div>",

You were now sandwiched between the fleshy mass that was her wife and her sister. Fiona was looking around in shock.

Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!\" yells the manticore as she hyperventilates. Maggie just rolls her eyes. \"Real smooth, Fiona. I told you not to touch me. Didn't you watch the news? Everyone at the precinct got infected with nebutori yesterday. There's an epidemic!\" Fiona gives a blush. \"I'm sorry, Maggie.\" Maggie let out a sigh. \"Doesn't matter. I probably should've told you yesterday. But I was too tired to... oh my Zeus! Where's Neil!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou at the time were in a dark space between Fiona and Maggie's obese stomachs.

You start to inch forward and Fiona and Maggie feel you. \"It's Neil!\" yells Fiona. \"Thank goodness he's alive. I can feel him. Fiona would reach in and grab you but Maggie grabs her by the arm to stop her. \"Fiona, no! You might squish him. If we just take a gentle step back...\" Maggie grunts and tries to lift her massive booty and hips off the ground, but she doesn't have the stamina too. Fiona tries to shake enough to move back herself but she's too heavy. \"Terrific,\" moaned Maggie. \"If this nebutori gets any worse, we won't be able to move.\" \"I'm scared, Maggie,\" says Fiona as she bites her claws and scratches her head with her wings. \"What if we're stuck like this? I already let myself go after 11 years of loneliness when Fang walked out on me. To think, I used to have a body that would put the strongest wrestler to shame.\" Fiona lets out a moan but Maggie grabs her sister by her face cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Fiona. Any sudden moves might crush Neil. Neil! Can you hear us down there!\" You let out a sigh as you continue to move through the lioness fat sandwiching you. \"I've been better!\" you call up. \"Neither of you move. I'll make it through.\" Maggie lets out a moan and Fiona pants in ecstasy as you move through the fleshy stomaches of your wife and sister-in-law.

As you make your way upwards through the flab, you unknowingly rub both feline titanesses in sensitive areas, leaving Fiona panting in pleasure and Maggie trying hard not to moan, as she was enjoying it too. \"...I have to hold on... not in front of Fiona, oh gods, specially NOT in front of HER. But it feels so good...\" she thought to herself, biting her lower and fuller lip as her thick fingers twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey?

She holds her breath, and tries to ignore the sensations you cause her as you worm your way up her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...a bit further, d-dear. Be ca-careful.\" she half moans, half mutters, while listening to her older sibling's loud purrs. Fiona looked like she left one foot on Earth, and set the other in Heaven, your wife pondered, and she desperately hoped she wouldn't give in to her urges. She could already smell it in the air, that thick scent that meant arousal, and that wasn't helping at all. \"N-Neil, you better hurry up!\" she pleaded, trying to hold her urges back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona, for her part, felt heavenly, despite their combined predicament, she never knew just how sensitive her belly was, or how... good it felt to be touched like that. Feeling her crush squirming under her lard-filled stomach sent wave after wave of pleasure, and she was very close to losing herself in it. Her hands grabbed hold of her massive love handles and squeezed gently, further enhancing her sensations. This didn't escape Maggie's attention, as she tried to peek over her massive bosom, only to see her sister's equally large melons blocking the view to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting out of hand, the last thing you needed was two huge fat cats to deal with, and horny ones at that, your wife thought, groaning as she too felt her resistance faltering. You, on the other hand, kept going up, trying to not let the occasional shakes and shudders bother you, blissfully unaware of what was going on outside. Eventually though, after what seemed an eternity buried under flab, you see a small opening, and make your way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreedom came in the form of fresh air and bright light, but it was quickly replaced by hot breath. Blinking due to the light, you look at your wife, and your smirk of accomplishment is quickly replaced by a look of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... N-Neil...\" Maggie mutters, her face flushed and breathing heavily through her mouth, her eyes half closed. You feel the 'ground' shudder, sensing something looming behind you, and turn around. Not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...oohoh wow...\" Fiona just moaned and panted, her eyes equally half lidded, giving you a seductive look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. This wasn't going to happen, it couldn't happen, not now, not never, and certainly not between your wife and sister-in-law! You swallow.</span></div></div>",

This special strain of LOS though came into contact with Nebutori, and when someone with the strain touches another Monster, it inflicts the Monster touched with Nebutori!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like I am right now\" Maggie said, shaking her hand with Ember to thank her for her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ember seemed to have forgotten all about Maggie when she was explaining, and when she noticed Maggie shaking her hand, she was frightened. \"Oh no, I've been infected! Why would you make contact with me even though I just told you what would happen to other Monsters who make contact with you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell-\" Before Maggie could finish her sentence, she felt her chest feeling all weird. After a minute, you and Ember saw that Maggie's breasts were growing bigger before your eyes, growing through both Nebutori and LOS. You also noticed that Ember was also growing fatter and taller through her contact with Maggie, and she looked like she was very scared and nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two were done growing, you saw that the two were definitely bigger. Maggie only gained weight in her breasts, but her gains were massive, and her breasts reached all the way to her hips. When Ember was done growing, she was 1720 Feet taller and looked slightly bigger than the tallest Monster in the world, and was certainly a lot fatter, with her breasts finally being matched by a massive stomach, and her bottom was quite a bit fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Maggie...</span></div></div>",

So good to see you again! How have you been holding up?\" she says, with a fake smile on her face. God, you hated her. As soon as she catches wind that you're here, that smile will be gone. \"We've been holding up just as good as always, mom. Come on in, get off your feet. Just be careful where you put them, Neil is on the coffee table.\" Cattleya looks around at the mention of your name, and she spots you fairly quickly, her face quickly turned into one of pure anger as she hissed at you, causing you to recoil somewhat. Yep. Today was gonna be one of those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she enters the house, plopping onto the couch infront of you, Maggie enters the adjoining kitchen. \"Want me to make you something, mom? Coffee, a snack...\" \"Some coffee would be fine, thank you dear.\" she said, speaking calmly to her daughter before turning bitter and facing you. \"Hello, <i>Neil.</i>\" she says, emphasizing your name as if it were blasphemous to even say it. \"Still as puny as ever, I see. I still can't wrap my head around what my daughter sees in you. I thought I'd raised her better...\" \"Well, at least she has better taste in men then you!\" \"<i>What did you say?!</i>\" she practically yells, getting in your face, clearly angry. \"Mom! Quit being mean to Neil!\" yells Maggie from the other room. Cattleya still glares at you like a war criminal, but she backs off a bit at least, and slumps back into the couch, placing her legs on the coffee table...dangerously close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, she notices how close you are to her feet, and a mischievous, toothy grin crawls across her face. She lifts up one of her feet, and hovers it dangerously close to you. \"Maggie, help-\" you cry out, cut off by the sudden force of being pinned underneath your mother-in-law's gross, hairy feet. You try to call out to Maggie, but you end up getting a mouthful of hair instead. At least this wasn't nearly as painful as being sat on, but it was humiliating either way, and you knew Cattleya just <i>loved</i> to torment you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, Maggie finally entered the room, holding an olympic swimming pool sized cup of coffee, which she sets on the coffee table. \"Coffee's ready, mom.\" \"Could you hand that to me, dear? My feet are just <i>so</i> comfortable in this position...\" \"Mom, come on, you can-where's Neil?\" \"Neil? Neil who?\" says your mother-in-law, acting clueless. \"Mom, get up. If you're sitting on him again...\" \"Relax, he went to get something, he'll be back in a bit.\" An obvious lie. There's no way Maggie will believe that. \"Oh, alright.\" ...she believed it. Well, looks like you're not getting out of here any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an agonizing few minutes trapped underneath the weight of your mother-in-law's legs, Maggie has to get up to do something (probably to check on you, since you've been gone so long), and leaves the room, giving Cattleya the opportunity to pick her legs off the table and observe your crumpled form. No bones were broken, but your spirit was crushed...and your body was, too. Everything was hurting...and she relished that fact. \"Oh, Neil...you deserve treatment far, far worse then that. But what to do with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd try and run, but you're in far too much pain to do so right now...and this wasn't even the worst of what she'd do to you. Oh, joy. Just your luck. What DOES she do with you?</span></div></div>",

When Fiona sees you her smile gets wider and she shows off her three rows of teeth. \"Hello Neil!\" she says and walks over to you. When she gets to the table she reaches down and scratches your head with a claw. She's very gentle and it feels good, but you don't like when she does it. The reason is because you know she's flirting with you. Ever since she got divorced she's been very depressed, but has taken a liking to you. Even though you're married to her sister, Fiona still tries to get your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie comes over and sees her sister scratching you affectionately. \"I'm glad the two of you get along. Now if mom could just be this accepting...\" she says. \"He is a little cutie.\" Fiona says and gives you a smile. You know there's something else in that smile. Maggie motions for Fiona to have a seat. The manticore walks around the table to the couch, giving you a clear view of her ass as she does. Its big, even bigger than Maggie's. She used to be very muscular, but let herself go after the divorce. Personally you think she looks good, but you have thing for big women, you did marry Maggie after all. When she turns Fiona catches you staring and smiles in glee. You groan at this, cursing yourself for staring. Maggie sits down as well and you move closer to her. \"So anything new Fiona?\" she asks. Fiona just slumps her shoulders. \"No, just the same old life. The same old me.\" she says sadly. Maggie rubs her back. \"Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find a nice guy soon.\" she assures her. Fiona just gets even more depressed. \"Easy for you to say. You've got a cute little husband and a daughter..\" she says. She's killing the mood and Maggie feels it too. \"How about I get us some coffee?\" she suggests, hoping a nice cup would calm her sister's nerves. With that she gets up and heads to the kitchen, leaving you alone with Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maggie is out of sight Fiona scoots over to you. \"Its nice to have some time alone isn't it?\" she says to you. \"Uh. yeah...\" you respond. She leans down and fills your vision with her face, batting her eyes at you. \"I've always wanted to get to know you better. I saw how you were checking out my ass earlier.\" she says. \"Look Fiona, that was just...\" you begin. \"Its okay, you're a guy after all.\" she cuts in. She smiles at you giving you a close up of her three rows of teeth. They're razor sharp and gleaming. You know she won't eat you so you're not scared of them. Its her other hunger that frightens you. Suddenly she picks you up and gives you a lick. \"How did Maggie land a prize like you? You're so cute and small. At that manageable size I'll bet a girl could keep you close to her at all times.\" she says dreamily. Then she gives you a little pout. \"You don't think there's anything wrong with me, do you?\" she asks. You really want her to put you down, but you don't have the heart to hurt her feelings, not with that look on her face. \"Of course not.\" you answer. \"I'm sure you'll find someone, just like Maggie has me.\" You emphasize that last part, hoping she'll get the point. She doesn't and licks you a few more times. She starts to purr and gives you a big kiss before putting you down. Does Maggie catch the kiss?</span></div></div>",

She gives you a an awkward smile and shrugs. \"So how have things been around here?\" Fiona asks. \"Oh, pretty good, right honey?\" Maggie says. You snap out of it and answer. \"Yeah, things have been great.\" you say. \"You two must be really happy together.\" Fiona notes, back in her depressed mode. She reaches over and begins stroking your back with a claw after she says this. You look at Maggie, who shrugs again. \"Uh, Sapphire's doing well too.\" you say. \"Yes, she's getting along well with her friends and she's doing very good in school.\" Maggie adds. \"You guys must be so proud.\" Fiona says with a smile. Its kind of a sad smile. Maggie looks at you and motions to Fiona with her eyes, like she wants you to do something. You pat Fiona's massive finger and give it a little rub. The manticore's smile widens and she looks genuinely happy. She then gets up and heads toward the bathroom. \"I'll be right back.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fiona's out of the room you look up at Maggie. \"What was that about? You saw what she did right?\" you say. \"I know, I saw. Its just that...Fiona's been really depressed, and she looked so happy.\" she says. \"You do realize that your sister kissed your husband and you're okay with it?\" you remind her. \"Yes, but she won't go further than that, and how much can a little affection hurt? She's always in a good mood when you're around, so can you just bear with it? Please, she's my sister.\" Maggie pleads. She leans down and gives you a kiss and bats her eyes in attempt to sway you. She really cares about her sister. \"Fine.\" you say with a sigh. \"Just make sure she doesn't do anything funny.\" Maggie smiles. \"Oh I won't. She might be lonely, but she won't do anything bad. She's a nice girl, she's just having a rough time.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fiona comes back into the room she sits down and resumes drinking her coffee. She's in a slightly better mood, and the three of you continue your conversation. \"So how's work?\" Maggie asks Fiona. \"Its going okay.\" she answers. \"It does feel good helping people get back on their feet. At least I can makes someone's life better.\" There she goes again. \"How are things at the salon?\" she asks you. \"Well its good I guess. I do whatever they need me too, so it varies.\" you tell her. \"Hmm, maybe I should pay you a visit there so you can help me relax.\" Fiona says to you with a wink.

At this point you had been moved to her shoulder, so you're going with her. She stops halfway however and looks over at you. \"Why don't you stay with Fiona honey. It would cheer her up, okay?\" she says. \"Okay.\" you say with a sigh. While this is kind of annoying you're happy that Maggie is trying to make her sister feel better. Fiona's not a bad person either. You actually do think she's attractive, its just that you're married. Maggie places you on the back of the couch and walks away. You walk over to where Fiona is sitting but suddenly she leans back. She sighs as she slumps into the back of the couch. The shift knocks you off balance and you go tumbling off of your perch and head right for her cleavage. Now you're trapped in between the massive jugs of your wife's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Fiona gets up and starts walking. You are helplessly stuck between her breasts and have no choice but to go along. Fiona heads into the kitchen and walks over to Maggie. \"I'm going to get going, so I'll see you two later.\" she says. She gives Maggie a hug, squishing you as their giant boobs press together. You want to call out to your wife, but are unable to even move. \"All right sis. See you.\" Maggie says. Fiona turns and heads to the door. She scans the room, looking for you, but doesn't see you. She didn't see you in the kitchen so she figured you'd be in here. \"I wonder where he went? Oh, I'd love to give him a goodbye kiss!\" she says, half giddy, half depressed. Little does she know you're right on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona walks through the door and heads to her car. As she walks you feel the movement through her boobs.

Fiona walks out and lets out a sigh. \"Home again, home again.\" She says in a depressed tone. Fiona walks towards the house, unknowingly jiggling you in her breasts as you grunt. You wind up slipping through her shirt as she unlocks the door. As Fiona enters the house, you roll down her ample stomach and grab onto the waistband of her shorts. You let out a sigh before Fiona walks forward and you harmlessly slide down her leg before hitting the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. Your manticore sister-in-law didn't even feel you. As you land, you hear a crunching noise beneath your feet. \"Huh?\" you ask. you look down and see you stepped on a large potato chip. You then see that the floor is littered with them as well as empty bags and dinosaur bones. Fiona's house in fact was a disaster area and the wallpaper was even peeling off. Fiona was the worst housekeeper you know. The living room looked like a landfill. Then again, she lives alone so she stopped bothering to keep up appearances for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear stomping and run around the couch to see your sister-in-law walking in the kitchen. She reaches into a box of dried pasta and chews on a few sticks without even bothering to chew them. Fiona then opens the fridge to take out a carton of milk. She sniffs the contents and gives a face of disgust. Obviously it had gone bad. But then Fiona shrugs her shoulders and drinks it anyway, you have to run back into the living room and hold your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder she's in such bad shape,\" you say. \"Her diet is terrible. But thankfully it's human free.\" You knew for a fact that Fiona quit eating humans when you started dating Maggie. At least someone in the family respected your relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wonder how you're going to get back home, you look and see several photographs on the mantle. One showed her with Maggie, except back then Fiona was much more muscular and looked like a Ms. Universe finalist. You see a trophy case in the corner and it reminds you. Maggie said that Fiona was a record breaking athlete back in high school and that she was actually jealous of Fiona and the fact Fiona got married first. Then her marriage fell apart and it all went down from there. You shake your head in pity. \"Oh how the mighty have fallen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder just how you're supposed to get back. Maggie must be worried sick. At least you can trust Fiona, well, mostly. She may be a stalker but she's completely harmless to humans. Suddenly, Fiona's phone begins to ring. Fiona walks out of the kitchen and is about to answer it, but lets out a sigh, turns around and decides to let the answering machine pick it up. But who is it who's calling her?</span></div></div>",

She walks to a small building and enters. You hear a few people talking as you try to climb up and get Fiona's attention. You manage to make it to the top of her shirt before her breasts jiggle and knock you back down. Just before you fall you manage to get a look at where you are. It seems to be waiting area, and Fiona is heading to a room in the back. You also see a fat weretiger with white fur sitting at the front desk. Fiona must be at work, she's a physical therapist. Its a little ironic that someone as depressed as Fiona can help people with their problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Fiona.\" you hear someone say. \"Hi Ava, anything new happening with you?\" Fiona asks who you assume is the tiger woman. \"Not really, how about you?\" Ava answers. Fiona slumps a little. \"No.\" she says with a sigh. You can't see it, but the weretiger is giving Fiona a pitying look. \"Well to give you something to do, there's a patient waiting for you.\" she informs the manticore. Fiona grabs the clipboard with the patient's information and heads into one of the doors in the hallway. When she enters who is there?</span></div></div>",

While they talk you try to climb out of Fiona's top once again. You manage to reach the top of her shirt and get a glimpse of Jessica. She's a drider woman with long black hair. Her upper body is that of a chubby woman, and below her waist is the body of a red spider. What stands out about her is the fact that her lower body is resting in some sort of wagon like device. Her back four spider legs are folded up on the wagon, and it looks like she uses her front legs to move around. Its kind of like a wheelchair for driders. \"I've been trying to move my legs and I think I'm getting better.\" Jessica tells Fiona. \"Just make sure you don't overdo it, its going to be a slow process. We don't want to rush things.\" Fiona says. Its strange that the normally sad Fiona can sound so dependable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to climb over the top of the shirt and finally manage to escape from Fiona's cleavage. To avoid falling back into those depths you try to move to the side and get to her shoulder. When you glance over at Jessica you see that she's slowly stretching out her legs. Fiona walks around a bit, so you hold on as best as you can. Looking around you see that she's helping Jessica as she grabs onto two rails on the ground and hoists herself into the air. She's standing on her front legs and slowly unfolding her back ones. She shakily sets them gently onto the ground while steadying herself on the device. \"Okay, easy now.\" Fiona says. She's standing next to the drider and making sure she doesn't overexert herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've just about made it onto the shoulder when Fiona suddenly bends down. She's checking on Jessica's legs, and the movement causes you to fall off. As you fall through the air you see that you're headed fro the legs of the drider. With no other options you try to grab onto them as best as you can. You manage to get a good grip and cling to one of them. You're glad you're tiny to her so you won't cause any damage to her legs. Looking up you see Fiona walking away, meaning you have to climb Jessica now. You make your way up the leg, which is considerably easier than climbing Fiona. Since her legs don't work properly she has to move slow, giving you a better chance to hold on. You think you're in the clear until Fiona starts talking. \"Okay, now try to stretch one of them out again.\" she tells Jessica. The drider complies and stretches out one of her spider legs. It just so happens that its the one you're on. Its not so bad at first, since she's moving slow, but the second time she does it is different. She over does it a little and ends up kicking the leg out, which sends you flying off and into the air. As you fall back down you're headed for.... </span></div></div>",

Quickly you grab onto the drider woman's hair and slide down her back before landing feet first on her giant red abdomen. You let out a sigh of relief and then grunt as you step back. Maggie definitely wouldn't appreciate you being on the rear of another woman, especially one whose butt was even bigger than Cattleya's. Though since Jessica was a drider, it couldn't be helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to overexert yourself, Jessica,\" says Fiona. \"But you're making progress. How did this happen again?\" The drider lets out a sigh and blushes. \"I injured half of my legs trying to hang a photograph of my son and his new fianc\u00e9e. \"That's right,\" says Fiona. \"He's a human. My brother-in-law is a human, not to mention the cutest one I've ever seen. Uh, disregard. That doesn't explain how you got hurt.\" Jessica blushes again and scratches her back. \"I slipped on the ladder.\" You let out a groan. \"A ladder?\" asks Fiona. \"You're a drider. Why would you need a ladder?\" Jessica lets out a laugh. \"I guess I'm getting on in age. Oh! oh!\" Two of Jessica's back legs begin to twitch and you start to slip as she starts to rise in the air and you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly fall off the edge of her abdomen but notice some webbing leaking out and grab it before using it to swing to safety back on top of the spider woman's continent sized rear. \"I could totally be Spider-Man.\" You think to yourself. Fiona bends and takes a closer look before smiling. \"Well, Jessica, it looks like you're making a fast recovery. Six legs down two to go.\" \"Thanks Fiona,\" says Jessica. \"Pretty soon, I'll be able to go back to Horrorville.\" \"Horrorville?!\" you think to yourself. This wasn't good. Horrorville was miles away from Dreadberry and it looked like Jessica was walking back toward her bed with you on her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe you're thinking this, but you hope that Fiona notices you on this spider woman's enormous abdomen.</span></div></div>",

The patient was a gray furred and 900ft tall cerberus lady who was wearing a one-piece swimsuit similar to the one Maggie usually wears. Except, that was aqua blue on the right, crimson on the left and magenta in the center. Her center head had black sceleras and ash-gray hair that was worn in a beehive style. Her left head had braided violet hair and was wearing a pair of goggles and had a crazy grin with her tongue sticking out of her mouth while her right head had cyan hair worn with spikes put into them and was wearing a glass eyepatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cerberus girl was very pear-shaped and had an ass that could almost rival Maggie's. However, what was most striking about her was her ginormous boobs. Each one looked the size of watermelons had she been human sized. In fact, they looked so heavy that she was hunched over and carrying a pair of crutches. \"Hello Mrs. Welker,\" says Fiona. \"So you've come to have your macromastia treated?\" \"Mrs. Welker?\" you think to yourself. This woman was Ruby's mother. You never met but you heard that Ruby's mom was a cerberus, unlike her orthrus daughter. \"Macromastia?\" You've heard of that. It's a disorder where a woman's breasts were too big for her body to support. It's a wonder she could even move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Welker's right most head let out a laugh. \"Don't worry about formality. Just call me Rose. You must be Maggie's sister. You know, we might actually be cousins. Both the original cerberus and Nemean Lion were children of Echidna after all. But that was thousands of years ago and....\" Rose's gray-haired center head just let out a growl and bit her right head in the ear to make her yell. \"Shut the hell up, you airhead!\" Then she growled and turned to Fiona and looked in surprise. You let out a gulp. You heard it wasn't uncommon for cerberuses (or is that ceberi?) to have split personalities but Rose seemed like a real basket case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here because I have a problem,\" says the gray-haired center head as she roared. \"It doesn't look that promising to have a fat cat with a scorpion's tail be our doctor.\" Rose's violet-haired left head just laughed insanely and didn't talk. \"Look at these things,\" says Rose's center head as she cups her boobs and the right head let out a sigh. \"I bagged a pretty good man with these but they just keep getting bigger every year. I almost smothered my husband to death with these meteors.\" The left head let out a laugh as the center head continued to rant. \"I'm not joking, broccoli buns,\" says Rose. \"I almost squashed my husband like a freakin' bug. He told me that he wants me to do something about them and until them he said he was going to be sleeping on the couch. So get off your large and unflattering green ass and...\" The center head then turned to the laughing left head and growled at it to make it shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. How the hell did Ruby turn out to be so normal with such a crazy mom. \"You'll have to excuse her,\" says the right head. \"She's always had a violent temper. I warned her that one day it would get her in trouble but she never listens to me. \"Shut up!\" yells the center head. Fiona lowers her head and presses her breasts against Rose's as you groan and have to hold your breast lest the much bigger pair of breasts suffocate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Fiona. \"The problem is that they're too heavy. You need to build your body up to carry them. Lift with your knees.\" Fiona then feels Rose's legs and makes all three of her heads wince in discomfort. \"Just as I thought. All flab.\" \"What would you know?\" asked Rose's center head. \"Your body is all flab.\" Fiona just gives a glare. \"I wasn't always like this. I used to have a body that would put the Hulk to shame. But 11 years of comfort food after Fang left me destroyed that. I have an idea. We'll start with something easy for the next few days. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona walks towards another door and shakes you up all the way. Maybe you should get her attention and let her know you're stuck in her boobs. Then again, knowing Fiona, she'd probably shove you too deep down to ever hope to get out. In the next room, you see a small pool. \"Swimming is good for the old leg muscles,\" said Fiona. \"And those large breasts would actually float. I'll show you what to do.\" Fiona was actually making sense. It's kinda ironic. Since Fang abandoned her on Valentines Day, she's been so depressed that it's a miracle she didn't try to commit suicide. She went so far as to ruin her physique and hygiene. But when it came to helping other people through physical therapy, she couldn't go wrong. She knew exactly what to do. Ironic. She could make other people happy but not herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose steps into the pool first and then Fiona lowers her shorts to reveal a bikini bottom underneath. Talk about planning in advance. But then you gasp as Fiona starts to take off her shirt. This shakes her breasts and causes you to slip out and land screaming in...</span></div></div>",

For once, you were thankful of Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was simple.

You remember one time she claimed the government was putting nebutori in the drinking water to make all women fat in order to sell them larger clothes and another time, that idiot accused the dentist of putting listening devices disguised as fillings in people's mouth. It was so ridiculous that she used a fake name from an old classmate she assumed died years ago.

That and her trademark headphones. \"Penny,\" says Maggie. \"Good to see you.\" Penny doesn't respond and Maggie lets out a sigh before pulling on one of the seal giantess's headphones. \"I said it's good to see you again, Penny.\" \"Likewise, Maggie. Thanks for inviting me over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. Penny always had those stupid headphones on and that made her oblivious to everything. One of these days that pinniped is going to go deaf. Penny waddled up to the couch and climbed into it, forcing you to move out of the way before you were plastered under her blubbery behind. \"Watch it, Penny!\" you yell. Penny turns her head and notices you standing on top of one of her tail flippers. \"Sorry Neil,\" she said. \"Even after two whole decades, I still find it hard to believe a Nemean lion like Maggie married you. After all, they're in the top five of the most dangerous monsters to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie was in the kitchen at the time making coffee and you crawl up Penny's back to try and reach her ears, not easy considering her slippery skin. Along the way, you slip slightly and land on one of the rolls on Penny's stomach. It doesn't help that Penny is banging her head to whatever music she's listening too. This forces you to pinch the seal woman to get her attention. Penny grunts and takes off her headphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Penny,\" you say. \"How is Ethan doing? I heard he was sick.\" Penny shrugged her shoulders. \"He recovered three days ago.\" You of course were asking about Penny's elusive husband. Penny actually got married on a trip to Europe before Maggie married you, so you've never met Ethan. In fact, Maggie hadn't. Neither you nor your wife nor anyone else in town for that matter knew what Ethan O'Neil looked like or what he even <i>was</i>. All you knew for sure was that whatever he was, he wasn't the same species as his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Maggie had a grim look on her face. \"This time I'm going to find out what kind of man I live next to,\" Maggie thinks to herself. \"Say goodbye to enigma, Mr. O'Neil because I have a plan. Maggie takes a monster sized cup of coffee and then takes it out to Penny who begins to drink it. \"You look sleepy, Penny. The DJ gig must be keeping you up all night.\" Penny just nodded her head before drinking the coffee. You see that Penny's face starts to turn a pinker shade of gray and then she starts to hiccup. \"The coffee's a little strong today.\" says the seal giantess. \"Oh,\" says Maggie smugly. \"That's because I added a bit of wiffleberry juice into it.\" Penny hiccups again and sways as you look up in confusion at the slightly intoxicated giantess. \"Now's my chance.\" Says Maggie. \"Chance for what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" says Maggie. \"Me and Neil hang out with Meryl and Flint, the Oxnards and the Sirtises a lot.\" \"I hadn't noticed.\" Says Penny still under the effects of the wiffleberry coffee. You knew where this was going. Penny always drank decaf coffee. She was the only person you knew who could get drunk on soda pop so her stomach couldn't take something like wiffleberries. Maggie was going to force Penny to agree to an outing just to meet Ethan. \"Don't look at me like that, Neil,\" says Maggie looking down at you. \"I'm a cat.

Maggie walks out and places you on the sill of the open window. \u201cNow Neil Honey,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t let Atlanta and Prima work you too hard. If a certain leviathan tries anything, I\u2019ll lock her up.\u201d You let out a laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Maggie. That won\u2019t be necessary. \u201cHave a good day at work Dad.\u201d Says Sapphire.\u201d Both your daughter and wife bend down and kiss you from the sides, The warm white lips of Maggie contrast with the cold wet blue lips of Sapphire, but you\u2019re not complaining. You wave goodbye to your family and walk in the window and jump down to the table with the shampoo and hair tools. You look up and see both your bosses getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was the woman who hired you, Prima Maston. Prima was an okay boss, but one thing about her bugged you. Most monsters you knew were from mythology or fantasy stories, but Prima, you didn\u2019t know how she qualified as a monster. She was a giant woolly mammoth. You once asked her about that, but she got mad and sucked you up her trunk before she spat you into a pterodactyl bath. Prima at the moment was right in front of you adjusting a barber\u2019s chair as her massive black spandex covered behind was right in front of you. You then turn to see Atlanta, your other boss switching the CLOSED sign to OPEN. Atlanta was a leviathan, an aquatic dragon with webbed hands and feet and no wings. You didn\u2019t like her much. While Prima considered you an employee, Atlanta saw you as a slave even though she was paying you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrima!\u201d you shout. \u201cPrima!\u201d The mammoth giantess\u2019s ears twitch and your enormous boss turns and looks down on you. \u201cNeil,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you use the front... oh. Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. After all, a bug sized employee is still an employee.\u201d You walk forward before Prima lifts you up into the air with her trunk. Atlanta walks forward. \u201cI have an idea Prima. Why not for his first chore, our little slave rubs our toes for a change.\u201d Prima lets out a sigh. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you Atlanta, Neil isn\u2019t our slave. He\u2019s our employee and he\u2019s one of only two employees we have. \u201cCome on Prima,\u201d says Atlanta. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you wouldn\u2019t want the little insect giving you a massage?\u201d Prima just trumpets her trunk in front of her business partner. \u201cI am his boss and so are you, we have to remember our professional relationship.\u201d Atlanta let out a scoff. \u201cHow did your people survive the Ice Age? After all, you had the bright idea to let that ditzy hornet Doz put up a bar in the salon.\u201d \u201cShe thought it was a <i>saloon</i> Atlanta,\u201d says Prima .\u201dAnd whose fault is that? You told me you knew how to spell.\u201d Atlanta mumbles to herself and crosses her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true, Doz, the warbeast came looking for a job and mistook the <i>salon</i> for a <i>saloon</i> because of Atlanta\u2019s spelling mistake on a help wanted sign. You saw her buzzing forward and polishing glasses. Why you don\u2019t know. Who could possibly want booze this early in the day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what are you going to do today?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But for a human, to say it was quite a workout would be an understatement. You spent the next eight hours traversing across the backs of various monster women, rubbing and massaging every inch that you could. For the ones with ordinary skin, it was at least bearable. But the ones covered in scales left your hands looking like raw hamburger, and as for the ones covered in fur, it was like being lost in a forest. But eventually, your shift ends, and Maggie comes to pick you up. She places you between her breasts and drives back home. \"So how was your day, dear?\" She asks \"Exhausting.\" You say \"Prima put me on massage duty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's over with now, and you can spend the rest of the day relaxing with me.\" You chuckle \"That's what I look forward to.\" Later that night, you and your family were enjoying a nice dinner, discussing how each of your days went. \"So honey, any luck with this Specter character?\" You ask Maggie \"Still nothing. Whoever it is, it's like they can walk straight through walls.\" Maggie turns to Sapphire and asks \"How was your day sweetie?\" But when Sapphire opens her mouth to speak, all that comes out is the sound of a rooster crowing. Needless to say, this really confused you. \"What was that?\" What was even stranger, was that Maggie reacted as if nothing weird was going on. She just said \"That's nice, dear.\" Before returning to her meal. \"Maggie, did you just hear what came out of our daughter's mouth?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. She said she aced her math test this morning. Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I could have sworn...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there's a loud popping noise, and where your wife was sitting, there is now a gigantic flamingo. You rub your eyes, only to see that you're not hallucinating. You turn around to see that your daughter is now a blue kangaroo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on around here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you here a high pitched laugh, and a female voice says \"Confusing, isn't it?\" You turn to see what appeared to be a human woman, dressed in a black and purple jester costume, her face colored white with black lipstick and eyeliner. \"Who are you? Did you do this?\" You ask angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jester woman grins. \"What's wrong? You don't like my work?\" She levitate a few inches off the surface of the table, and begins flying around you in circles. \"What are you?\" You ask \"You're my size, so you can't be a monster.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there are many who would disagree on that. I can be any size I want, do anything I want, and what I want right now is to have some fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just who are you, exactly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your worst nightmare. But just call me Kltpzyxm.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call you what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs in frustration, and pronounces it slowly. \"Kill-tip-see-zim\" \"Well, where did you come from, and why did you do this to my family?\" She smiles and shrugs \"I came from the tenth dimension, and I did this out of boredom mostly.I hate boring, and nothing amuses me more than screwing with the minds of three dimensional beings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were getting mad. She did this just for entertainment? That's got to be the dumbest thing you've ever heard. \"You grab her by the collar and lift her up off the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change them back now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon realize your mistake, as the next thing you know, you're the one being held, hundreds of feet in the air as a now giant Kltpzyxm is squeezing her first around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh uh, you shouldn't threaten a lady, especially one with god-like powers. Tell you what, let's play a game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it meant getting rid of this inter-dimensional Harley Quinn knock off, you'd try anything. \"Fine. What's your game?\" \"If you get me to say my name backwards, I'll disappear, for say, a week or so. But if you don't get me to say it within an hour, you and your family become my playthings.\" It suddenly occurs to you that this scenario seems familiar. Didn't you see this in a Superman cartoon before? An idea forms in your head, and you inwardly smile to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do I have to do to get you to go away again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me to say my name backwards.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I say it backwards if I can't even say it forwards?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I have to say it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mxyzptlk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOOF! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you're sitting on your dining room table, eating dinner, with your wife and daughter back to normal. \"Dear, did something just happen?\" Maggie asks. You smile. \"No, nothing. What's for dessert?\"</span></div></div>",

Maggie had to go into work earlier than usual because of a Specter related emergency so Meryl offered you a ride. Of course, being late for work doesn't concern you because you have Kltpzyxm to worry about. She said she'd be back. So, you decided to be ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your sister was driving, you walked alongside the front window and took out a marker to draw big letters on the front. Meryl notices this just as you've managed to write the Z and needless to say, she isn't happy. \"Hey!\" yells the giant skeleton. \"What's the big idea Neil!? I offer you a ride and you mess up my car?\" \"Don't worry Meryl,\" you say. \"It's only temporary.\" \"What are you writing anyway?\" \"Mxyzptlk.\" Meryl looks at you as if you're crazy but still keeps an eye on the road. \"Mxyzptlk? You mean that annoying little imp who's always pestering Superman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head. \"Well, just last week, I had trouble with a real life version from Dimension 10.\" \"You're kidding.\" \"No, she said her name was Kltpzyxm.\" \"Mxyzptlk? Kltpzyxm? You've been hanging around Lily too much. No offense Neil, but your wife has crazy friends.\" You finish drawing the M on the windshield before responding. \"You're the one who introduced me to Maggie, remember bonehead?\" \"Touch\u00e9.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as Meryl is driving, a stop sign appears out of nowhere and forces your sister to slam on the brakes. You yell and slide across the dashboard as one of Meryl's eyes roll out of her skull. Meryl winds up skidding off the road before her tires mysteriously turn into peppermint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did that stop sign come from?!\" yells Meryl as she puts her eye back into her head. Meryl gets out and sees her now candied tires melting on the ground. \"Huh?\" Suddenly there's a thundering sound and a gust of smoke and before you know it, your sister has been turned into a giant skeleton of a brontosaurus. \"What the Sam Hill!?\" \"Yep,\" you say as you look at your watch. \"That should be her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's another puff of smoke and Kltpzyxm shows up waving in your face. \"Guess who.\" She says. \"Oh,\" you say. \"Hello Ms. Mxyzptlk.\" \"It's Kltpzyxm not Mxy... Oh I see what you're trying to do. You must think I'm stupid.\" Meryl lowers her head and spots you and Kltpzyxm. \"Who's this clown Neil?\" she asks. Kltpzyxm smiles maliciously and snaps her fingers to make Meryl explode in a puff of smoke before revealing your sister had turned into a skeleton of a gargoyle. As Meryl is trying to wrap her skull around this, Kltpzyxm snaps her fingers and turns your sister into a skeleton of a donkey and then a skeleton of a frog and then a skeleton of a hippopotamus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skeletons are hilarious,\" says Kltpzyxm. \"Why didn't you tell me your sister was undead.\" Meryl grits her now enlarged tooth bones because she isn't amused. \"This crap ain't funny. Change me back right now or else...\" Kltpzyxm then snaps her fingers and turns Meryl into a skeletal elephant before laughing like a hyena. \"You're despicable!\" yells Meryl. Kltpzyxm laughs but then decides to spring the trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, real funny Kltpzyxm. But we can't stay, we have to get to the car wash. Some vandals defaced my sister's Scaravan.\" \"It doesn't look that bad to me,\" says Kltpzyxm. \"Hey, what's this word?\" Kltpzyxm snaps her fingers to summon a magnifying glass to look at the word you wrote. Upon realizing what she read, Kltpzyxm gasps and you give a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOOM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKltpzyxm disappears in a flash of light and Meryl is turned back to her normal form (Well normal for a 650ft skeleton). \"I told you so.\" You say. Meryl let out a mumble before stepping back into her car. \"I should've stayed in the ground.\" You let out a sigh as Meryl starts the car again. \"Get used to it Little Sis,\" you say. \"She'll be back in seven days.\" \"Seven days or not, you're cleaning my windshield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are you when Kltpzyxm attacks you again the next week?</span></div></div>",

However, you knew you were expecting bad company so you figured you'd paint a little message on the fingernails. The succubus night singer looks down in confusion. \"What are you doing human?\" she asks. \"I didn't request that paint job.\" \"Oh this,\" you say as you finish painting a P on Lee's thumbnail. \"It's, uh, the latest thing.\" Lee takes a closer look and reads the message, since the succubus used to be a human, she recognized the letters slightly. \"Mxyzp... oh, I remember that guy. Not by much though. I never was much of a comic fan. Don't paint that on my pinkies though, I want them red for a little contrast.\" \"Yes ma'am,\" you say. \"And one.. two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a puff of smoke and Kltpzyxm appears again. You let out a sigh. \"Don't you have anything better to do?\" you ask. \"Uh-uh,\" says Kltpzyxm with a smirk. \"You denied me my fun last time, but this time...\" \"This time I'm at work and as you can see I'm working on a succubus, you know how nasty they can get when you don't pay attention to them. There, done Lee.\" Lee smiles and then holds up her nail. \"You've just got to try out this nail job. This little guy is the best in the business.\" Kltpzyxm lowers her head to get a closer look at Lee's nails before she reads the letters inscribed on them. Once she realizes what they spell, her eyes pop and she glares at you. \"I hate you so much right now!\" With that, Kltpzyxm vanishes in a puff of smoke. Lee lets out a scoff. \"Jealous,\" she says. \"Simply jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus holds up her foot and you see her massive hoof in front of you. \"Don't forget the pedicure Neil. Try to make it flash.\" \"And while you're at it,\" says Prima. \"If that friend of yours comes back, tell her about the sign.\" The mammoth giantess points to a \"no-smoking\" sign as you work on Lee's massive hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week later, you're already waiting for Kltpzyxm to appear and start the process over again. At that moment you're visiting with your sister Meryl and playing a game of chess with Flint, your golem brother in law. As you push one of your pawns forward, Flint notices you're troubled. \"Something bothering you Neil?\" your brother-in-law asks. \"You might say that Flint,\" you say. \"I'm expecting company and not looking forward to it. And no, it's not Cattleya. This time.\" Flint moves his bishop to take your pawn and then rubs his chin. \"Worse than Cattlya? How is that even possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move a knight forward and stop to catch your breath. \"Well, I don't know if Meryl already told you but back on Earth we have comic books involving heroes and villains. You must have heard of Superman right? Well, he has an enemy called Mr. Mxyzptlk.\" Flint raises an eye slab at that before moving a pawn forward. \"That's a funny name.\" \"There's nothing funny about him,\" you say. \"He's an annoying trickster that can warp reality. The only way to get rid of him is to get him to say his name backwards, Kltpzyxm.\" Flint actually lets out a laugh at that as his stone body makes noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't laugh. I recently ran into someone just like Mxyzptlk named Kltpzyxm. Meryl ran into her too.\" Meryl comes forward and places drinks on the table. A glass for Flint and a thimble for you. \"Believe me dear,\" says Meryl to Flint. \"That babe is dangerous and she's gonna be on the warpath now that Neil's outsmarted her thrice. Does Maggie know about this?\" You just take a drink. \"She'd probably think I was crazy if I told her. I'm worried. Kltpzyxm should've been here by now.\" \"Maybe she gave up.\" Says Flint. You shake your head. \"No,\" you say. \"If she's anything like Mxyzptlk. I doubt it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Kltpzyxm was flying overhead and was in a sour mood. \"I can't believe it. He fooled me three times. I'm not gonna take this anymore! Maybe I better change tactics. There has got to be somebody in this town who hates this punk as much as I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kltpzyxm flies over your house, she looks across the street to the home of Meagan the were fox, your ex-girlfriend. Inside there are photographs on the wall of you that have knives jabbed into them and Meagan appeared to be chewing on an effigy of you. Twenty-years and she still has a grudge. \"Hmm,\" says Kltpzyxm. \"Interesting. But I wonder.\" Kltpzyxm then proceeds to fly downtown above your mother-in-law Cattleya's house. Inside Cattleya was washing dishes but Kltpzyxm saw inside that there was a photograph of you on a dartboard. \"Interesting,\" says Kltpzyxm. \"It seems that there are two hotheads who sound like fun. Maybe we can team up against Neil, or maybe they could be good for a laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Kltpzyxm decide to visit?</span></div></div>",

That rotten mother-in-law of yours continues to wash dishes when she notices pink bubbles forming out of the drain and grunts. The splinter cat giantess leaves the kitchen and returns with a plunger to tackle the problem only for Kltpzyxm to emerge from the drain smiling, prompting Cattleya to scream and grab a frying pan to assault Kltpzyxm with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKltpzyxm rubs her head as Cattleya growls at her. \"That's a very easy way to give someone a heart attack!\" yells your mother-in-law. \"Easy Lady,\" says Kltpzyxm. \"Ouch. By the way, you might want to look at the water heater.\" \"I'm calling the police,\" says Kltpzyxm as she walks to the phone. \"I'll have you know my daughter is the sheriff. She knows how to deal with weirdoes like...\" Before Cattleya can even grab the phone, Kltpzyxm snaps her fingers and the phone winds up attacked to the ceiling. Cattleya turns her head and Kltpzyxm smiles. \"Wow. So you're the guy's mother-in-law. <i>Everyone</i> has in-laws they hate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCattleya suddenly is very interested. \"How do you know that little cockroach.\" Kltpzyxm lets out a scoff. \"That wet blanket has ruined my fun three times already. By the way, I'm Kltpzyxm.\" Cattleya lets out a hiss. \"Don't get me started. I thought I raised my Maggie not to fall in love with insects. Humans are only good for three things; breakfast, lunch and dinner. Fang was definitely no prize as far as son-in-laws go but at least he was a monster. And Neil's job. I'll bet he only goes there so he can flirt with other monsters. The only thing he has working for him is Sapphire.\" Kltpzyxm snaps her fingers again and it isn't long before she and your mother-in-law are talking over tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really hate him, don't you?\" asks Kltpzyxm. \"Hate him enough to do something about it?\" Cattleya lets out a purr as she gives an evil smirk. \"I'd like nothing better than to get rid of that pest forever. If Neil wasn't my son-in-law, I'd swallow him with a swig of rum. Perhaps the two of us could take that microbe down a few pegs.\" Kltpzyxm makes a literal lightbulb appear over her head. \"I have an idea,\" she says. \"I'm very good at warping reality. Perhaps I could find a way to hit him where it hurts the most.\" \"Go on,\" says Cattleya. \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKltpzyxm lets out a giggle. \"Your Maggie doesn't have much of a taste for humans does she?\" \"I wish,\" says Cattleya. \"Even before she started dating the loser, she considered humans to be quote un-quote, 'sometimes food'. Fiona may not eat humans now, but <i>she</i> had a good appetite.\" \"Well,\" says Kltpzyxm with a giggle. \"How about we remind Maggie that she married a man lower than her in the food chain. If I can somehow manage to trick your daughter into going black widow, it will be munch, munch, sayonara sucker!\" Cattleya purrs at that plan but rubs her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good plan, but we have to ensure he won't be missed. We have to make Maggie hate Neil somehow. If you can make it look like Neil was cheating on Maggie, she'd go ballistic. Perhaps maybe make it look like he's seeing multiple girls on the side.\" Cattleya stops to laugh as she drinks some tea. \"Maggie would be so mad, she'd kick him out if she doesn't squash him like the bug he is first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKltpzyxm and Cattleya laugh wickedly at their two plans. \"The only question,\" says Kltpzyxm. \"Is which diabolical plan do we do?\"</span></div></div>",

Moxie was a gremlin who was abnormally tall for her species. Most gremlins don't get any bigger than 300ft but Moxie was a tall glass of water to say the least. Being a gremlin, she was the town mechanic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you don't trust her. Moxie doesn't know it but you learned she was having an affair with Lily's husband Angus. You were appalled that it didn't bother Moxie at all that she was dating a married man. Shameless tramp. Of course, you decided to keep it to yourself. Maggie would no doubt tell Lily if you told her. Minotaurs were by nature temperamental and Lily wasn't a model of mental stability to begin with. You didn't want to add more fuel to the fire so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured you wouldn't rat on Angus and Moxie until something happened to really concern you.

Moxie has a big bulging pregnant belly and there are no guesses as to who the father is. \"Oh no.\" You say mentally. Moxie staggers forward and Atlanta takes a good look at the big belly. \"Moxie,\" she says. \"You're <i>pregnant</i>? When did this happen?\" Moxie shrugs her shoulders. \"Just two months ago.\" \"Two months?\" asked Prima. \"And already that big? Kinda large for a baby gremlin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoxie laughs nervously but you just glare. She didn't know you were onto her but you were still pretty mad that she let that happen. There was no doubt Angus was the father. You didn't think the affair would go <b><i>that</i></b> far. This was so not good. If Lily found out about this. It would not end well at all. \"So,\" says Atlanta. \"Who's the father?\" Moxie gives a nervous look and turns the other way to avoid telling the truth before she sits down and holds her big yellow nails in front of you. You start to file Moxie's enormous fingernails, occasionally looking up and glaring at her and then looking down at her big pregnant belly. What do you do now? Lily would most likely find out sooner or later. A gremlin born with horns and hooves would attract a lot of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter work that night, you're getting off of work and Maggie picks you up and sticks you between her breasts. \"So how was work today?\" you ask. You hold your head down to Maggie's confusion. You want to tell Maggie. After all, Lily was Maggie's friend. But you don't know whether or not you should. You've kept the affair to yourself all these years because you were afraid Maggie would tell Lily and there's no telling what that crazy heifer would do if she found out her husband has been cheating on her for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinnertime, you're so single-minded on Moxie's pregnancy that you can't even eat. Sapphire and Maggie look at you in concern. \"Something bugging you Dear?\" asks Maggie. \"You haven't even touched your centipede fettuccine.\" You definitely didn't want to say anything with Sapphire in the room but the secret was eating you up inside. Now was the big moment, should you pull the bandage off and tell Maggie what was going on or should you keep what's going on between Angus and Moxie a secret until you can't keep it any longer?</span></div></div>",

You don't want her to hear what you're about to discuss with Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maggie,\" you say. \"There's something I should've told you sooner. Today, Moxie came into the salon.\" \"Neil,\" says Maggie. \"She shows up once a week at the salon. She's a mechanic. It wreaks havoc on her nails. I wouldn't exactly call that unusual.\" \"You don't understand Maggie.\" You then gesture to Maggie to pick you up and then you whisper what happened in your ear. Maggie's eye immediately goes wide before she shouts \"<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">WHAAAAAAAAAT!\"</font></b> prompting Sapphire in the next room to plug her ears. \"That bastard! Not the child, I mean Angus! Neil, why didn't you say something about this earlier?! I can't believe it. First Fang and now this!\" Maggie is shocked and appalled to hear the news between the Oxnards and from the look on her face, she was ready to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maggie,\" you say. \"Please, calm down. This is why I didn't want to tell anyone.\" Maggie thinks about that and realizes something. \"If word gets out, it'll kill Lily. What to do, what to do?\" That night in bed, both you and Maggie were wide awake with you in between your wife's boobs as you're both trying to think of a solution to this problem. The very next day is your day off and you're nervously sitting on the coffee table as Maggie is getting dressed for work. \"Don't worry, Neil,\" she says. \"I have a plan. I'll get everyone I can together to try and figure out how to tackle this problem. You just stay here and watch Shocker's Tales and I'll be back tonight.\" You nod your head. \"I hope you know what you're doing, Maggie.\" As Maggie is out the door, you see the Shocker appear laughing on the television and then immediately change the channel. \"Not in the mood for Shocker's Tales today. Most of those stories are about adultery. I can't enjoy them today.\" You're visibly shaken. \"And I can't even get to the fridge to grab a soda to calm my nerves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you're standing on Maggie's shoulders as she is forcing Sapphire out of the house so she wouldn't overhear the meeting. \"I don't care what you do,\" says Maggie. \"Go to a movie, hang out with Ruby or go to the library. Whatever. I need you out of the house tonight.\" \"Why?\" asks Sapphire. \"And why were you screaming last night? What's going on?\" \"That's none of your business, young lady,\" you tell Sapphire. \"For your own sake we need you out of the house until bedtime. Just go!\" Sapphire shrugs her shoulders and runs off. \"Why can't she go out on the town without question like other teenagers?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Maggie invited many of the monsters you knew to a meeting to discuss the plan. First was your sister, Meryl and brother-in-law, Flint. Maggie had also, against all logic, invited her sister, Fiona, though you're glad Cattleya wasn't with her. Barbara Anne and Penny being Lily's closest friends besides Maggie were there as well as Pearl's parents, Fortuna and David Sirtis. Irma and Jolene were there as well as Taleela Khamen, Sapphire's history teacher and she came with the art teacher, Colleen. For some reason, Isis was there as well, but she appeared to be sleeping and it looked like she drew on her eyelids to fool Maggie. The last to arrive were your neighbors Summer MacBeth the Werehyena and Flora Flanders the Spriggan. Flora appeared to be carrying a container of potato salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why Maggie wanted us all to meet here?\" asks Barbara Anne. Penny just shrugs her flippers and lets out a muffled \"I dunno\". \"Maybe it's a potluck,\" says Flora. \"I hope so. I brought potato salad.\" \"Shut up, Flanders.\" Mutters Summer. Maggie walks into the center of the room with you on her shoulder. \"Everyone,\" says Maggie. \"Neil has brought to my attention a serious emergency.\" Everyone, except for Flora looks on in worry. \"Is there an escaped terrorist loose in Dreadberry?\" asks Jolene as she takes out a pair of handcuffs with an excited look on her face. Irma looks on at Jolene as if to question why she brought handcuffs in the first place. \"No, Jolene,\" says Maggie with a sigh. \"There isn't an escaped terrorist.\" Jolene is about to speak again but Maggie cuts her off. \"There isn't an escaped arsonist either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well cut to the chase, Mags,\" says Barbara Anne. \"What's the sitch?\" \"It's Moxie,\" says Maggie. \"She's pregnant.\" \"That's great,\" says Flora. \"Has she thought of a name yet? Are we planning a baby shower?\" \"Shut up Flanders.\" Groans Summer. \"Wait,\" says Fortuna. \"How is that possible? Moxie isn't even married.\" \"Who got her pregnant?\" asks David. You twitch your fingers before coming clean. \"Angus.\" Everyone is shocked and Meryl even drops her jaw into Flint's glass of beer before Flint quickly fishes it out to reattach it. \"What?!\" yells Meryl. Fiona looks the most upset and appears to be on the verge of tears herself, though given that she caught Fang cheating on her before the divorce, that was understandable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara Anne in response gave an angry growl. \"That bastard!\" \"I thought it was kind of weird that the Oxnards' car kept breaking down every week.\" Said Fortuna as she angrily showed her fangs. \"It would explain why the backseat looks like a Jackson Pollock.\" Says Penny. \"Neil,\" says Taleela. \"How long exactly has this been going on?\" \"I don't know for sure,\" you reply. \"I only found out last year but even then it looked like they've been together a while.\" Colleen gives an angry growl as she scratches the side of the couch. \"You mean to tell me, that bull has been cheating on his wife for freakin' years!?\" Flint angrily breaks his glass in his hand. \"And to think that's the guy me and the guys go fishing. I have half a mind to tear off his horns and shove them up his nose.\" \"That goes double for me,\" says David as his eyes glow bright white. \"What exactly does 19 years of marriage mean to him anyway!?\" David punches the coffee table so hard it breaks in half, to Maggie's dismay. \"Can't you take your angry out on something other than my furniture?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn the furniture!\" shouts a voice. It was Fiona to everyone's surprise and she was practically ready to have a mental breakdown. \"What Angus did was a terrible sin.\" \"That green crybaby is making sense for once,\" says Barbara. \"We oughta run him and his secret family out of town.\" Jolene stood up and swung her handcuffs. \"I say we lock him and Moxie up.\" \"Jolene,\" says Irma. \"Adultery isn't illegal. It's wrong but it's not a crime. We can't arrest them.\" \"Killjoy!\" yells Jolene in Irma's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Greg Weisman,\" says Fortuna. \"Something just occurred to me. It only takes a gremlin a few months for gestation. When the child...\" \"Children.\" Says David. \"Excuse me?\" asks Fortuna. \"Think about it, Fortuna,\" says David. \"Gremlins come from big families. There might be more than one baby.\" \"Oh,\" says Flora. \"That's even better. I hope it's twins.\" This time Summer holds her claws dangerously close to Flora's face. \"<i>Shut up</i> Flanders!\" \"Sooner or later,\" says Penny. \"Lily will find out and then she'll turn Angus into a steer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooner?!\" yells Meryl. \"The longer it goes on, the more pissed off Lily will be when the cat's out of the bag.\" \"Excuse me?\" asks Barbara Anne, slightly offended at that remark. \"That's a bad idea, Meryl,\" says David. \"That would be putting extra stress on an already unstable structure.\" \"It's best we tell her now,\" says Fiona sadly. \"Lest she find out for herself like I did.\" \"I agree,\" says Colleen. \"Fiona's a regular mess.\" Fiona lowers her head in sadness just as Isis wakes up and lets out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we tell her?\" asks Penny. \"Or shouldn't we? This is Lily we're talking about. Whoever tells her has to be somebody she'll listen to.\" \"Looks like that means Maggie.\" Says Taleela. You and Maggie both look in surprise as the mummy woman rises. \"After all, Maggie. You're the sheriff and her friend. You should break the news to her. Everyone else (except Isis) is in agreement and speaking amongst themselves as you look up and see Maggie biting her lip. \"This can't possibly end well.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you're at the salon being overseen by Prima and Atlanta as you're giving a massage to an overweight frilled werelizard woman and unintentionally causing her pain as you're so stressed out. You don't know how it could get worse when in walks...</span></div></div>",

I need you both to leave the office and don't come back until after I speak with Lily.\" \"Come on, Sheriff,\" whines Jolene. \"You'll need our help with the arrest.\" Irma slaps herself in the face. \"Jolene,\" she says. \"When are you going to get it through your thick and empty head that not every case involves an arrest!?\" Jolene hisses at the frost giantess. \"Have you looked at our jail?! It's empty! What if somebody from out of town saw our cells with no criminals, other than the town drunk who <i>lets</i> herself in!\" Sierra is asleep in her cell as this argument is going on and Maggie opens the cell before snapping her fingers to wake the drunk capricorn up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSierra,\u201d says Maggie. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be in here when Lily comes in. Jolene, Irma. Please take Mrs. Cornwall home.\u201d Irma lets out a sigh and Jolene then realizes something. \"But we'll still have to arrest Lily after she kills Angus for his infidelity.\" \"Jolene,\" says Irma. \"Lily may be a kook but she's sane enough to realize an affair isn't worth somebody's life. She's not going to kill Angus. She's more likely to... demotivate him.\" As the deputies take Sierra away, Maggie nervously bites into a donut as she is waiting for Lily to respond. \u201cHello, Lily. I\u2019m going to need you to come to the station. Alone. Thanks. See you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie knows that the conversations won\u2019t end well, so as she hangs up, she begins to stuff herself with donut after donut until an hour later, Lily showed up. \u201cWhat kept you?\u201d asked Maggie as she took the last Boston Creme out of the box. Lily just blew out some smoke before putting her cigarette back into her mouth. \u201cAngus took the car to be repaired today. I\u2019m thinking of trading it in if this keeps up.\u201d Maggie shakes her head and bites into her donut.\u201cLily,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long, long, long time, right?\u201d \u201cSince the 3rd grade, Mag,\u201d said Lily. \u201cSo what is it? I have it. You wanted to hear about the conspiracy going on at a certain television network.\u201d Maggie raises an eyebrow. \u201cExcuse me? Oh, for crying out loud, Lily. Put that cigarette out.\u201d Lily drops the cigarette to the ground and snuffs it out with her hoof before speaking. \u201cMinor villains from popular franchises are sneaking into the system intentionally creating bad shows as a means of getting revenge on the heroes who humiliated and defeated them.\u201d Maggie rubs her chin. \u201cThat... that theory actually holds a lot of water.\u201d \u201cAnd the villains are those who either haven\u2019t been seen in years or are otherwise too unimportant to go noticed.\u201d Maggie then waves her hand. \u201cThat isn\u2019t why I called you here. Lily, I have very sensitive information. Why don\u2019t you sit down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur sits her fat butt down in the chair in front of Maggie\u2019s dress as Maggie twitches her finger. \u201cAngus has been \u201ctaking the car to get fixed\u201d at least once a week for how long?\u201d Lily scratches her chin. \u201c5 years now,\u201d said Lily. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think that our Chokeswagon is a lemon.\u201d Maggie shakes her head. \u201cLily. Have you seen Moxie lately yourself?\u201d \u201cYep,\u201d said Lily. \u201cAnd might I say, she\u2019s looking a little chubby these days. I know we\u2019re not ones to throw stones but...\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not fat,\u201d said Maggie. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant. With octuplets.\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d said Lily. \u201cThat\u2019s the first I heard of it. But Moxie\u2019s single. Some hungry profligate must\u2019ve been messing with her.\u201d\u2028\u2028Maggie bites her lip. \u201cFunny you should mention it. Neil just recently told me something that he\u2019s been keeping a secret for years. That night when you invited us over for game night, Neil accidentally got in your car when Angus took it to Moxie\u2019s garage. He saw something that he thought you were better off not knowing. But now we have no choice. The father of Moxie\u2019s octuplets, is your husband.\u201d Lily gave a look of pure shock and dropped the cigarette she was about to light and place in her mouth. Maggie just stares at Lily in worry before Lily speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it was strange that the Chokeswagon kept breaking down. All this time, Moxie was doing bodywork on Angus when I thought she was doing it on the car. It makes sense now.\" Maggie smiles nervously. \"You're taking this rather well, Lily. Need me to...\" \"No,\" says the minotaur as she gets up. \"I can walk home from here.\" Lily leaves the office as Maggie gives a gulp and opens another box of donuts and takes out a cruller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, you, Maggie and Sapphire are eating pizza for dinner and Sapphire is scarfing up her portions but notices you and Maggie aren't eating your food. \"Mom?\" she asks. \"Dad? Aren't you going to dig in.\" \"Not just yet, Sweetie.\" You say nervously. \"I'm not that hungry?\" Sapphire raises an eyebrow and stares at Maggie. \"I find that hard to believe, Mom. Is something wrong?\" You stomp up to your daughter's plate and glare up at her. \"Nothing that's any of your concern, young lady. Sapphire, sometimes adults are bothered by things that you shouldn't have to worry about.\" Sapphire picks off an anchovy from her pizza and eats it. \"Does it have to do with Mr. Oxnard's affair with Ms. Axelrod.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Maggie drop your jaws. \"You knew?\" asks Maggie. Sapphire nods her head. \"It wasn't exactly hard to figure out. Moxie is pregnant but not married and Mr. Oxnard drops off his car every week at her garage. Then you take into account that Mrs. Oxnard is not exactly mother material. I mean, she smokes like a chimney, she's insane and she's not a very a good cook. I mean, when was the last time she and Mr. Oxnard...\" \"You are not old enough to worry about that!\" You yell. \"But I'm sorry you had to figure that out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire then realizes something. \"You don't think that Mrs. Oxnard is going to be too angry do you?\" Maggie scratches her chin. \"I don't know. Well, Sapphire. Remember, Grandma lives two houses next to the Oxnards. She'd be the first to know if things got hairy.\" Maggie gives a nervous laugh. You let out a groan. \"Stupid Cattleya.\" You mutter to yourself.</span></div></div>",

The customer was a regular, Lee Gin. The reason she was a regular was because Lee was the one species of monster that wouldn't be out of place at a beauty parlor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lee was a 680ft tall succubus, a female demon that seduced human men. She was very fat with a huge bulging belly and thunderous thighs (though not as big as Maggie's but very close) and breasts that were like volleyballs. She had gray skin and long light blue hair that reached to her butt. Being a demon, she had horns on her forehead, a devil's tail and leather wings. She also had snake-like eyes and hooves for feet. She was wearing her usual attire, a dental-floss thin leather bra and blue pants with bats all over them, much like Morrigan Aensland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lee entered the parlor, she waved her hair and gave a smug smile as she shook her breasts. Even for a succubus, Lee was the biggest sex fiend you had ever met. She didn't care about the species or even the gender. In fact, she worked at a nightclub as a singer/exotic dancer. The scariest part is that Lee wasn't <i>born</i> a succubus. She used to be a human, until the day she did it with an incubus. You still haven't figured out how it happened, but she got knocked up. Surely giving birth to a building sized offspring would more than likely kill a human sized mother, but the moment Lee became pregnant, her body was transmogrified into a titanic succubus, twice as big as the incubus that impregnated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard that Lee was obsessed with power and sex even as a human and now that she's a succubus, her lust is one hundred times more out of control. She was extremely dominant as well. You heard that her incubus mate filed a restraining order against her for harassment. When a freaking <i>incubus</i> is concerned about your libido, you know you have a problem. Not that Lee cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss me?\" asked the succubus as she blew a kiss at both Atlanta and Prima. Prima shivers as Atlanta almost gags. \"My,\" says Prima. \"You're in a good mood today, Olympia. \"That's right,\" you thought. \"Lee is short for Olympia.\" Lee bent over and shook her enormous rear, forcing you to look away as she rubbed her tail in Prima's face. \"I'm in a very good mood, Prima. I did it last night with a purple gargoyle who was easy on the muscles. Sure he was a little old and he said he did it with at least two other gargs, I think he said one of them was a prison guard or something, but whatever, he was tired of his own species, so he punched a ticket on the Lee Gin express. Wish I could remember his name though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. You're surprised Lee only has ONE daughter after all these years. Lee then walks up and looks down on you. You're at eye level with her navel that was as big as a cave. \"Hi, Neil,\" she says. \"How's Maggie doing.\" \"Uh, she's doing okay, Lee. Sapphire's told me about your daughter, Donna was it? She's in all her classes.\" Lee just let out a sigh. \"Don't get me started on her.\" \"Why not? Sapphire said that Lee's grades were on level with hers. That's quite a compliment I might add.\" Lee scoffed and stuck out a serpentine tongue covered in black piercings. \"What does that matter to a succubus? My daughter is as homely as an empty cupboard. Flat chested, needs glasses, skinny as a rail. Who ever heard of an unattractive succubus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" You think to yourself. Sapphire did describe Donna as being... to put it bluntly, a nerd. From the sound of it, she wasn't grotesque ugly but plain looking which counted as ugly by succubus standards. \"Looks aren't everything, you know.\" You say. Lee just breaks into hysterical laughter before lowering her head to your level and pushing you across the table with her nose. \"Neil,\" she says. \"For succubi, looks <i>are</i> everything. Speaking of which, I thing my hair, gut, spine and wings are in order and I'm in luck. You're on nail duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a laugh. \"So, what do you want me to work on first, Ms. Gin.\" Lee gave a smile. \"You can start with my...\"</span></div></div>",

The woman was an incurable gossip who always had her nose where it didn't belong. Though otherwise she was perfectly harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was one thing you hated about Rachel. That thing you hated about her was the fact that she was friends with Cattleya, your battle-axe mother-in-law. How a sweetie like Maggie came out of a crumb like that splinter cat was a mystery you'd never be able to solve. That's when you heard the door open and Rachel came in. \"Hi Prima,\" says the tanuki giantess. \"Atlanta. Neil.\" \"Hello Rachel.\" Says Atlanta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you turn your head and almost scream because this time Rachel didn't come alone. Following behind was none other than Cattleya herself. \"Oh no.\" You groan. Cattleya immediately notices you and cracks a smirk. \"So you <i>do</i> have a job, Neil. I'm impressed. And in case you didn't notice, I'm being sarcastic. Don't think I don't know why you really work here.\" \"Cattleya,\" you mutter. \"I thought the air was a little smoggy, but I guess it was just you opening your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCattleya lets out an angry hiss and bears her fangs. \"It's been over twenty years and I still can't believe Maggie got saddled with a loser like you. I certainly didn't raise her to have that kind of bad taste.\" \"Oh really?\" you ask smugly. \"Guess she takes after her father in that regard.\" Cattleya meows angrily and the Splintercat is just about ready to smash you into paste, but pulls her hand back. \"You'd so be a snack right now if you weren't married to Maggie.\" \"Whatever you  mean-spirited crone.\" You say back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCattleya lets out a sigh. \"What are we doing here anyway Rachel?\" asks Cattleya. \"I haven't been to a spa in centuries.\" Rachel lets out a laugh. \"Come on girl. Take care of your nails once in a while, those claws can desperately use some pampering.\" Cattleya looks into her claws and lets out a sigh. \"Fine.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really don't want to work on your mother-in-law's nails and cross your fingers to hope that doesn't have to come to it.

It\u2019s already bad enough that you have to do one of the finger or tone nails with these girls you don\u2019t like, but for you to have to do one of them just makes you sick enough, and now, you just got even sicker with the announcement that Prima made. \u201cNeil, I would like for you to give Cattleya her nails clipping on both her finger nails and her tone nails.\u201d Prima announced just as she goes over to Rachel to begin cutting the nails off Rachel.

Just as she takes her shoes and socks off, you just notice a horrible stench on her toes that make you really sick. You smell her toes and you notice well that, along with her feet were sticking worse than any diaper or smelly stuff you ever had to smell in your life. In fact, the first moment you inhale that smell, you just wanted to puke. Right now you are just struggling to breathe, and Prima notices it. \u201cNeil, is there something wrong?\u201d Prima asked, as she stops with Rachel\u2019s toes for a moment. \u201cYou dang right there is, this feet smells like year old diaper.\u201d You told her, just as the mammoth smells the feet with her big noes, and then she gets repulsed as well. \u201cOh my god, no wonder I needed to make a rule that you must have clean feet before coming here, as I don\u2019t want that stench in here.

Doz was the only insect you knew, and she was only half-wasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman, however, was clearly 100 percent bee. She was around 925 feet tall. She had short, red hair and compound, black eyes. Sticking out of the top of her head were two antenna. Instead of a mouth, she had bee like mandibles. From the looks of it, she was incredibly pregnant. Her breasts looked like they were V-cups, and her butt was as big as Maggies. But her belly dominated her frame. It was easily as big as a bean bag chair. You saw that she had large wings on her back. She was wearing a tight, black robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't think she looked like royalty, but you didn't want to risk questioning it. You walked over to her to introduce yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" You shouted, \"My name is Neil. Welcome to the Primordial Earth Salon and Spa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro bee looked down at you, with some difficulty considering her massive belly. \"Good to meet you,\" she said in a thick Scottish accent. \"The name's Delia O'Shay. I'm the queen bee of a nearby colony.\" So she was a queen bee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, follow me.\" You shout up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou show Delia to the barber's chair where Prima was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I take off my robe? It's been bugging me all day.\" Delia asks. Prima nods her head. Delia pulls her robe off in one motion, revealing that she was wearing black underwear underneath it. Delia slowly sits down as Prima gets the scissors ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a TV?\" Delia asks once she's settled in. \"I want to see how the Slicers are doing.\" The Slicers were a national football team. You wondered why a queen qould care about that. Prima turns on the TV on the nearby wall and changes it to the sports channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what brings you to Dreadberry?\" Prima asks as she starts cutting Delia's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My colony move around a lot. We settled her about a month ago. We love where we are, but that mayor of your is getting uppity. Apparently, we have no permit to build out new nest. I'm heading there to talk to her, but one of my drones said to 'pretty up' first. I was a tomboy growing up and still am, so I don't see the point of this.\" Delia explains while she watches the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just send one of your drones to talk to the mayor?\" You ask as Prima picks you up and drops you in Delia's hair to help her shampoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I might be a queen bee, but I don't lie around all day popping out eggs. I still have duties to my colony. Public relations, finances, all that good stuff.\" Delia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue shampooing her hair, but you step on a puddle of shampoo and slip off.

I heard all they do is produce eggs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're half right. The queens primary job is popping out eggs to keep the colony up, but some of us decide to take on other duties. Some queens do prefer only making more drones and do nothing else. I'm not one of them. Like I said, I deal in stuff like finances, relations, law creation, et cetera. There are some things I'm not part of, like directing honey gathering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you become queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my coloney, the next queen is chosen before the previous queen leaves. I was chosen due to being the queen's second-in-command for over 10 years. So, at 44, I became queen. And before you ask, as soon as I became queen, I was given a potion that made me massively pregnant. As soon as a pop out a bunch of eggs, new ones take their place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any queens who don't make new drones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some. Obviously I'm not one of them. They leaving the egg making to someone else. Then there was Lita...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say it like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she became queen at 26, and she's been pregnant with millions of young. Thing is, though, she loves being pregnant so much that she outright refuses to pop out any eggs. She hasn't produced a single egg in 30 years. That woman's belly is the size of a building now. They removed her from the queen position and appointed a new one. And even though she isn't queen anymore, she's still getting new eggs every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Do you visit her at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, every week. I'm actually heading to her after I deal with the mayor.\" Delia then stops talking and thinks for a moment.

I\u2019m off to school.\u201d Maggie raises an eye in confusion. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re walking to school Sapphire.\u201d Sapphire lets out a laugh. \u201cOf course not mother. Onyx just got her driver\u2019s license. She said she was giving me a lift. Ciao.\u201d As Sapphire leaves, you look up at Maggie. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Sapphire have her driver\u2019s license Maggie?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d says Maggie. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way in Tartarus I\u2019m letting her drive my car. You know how it is with teenagers. Oh geez, we better get ready for work.\u201d \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d You yell. \u201cPrima would kill me if I\u2019m late again.\u201d Maggie picks you up and takes you back to the bedroom to get ready for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie puts you on the dresser as she starts to put on her uniform. Sometimes you can\u2019t believe your luck that your wife was the sheriff. The town has good taste. Though you wonder how the mayor stays in office with her depression. You comb your hair and look in Maggie\u2019s compact mirror as Maggie is brushing her hair. It\u2019s as thick as mane given that she\u2019s a Nemean lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re just about ready but as you walk out, Maggie\u2019s tail accidentally hits you and pushes you off the dresser. You grab the tip of the tail and Maggie accidentally in turn flings you into her huge rear. You have to grab onto waistband on Maggie\u2019s panties as Maggie tightens her belt and shorts. You wind up wedged between your wife\u2019s butt cheeks and can only squirm just enough to get a view from the tail hole. \u201cJust great.\u201d You mutter. Maggie turns her head and sees you missing from the dresser. \u201cNeil?\u201d she asks in concern. \u201cNeil? Where are you.\u201d Maggie gets on all fours and scans the floor for you but there\u2019s no sign. If only your wife knew you were stuck in her pants but you couldn\u2019t move enough for her to notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she\u2019s done searching the room, Maggie lets out a sigh. \u201cNeil, I don\u2019t have time for games. I have to get to work too. Looks like you\u2019re gonna have to call Meryl to give you a ride.\u201d \u201cMaggie!\u201d you yell. \u201cWait! I\u2019m in your crack! Maggie!\u201d But you\u2019re too far down for Maggie to hear you. Maggie gets into her car, it\u2019s a silver colored car similar to a Buick but with spikes on the top and a grill bearing fangs. Maggie plops down into the seat and all you can see is darkness as you turn the car on. This isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve been stuck in one of her orifices. That\u2019s how she became pregnant with Sapphire. It was going to be a long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Maggie\u2019s office, her two deputies were already there. Irma, the frost giantess was rubbing her hunched back in pain and sweeping the steps as Maggie pulls over and gets out of the car. \u201cMorning Irma.\u201d Irma lets out a sigh. \u201cMorning Sheriff.\u201d Irma raises her broom in the air and accidentally knocks down the sheriff sign, causing it to fall on her as you close your eyes. \u201cOw.\u201d Says Irma completely dry. Maggie runs forward to help Irma up. \u201cIrma are you alright?\u201d Irma lets out a sigh. \u201cNo Sheriff. I\u2019m never alright.\u201d You shake your head. Irma has the worst luck of anyone you know. She\u2019s the only monster you know who could get struck by lightning on a sunny day. You and Maggie feel sorry for her having to live her life in sadness despite being the older of Maggie\u2019s two deputies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie walks inside and is utterly surprised. In the jail cell is a large angry ogre. \u201cJolene!\u201d yells Maggie in exasperation. The basilisk girl runs in in pure excitement and slips slightly on the floor before hitting her head on the cell. \u201cOuch. Hi Sheriff Reever.\u201d \u201cJolene,\u201d groans Maggie. \u201cWhy is Mr. Myers in the jail cell? He ain\u2019t no criminal.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what you think Sheriff,\u201d says Jolene. \u201cCaught him breaking and entering at 21 Scream Street.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s <i>my</i> house you idiot reptile!\u201d yells the ogre in the cell. \u201cI locked my keys inside and tried to climb in through the window.\u201d \u201cSorry Mr. Myers,\u201d says Maggie. \u201cYou know Deputy Piper. She gets carried away.\u201d Maggie walks up and opens the jail cell so the irate ogre can come out. You shake your head. Jolene was too eager when it came to her job and will look for any excuse to throw a monster in jail to prove her worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie shakes her head and waves her finger at Jolene. \u201cDeputy Piper,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep jumping to conclusions. That\u2019s the third time this week you\u2019ve put an innocent monster in the cell.\u201d Jolene hangs her head down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Sheriff, but we need to make an arrest to prove we\u2019re serious about keeping Dreadberry safe. Can\u2019t let the marshal outdo us.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d groans Maggie. \u201cDon\u2019t get me started on that striped idiot. If she isn\u2019t criticizing me, she\u2019s hitting on me.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell her you\u2019re married?\u201d asked Irma as she rubs her hunch in pain.\u201d Maggie rolls her eyes slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t think Prussia would understand.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie was obviously talking about Prussia Kipling, the monster marshal they sent to help her keep an eye on Dreadberry. Maggie and Prussia were always at each other\u2019s throats. To make matters worse, Prussia is the only monster on your side of town who doesn\u2019t know anything about you. Maggie wants to keep it that way because the weretiger only sees humans as food. You shiver at the thought that Prussia might be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie sighs and takes a seat at her desk, unknowingly pinning you down. You had to find some way to get out of here and let Maggie know what\u2019s going on. It was gonna be one of those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Struggling and kicking and frantically pulling at your wife's titanic ass, you begin to pry yourself out of your current position...slowly. You were so tightly trapped between the furry canyons that it made escaping a difficult task but, after an indeterminate amount of time, you manage to free yourself, falling several feet until you land on the inside of the back of her pants. A small victory, but you'll take it. You take the moment to rest up against your wife, and examine your surroundings, wondering how you were going to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been in your wife's pants before, so that wasn't anything new...but to climb out of them would take some work. The back of her pants created a steep wall that extended at least 80 feet or so into the air, probably more...and the denim surface was surprisingly difficult to grasp. You could always climb up your own wife to get out, but...that obviously carried risks of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did have another option, though; the pants leg. Walking alongside Maggie's legs would lead out to open air easily, and you should be able to yell and get her attention once you're outside of your denim prison. Of course, that's assuming she doesn't stand up and send you tumbling to the ground. But it would be a lot easier on you, and you're less likely to be sat on if she shifted positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards the titanic ass of your wife, you realize that, although she couldn't hear you in here, you could easily get her attention all the same. After all, you were in her pants...there's more then one way to get a woman's attention in her pants, although she probably wouldn't appreciate any of what you had in mind. Shaking those thoughts out of your head, you could at least try hitting her or biting her to make her feel you, but would she even feel you? She's known for having tough skin...both physically and metaphorically. She probably wouldn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, for the time being, you have plenty of time to decide a plan of action. No matter what you do, though, you really can't remain in Maggie's pants all day, so you have to do something to get her attention.</span></div></div>",

Hercules had to strangle it to kill it. <i>Hercules</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie herself was pretty hard skinned.

It takes some effort and your teeth barely even go in. When you do it you don't expect a reaction but suddenly Maggie's whole body jolts. The movement causes you to stumble to the ground and her ass lands on top of you. Above you Maggie is looking around to see if anyone saw her jump and wonders what that was. It didn't hurt but it did feel kind of good. Back down below you are trapped underneath her. You definitely know she felt that so you decide to give her some more to try and get her ass off of you. You once again bite her ass but do it multiple times. Her ass begins twitching and above she's biting her lip a little. Finally she gets up and walks to the bathroom, with you holding on to her cheek. When she gets there she reaches down her pants to find whatever was doing that. Her huge paw comes down behind you and you cheer as it grabs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie lifts you up to her face and her eyes go wide. \"Neil? What were you doing in there?\" she asks. You shrug and smile sheepishly. \"Oh you know me. Sometimes I get into some tight spots.\" She sighs but completely understands. You've ended up in various places on her body by accident over the years. \"I'm just glad I got you to feel me. I'm sorry if the biting hurt you.\" you tell her. \"That was you biting me?\" she asks. \"It didn't hurt but you definitely got my attention.\" She then brings you to her face. \"It didn't hurt at all, it actually felt kind of good.\" You don't understand at first but then it dawns on you. Being a Nemean Lioness she wouldn't feel pain form that, but she did feel pleasure from it. You then remember that when the two of you are in the mood she is sensitive to your touch. Guess her body is receptive towards you. \"I'm glad we're so in love.\" you tell her and kiss her nose as she holds you next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie licks your body and then gives you a big kiss, leaving you covered in saliva. \"We'll have to finish what you started tonight.\" she says with a seductive smile.

The woman was clearly a cat creature, with her dark grey fur, cat ears, and tail. She had red hair that was tied up in a proper bun. You couldn't see her eyes since she had sunglasses on. She was wearing a black suit with black heels. She had an athletic body, but what really drew your attention was her butt. It was enormous. You actually thought it was bigger than your mother-in-law's. You were amazed that she even fit through the door. You looked your wife and could see that, even though she was trying not to, she was staring at the newcomer's rear too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maggie and Neil Reaver?\" The woman asked in a cold tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Can we help you?\" Maggie asked, now looking at the woman's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, FBI. I've come here on an investigation and I need the police's help.\" The woman said, speaking very professionally. You gaze went to her face when she mentioned being an FBI agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What seems to be the problem?\" Your wife asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the space of 3 months, 12 banks have been robbed, including the ones in Fearfield, Terrordale, and Panicburg. No has been able to I.D. the suspect. All we know is that the suspect is a female demon around 900 feet. It is believed that she may come through this town, since it's on Fearfield's route. My superior's have assigned me to this town in order to catch the thief before they rob another bank. As such, I require use of you police force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it.

Let me know if you need anything else.\" Maggie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Michelle replied and turned to leave the office. As she did, her mountainous rear knocked into the desk, causing you to lose your balance and fall onto Maggie's leg. You heard Michelle sigh in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies, that tends to happen sometimes. My body does not distribute fat the same way others due. Every ounce of fat I get goes to my, ahem, buttocks. I hope it will not be too much trouble.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" Maggie replied. \"I'll have an extra wide office set up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle nodded and left the office. When she did, Maggie put you back on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is exciting Neil. We actually get to work with an FBI agent. And she's a Mngwa.

Maggie then kisses you. \"Be careful, Neil.\" She says. With that, Prussia walks out of the office with you in hand and boy is she mad.

Just as long as you and your family are willing to give me my privacy.\" You nod your head. \"Of course.\" You say. Michelle however has the same stoic expression on her face. You might have to get used to that if she's going to be around the house. \"Exactly where do you live?\" the mngwa giantess asks you. \"Oh,\" you say. \"Maggie and I live on the west side of town. 113 Wyvern Way.\" Michelle nods her head and gets up out of her seat. You can't help but stare at the fact that Michelle's chair had gotten stuck to her rear and slowly slipped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before Michelle and you are driving towards your home in a pitch black hearse of some kind with painted black windows. You're actually surprised that Michelle found a car big enough for the airbag she calls an ass, but you don't say anything. You're on the phone with Maggie about the situation. \"I guess there's nothing wrong with it,\" says Maggie. \"We'll just have to explain it to Sapphire when she comes home why there's a huge-assed mngwa FBI agent in our home. Don't tell, Michelle but I didn't think it was possible for any monster to have a larger rear than a splinter cat. But we have to be hospitable.\" \"Don't worry, Dear,\" you say. \"She'll probably just stay indoors all day.\" \"I'll have to call you back later, Neil,\" said Maggie. \"Just spotted a speeder. Love you, bye.\" Maggie hangs up just in time for Michelle to reach your house. The giant pear-shaped Mngwa walks out of the car and unfortunately you see someone you definitely don't want to see today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" You groan. It was Meagan, your werefox ex-girlfriend and she growls at you. \"Well,\" she says. \"Isn't this a surprise. Another fat cat. And this one has a fatter ass that that other slut you married.\" Michelle lowered her sunglasses to show her golden eyes. \"Who is this?\" she asks. \"Michelle,\" you say. \"Meet Meagan Reynard, my ex-girlfriend.\" The fox giantess growls at you. \"You gigolo,\" she says. \"I'm going anal vore you for this! Dumping me for two women, that is... guh!\" Suddenly Meagan sticks out her tongue and eyes and then collapses on the ground. Michelle had used some pressure point on her. You look at Michelle in surprise. \"Is she dead?\" you ask. \"No,\" says Michelle. \"But she'll be unconscious for ten minutes. Then she'll forget why she came. I gotta say, you do have some interesting taste in girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell Michelle where the spare key is kept and then she unlocks the door, having to put a lot of effort into squeezing her mastodonic butt cheeks through the doorway. \"Sorry,\" you say in embarrassment. \"The doorway is only just big enough for my mother-in-law to get in through. She's a splintercat so, well.\" Michelle nods her head and walks in. She almost knocks down the lamp by bumping it with her huge ass but catches it on her knee and puts it back. But she does end up knocking over a few photographs that land on her rear and are still standing up as she places them back. She stops when she holds up one of you and Maggie with a baby Sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you say. \"That's our daughter Sapphire, she's a teenager now.\" \"You adopted?\" asked Michelle. \"No,\" you say. \"No. You see, I got stuck in Maggie's love tunnel for days and it had some lasting consequences. Heck, I didn't even know I <i>could</i> get Maggie pregnant.\" Michelle stares at the photograph before putting it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the door opens and in walks...</span></div></div>",

She said she would call the contractor who built the house and ask him for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Maggie hung up and came back to you, Michelle, and Sapphire. Sapphire was leaning on the wall and you were sitting on one of Michelle's enormous butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I called the contractor, and he said he'll come over to see what he can do to get Michelle out. But he has a massive backlog of orders and complaints, so it will take him a while to get here?\" Maggie explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how long?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, he said it would take around... 12 weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"12 WEEKS?!

I'll bet you're cheating on Maggie somehow.\" \"Well I'd stay out of Vegas if I were you, sardine breath,\" you say. \"I'm not like Fang.

I'll tear her a new one and then I'll put you on a skewer, you little son of a....\" Before Cattleya could say anything else, Michelle taps her on the back and Cattleya turns around and looks in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am.\" Says Michelle. Cattleya takes one brief look at Michelle's stoic sunglasses-wearing face and then a not so brief look at Michelle's massive ass. Cattleya continues to stare and circles around Michelle before she places her own gargantuan ass against Michelle's for comparison. As it turns out, Michelle's ass is more than twice as wide as Cattleya's and that says something since before you met Michelle, Cattleya's ass was the biggest you've seen. You couldn't help but laugh as Cattleya stares dumbfounded at Michelle. For once in her life, that bigmouthed bitch is speechless. She hasn't been this confounded since she got the news of Maggie's pregnancy with Sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be perfectly clear, Mrs. Reaver,\" says Michelle. \"I do not intend to seduce your son-in-law. I am merely here on an FBI mission. I advise you not to tell anyone.\" \"Yeah,\" you say. \"And that goes for that idiot, Rachel as well.\" Cattleya doesn't have anything more to say and just walks out. You can't help but laugh. \"About time somebody took that pest down a peg.\" Michelle adjusts her sunglasses as she sees Cattleya leave. \"I take it you don't get along well with your mother-in-law?\" \"Are you kidding?\" you ask. \"She's a nightmare. Cattleya has been giving me nothing but sass for 20 long years.\" Michelle nods her head. \"In-laws seldom get along.\" She says. With that, you stand on the coffee table as Michelle takes a seat on the couch. Apparently all that mngwa booty is too much for the couch as it collapses, leaving Michelle to groan. \"Uh,\" you say. \"That's okay. We were planning to buy a new couch anyway, don't worry.\" Then you whisper under your breath. \"I'll bet she doesn't have any trouble finding a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, nearby, Lily is walking down the street when she sees Michelle in the house with you and Michelle. She immediately realizes Michelle is wearing a suit and sunglasses. Given how Lily is a conspiracy theorist, she immediately ducks on all fours as she runs past your house and the minotaur girl then stares at Michelle in the window and snaps a photograph of her before running off.</span></div></div>",

Entering and signing in at the front desk, you head to the mayor's office. When you enter, you see two people sitting at the Mayor's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first figure was the mayor herself, Hailey Yorkshire. She was a centicore, some kind of antelope creature, with black fur, silver hair, and long horns. She was very muscular and was clad in her usual white suit. Usually when she called, something was wrong. She was not the happiest person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other figure you didn't recognize. She had orange and black fur, dyed silver hair in a ponytail, and grey eyes. She was incredibly fat, even moreso than your wife, but not to Fiona's extent. She was wearing a grey suit and cat-eye glasses. When she heard you two enter, she turned to look at you, revealing a pair of fangs reaching her chin. She was a saber-tooth anthro. You've heard of them, but never seen one in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Maggie. I see you've brought Neil with you.\" Hailey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we had a bit of an... accident.\" Your wife said, clearly not wanting to tell her everything about this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. I'm glad you came. I want you to meet Sasha Rasto.\" Hailey said, gesturing towards the other woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised. Sasha Rasto? She was one of the richest monsters in the world. She owned her own line of casino's including The Screamer and The Nightmare Castle. Why was someone so rich and famous in your town?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello Ms. Rasto.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no need for formality. Call me Sasha\". Sasha replied in a Russian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Rasto here was planning on building one of her new casino's here in town. I tried to tell here that there is no land available for her to build, but she insists on checking herself.\" Hailey explained. \"Maggie, can you show Ms. Rasto around town and prove to her she can't build here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, mayor.\" Maggie replied. \"Sasha, do you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" She replied and got up out of her chair, rather difficultly considering her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you left the office and got into Maggie's car. Maggie and Sasha both got in front and you got on the dashboard. You drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you went around town, Sasha told you both about her life. She loved gambling and was really good at it, gaining enough money to start her own casino. It got popular, and eventually, she was opening more and more. The more money she got, the more opulent her life was (which you  could tell from her waistline.) Just as she was telling you about her plans for the new casino, she suddenly yelled \"STOP\". The car halted in an instant, launching you off the dashboard and onto your wife's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it.

There was a Halloween party here years ago. One of the guests got drunk and tried to hit it off with one of the female partygoers. Her boyfriend didn't like it, so he shot him and then shot her. Then he set a fire to cover his tracks. He would've gotten away with it except for one thing. One of the guests was a boggart. You can't exactly kill the living dead. The boggart called my boss, the previous sheriff and we sent the arsonist up the river.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Sasha. \"So that's it.\" \"Uh, yeah,\" you say. \"People would be hesitant to build anything where fourteen people got burned alive.\" Sasha just let out a laugh. \"Superstitious zadotras.

I will speak to Mayor Yorkshire about this and you will see a casino on this ground soon enough.\" You and Maggie look in concern as Sasha gives a hearty laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before Maggie drives Sasha back to Mayor Yorkshire's office and Sasha is already handed a construction permit. \"So you're constructing where the Wellington house once stood,\" says Hailey. \"I was afraid of that.

But I know no good can come from this.\" \"You wanna bet on it?\" asks Sasha jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Maggie is driving you to work. \"So, she's really going to put a casino in such an awful location.\" \"Looks like it, Neil,\" says Maggie. \"I gotta say, you wouldn't catch me down there.\" You let out a sigh. \"I just hope I'm not too late for work. Atlanta would eat me alive.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next few weeks, Dreadberry was filled with the sounds of construction. Sasha was determined to get her new casino on that ground, no matter what people told her. And, after much work, she did it. She opened Dreadberry's first casino, the Mansion of Fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Maggie were standing outside the new building, you on Maggie's shoulder, in a huge crowd of people. Sasha had invited the two of you to the grand openting. You had to admit, from the outside the place looked pretty good. It was a 9 story building with a Victorian era design to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did Sasha invite us again?\" Maggie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the phone call, she said it was because we were the ones who found the land, so she felt she should thank us by inviting us to the opening.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really one for gambling.\" Maggie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, but we should still be nice.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can answer, the front doors open and Sasha steps out, excited. \"Privyet, everyone! I am Sasha Rasto, and I am happy to anounce that this town's first casino, The Mansion of Fear, is now open for business! Please enjoy!\" She annouced loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Maggie, and the rest of the crowd enter the massive building. The inside was just as impressive as the outside, having a rustic, old-time design to it. Roulette wheels, Blackjack tables, and slot machines were all over the place, in both monster and human sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to admit, Maggie. Sasha knows how to design a casino.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. It does look nice.\" Maggie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to check out some of the human sized games.\" You tell Maggie. \"Why don't you try some of the stuff around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie shrugs before taking you off her shoulder and heading off. You look back at her before heading for a human sized slot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day, you and Maggie went aorund the casino, talking with other patrons and occasionally playing a game. You noticed that Maggie's attitude seemd to change. At first, she didn't want to play any of the games, but as the day went on, she seemed to start playing more and actually having fun. When it was time for the place to close, she was smiling broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I have to admit. Today was actually fun.\" Maggie said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad. This place might be fun to visit once in a while.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, once in a while...\" Maggie seemed to trail off, and looked back at the slots before you and her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, Maggie told Saphirre about the day while you got ready for bed. You were surprised at just how enthusiatic she was. Eventually, she came up to the bedroom and changed into a nightgown. She picked you up kissed you before setting you on her right breast. The two of you went to sleep right then.<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThe next morning, you woke up to find that you were on the mattress. Confused, you looked around and saw that Maggie was nowhere to be seen. Just then, the phone rang. You picked up the human sized reciever (there were two sets, one for Maggie and one for you).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Reaver, it's Sasha.\" You were surprised. Why was Sasha calling you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, I would just like to know why your wife is here at the casino before it's open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were really confused. What was Maggie doing there? You tell her you would be right there and hung up. Then you call Atlanta and explain to her what's going on and ask for a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n40 minutes later, you arrive at the casino. To your surprise, Maggie is standing in front of the door, still in her nightgown. You walk up to here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Maggie?\" You call up to your wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie turns around and faces you. \"Oh, hi Neil.\" It's at this point you notice something different about your wife.</span></div></div>",

It even reflected the light of the sun. \u201cMaggie?\u201d you ask as you cover your eyes. \u201cWhoa.\u201d Atlanta even had to switch her glasses out for her sunglasses. Maggie stands up as Sasha herself seems surprised. Maggie\u2019s night gown even looks tighter on her for some reason. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asks your Nemean lioness wife. \u201cIs there something in my teeth?\u201d You look and see that Maggie\u2019s teeth were as bright white as ever, despite her fur turning bright gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh,\u201d you say. \u201cMaggie. Have you noticed something different?\u201d Maggie raises an eyebrow in confusion. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d she asks. Atlanta holds up a mirror and Maggie looks in surprise at her new golden coat of fur. \"Holy mackerel,\" says your lion wife. \"I must've used Sapphire's scale shampoo by mistake. This must be what it does to monsters with fur.\" However, Maggie fixed her hair as she continued to look into Atlanta's hand mirror. \"Hmm,\" she says to herself. \"I could get used to this look.\" Sasha then gives a cough to get Maggie's attention. Maggie then looks at the sabertooth and blushes. \"I'm sorry, Sasha,\" says Maggie. \"I don't know why I'm at your casino so early in the morning.\" Sasha rolls her eyes. \"Casino not open yet. Come again tonight.\" Maggie then smiles nervously and walks away before she takes you from Atlanta's hand. \"Will do.\" Atlanta gives a slight glare before Maggie walks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maggie?\" you ask. \"Why so interested in the casino all of a sudden?\" Maggie gives a nervous smile. \"I dunno, Neil. I guess I just had a great time last night.\" It isn't long until Maggie returns back to the house. Next door, Penny the wereseal is waddling in the nude to get her newspaper and then she sees Maggie and drops her jaw at the golden lion. She even takes off her headphones. \"Maggie?\" the blubbery giantess asks. Maggie notices Penny and smiles. \"Hi, Penny,\" says your wife. \"Good morning. Oh, I forgot to tell you. Sasha Rasto opened up a new casino down the street. I've already been and it's awesome.\" Penny just bites her lip. \"No thanks. I've never gambled in my life and I'm not starting now. I'm not crazy like Lily.\" Maggie shrugs her shoulders and walks inside just as Summer is walking out and looks in surprise at Maggie. \"The things they're doing with hair dye these days.\" Mutters the hyena as she bites into a piece of raisin toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Sapphire looks on at her mother with her eyes bulging out of her head. Maggie was too busy cooking breakfast to pay Sapphire any heed. You bite your lip because you're desperate to change the subject from Maggie's golden coat of fur. \"So, Sapphire,\" you say nervously. \"Isn't Goldie coming over later?\" Sapphire nods her head. \"Mrs. Kipplestein is assigning us to work in teams on book reports. Goldie's my partner for the assignment and we're working on a book written by Olga Rowling. Anyway, what's with Mom's fur?\" \"She says it was your scale lotion.\" \"It can't do <i>that</i>. Something really weird is going on.\" Maggie then places breakfast on the table and you and Sapphire notice that Maggie had a lot more food on her plate than Sapphire's plate. You and Sapphire stare at Maggie. \"What?\" asks Maggie slightly defensively. You and Sapphire decide not to give the matter any more thought and just begin to eat your own breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sapphire's science teacher, Mrs. Keys was going through her safe in a frustrated tone when her teenaged hippogriff son, Grevy walks by. \"Need me to help you with anything, Mom?\" Gevy asks. Mrs. Keys just gives a shriek. \"Help me strangle your father for one. Remember last night when he said he was getting milk? That blasted pegasus was at that wretched casino that opened up. I'm just making sure he didn't lose anything important. Aha, everything seems to be... ARGH! Don't tell me that blockhead lost that evil spirit of greed I had contained in here! And of all the places for it to be flying around, it had to be a casino!\"</span></div></div>",

And this was one night after the casino opened up in Dreadberry.\" You nod your head. \"That's what happened Ms. Todoroki. I don't know if there's anything wrong with Maggie but she was already at the casino this morning, before it even opened.\" Ibuki then rubbed her chin. \"Interesting. Sounds to me like our sheriff has gambling fever.\" You give a look of shock and accidentally paint Ibuki's skin in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you ask. Ibuki gave a scoff. \"I think I know a gambling addict when I see one. Before Lexi canned me, I covered a gambling addict who had to have three jobs just to cover his debts.\" \"My wife is not a gambling addict!\" you yell defensively. Prima gives a trumpet before she starts to cut Ibuki's hair. \"I wouldn't bet on that, Neil,\" says your mammoth boss. \"Bad choice of words, I know. But a casino is a dangerous thing. It can do strange things to people. I know a few monsters who let their heads spin due to the promise of money through risk. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t step one flat foot into a casino.\u201d You doubted that Maggie was the kind of person who would let the Fate\u2019s Hand Casino get the better of her. You were married to her for 20 years and you knew her better than that. But Prima did have a point. People don\u2019t think straight when they\u2019re gambling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could think anymore on the matter, you turn to see Penny waddling in and sitting in the chair right next to Ibuki as she gives a seal-like bark. \u201cHello, Prima,\u201d says the wereseal giantess. \u201cNeil.\u201d \u201cWhat can we do you for, Penny?\u201d you ask. Penny barks again before speaking and taking off her faux fur coat. \u201cI want my hair dyed black.\u201d \u201cBlack?\u201d you ask. Penny nods her head. \u201cI want to look my best. Sasha hired me as a DJ at the casino. We ice-element monsters have to stick together.\u201d You nod your head. \u201cMakes sense.\u201d As you finish with Ibuki\u2019s toes, you crawl up Penny\u2019s blubbery body and up towards her hair as you take out a can of black hair dye and start to spray it around. On top of the seal woman\u2019s head, you see one of Sasha\u2019s employees, a large pinkish red werewalrus woman, enter and hang an advertisement poster on the door. \u201cHey!\u201d yelled Prima. Prima is about to confront the werewalrus, but Atlanta stops her. \u201cWait! I gave Sasha my permission to advertise Friday night\u2019s guest at the casino.\u201d Prima gives a snort. \u201cWell I didn\u2019t give anyone permission of the sort, fishface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the poster and see that there is a 950ft vampire lady dressed as a magician. She had cement grey skin with red eyes and short grey hair (unlike your case, vampires are often born with gray hair). The vampire woman had a slim upper body but enormously muscular legs that rivaled the best body builders. You recognized and heard about her. Her name was Natasha Lake, alias theAmazing Lakeinski, a Russian vampire who took up stage magic to make up for the fact that the only vampire power she had was immortality. She was one of the best magicians there were. You let out a whistle. \u201cHmm,\u201d you say. \u201cBoy would I like to see her with Maggie and Sapphire. Wait. What am I saying? I\u2019d have to be crazy to lead Sapphire into a casino of all places. Besides, I don\u2019t think they allow teenagers in places like that. Hmm. Maybe it will take Maggie\u2019s mind off of gambling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Penny overhears you and scoffs. \u201cYou think Maggie has a gambling problem? If Maggie has a gambling problem, then I\u2019m a werewalrus.\u201d You let out a sigh. Penny was probably right. After all, she\u2019s known Maggie long before you even met her. You shrug your shoulders and continue to dye Penny\u2019s hair, wondering what will happen next. But boy, you sure would love to see the Amazing Lakeinski work her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your cellphone rings and you pick it up. \"Hello?\" you ask. \"Hi, Neil,\" says Maggie. \"I just wanted to let you know I used some of my winnings to liven up the house a little bit.\" \"How so?\" you ask in concern. You hear Maggie giggle on the phone. \"Oh. I just acquired a very spectacularly looking piece of artwork. I might decide to put in an art gallery to the house. I don't know why, but I just felt like it. Just wanted to let you know, honey. Love you. Buh-bye.\" As Maggie hangs up, you give a gulp. \"I am going to dread coming home tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of your shift, Penny offers you a lift home to save Maggie the trip and you're biting your nails as you ride on Penny's shoulder and it isn't long before Penny runs into Sapphire and hands you to your daughter before retreating into her own house next door. Sapphire gives a nervous look. \"Don't tell Mom,\" she whispers to you. \"But I think it's an eyesore.\" You give a scoff. \"Come on, Sapphire. It can't be that bad. I hope.\" You and Sapphire go inside and you learn that Maggie bought a very loud looking....</span></div></div>",

In the painting are three beautiful naked women laying in provocative positions among a mountain of gold and jewels. One is a Nemean lion with blue fur, one a weretiger with yellow fur, and the last is a werepanther with green fur. All of them have hourglass figures with extremely large breasts. Standing in front of the mantle under the painting is Maggie, looking very proud of her purchase. \"Well?\" she asks. \"What do you think?\" You tilt your head and examine the painting. The women in it are very attractive, there's no doubt, but it doesn't seem like Maggie's style. \"Don't you think its a little...racy?\" you ask your smiling wife. \"More like tacky.\" Sapphire mutters under her breath. \"There's nothing wrong with a little sex appeal in art.\" Maggie responds. \"Besides, doesn't the gold look great?\" Her eyes have a distinct glint and her golden fur seems to shine as she talks. \"No, I think this piece suits our home perfectly.\" You just stare at your wife as she looks over her new possession and Sapphire shakes her head with a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day you and Maggie are sitting on the couch watching TV. Maggie is watching one of those pawn store shows where people try to sell off their stuff. \"What?! These guys are totally ripping these people off!\" she says as she watches. On the screen a minotaur man is attempting to sell an old guillotine, but your gaze shifts to the painting in the room. \"Maggie?\" can we talk about that painting?\" you ask. Your wife looks up at it and plucks you off of her shoulder. \"What about it?\" she asks. \"I just think that you could have spent your casino winnings on something a little more practical.\" you tell her. \"This is practical. It represents my efforts. Just look at those jewels!\" she responds. You shake your head. \"I just think maybe it doesn't go well with our home.\" you suggest. Maggie gives you a smile, but her eyes have that glint in them again. \"Well you can't get rid of it. It is MINE after all. I bought it with MY money.\" she says, really emphasizing her words. You don't even think she knows she's doing that. You sigh and let it go as your wife goes back to her show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night when the two of you are in bed and you're pretty tired. Maggie on the other hand seems ready for some action. \"Actually honey, I'd kind of like to get to bed.\" you tell her. The lioness just shakes her head and grabs you between two fingers. \"Sorry, but I really need it tonight. Think of it as something for luck when I get to the casino tomorrow.\" she says. \"You're going back again? Listen I think you should really cut back on the gambling.\" you tell her. She just laughs and shakes her head. \"Whats the harm? I haven't lost any of our money, or should I say MY money. I'm using what I earn.\" you really don't like how she's acting right now. Before you can get another word in she puts you to work. Your next hour is spent on and inside your gigantic golden wife. When she's finally satisfied you end up lying on her breast right next to her nipple. She watches you as you snooze away and smiles. \"Thats my little husband. MY husband.\" Her fur shines ever slightly as she turns in as well.</span></div></div>",

After the night you had you really just want to go back to sleep, but you know you have to go to work today. Your wife's breasts, now serving as your bed, is moving slightly as she sleeps. Instead of waiting for the alarm clock you decide to wake her up. Before you do however you look around at the massive landscape that is Maggie. She's just as beautiful as ever, but her once white fur is now a gold. The color you don't mind, but you really think the change in color has something to do with her personality shift. With a sigh you trudge over to the side and slide down her boob, landing near her neck before making the walk to her head. When you reach her ear you call into it. \"Maggie? Time to wake up honey!\" you tell her. Her eyes open and she glances at you. Her paw reaches over and grabs you. \"Morning lover.\" she says with a kiss. She gets out of bed and places you on the dresser before stretching with a yawn. Well this isn't so bad. You gaze up at her wonderful form, even with with the new fur. \"Come on honey, lets get washed up.\" she says and snatches you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie carries you to the bathroom and starts the shower. She steps inside and places you on the small shelf next to the shampoo while she washes herself. The water hitting her gigantic body is a sight to behold. Of course, you've see it many times before, but now her golden fur glistens as the water runs down her curves. One of the bottles of shampoo next to you rises into the sky as Maggie grabs it. While she lathers herself up you notice that she's using her own shampoo. Glancing over you see Sapphire's shampoo on the shelf as well. Thats what Maggie claims is to blame for her change in color. You wonder about that as you watch your wife wash her breasts, getting slightly excited at the sight. When she's finished with her own body Maggie grabs you and washes you as well before exiting the shower. The two of you head to your bedroom and get dressed. Maggie, now in her sheriff's uniform takes you to the kitchen for some breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you enter the kitchen Maggie sets you the table and grabs some bread to put in the toaster. While its toasting she begins cooking some bacon and eggs as well. At this point Sapphire walks in, ready for school. \"Good morning sweetie.\" Maggie says cheerily. \"Morning guys.\" the mer-lion responds, sitting down in front of you. \"So dad, has there been any change?\" she asks in a hushed tone, glancing at her mother. \"No, she's still acting pretty strange.\" you answer. Maggie, unaware of your conversation, brings over two plates. When the three of you are well into your breakfast Sapphire speaks up. \"So mom, you think we can put that painting somewhere else? Its kind of distracting.\" she says, choosing her words carefully. \"I think its great! It really grabs your attention.\" Maggie responds. \"Besides, I'd say its my decision seeing as I'm the head of the house. I mean, I'm the bread winner right?\" You and Sapphire exchange glances. \"Not to bring you down honey, but I do support us more than you do.\" The lioness puts a finger to her chin, as if thinking. \"Besides, in Monstrossia, women hold all the power, and since you can't really get around without me, I technically own you!\" The ways she's talking is really getting to you. The Maggie you know would never act like this! You also noticed the way she grinned when she said she owns you. Sapphire shakes her heads as she finishes her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen its time to leave the three of you get into the car. You stare up at your wife from between her boobs as she drives. She looks so normal right now you wouldn't guess how obsessed with money she's become lately. Maggie stops in front of the salon to drop you off. Whose day do we follow?</span></div></div>",

Upon driving up she gets out of her car to find Irma standing there waiting for her. \"What are you doing out here?\" she asks as she walks up to the frost giantess. \"I lost my key.\" she answers gloomily. With a smile Maggie sighs and unlocks the door so they can both go in. \"You should find it soon, those keys aren't cheap.\" Maggie says. \"Wait..yes they are.\" Irma responds. In truth this is the fifth time she's lost her key. Its a wonder no one has found one and robbed the place. However Maggie has always been understanding since they're pretty cheap, until now that is. \"Yes well, its better to spend money on more important things right?\" the lioness asks. Irma gives her a confused look but shrugs it off. \"So where's Jolene?\" Maggie asks as she sits down. \"She said she was going to get an early start today and went right on patrol.\" Irma answers. Maggie groans and put a hand to her head. \"I hope she doesn't do anything rash.\" Irma watches her boss and her thoughts drift to her golden fur. Its been like that for days now, but Maggie assured her its no big deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opens and Jolene walks in, dragging a young leprechaun girl with curly red hair and freckles. \"Look what I found!\" she says with a grin. Maggie shoots up in her seat as she recognizes Goldie, one of Sapphire's friends. \"Thats my daughter's friend!\" she says. \"What did she do to get hauled to jail?\" Jolene puffs out her chest proudly. \"I saw her in front of the high school showing a pot full of gold to her friends. She clearly stole it and was bragging about it. What kind of teenager has that kind of money?\" Irma shakes her head as Maggie face palms. \"She's a leprechaun Jolene. Every leprechaun has their own pot of gold.\" Maggie explains. Jolene blinks and then releases her captive. \"Whoops. Sorry kid.\" she says. \"I already tried explaining it to you!\" Goldie says angrily. \"Now I'm late for school!\" The basilisk shrugs off her complaint. \"How was I supposed to know you were a leprechaun and not just an elf?\" she asks. \"Pretty sure the hair, freckles, and green clothes would give it away.\" Maggie says. Jolene gives Goldie another look. \"Oh yeah.\" Goldie, having noticed Maggie, forgets her anger. \"Hey Mrs. Reaver. Wow, Sapphire was right about that fur.\" she says. Maggie twirls a little, showing herself off. \"Its a good look right?\" she asks. Goldie raises her eyebrows. \"Sure.\" she says awkwardly. \"Now give her a ride to school.\" Maggie tells Jolene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolene and a still frustrated Goldie exit and Maggie sits back down. \"Say, if we ever do arrest a leprechaun do you think we could confiscate their gold?\" she asks, rubbing her chin. \"Boss, I'm pretty sure we can't do that. A leprechaun's pot of gold is like super important. Its a cultural thing.\" Irma tells her. \"Well thats too bad.\" Maggie says. Just then a yawn sounds from one of the cells and the two look over to find Sierra just waking up. \"Sierra! When did you get here?\" Irma asks. \"Sometime last night, I think. Jolene was the only person here when I slipped in.\" she says, holding her head. She's got a bad hangover. Maggie thinks back and remembers that she did tell Jolene to lock up. \"Maybe we should start charging you rent.\" she says jokingly, but then stops and thinks seriously about it. \"Boss?\" Irma says. \"Naah.\" Maggie responds and waves off her own thoughts. She can't charge rent in jail. At least, not unless she figures out a way. She decides to think on it later and heads to her office to do some paperwork.  </span></div></div>",

She even shields her eyes. \u201cDid you dye your fur, Maggie?\u201d asks Fiona in confusion. Maggie gives a nervous purr. \u201cUh,\u201d she says. \u201cNot exactly. I think it was Sapphire\u2019s scale polish.\u201d Fiona has to reach into her cleavage to put on a pair of sunglasses. \u201cI bet. Maggie, the post office delivered this package to my house by mistake. It\u2019s addressed to you.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d yells Maggie. \u201cGood. It came. Thanks, Fee.\u201d Maggie snatches the package from her sister and holds out one of her claws. Maggie\u2019s claws had also turned to gold and she opens the package as Jolene, Irma and Sierra all turn their heads in curiosity to see what comes out and it catches them by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe package contained yet another painting. This time the painting depicted an image of a Japanese junk that was made out of gold and depicted the junk carrying two titanic Japanese monsters in regal garbs. A kappa dressed as an emperor and a baku dressed as an empress. From the looks of it, the servants on board, including an army of samurai, were all humans. Everyone besides Maggie looks in surprise before Maggie hangs the painting up behind her desk. \u201cThere,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that brightens up the office. Worth every skull.\u201d Irma looks in surprise and bends back so much she grunts as it irritates her spine. \u201cYou\u2019re hanging that thing in the office?\u201d Maggie gives a purr. \u201cIt\u2019s my office and I\u2019ve decided that it could use some sprucing up. Give it some class. How does it look, girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona, Sierra and Irma are speechless but Jolene has no qualms in speaking her mind. \u201cI think it looks really cool. This will show visitors that we\u2019re a higher breed of law enforcement.\u201d Maggie gives a purr. \u201cHear that? At least Jolene is happy with it.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d mutters Fiona. \u201cBut everyone knows she has really bad taste.\u201d Jolene hisses at Fiona as Irma gives a weak chuckle. \u201cMaggie,\u201d Fiona continues. \u201cThat painting looks like it cost a small fortune.\u201d Maggie gave a scoff. \u201cPish-posh. Just something I bought with my winnings from the casino.\u201d Fiona\u2019s eyes popped. \u201cCasino? Oh, you mean that new casino that opened in town. That surprises me. You\u2019re not a gambling person.\u201d Maggie shrugged her shoulders and stroked her large golden belly. \u201cSomething just got into me. Nothing to worry about, big sister. Wanna come to the casino tonight?\u201d Fiona bites her lip nervously. \u201cCasinos and I don\u2019t really get along, Maggie. I met Fang in a casino, remember.\u201d Maggie gives a slight growl. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Well, maybe if you go to the casino again, you\u2019ll meet somebody better than Fang.\u201d Sierra gave a laugh from her jail cell and felt her head. \u201cAny man would be preferable to Fang.\u201d Fiona actually seems to consider Maggie\u2019s suggestion and even scratched her head with her stinger tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Maggie sees a car going by at extreme speed. \u201cHold that thought.\u201d Maggie runs into her police car and goes after the speeder with sirens blaring. The woman in the car was a fat weresheep with red wool over her body and a woolly afro on her head. She was wearing a black skirt and polka dot shirt and was traveling 10 miles above the speed limit. The sheep woman heard sirens blaring and then turned around to see Maggie approaching her. The sheep woman pulled over as Maggie stopped her. Your enormous wolf stomps up towards the sheep woman and gives a sly smile. \u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am. Do you realize that you were going 30 miles in a 20 mile zone. The sheep woman gives a bleat. \u201cBut Sheriff,\u201d says the sheep. \u201cI just caaaaaame here from Feaaaarfield to cover the Faaaate\u2019s Haaaaaand Caaaaasino that just opened up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie shakes her head and begins to write up a ticket. \u201cThat\u2019s no excuse for speeding ma\u2019am.\u201d Maggie hands the sheep giantess a ticket and as the sheep looks at it, she screams. \u201c300 Skulls for a speeding ticket! That\u2019s highway robbery! I was only going 10 miles over the limit!\u201d Maggie gives a purr. \u201cSorry, but if you don\u2019t pay the ticket, I\u2019m going to have to lock you up and impound your vehicle.\u201d The sheep woman grumbles and takes out her wallet. \u201cI haaaaate Nemeaaaan lions.\u201d She moaned as she fished out the money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Fiona was walking away from the police station thinking about what she said. \u201cMaybe Maggie\u2019s right,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that\u2019s easy for her to say, she has Neil. I have nobody. Why should I walk into the casino? No man can be as perfect as my sister\u2019s husband. If only I met him before she did. All I did was get stuck with a man who I loved and who left me. What to do, what to...\u201d Suddenly, Fiona\u2019s skin turns from green to a shade of pink and her hips begin to expand as her eyes spin. Something is coming over her, similar to what had come over Maggie. She then got a crazed smile on her face. \u201cOn second thought,\u201d said the pink manticore who was expanding with every step she took. \u201cPerhaps it is time I got back in the saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Maggie had gotten out of work but was going to the casino, leaving you and Sapphire to order out for dinner. You chew on a piece of rice as Sapphire slurps up some low mein. \u201cMom is going to the casino again?\u201d asks Sapphire. You let out a sigh. \u201cAnd she said she was bringing your aunt Fiona with her. I really hope this isn\u2019t a recurring theme.\u201d Sapphire gives a scoff. \u201cDad,\u201d she says. \u201cMom does not have a gambling problem.\u201d You let out a sigh. \u201cI said that too. But now I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Maggie and Fiona had arrived at the casino, Maggie glowing bright gold wearing a little black dress and Fiona glowing bright pink while wearing a little red dress. \u201cMeow,\u201d says Fiona. \u201cAren\u2019t we both looking fine.\u201d Maggie let out a laugh. \u201cOkay, Fiona,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile you\u2019re looking for a replacement for Fang, I\u2019ll be hitting the games. I\u2019m feeling lucky.\u201d Fiona gave a purr. \u201cSo am I.\u201d With that, both girls in the casino walked out to have an eventful night.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Into Maggie's office walked the one person Maggie didn't want to see, Prussia Kipling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrussia was a marshal assigned to Dreadberry, which you find weird considering, why would Dreadberry need both a sheriff <i>and</i> a marshal? This was a point Maggie agreed on all too well. Appearance wise, Prussia was a blue weretigress who looked like a bloated navi and dressed like an actual marshal out of the wild west. The tigress walked inside and Irma and Jolene quickly got out of the way as Maggie rose up out of her seat, forcing you to hold onto her waistband to keep from slipping down her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie growls at Prussia as Prussia comes in. \"I wish you would stop with that nasty attitude, Maggie,\" says Prussia. \"We're on the same side. You need all the help you can get with Dopey and Grumpy over there.\" She says this as she points to Jolene and Irma. Jolene lets out a gasp and turns to Irma. \"How dare she call you Dopey.\" Irma rolls her eyes. Obviously Prussia was referring to Jolene as \"Dopey\". Maggie walks forward to Prussia and stares her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, Marshal,\" she says. \"We were doing fine before you blew into town. Why does Dreadberry even need a marshal?\" Prussia lets out a laugh. \"You should give this town credit. Some people actually think a marshal and a sheriff are the same thing? So, how are you doing catching Specter?\" Maggie lets out a growl and blushes. \"Not much luck. Nobody has even heard from him in weeks. And no, you didn't scare the bastard off, even though that is all too possible.\" \"Burn.\" Comments Jolene. Prussia just turns her head and roars at Jolene to get her to back off. You shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no surprise that Maggie and Prussia didn't get along well. In fact, Meryl told you a long time ago that Nemean lions and weretigers rarely get along. However, as Maggie turns around to try and ignore Prussia, that blue tigress smiles seductively at Maggie and then smacks her in the butt, causing her to growl and you to grunt as the slap shook Maggie's rear and nearly made you fall through. \"Looks like the queen of beasts has some junk in the trunk,\" says Prussia with a grin. \"Just how I like it.\" Maggie growls and then slaps Prussia in the face. You give a glare yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the one thing you hated most about Prussia. You could accept she was a lesbian, but she was always hitting on Maggie. Prussia had no idea Maggie was married despite Maggie trying to tell her. Unfortunately, Maggie didn't tell Prussia that you were a human because she doesn't think that Prussia would understand. Prussia believed that the only thing humans were good for was eating and assumed Maggie was a predator as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Prussia,\" says Maggie angrily. \"You need to keep your hands to yourself. My husband wouldn't like it.\" \"There you go on again,\" says Prussia as she rolls her eyes. \"When am I going to meet this alleged husband of yours?\" Maggie bites her lip nervously as she tries to think of an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You give a look of fear as the tiger giantess licks her lips and then plucks you out as Maggie jumps up and screams. \"Well lookie what I've found,\" says Prussia as she stares at you with hungry eyes. \"A snack.\" You let out a scream as Prussia opens her mouth and shows you her enormous fangs, ready to devour you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Prussia can place you into her mouth, Maggie turns around and gasps. \"Prussia!\" she yells. \"Put him down!\" Prussia closes her mouth and lets out a sigh. \"Fine,\" she says. \"You can have a bite.\" \"You don't understand, Prussia,\" says Maggie. \"That's my husband!\" Prussia drops her jaw in surprise before Maggie takes you from Prussia's hand and pushes you against her (face) cheek. \"Not again, Neil,\" says Maggie. \"How many times have you been plastered to my ass?\" You shrug your shoulders. \"I lost count.\" You then kiss Maggie as she purrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Husband?!\" yells Prussia. \"You mean, you actually HAVE a husband?! And he's a <i>human</i> of all thing?!\" Maggie nodded her head. \"I'm sorry Prussia, but I'm not a lesbian. Besides, I don't see anything wrong with marrying a human.\" \"Nothing wrong?\" asks Prussia. \"Humans are food, Maggie! Please tell me you're at least planning on eating him down the road.\" Maggie lets out a growl at Prussia. \"Leave.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrussia growls back and stomps out of Maggie's office before Maggie looks down at you. \"I better get you to work,\" she says as she pets you. \"Before Prima and Atlanta have a conniption fit.\" You let out a laugh. \"Thanks for saving me from Prussia.\" \"You took the words out of my mouth,\" says Maggie. \"That woman is a total creep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what neither Maggie or you realized was that as Prussia was walking down the street, she was thinking about you and Maggie and mumbling to herself. \"Unbelievable. All this time she was married to a human! Why didn't anyone tell me she was straight!? That means that Sapphire is... ugh. That's enough to kill a gal's appetite.\" Prussia stopped to scratch away at a fence as she pondered the situation. \"She can't be serious. Doesn't she realize I could make her happier than that... that appetizer. After all, we're both cats. I'll bet I'd make a better parent for Sapphire than someone she could swallow whole by accident.\" As Prussia scratches a fence post into the likeness of Maggie, she hears an angry scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! You bloody tiger! What're you doing to my fence!?\" That voice was none other than Cattleya, your mother-in-law. Cattleya outright despise you and the thought of a human son-in-law filled her with disgust. Prussia backed away as the splinter cat stepped back. \"Oh,\" said Prussia. \"Cattleya. Darn sorry about that?\" Cattleya then looked at the carving and realized who it was a carving of. \"You're twenty years too late, cowgirl. Some minuscule little parasite beat you to it. Of all the species, she HAD to fall in love with a bloody human.\" \"Exactly,\" says Prussia. \"It doesn't take a genius to know she'd be better off with another cat. Humans are only good for eating.\" Cattleya lets out a scoff. \"If he weren't married to my youngest daughter, I would swallow that pest with some rum. Not only is he married to Maggie but my other daughter has been stalking him ever since that ratbag Fang walked out on her! The only decent thing about him is Sapphire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat both cats don't realize is that somebody overheard their conversation. That somebody was a certain voluptuous victorian banshee woman with green, pink and blue hair. Raven Dark. \"Hey!\" yelled Raven as she flew down. Her shrieking causing Cattleya and Prussia to plug their ears. \"Don't you talk smack about Neil.\" Said Raven. \"He's the cutest thing I've ever seen.\" Raven lets out a fangirl shriek and shakes her arms as Cattleya and Prussia continue to hold their ears. \"Bloody banshee.\" Mutters Cattleya. Raven then let out a sigh. \"Too bad by the time I found him, he had already settled down with an overfed alley cat.\" Then Raven grunted because Prussia grabbed her by the dress. \"You take that back, you screaming cow! Maggie is perfection! It's a shame she's the one married to Neil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Raven and Prussia are arguing, Cattleya is thinking to herself and then the splinter cat comes up with an idea. \"Quiet!\" she shouts. Raven and Prussia stop and then turn to your mother in law. \"What we have here is a conflict of interests.\" First she points to Prussia. \"You want my daughter's hand.\" Then Cattleya points to Raven. \"And you have the bad taste to want the man who already has it. I don't care as long as I don't have to put up with that parasite in law for a long time. Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the trio are in Cattleya's house. \"It seems,\" says Cattleya. \"We need to find a way to separate those two.\" Prussia let out a purr. \"I see what y'all are sayin'. I get Maggie and the Mad Hatter's daughter over there gets Neil.\" Raven is about to shriek again but Prussia puts her hat over the banshee's mouth. \"Well,\" says Cattleya. \"We better think of something. I know I haven't had much luck on the matter after 20 long years.\" The banshee, splintercat and weretiger all sit at Cattleya's dining room table to think of a way to break you and Maggie up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who comes up with the first idea?</span></div></div>",

Raven giggles and then shapes her ghostly birthing hips. \"It's exactly what it looks like,\" she says in a singsong tune. \"A love potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrussia lets out a slight growl as she hears this. \"Raven,\" she says. \"Love potions are <i>illegal</i>. I am an officer of the law y'all know.\" \"I know,\" says Raven. \"But desperate times call for desperate measures. After all, I'm Neil's real soulmate and not some overfed, so-called queen of beasts.\" Cattleya gives an angry glare and shows Raven her claws. \"Uh, no offense, Cattleya. My point is that this love potion could hypnotize both Maggie and Neil into leaving each other for who they really belong with. All it needs is a DNA sample from the intended target and whoever drinks the potion will fall in love with said target. It will only work if the potion is mixed in with tea. Cattleya could take care of that by slipping it into their tea when they aren't looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCattleya let out a purr and nodded her head. She actually liked that idea. However, Prussia was still skeptical and that tigress scratched her oversized belly before speaking her mind. \"That does sound like a good idea, but how do we know Sapphire won't drink it and ruin everything.\" \"Sapphire doesn't like tea, Prussia,\" says Cattleya. \"Which brings me to the next question.\" Prussia let out a laugh. \"Don't worry about that. You think they'd give a <i>human</i> the custody of a <i>monster</i> child. Once I steal Maggie away from that morsel, I'll take good care of your grand baby.

Maggie walks in with you on her shoulder and greets her. \"Hey mom!\" she says. \"What brings you here?\" Cattleya sits down on the sofa. \"I just thought I'd stop by for a cup of tea.\" she says. \"I do like spending time with my daughter.\" Maggie smiles and nods. \"Okay, I'll go get us some tea.\" she says. As the two of you head back to the kitchen you groan a little. \"Now Neil, don't be like that.\" Maggie tells you. \"Its not like she can do anything with me around.\" You guess she's right, but you're still wary around her mother. There's still a chance you'll end up under her ass somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the living room Cattleya looks to Raven and Prussia through the window and grins. Prussia gives a thumbs up and hides as Maggie enters with the tea. Cattleya gets up and walks over. Once the tea is on the coffee table Cattleya puts her arm around her daughter's shoulder. \"Looks great sweety, but could you grab the sugar too?\" Maggie stares at the tea for a second before answering. \"Oh! You're right!\" she says and turns back toward the kitchen. In a quick move Cattleya grabs you off of her shoulder and closes her paw around you. You find yourself in complete darkness as the splintercat moves back toward the couch. While keeping her paw closed so as not to let you see what she's doing Cattleya adds the love potion to both yours and Maggie's cups, yours actually being a thimble.

She grins just thinking about getting you away from her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you see the light as Cattleya opens her paw. You've been trying to get out this whole time, so when she opens up you lose your balance in mid-struggle. With a cry you stumble off of her paw and fall into Maggie's tea cup. You swim to the edge and look up to see Cattleya's claw coming down. The splintercat grabs you and lifts you up. Luckily she didn't add any DNA to Maggie's tea yet to keep any accidents from happening. With one quick move she dunks your head into the thimble, which is actually still pretty big to you.

You stare up at the beautiful weretigress and she glances down at you. Suddenly her eyes change and she looks at you with a softer expression. \"You are pretty cute.\" she says and scratches your head lightly with a claw. You turn bright red and are once again conflicted. You're married! Why are you feeling like this?! Then you feel her scratching again and can't help but give in. You plop down onto the giant furry paw resting in front of you and begin stroking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven is watching the two of you with an increasingly frustrated look. \"Are you kidding me?!\" she says. \"Now she's all over him!\" Cattleya looks confused and then she realizes what happened. \"The little bug must have back washed into the tea when he fell in it!\" she exclaims. Raven is fuming now. \"So not only do I have more competition, he's also in love with her?! This was supposed to be a simple plan!\" You and Prussia are in your own little world, looking into eachother's eyes. Cattleya grabs you and holds you up. \"Look, lets just grab him and go! We can fix everything and return him later!\" she says, deciding to just go for broke. Prussia feels differently. \"Oh no you don't! This little cutie ain't goin nowhere!\" she says and grabs you back. The three of them start arguing and you're caught in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile all of this has been in the span of about five minutes. As the three women are fighting Maggie walks back into the room. \"Sorry, I had to open a new bag of sugar and couldn't find it at first.\" she says as she walks in with a sugar dish. She stops cold upon seeing the spectacle before her. Her mother is holding her husband and arguing with two other women. One of which has a crush on her and the other has a crush on her husband. \"What the hell is going on!?\" she yells, causing everyone to stop. she had a bit of a roar in her statement. You stare at her a little ashamed. You are falling for another woman after all. \"Well, you see Maggie...\" Cattleya begins...</span></div></div>",

Your wife marches over and snatches you away to the dismay of Prussia. She brings you up to her face and gives you a questioning look. \"Whats going on?\" she asks. You start sweating nervously and then you break down. \"I don't know!\" you tell her. \"I just want to be closer to her! I think I'm in love!\" Maggie growls and narrows her eyes, making Prussia nervous. \"Don't be mad at him!\" she says and tries to grab you.

Cattleya looks away and Prussia hesitates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Raven breaks the silence yet again. \"She's in love with him!\" she says with a pout. Maggie looks surprised and then angry. \"Okay, someone explain what the hell is happening!\" she says, looking at Raven in particular. The banshee sees you and Prussia exchange a longing look and can't hold it in. \"We were going to break you up with a love potion but things went wrong and now look! My little Neil is head over heels for another dumb cat!\" she says. Cattleya grabs Raven's arm. \"Raven!\" she hisses. Maggie looks at her mother sharply. \"I take it you had a hand in this as well?\" she asks. Cattleya looks down, slightly angry and slightly ashamed. With a sigh Maggie places you in her paw. \"Well I have every right to arrest every one of you, but first I need to get Neil back to normal.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into the eyes of your gigantic wife a little afraid. She smiles at you and gives you a kiss. \"I don't blame you honey.\" she says. \"You were caught up in something you couldn't help.\" You smile at her but also steal a glance at Prussia, who looks back. \"Well, I'm sorry to say we're in love now!\" the weretiger says. Maggie glares at her and puts you between her boobs. \"You're not getting anywhere near my husband!\" she says. Prussia bares her teeth for a moment but then thinks better of messing with a Nemean Lion. Maggie turns to Raven sternly. \"Now fess up, do you have an antidote?\" she asks.

There is a cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why do I get the feeling there's a 'but' somewhere?\" Maggie mutters through clenched teeth, pinching the gap between her eyes. You fidget in her vast bosom, still occasionally looking at Prussia and giving her an awkward smile. Unsurprisingly, she returns it in the same manner, further unnerving your wife. Raven clears her throat and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...actually, there are two possible ways to reverse or, at least, nullify the potion's effect. One is to simply have Neil drink the potion with a sample of your saliva on it, and he'll fall in love with you all over again. The other is a potion that I recall reading about sometime ago, called 'Angel's Lament'. It can nullify most curses or potions without any secondary effects, other than mild nausea. However, it is extremely difficult to make and I'm pretty sure one of the key ingredients is all the way in the mountains near Terrordale.\" as the banshee finished her explanation, Maggie rubbed her poofy chin with one hand, pondering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that just leaves the first option. Fine with me.\" reluctantly, Raven hands her the love potion, and after combining the necessary reagents, you find yourself drinking the mixture from the thimble (which was emptied and refilled), and the mental images of Prussia are replaced by those of your rotund wife. You cough and shake your head, and Maggie rubs your shoulder with the tip of one of her claws. Now back to your senses, you look up to her and thank her, rubbing the fur of her chest and making her purr gently. A wail, however, ends the tender moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... what about me?\" the tigress, for a woman of her size, mewled softly, her expression on the verge of tears. \"First I lost you to that hunk of a man, and now I'm going to lose <i>said hunk</i>! It's not fair!\" Maggie turned her attention from you to the distraught tigress, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You never had me to begin with, and Neil has always been with me.\" however. her tone changed abruptly, as a thought just occurred in her head. \"...But you know what... I think I have the perfect solution to both your problems.\" you cannot help but look at your wife, surprised by her lighter tone. Maggie's expression, however, is one you know well, even if she's rarely like this, she's planning something devious. Prussia and Raven also seem to caught on, and look intimidated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two will put each other's DNA sample on the tea cups, and then you will drink them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room fell silent. Prussia was completely petrified, Raven held her mouth wide open, as if in a silent scream (which was kinda ironic, given her circumstances), and Cattley looked stunned. Satisfied with the result, Dreadberry's sheriff continued before anyone could object. \"However, IF you refuse, there will be consequences, for starters, Raven, you were in possession of an illegal item, and I am bound by the law to arrest you for such. And you, Prussia,  you can be sure I'll speak of this to the Mayor, and I don't think she'll be in the mood to deal with your shenanigans, in fact, worst case scenario, she might revoke your marshall badge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the splintercat took a step forward, her voice low. \"Now, Maggie, you're taking this too far. There's no need t-\" she was cut short as the large lioness turned to her, her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you, Mother dearest, you can be damn well sure I'll tell your granddaughter what you just tried to pull, and you can also expect to spend a very lonely Christmas, this year.\" for the first time ever, you see the mother-in-law who despises you so much falter. Her knees trembled lightly, and she lifted one shaky hand to her chest, mouthing something of the likes of 'you wouldn't dare'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tense silence fills the room, as you look on expectantly from your wife's bosom.</span></div></div>",

With a grim expression she pours it into her drink, but notices something that no one else does. The bottle isn't exactly clear so no one notices that its almost empty. The gears start turning in her head as she pours it into her tea. Then she spits a drop into the cup while Prussia does the same with hers. All thats left is to hand Prussia the bottle. As she is handing it over there is a noise from outside. Like it was a gift from god everyone turns to look out the window. In a flash Raven gives her cup to Prussia and grabs the cup with your DNA. She gives Prussia a grin, which the weretiger returns when she feels how empty the bottle is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now drink.\" Maggie says. The two of them swap cups and are about to drink when Maggie stops them. \"Wait! How do I know you actually put the potion in?\" she asks. Raven tosses her the bottle. \"We just used the last of it.\" she says spitefully. Maggie looks inside the bottle and nods satisfied. It was a small slip up that she didn't consider they switched the cups around. With that the two girls drink. Thanks to their little switcharoo Prussia is drinking tea with your DNA and Raven is drinking tea with her own DNA. Nothing happens but the two of them have to put on an act. \"You're so beautiful!\" Prussia says as she rushes to give Raven a hug. \"And I never knew you were such a pretty kitty!\" Raven says back. This all sounds pretty corny to you but that might be how the potion affected them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now get out!\" Maggie orders. The two lovebirds walk out hand in hand, making eyes at each other. \"And as for you...\" the lioness says as she turns to her mother. The door shuts before they hear anymore, but as soon as it does they let go of each other. \"Okay, thats enough of that.\" Prussia says. \"Thanks for getting me out of that. I couldn't bear to not love Neil.\" Raven rolls her eyes. \"I loved him from the start, not because of some potion. As much as it pains me to have another fat cat pining after my Neil, we need to help each other.\" Prussia gives her a thumbs up. \"Got it. I'll bust you for possession of a love potion, but we won't tell them you used it. I'll make sure you get a slap on the wrist, then it will be over and Maggie can't do anything.\" she explains. Raven smiles at the plot and they head off. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You struggle but its useless against the giant tigress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally breaks the kiss she continues leaning on the desk.

You look over and see Maggie, who storms over angrily. \"Guess the cat's out of the bag.\" Prussia says and stands up, letting you go. \"Oh, I'm reporting your ass and having that ghost arrested!\" Maggie says, getting in Prussia's face.

Oh, Mayor, it's you! Is there a problem? Huh? What do you mean you've hired a professional? But Mayor, we're doing the best we can! Fine. Who was it again? Are you serious?! But she's a psychopath! Fine, send her over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie hangs up the phone and growls in frustration. \"What's wrong, Boss?\" Asks Jolene. \"The mayor says we're not making enough progress on the Specter case, so she's hired a bounty hunter to get the job done.\" For the last six months, Dreadberry has been terrorized by a string of bank robberies. But no evidence has been found as to who the perpetrator could be, no fingerprints, DNA, nothing. Whoever it is somehow breaks into the vault, clears out the money, and vanishes without a trace. But there are no signs of forced entry, and nothing ever appears on the bank's security cameras. The mysterious thief has been dubbed \"The Specter\", because it seems as though he can just walk through the walls of the vault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this bounty hunter?\" Jolene asked. Maggie growls again \"Bona Fete.\" Maggie hated bounty hunters, and especially Bona Fete. They had never met, but she knew Bona by reputation. She was the most feared and relentless bounty hunter in the entire monster world, a loose cannon willing to kill her targets no matter what their crimes may be. Jolene on the other hand, idolized Bona Fete, and squealed with glee when Maggie said her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! You mean the Bona Fete? This is gonna be awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Bona arrived. She was a 950 foot tall gargoyle, just a head shorter than your wife. She had grey skin with black hair, and a muscular build. She wore a black metal chestplate with a skull painted on it like the Punisher, Kevlar pants, with her arms covered in tattoos, each one symbolizing a kill she's made. Following her was her pet fenrir, and a giant, ferocious wolf. When they walked into Maggie's office, you could hear her fenrir growling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Ripper.\" Said Bona before turning to Maggie, who glared at her. \" I take it you're the one the Mayor of this charming little town hired me to help?\" Maggie growls again \"I'll have you know we don't need the help of your kind here.\" Said Maggie \"I'm only working with you because I have to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBona scoffs \"You don't need help? If your mayor had hired me in the first place, I'd have caught this Specter criminal within a day.  So just stay out of my way, kitten.\" It was this point that Maggie gets up from her chair and storms across the room, getting in Bona's face, snarling. Bona just smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, make one move, it'll be the last thing you ever do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, Ripper begins sniffing the air, picks up a peculiar smell, and begins barking. Maggie looks down and asks \"What's wrong with your mutt?\"  Ripper follows the smell , which leads to him stocking his knows up to Maggie's rump. \"Care explain why your dog is sniffing my rear?\" Bona chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ripper knows the scent of humans well.

That creature must have some seriously sharp teeth to be able to hurt a Nemean lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipper pulls and manages to rip off a good chunk of Maggie's pants and you're forced to hold on a piece of her panties just to survive as you scream.

The fenrir further shreds the cloth and soon you're in the beast's jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get hit by a blast of foul breath that reeks of death. You're too busy coughing to scream. Ripper's breath was even worse than Cattleya's. But you couldn't think about that now, you had to escape or be eaten. Fortunately a stream of drool comes down and knocks you to the ground with a splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" You groan. You try to stand but you keep slipping on the slime before you're in the jail cell. Thankfully it wasn't built to hold humans. \"Oh great,\" you groan. \"Not more saliva.\" You hear snarling and look up to see Ripper and quickly slip into the cell as the creature bangs its head against the bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're scared to death and suspect any minute the fenrir will try and chew through the bars. Fortunately for you, Irma comes in and grabs Ripper in a bear hug. Ripper struggles but the frost giantess's grip is too strong. \"Thank you Irma,\" says Maggie as she rubs her butt. \"Bad dog. Bad master too.\" Bona at the moment is laughing at the havoc her pet has caused and Maggie growls at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep that thing under a leash before I do the universe a favor and neuter <i>you</i>.\" \"I'd like to see you try hairball,\" says Bona. \"Or should I say butterball?\" From the look on Maggie's face, you can tell she wasn't getting along well with Bona and you don't blame her. This woman was a lout. As if to hammer it home, you hear buzzing and look up to see a giant fly. Bona immediately takes out a gun and shoots the fly, destroying the window in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie gives an annoyed look but Jolene is in awe. \"That is so cool.\" Says Jolene as Bona blows on her gun. \"The way I see it,\" says Bona. \"Specter is already dead.

There was no mistaking it, Specter was no monster, he was a human no bigger than you were. He was wearing a black cloak and what looked like a Taskmaster mask as he panted and ran away carrying what looked like a bag that was the same color as a starry night. It would be impossible for it to hold all that money in the vault, even if said money were human size, unless the bag was magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" you ask. \"That's Specter. Specter was panting and looking around as he heard Ripper barking coming from the vent. \"Great,\" complains the bank robber. \"Now they've got a fenrir. \"Terrific.\" Specter pulls on his cloak and suddenly becomes invisible as you look on. \"Unbelievable,\" you say. \"He must be a wizard. But why would he steal? What a waste.\" Specter runs to the side of the wall to hide, but you knew where he was and nod your head. \"Come on Neil. Compared to Dracula, this guy should be a piece of cake.\" As Specter is trying to inch away, you run up to him and tear off his invisibility cloak as he screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecter looks you in the eyes and gasps. \"Specter I presume.\" You say. \"Wh-What are you doing here?\" asks Specter. \"I just hitched a ride on my wife. Quite frankly, I don't trust Bona. Give yourself up and you might not get eaten.\" However, Specter just punches you in the face and tries to run. You wipe your mouth and then toss one of your shoes into an alarm to make it sound off and then tackle Specter to the ground. In the process, a roll of skulls (monster currency) is knocked out of the bag. The bills are the right size for monster currency, so the bag was magic. So that was how Specter was able to clean out the vault without anyone knowing what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say,\" you say as you hold Specter down. \"You have balls for stealing from monsters. Don't know how you intend to spend all that cash though. Not all monsters are exactly human friendly.\" However, Specter reaches into his back and takes out a knife and nearly takes your hand off to force you to let go before he runs again. Suddenly Specter falls back and you start to tumble yourself when you hear a shaking noise. There were exactly five monsters coming forward and from the sound of it, two of the monsters were abnormally tall and one of the monsters was some kind of feral beast rather than a sentient being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie, Bona, Ripper, Irma and Jolene were rushing forward to catch Specter from the other side of the bank. \"Damn you Bona!\" yells Maggie. \"That stupid dog of yours probably alerted Specter we were onto him. Why did you bring that thing with you anyway?\" Bona takes out a hand gun and clicks it. \"Shows what you know Kitty Cat,\" she says. \"Now that Specter's scared, he'll make a foolish mistake and.. BANG! BANG!\" Maggie gets on all fours to run ahead as Bona is thinking up how to kill Specter. If only they knew they were dealing with a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrma stops to catch her breath as Ripper runs past her. \"I'll... I'll be right there Mag... oh, my back... ouch.\" Jolene smiles as she runs alongside Bona. \"Just watch junior,\" says Bona to Jolene. \"You get to see a genuine execution in progress. \"Awesome.\" Says Jolene as the basilisk giantess shows her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, you're still running after Specter. \"Come here Specter!\" you yell. \"You're going to the slammer!\" Specter reaches into his magic back and tosses several caltrops on the ground as you step on them and growl in pain. You take off your jacket and throw it in Specter's face to make him fall to the ground. Before Specter could grab anything else from his back, you grab him in a headlock and make him grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard quakes and see a shadow, a monster was coming from around the corner, but which one...</span></div></div>",

You feel Sapphire\u2019s paw and smile at her. \u201cRelax Baby,\u201d you say. \u201cYou\u2019ll shred.\" Sapphire laughs and soon the three of you are in the car. You\u2019re on Maggie\u2019s shoulder looking down at Sapphire who is still looking over her book. Sapphire put a lot of effort into her studies, a fact you appreciated a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Maggie is driving down the street, she\u2019s forced to stop and you yell before you fall back and land in Sapphire\u2019s backpack just as Sapphire is putting her book away. Maggie growls at the car that just cut her off. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I have to take my daughter to school, you jerk! Honestly Neil. They\u2019ll give anyone a driver\u2019s license these days. That\u2019s when you hear a zipping noise and gasp. Sapphire didn\u2019t know it, but she accidentally zipped you inside her backpack with her textbooks. As Maggie starts driving again, you climb a textbook. \u201cMaggie!\u201d you yell. \u201cSapphire! Stop the car!\u201d But unfortunately neither your wife nor daughter can hear you. It looks like you\u2019re going with Sapphire to Nightmare High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon hear the door open and Sapphire runs out. \u201cBye Mom!\u201d she yells. \u201cBye Dad! I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d If only she knew here dad was in her backpack. This was not good. You can only hope Maggie realizes something\u2019s up. Sapphire walks into Nightmare High and finds  Emerald, your rag doll niece waiting for her. Emerald smiles as Sapphire comes up and shakes her hand. \u201cEmerald,\u201d says Sapphire. \u201cGood to see you cuz.\u201d Emerald grins and shows the zipper over her mouth. Although you were glad that Meryl and Flint enchanted themselves a little one of their own, you wish that Emerald wasn\u2019t so creepy. You can\u2019t remember the last time she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire and Emerald walk into the schoolhouse and you watch as many monster teenagers both male and female pass by. Down the hall was Sapphire\u2019s closest friends; Topaz the Chinese dragon, Onyx the Carbuncle and Sapphire\u2019s B.F.F., Ruby the Orthrus. Makes you wonder why all Sapphire\u2019s friends were named after gems. \u201cGood morning Sapphire, Emerald.\u201d Says Topaz as she opens her locker. Ruby walks up and gives Sapphire their secret handshake and you close your eyes. Sapphire wouldn\u2019t like it if you knew. \u201cHey Ruby,\u201d said Sapphire. \u201cIf you see your brother, tell him congratulations for me.\u201d Ruby\u2019s two heads give a smile. \u201cThanks Sapphire,\u201d says the right head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d says the left head. \u201cHow much it means..\u201d \u201cFor Norville...\u201d \u201cTo be working with machines.\u201d You remember that Moxie recently gave Ruby\u2019s brother a job at her garage. You\u2019d tell Ruby congrats yourself, but you could never speak to her properly. Trying to communicate with two headed monsters gave you a monster headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnyx, that carbuncle finally notices Sapphire and turns her head. You see that she\u2019s eating some kind of candy, a little too early in the morning for that, but you couldn\u2019t tell what it was. \u201cOh, Sapphire. Didn\u2019t see you over the weekend G.F. Oh, you weren\u2019t sick were you? You were sick and didn\u2019t tell me? That\u2019s just plain rude.\u201d Sapphire lets out a roaring laugh. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sick Onyx. I was studying for Ms. Tavi\u2019s big math test.\u201d Onyx continues to stuff her face and then holds out the bag. \u201cKnock it off Sapphire. You\u2019re the smartest girl I know, you\u2019ll do fine. Say, you want some candy coated humans? I\u2019ve got plenty. You gasp in horror as Onyx mentions exactly what she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuck!\u201d yells Sapphire in disgust. \u201cOnyx! I\u2019m part human!\u201d Realizing that she accidentally offended her friend, Onyx puts her snack away as Topaz simply rolls her eyes. \u201cToo much sugar early in the morning ruins the brain,\u201d says Topaz. \u201cIt is you I worry about Onyx.\u201d \u201cHey,\u201d says Ruby. \u201cWhere...\u201d \u201cIs Pearl.\u201d Sapphire walks forward and then bumps against something, or rather someone. \u201cOuch!\u201d Sapphire looks down at a familiar dark skinned gargoyle girl who has her arms crossed. \u201cOh, sorry about that Pearl. I didn\u2019t...\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t see me,\u201d says Pearl mockingly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it all before.\u201d Pearl may have been Sapphire\u2019s friend but she had a temper on her. You couldn\u2019t tell by looking at her but she\u2019s abnormally small for a gargoyle. Since her aunt and cousin are as big as Maggie it\u2019s especially frustrating for her. You wonder why Pearl would hang out with Sapphire and the girls given they obviously tower over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019re extra angry this morning Pearl,\u201d says Topaz. \u201cAll that self-directed rage is eating you alive.\u201d \u201cSave the fortune cookies for after school Topaz,\u201d says the gargoyle girl. \u201cYou\u2019d be angry too if your boyfriend dumped you for a freaking nuckelavee. It\u2019s like my Auntie Destiny says, men are poison.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s only because she can\u2019t accept that she was a victim of karma,\u201d says Topaz. \u201cShe\u2019s as much to blame for what happened as... what did you say his name was.\u201d Pearl got so mad her eyes glowed bright. You gulp and hide further into Sapphire\u2019s backpack. \u201cDon\u2019t make me take out your dragon balls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Pearl could do anything she\u2019d regret, Sapphire lifts her up and lets out a sigh. \u201cYou remind me of my Grandma,\u201d she says. \u201cShe\u2019s always mad at Dad for something stupid.\u201d Onyx lets out a laugh. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s one problem when you marry outside your own species.\u201d Onyx lets out a laugh before Emerald lightly taps her on the back of her head. You could just laugh at the carbuncle\u2019s stupidity if it weren\u2019t for the fact you just remembered you were in a high school for giant monsters and Sapphire had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ground begins to shake and you scream as you grab the spine of Sapphire\u2019s math book. \u201cLooks like Headmistress Wayne fell asleep again.\u201d Says Sapphire. \u201cShe can,\u201d \u201cSleep all day,\u201d \u201cIf she wants.\u201d Says Ruby\u2019s two heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver. Headmistress Wayne was the world\u2019s biggest monster. She was almost twice Maggie\u2019s height and that was saying something. The woman was no ordinary monster, but a monster mutated by human experiments. The woman was so big that her office was underneath the school and not inside it. According to Sapphire, Morgan isn\u2019t mean at all, but Sapphire has never been Morgan\u2019s office so she isn\u2019t a reliable source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Sapphire and her friends were heading to class now. You don\u2019t remember Sapphire\u2019s schedule so you don\u2019t know which teacher she\u2019ll run into. Well, which class are you unintentionally following your daughter to?</span></div></div>",

You sit inside the bag and wait for an opportunity to get your daughter's attention. A rumbling outside tells you that everyone is arriving and taking their seats. Then a voice begins speaking aloud. \"All right guys, how's everyone doing today?\" You recognize that voice. Its Colleen Howler, Sapphire's art teacher. You're actually relieved because she was the most safe teacher for you to be around in this school. This is because she doesn't eat humans. Its not that she feels bad about it though, its because she thinks they taste horrible. You've met her a couple of times and she is friendly enough. Though those times she wasn't so much talking to you as she was Maggie. Still, she's civil to you and Sapphire says she's really nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay class before we get started lets talk about what we've been up to.\" Ms. Howler says. You realize that Sapphire probably won't be going into her bag for this class so you decide to try and find your own way out. While you look around the inside of the bag you hear Ms. Howler outside talking. She sounds really friendly and energetic. Her personality, coupled with the fact that she doesn't eat humans, makes you confident that you can get out of this okay. You inspect the zipper from the inside and see some light coming in. Its open a little just enough for you to squeeze out. Using her textbooks, you manage to climb up and out of Sapphire's bag. When you exit you slide down the bag and onto the floor. You turn around prepared to try and grab your daughter's attention but she gets out of her seat before you can. You manage to dodge her scaly feet and watch her walk away. This reminds you of how much danger you're still in. Anyone could crush you without even noticing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to wait for Sapphire to return to her seat. It would be ideal to get your daughter's help. Unfortunately as you see her coming another set of booms is coming from another direction. You look to see the furry feet of Ms. Howler heading for you. She makes it to your location before Sapphire and by a miracle doesn't step on you. She does come dangerously close and the impact of her paws knocks you off your feet. She stands there for a second while she talks to the class and you pick yourself up and absentmindedly lean on her. Suddenly she starts walking again and by reflex you grab her fur in surprise. You're taken along for the ride until she arrives back at her desk. You think for a moment and decide that Ms. Howler, being the closest monster, is your best bet now. Looking up you take in her towering body. Her fur is red and white with a paint stain here and there. You take a breath and begin climbing the massive werewolf's furry body. You make your way up Ms. Howler's body, not paying attention to the voices around you. Your only concern is finding a way to get noticed. Eventually you make it to her thigh and start to think you're making good progress. As if someone knew what you were thinking her paw comes down to scratch herself. You try your hardest to dodge and through your maneuvering end up on her backside. When you feel safe enough you begin to climb again. Just as you do the werewolf takes her seat and you are trapped under her giant ass. What now?</span></div></div>",

Just as the students are walking out, Colleen's ears twitch. She begins to sniff the air and feel around her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt as Colleen's claws snatch you up from her furry rear and then pulls you in front of her face by the leg. She looks in absolute surprise as her irises widen. \"Hi Colleen.\" You say weakly. Ms. Howler turns her head and notices Sapphire about to leave. \"Sapphire,\" says Colleen. \"Can I speak to you for a second.\" Sapphire turns her head and walks up to her art teacher. \"What is it Ms. Howler?\" she asks. Colleen holds you in front of Sapphire and your daughter is in complete shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy?!\" Sapphire asks. \"What are you doing here?!\" You let out a sigh. \"Let's just say, maybe your mother's shoulder isn't the safest spot in the car for someone my size. Especially when she's forced to hit the brakes.\" \"You're lucky I found him when I did,\" says Colleen. \"There are monsters in this school with poor enough taste to gulp your father down.\" Colleen hands you to Sapphire and Sapphire nods her head. \"Thanks Ms. Howler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long until Sapphire takes you into the girl's room to wash the paint off of you. \"Not a word of this to your mother, Sapphire,\" you say. \"Her ass is the only one I want to touch for the rest of  my life.\" Sapphire lets out a slight growl. \"Speaking of which, she's probably worried sick.\" Sapphire then carries you into the hallway as you let out a sigh. \"I'm sorry Sweetie,\" you say. \"I didn't mean to cause any trouble.\" That's when you hear a tumbler moving and a door opening. You look to see Sapphire opening her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you yell as Sapphire places you inside. Sapphire lowers her head to your level and lets out a slight mew. \"I'm sorry Dad, but this school is dangerous to humans. You're lucky the teacher who found you was Ms. Howler. If she didn't hate the taste of humans... ugh. I don't even want to think about it. Just stay there. I'll call Mom and tell her you're alright.\" With that, Sapphire kisses you and then shuts the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh and cross your arms as you look around Sapphire's locker. There's bedazzles, school books and posters of boy bands, basically your average teenage girl's locker, albeit blown to giant size. At least Sapphire had some comic books for you to read. It was going to be a long day. You flip through Sapphire's comic books and reread the same story lines for hours until you finally hear a clicking noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head and see the locker opening up. Sapphire reaches out her hand but you just cross your arms and give her a cross look as she sighs. \"I'm sorry Dad,\" she said. \"But Mom couldn't get out of work. Sorry to keep you waiting.\" You let out a sigh. \"Well at least nothing could kill me in here.\" Sapphire then bites her lips and you don't like the look of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" you ask. \"Dad,\" says Sapphire as she looks down on you nervously. \"You remember I signed up for extra credit with Ms. Khamen to tutor a failing student in history.\" \"Yes,\" you say before your eyes pop and you realize what she means. \"Oh, don't tell me!\" Sapphire picks you up and then places you in the side pocket of her jeans. \"Please understand Dad. I made prior arrangements and I can't reschedule at the last minute. Just stay out of sight. Ms. Khamen just told me to meet the monster in the library after school. I don't know if this monster eats humans or not, so be careful.\" You let out a sigh before Sapphire walks towards the school library. You couldn't believe that Sapphire had to tutor some underachieving student. Then an awful thought hits you. What if it's a <i>boy</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sapphire enters the library, you peek out to see that the librarian was a bright green skinned Lovecraftian monster, a demoness with the face of an octopus and tentacles for hair. You even see some tentacles at the sides of her mouth which is filled with hundreds of needle like teeth and she has leather wings as well. The librarian stares at Sapphire before returning to the book she was reading and Sapphire reaches a table with the student she was supposed to tutor waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what kind of monster is it...</span></div></div>",

She has sharp teeth, claws, and all that other stuff you would expect to see in a dragon. She was also wearing a pink shirt, with blue jeans that fit her. She is like a Red Eyes Black Dragon, but she is a female version and humaniod standing one as well. \"Hey Sonya. How in the world did you allow yourself to get yourself failing your class? Did you know this is the 3rd time in the past few weeks that I had to tutor you. Aren't you taking your school work seriously at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonya just muttered. \"Who honestly gives a crap about school lessons, I just come here to play basketball and tennis and that's it.\" as if she wasn't giving a freaking damn about her grades at all. This is one of the students that not only was giving Sapphire serious issues at school, with all of her nastiness and cruel things she would say to her, but also that Sapphire has to put up with this gal on so many times for tutoring. Sapphire is on top of her class most of the time, so it's not surprising that she has to tutor, but she is annoyed that this is the girl she has to tutor. Just looking at her from poking at the pocket to see it for a second is just sickening. Heck, when the Lovecraftian just look at Sonya's nasty and rude face right on her, she was in fear right then (I know it's a little different than what you intended, but there is something with my new character that makes many fear her). \"You better be lucky that you aren't the one I bet up in this school.

She doesn't eat humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see the monster Sapphire was talking about. The monster looked to be around 18-19 years old. She was about 675 feet tall. She had brown eyes and short, black hair. She had green skin and was covered in thorn like fur. You could see a branch-like tail, wich made you realize that she was a cactus cat. She was slightly chubby, mostly in her stomach and legs. She was wearing a blue shirt with an old castle on it and blue jeans. She looked down at you in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sapphire. Why do you have a human? You know it's against policy to bring snacks into the library.\" The girl, Jade, says in a matter-of-fact tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He isn't a snack, Jade. This is my dad, Neil.\" Sapphire replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade gets right up in your face and smiles, revealing a row of sharp teeth. \"Oh. I didn't know Sapphire was half-human. It's nice to meet you, Mr. Reaver. My name is Jade Louisa Harrett. I am a 18-year-old cactus cat.\" She says proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sweating at the sight of her teeth. \"It's nice to meet you.\" You say, a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you look scared? I thought people liked smiles?\" She asks, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade, you right up in my dad's face and baring your fangs. That tends to make humans uncomfortable.\" Sapphire tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade's face falls. \"Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Reaver. Please forgive me.\" She quickly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it isn't. You're the first human father I've met and I scared you. I didn't mean to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really, it's fine.\" You try to explain, but don't get the chance. Jade has started crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, dad?\" Sapphire gets your attention. \"Jade doesn't really understand social cues. She has Asperger's Syndrome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explained it. One of your friends had Asperger's. You turn to Jade, who is still crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade, it's alright. You didn't know. It's just, being a human, I get worried about being eaten.\" You calmly explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade sniffles. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You didn't do anything wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade smiles, this time with no teeth. \"OK. I promise I'll be more careful about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Sapphire says. \"So, do you want to get started on being tutored?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's Jade's reaction?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then she turned to you and Sapphire. \"Yeah. I can't wait. I love history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if you love history, then why do you need a tutor?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The teacher said I had trouble paying attention. I can't help it. My mind wanders a lot. So she assigned me a tutor to give me any information I missed in class.\" Jade explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Jade is pretty smart in some subjects like art and history.\" Sapphire tells you. \"But she is failing math and science, so she has another tutor for those. But we're wasting time. Let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours, Sapphire helped Jade with any information she didn't get in class. You also chimed in from time to time, since history was a good subject of yours when you were in high school. And Sapphire was right, Jade was pretty smart, just unfocused. There were times where her face would go blank and either you or Sapphire had to bring her back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the fact that Jade was VERY talkative. Once a topic she liked came up, she would ramble on and on about it and forgot the reason she was here. Sapphire would have to stop her to get her back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it was time for the library to close and you, Jade, and Sapphire left. Jade insisted on carrying you on her shoulder. As you left, Sapphire was talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so she wound up being stuck in our door frame for 12 weeks. Food and bathroom breaks were a bit of a problem.\" She finished her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled at remembering that, but Jade was stone faced. \"It doesn't seem that funny. Laughing at another person's distress. She can't help it if all her weight distributes to her buttocks.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never see the humor in things.\" Sapphire replied. \"Oh. I just remembered. I was invited to a party tomorrow and I can bring two guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're eyes widened at the word \"party\". A party meant there would be boys. And they might try to hit on Sapphire. \"I'm not sure if I should let you go.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I wasn't going to initially, but as I was tutoring, I thought that it might be a good idea for Jade to go to make friends.\" Sapphire explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NONONONONONONONONONO.\" Jade replied quickly. \"I hate crowds. I hate people looking at me. I hate loud noises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be at the old discotheque.\" Sapphire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Jade's attention. \"Really? Maybe I will go then.\" She said. \"But only if I can bring earplugs. And I'm bringing my own drinks and snacks. I don't like eating other peoples food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\" Sapphire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think...\" You begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, the invite said I could bring 2 guests. And my other guest is you. It's a teen party, but the host doesn't care if one or two parents show up.\" Sapphire told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat calmed you down a bit. At least you could keep boys from hitting on her. But that did mean you had a risk of ending up as someone's snack. \"Ok, what's the party?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire smiled. \"It's a...\"</span></div></div>",

You've gotten yourself stuck under Maggie quite a few times in your life. Try as you might, you can't wiggle out from under the giant cheek. You don't know how long you spend there until Ms. Howler gets up. As she stands you find that you're stuck to her butt cheek as if you're imprinted on it. Unable to move you can only watch as the students leave. Class must be over. You see Sapphire walking out and in a desperate attempt you cry out to her. No one hears you and soon you're alone with the teacher. She walks around and straightens the room, humming to herself as she does so. You stare up and see her white tail swaying above you. There's paint on the tip, almost as if she uses it to paint with. The bell rings and another class enters the room. Once again Ms. Howler begins teaching and sits down with you on her rear. This goes on until its time for school to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the final bell rings Ms. Howler packs her things and exits the art room. You see various monsters pass you by as she heads to the parking lot. Once again you fail to get anyone's attention and she makes her way to her car. You brace yourself when she sits down to drive home, a little thankful that the car seat is softer than her chair in the art room. The sound of the car tells you that she's on the road with you as an unwilling stowaway. When the car stops she gets out and heads into her house. \"Okay, time to get this paint off.\" she says as she sets her things down. You're too exhausted from being sat on all day to try and wiggle free, but you definitely notice the change in scenery when she enters the bathroom. You hear the shower turn on and suddenly water is pelting her body. As the paint washes off, so do you. You fall and land with a splash in a pool of water mixed with soap and paint. In a panic you swim to the giant werewolf and head between her feet. You have to dodge while swimming as she lifts her feet to wash them and sits them back down with a booming splash. When her paws are clean you grab her fur and wait out the rest of the shower. Staring up you see her washing herself, but make sure not to stare too much. You are married after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she gets out of the shower she dries off as she walks. You let go of her foot and land on your butt on the floor. Staring up at her you think that she is a very attractive woman. You always did have an affinity for furry monsters. After all, you married a lioness. Looking around you see that you're in some sort of art room. It does make sense that she'd have a room at home to help with her job. Littered around there are various pieces of different kinds of art. You don't know if Ms. Howler made them, but you assume not since they're all on display as if she collected them. They each have an initial by them, probably of the artist who made them. There's a painting with a \"P\" under it on the wall, and next to that is a pencil drawing with an \"H\". Between them is a picture drawn on one half and painted on the other. There's a \"D\" under this one. You also see a nice looking figure made of seashells on a stand with an \"A\", and next to that is a mannequin wearing an outfit that looks professionally made. There's an \"L\" on the mannequin's neck. On another stand with an \"S\" is a figure carved from wood. There are many more things in this room, each with an initial by them. You have to say its impressive, but now is not the time to admire artwork. You look to the giant werewolf above you and prepare to try and contact her.  </span></div></div>",

Luckily you manage to grab onto her furry paw and hoist yourself up. The ascent has begun and you have an easy time until she begins moving. You knew this was coming so you stop climbing and hold on tight while she moves about. Whenever she stops you resume your climb, pausing whenever she walks around. Whenever you look up you see her fiddling with paint or looking through papers. She must be working on school related things. You're also granted a glimpse of her generous figure, which again makes you feel a little guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you reach her stomach, which is better than your last attempt. Last time you ended up being stuck under her ass. You're feeling pretty good until you see her arm moving. She's about to scratch her belly! You start to move but her paw comes down and scratches a spot on the other side of her stomach. She must not have felt you and just had a normal itch. With a sigh of relief you continue on, stealing glances at her arms and paws the whole way. When you cross from her stomach onto her chest you experience some shade. Looking around you see a huge breast on each side, and above is her face. With the end in sight you make your up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you move between her boobs Ms. Howler begins walking again. Like before you stop and hold on, but now there's a new twist. As she moves her breasts sway, and with you being so close you can't help but look. The giant orbs distract you almost enough to make you lose your grip. Cursing yourself you shut your eyes and regain your hold on her fur. When the chance comes you keep climbing faster than ever. Finally you reach her neck, and from there you make way for her shoulder. Just as you reach to climb up however she suddenly shifts and you fall from your position. Instead of falling to the floor though you hit one of her boobs and bounce along on it. With some effort you manage to grab some fur and hold on. Now you have to climb back up! She starts moving again, but to make matters worse as her breasts move you get jostled around as well.She appears to be headed somewhere this time, but where? </span></div></div>",

She eventually stops and you check your surroundings. You see she's in front of a refrigerator just as she opens the door. Bending down she grabs a container from inside. You have to hold on tighter when her breasts shift from the movement. Soon after she's got the food heated up and on a plate. She must be having leftovers for dinner. As she sits down you see that her meal is lasagna, mostly meat. It appears to be a couple different kinds, but you're thankful that none of them is human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Howler sits to eat and you decide to try and get her attention. You begin climbing the slope of her breast as she devours her meal. She's using utensils but still eats with a ravenous quality as a wolf does. As you climb you see her arm moving from the plate to her mouth, accompanied by the sound of her eating like animal. Seeing how sharp her teeth are and the way she rips into her meal makes you stop for a second. The sight of it makes you thankful that she doesn't eat humans. You regain your focus and press on toward her face. Getting near those teeth may be dangerous, but it would be good to climb while she's sitting still like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the giant body you're on shifts. Up until now she had been moving while she eats, but nothing you couldn't handle. Now she's a little closer to the plate and you get thrown off by her movement. As you fall down you look up at her massive face as she continues to eat. With a plop you land in the lasagna below, or whats left of it. She's just about done and you're sitting in what remains. Her fork comes down and grabs a portion, narrowly missing you. You scream and scramble away, but the sauce makes your movements awkward. As you run you slip and fall onto your belly, making you easy pickings. The fork returns and you are scooped up with some loose meat and cheese. You collect yourself just in time to see Ms. Howler's cavernous maw before you are brought inside. The fork leaves her mouth and you get stuck inside with the food. Her tongue moves under you, making you slip on the saliva. As you slide around, getting a view of the huge teeth surrounding you, light suddenly appears. You find yourself hurtling through the air as you are spat out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll onto the table while the werewolf tries to get the taste out of her mouth above. \"What the hell was that? It tasted horrible!\" she says. You wipe the saliva out of your eyes and look up at her. She looks down on you to try and figure out what was in her food. Does she recognize you with all the sauce and saliva?</span></div></div>",

Her gigantic eyes study you for a second and widen in surprise. \"You're Sapphire Reaver's father! Neil!\" she says when she recognizes you. \"Hello Colleen.\" you say and give her a small wave. \"What were you doing in my food? For that matter what were you doing in my house?\" she asks a little accusingly. \"Well...\" you begin and proceed to explain your day. \"So you you were stuck to my butt?\" she asks after you finish. You nod and she sighs. \"I guess it goes to show how dangerous it is for a human in these parts.\" You shrug and she sets you down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the world have you stayed alive?\" she asks. \"Well I have my wife and daughter to look out for me.\" you tell her. \"Well, that and luck I guess. Don't get me wrong though, I end up in these situations with Maggie quite a bit. Its kind of how we had Sapphire.\" Colleen laughs and gives your head a little scratch. \"Wow you are lucky.\" she says.

I wasn't sure if you liked me.\" you admit. \"Well I'll admit I sort of focused on your wife whenever we met with each other because she's a monster. I didn't mean to ever shut you out, you're a nice guy.\" she says. You smile a little at the compliment. \"Although I have to say you taste awful.\" she adds. You both share a laugh and continue talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Colleen walks over and explains the situation. \"Okay its a little late so we'll just wait until tomorrow to deal with you. I called your wife so she knows where you are.\" she tells you. You breathe a sigh of relief. \"At least she doesn't have to worry.\" you say. Colleen picks you up and carries you to another room. You look around and see that its her bedroom. \"I don't want you getting into any trouble so you'll sleep in here with me.\" she says. Then she gets into bed and places you on the bedside table. She also provides you with a cloth you can use to sleep on. \"Now you sleep there and tomorrow we'll get you home.\" she says. With that she turns the lamp off and goes to sleep.

That means that this class is none other than Mrs. Tavi\u2019s. her predatory nature is well known and as such you have never been able to attend a parent teacher conference for fear of being eaten. You start to panic and run towards the door hoping to make it out before Mrs. Tavi arrives.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When did this happen?\" \"Not too long ago...\" Sapphire admits. \"Ms. Tavi gave her something that upset her!\" Onyx calls out from besides Sapphire. \"What!?\" Maggie stutters dumbfounded by the news. \"Just wait til I call the school.\" Maggie growls, enraged by the idea of such student mistreatment. \"I'll show them just what happens when they mess with my daughter!\"  \"I-It could've been anything!\" Sapphire reiterates while scowling at Onyx. \"Besides, I was thinking about going to the nurse to find out what's..Oghhh..w-wrong.\" \"Well you do that Sapphire.\" Maggie insists. \"There's a lot of things that can cause stomach aches. Like spoiled food or...\" </span></div></div>",

As far as you know all the teachers in Nightmare High are women and most of them are titanic even for monsters. As you think the situation over, you see Ms. Tavi entering the classroom and let out a sigh of relief because the hydrus giantess didn't notice you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the other teachers, the first one who came to mind was Ms. Khamen, the mummy history teacher. She was the friendliest teacher in the school which was saying something. Mummies weren't usually pleasant around humans and they all knew how to use magic that was often used for evil spells. But Ms. Khamen was harmless to humans. You even heard a rumor she used to be a queen when she was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the Ziz, Mrs. Kippelstein. That weird bird wasn't exactly mentally stable. She was basically a giant ostrich version of Woody Allen in terms of personality. However, she was one of the good teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Ms. Howler, the art teacher. She was a huge werewolf that came from a large family. Usually werewolves are highly predatory, but Ms. Howler considers humans to be the worst tasting, foulest snack in the monster world and would rather starve than eat one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was also the most annoying teacher in the school, Uma D. Kay. Ms. Kay was the home etc. teacher and a giant obese zombie that looked like a combination of Ghoulia Yelps and a Boomer. Uma had a bad habit of flirting with you to the point where she did it in front of Maggie. One time she had the nerve to ask if you were going to divorce her anytime soon. If she weren't already dead, she'd have a death wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were some bad teachers in the school other than Ms. Tavi. First was Mrs. Keys, a gryphon science teacher and borderline mad scientist. The other was Ms. Hugo, a dragon/snail hybrid who worked as the gym teacher. She hated you and Sapphire because your sister Meryl married Flint, the guy Ms. Hugo had her eye on but never had the courage to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel tremors and then see one of the teachers coming. But who is it?</span></div></div>",

Then you grunt and have to hold on as Sapphire takes her seat and puts her backpack at the side of her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out to see monster students of all species. You see a nerdy looking and flat chested succubus girl with a pair of swirled glasses like the kind you'd see in an anime, sitting next to Sapphire. She was Lee's daughter Donna Gin. Looking at the girl you fine it hard to believe that she's a succubus or her mother's daughter. You turn and see a kappa jock staring at Sapphire and flexing one of his muscles. Sapphire just lets out a hiss and shows the kid her claws. \"Good girl, Sapphire.\" You say to yourself. You didn't like it when monster boys looked at your not so little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you turn and see your rag doll niece, Emerald, sitting next to and appearing to be smiling at another boy. This one appears to be were owl boy who appeared to be flirting with her. You're definitely going to be telling Meryl about that when you got home. You manage to unzip yourself from the backpack and climb out. It looks like everyone's eyes were on the chalkboard. Then you realize something. You didn't know whose class this was. You were nervous at the thought of running into the giantess in charge of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opens up and you see a pair of thunder thighs, no, make that hurricane hips, walk in. They were bright gold colored wrappings around them and that prompts you to look further up to see a large gauze covered stomach that revealed tan Egyptian skin in some of the gaps in the wrappings. Further up you see a chubby face with more gauze covering only the nose and long black hair that looked almost blue. The mummy giantess was wearing nothing more than a black shirt and red jacket and on her arms were tattoos that resembled hieroglyphics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief as the teacher entered the room. You knew this one. Her name was Taleela Khamen, legally changed from Talealakamen. She was the friendliest teacher in the school and thankfully, she forbade monsters from eating humans in her class. Taleela taught history, because what better teacher for history than a woman who was thousands of years old. There was a rumor that before Taleela was mummified, she was the queen of Egypt. Why would someone who used to rule, work for a school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaleela closed the door and put her books down on her desk. \"Morning and bienvenue class,\" said Taleela. \"Today we'll be continuing our study on the Werewolf-Vampire War of 1712. And just to be frank, I don't want anything you learn in class today mentioned to Ms. Howler. That goes for you too Ms. Cain.\" By this, Taleela was talking to a vampiress in the corner of the room who merely lets out a hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ms. Khamen was writing on the board and Sapphire was taking notes, you realized you needed to get someone's attention to get out of here. But who's?</span></div></div>",

(Emerald is a few seats over, leaving plenty of time for you to get snatched up and eaten by one of her classmates before she even sees you; Taleela seemed so caught up in her lecture she likely wouldn't even see you at all.) With a grunt of effort, you leap back onto Sapphire's backpack and start to climb, starting at the mesh bottle-holder on the side...and you have quite a way to go--at your size and speed, it'll take the better part of an hour to reach the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strain on your limbs isn't helping, either. You just <i>knew</i> you were gonna pull something after this...dammit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your climb, your attention starts to drift to Miss Khaman's lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last class,we left off just as the War started...can anyone tell me--whithout looking at their notes--where and when that was?\" Miss Khaman opens.<br>\r\nA few students groan when she forbids them from checking their notes, but your daughter isn't one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see Sapphire raising her hand. \"July 8th, 1712? Between...Lycanthropolis and Vladistan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on the money both times, Sapphire; good work.\"<br>\r\nDespite the strain of climbing--by now you'd just passed the drink-holder--you smile at Miss Khaman's praise for your daughter. Darn right she'd get it on the first try, with her near-constant studying. You wondered why she was so worried about her grades. Just how nasty WAS that Mikki Tavi...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway up...goddammit, your arms hurt! And your grip wasn't the firmest, either--the backpack wasn't exactly a nice, hard climbing wall with lots of easy grips. And you weren't <i>quite</i> as spry as you were at Sapphire's age, as much as you tried to keep in shape.<br>\r\nYeah, you were <i>definietly</i> gonna need an asprin after this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...first stage of the war went to Lycanthropis, since the werewolf city-state had already been on a war footing; putting down insurrections in its coastal territory just a few years before,\" Miss Khamen went on, the squeaks and grinds of her chalk on the blackboard. \"Their initial push from the east in July and August claimed large swaths of Vampire land, including some small silver mines, cutting through the Vampires' supply of one of their major weaknesses. Unfortunately for the Werewolves, this sort of blitz stretched their supply lines quite thin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop to catch your breath, almost within reach of the top of the backpack...<br>\r\nWell, you actually stopped a short while ago, but got caught up in the history lesson. As much as you mentally kick yourself for that, this was pretty interesting. Maybe you should talk to Maggie about upgrading the cable to get the historical channels? Or at least hit the library sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiling that thought away, you pull yourself over some more folds and wrinkles before you finally, FINALLY reach top of Sapphire's backpack!<br>\r\n...You'd cheer if you weren't so whupped. On the plus side, you'd probably made up for all the times you'd missed working out in the past, oh; six months? Well, time to do what you came here for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another grunt of effort, you stand up and start waving your arms around. \"Sapphire! Down here! It's your father!!\" You shout. \"I fell in your backpack! Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour daughter is busy taking notes, but the classroom is quiet save for Miss Khaman's lesson. Will Sapphire notice you...?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was in a good mood. \"Oh,\" says Maggie. \"Una and Pauline are in town and they've got quite a surprise for you both.\" Sapphire gives a blink. \"Una and Pauline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie was referring to two of her cousins. Una was a Nemean lioness witch doctor who lived all the way in Direopolis. You knew her well because the last time she was in town, she gave Fiona a voodoo doll of her ex-husband as a birthday present. If only Fiona wasn't too nice to use it to her advantage. As for Pauline, she was a bright black-furred Nemean lioness who lived in Screamtown and ran a restaurant called Narnia that specialized in gourmet food. Last time you heard, she had a human boyfriend who came from a family of literal harpies. You didn't mind those two. They both lived in towns where it was illegal for monsters to eat humans. You just hope they remembered to wear clothing. After all, even though they had fur to hide it, it was still not a good thing for Sapphire to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do your cousins want?\" Maggie gives a giggle. \"They've invited us to see a magic show.\" Suddenly, Sapphire's jaw drops and she gives an excited look. \"Magic show?\" she asks with a huge smile on her face. Maggie nods her head. \"The Amazing Great Lakeinski is in town and Una and Pauline bought tickets to the show tomorrow night.\" \"That's amazing.\" You say. You loved a good magic show. The last time you saw one was when Sapphire turned 10 years old. This was going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie parks the car outside of the house and outside waiting for the both of you is none other than...</span></div></div>",

Her ear sometimes flicks to the side and she occasionally looks up from her notebook...but never towards you. Scowling at your bad luck, you slump back down onto the backpack and try to think of another option. Every moment you spent out here in the open, away from Sapphire's attention, was another you could end up as lunch for some random monster, or even flattened without being seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to find some other way of getting her attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Sapphire was diligent--her eyes barely left her notebook except to look up at the blackboard.<br>\r\nWait...that was it! If you could get onto Sapphire's desk or notebook, she'd be bound to see you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd mean YET ANOTHER grueling climb, but it was worth the strain. You'd already come this far, after all.

The whole business set off \"Inappropriate Alarms\" in your head, not to mention you were in public.

She was the nicest of the teachers in the school and you probably shouldn't bother Sapphire or Emerald in class. Teenagers can't afford any more distractions as it is. You quickly dash by, making absolutely sure none of the students saw you. While Taleela forbade eating humans in class, you didn't want to take any caches because several of the students belonged to highly carnivorous species. At one point you have to duck and hide before a slightly chubby zebra striped pegasus goth girl nearly spots you. You notice she has unusually sharp teeth for a horse, which makes you nervous. Once you're sure the pegasus girl can't see you, you continue to run towards Ms. Khamen as she continues to speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This blitz left the werewolves vulnerable to a new attack and as such, Vampire General Syrnge came up with the idea to utilize dire bats holding firecrackers to catch the werewolves by surprise so that the vampires could get around the wolves while they were distracted.\" However, the vampires had another enemy for the werewolves had heard of a creature wandering the countryside. An artificial monster, one that they decided to recreate at the scale of a real monster. Can anybody tell me what this creature was? Yes, Sapphire.\" \"That would be the original Frankenstein's monster, the progenitor of the method used to create the Franken race.\" \"Very good, Sapphire. Back in those days, Frankensteins were bitter enemies of vampires. Frankenstein Duo became the first giant Frankenstein to exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the obese mummy woman is writing on the board, you run forward and then you look up to see Taleela's huge gauze covered behind right above you. It wasn't as big as Maggie's but it was pretty close. You look down in embarrassment as to avoid staring. You then see a loose bandage reaching down from Taleela's waist in between her butt cheeks and as Taleela is distracted, this gauze hangs down and loose. You nod your head and then grab hold and begin to climb up the gauze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You press your legs at the back of Taleela's calves and continue to climb through her long black hair as you climb up the mummy's huge ass and up her back. You of course have to be careful. Taleela's back has a surprising number of folds. \"How can somebody who's been dead and dried up for so many millenniums have so much back fat?\" You wonder to yourself. You also couldn't believe Taleela didn't notice you. Was she that much in teacher mode or was she just numb from being a dried up corpse for thousands of years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there....</span></div></div>",

You grumble as you're caught in the gauze, but the more you struggle the worse it gets util you're tied up yourself and let out muffled shouts. Now, only your eyes were visible and from the point where you are, you can see that you\u2019re stuck to Ms. Khamen\u2019s left butt cheek. You give a groan at your position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only rear you could tolerate being trapped under was Maggie\u2019s. She\u2019s sat on you more times than you can count during your 20 year marriage so you have experience being buried under monster girl booty, but Taleela\u2019s butt was different from Maggie\u2019s as there was no fur anywhere. Also, it was somehow squishy and stiff at the same time due to Taleela\u2019s dry mummified skin. You wonder to yourself how it\u2019s even possible for a mummy to be so fat. For the most part, Taleela\u2019s butt was almost as big as Maggie\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn\u2019t long until the school breaks for lunch and Taleela retreats to the teacher\u2019s lounge. You struggle and try to shake your way out of the bindings and even pound on Taleela\u2019s fat ass but she doesn\u2019t feel a thing and you\u2019re no closer to getting free. Taleela at the moment was at a water cooler when you spot Mrs. Keys walking by and gasp. Taleela walked out of the way and saw that the griffin was grumpy. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Ophelia?\u201d \u201cSome thief stole the box of humans I needed for my science class tomorrow. Now I have to reschedule everything.\u201d You begin to sweat. You seriously don\u2019t want to know what Mrs. Keys had in mind for those humans. Taleela gives a look of horror and disgust. \u201cYou are very crude, Ophelia.\u201d Ophelia just gives a scoff and waddles away. You give a sigh of relief that Mrs. Keys didn\u2019t see you. It was going to be a long day. Maggie was going to be really worried later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u2028\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the school day is over, Taleela walks up to her car with you still stuck to her butt. Taleela\u2019s car was a bright red colored sports car with a hood ornament of the Egyptian goddess Bastet on the front and six wheels. Taleela sits down right on top of you as you grunt and are forced between her butt cheeks, further trapping you in the gauze. This was going to take a while to explain to Maggie. Taleela let out a mutter as she started the car. \u201cI think I need to replace the seat cushion soon. It\u2019s starting to get lumpy.\u201d You grumble as you try to chew through the gauze and at least free your mouth. You immediately regret your decision as your mouth is burning. \u201cWhen was the last time Taleela changed her bandages?\u201d you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaleela soon arrives at her house and gets out of the car. You look and see that Taleela\u2019s house is actually a large blue pyramid and there appears to be a pool in the back with gold statues of the Egyptian gods decorating the back yard. Taleela walks up to the door and unlocks it before coming in. You look in surprise at the interior of Taleela\u2019s pyramid. From the looks of it, it appears to be a crypt of some kind and there are hieroglyphs on the wall. You see one that depicts Taleela when she was alive. She was still heavy back then but was dressed in regal attire. You turn your eyes and then you see what appears to be a golden throne in front of the television. Of course, there was also a giant mummified cat sleeping on a cat bed nearby and that made you nervous. You had no idea Taleela had a cat. Must\u2019ve been her pet in life. You may have a thing for felines but you had no idea whether or not Taleela's cat was friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaleela also had an ankh hung on the wall and in the corner of the room was an enormous sarcophagus that was lined with a mattress. On the shelf there were 4 canopy jars that you guess held Taleela's organs. From the looks of it, Taleela's pyramid had a mix of ancient Egypt and new technology as it clearly had electricity and running water. Taleela walks to the corner and hangs up her jacket. As she does so, you see that near the coat hanger is a dummy head wearing an Egyptian bejeweled headdress of some sort. Perhaps the theory of Taleela being a queen in life had some leverage to it. But why would somebody who was a queen before she died apply for a teaching job in a high school upon resurrection?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think about that, you remember you're stuck in between the mummy's butt cheeks and at that moment, Taleela was heading to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you try to zip out of Sapphire's backpack you see your daughter walking into a classroom, however, you didn't know where she was going. You saw that both Ruby and Topaz were walking by her sides and Emerald. When Sapphire arrives in the classroom, you see that she hangs her backpack on a rack as do all the other students. You let out a grunt and take a look around. From the looks of it, besides Sapphire and her friends, there were 12 students in the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to take a quick look at the students before descending. In the first row there were three students, first was one you recognized, Donna Gin. Donna was the daughter of your customer, Lee the succubus. Lee had light gray skin and blue hair like her mother except she was much skinnier than Lee, had smaller horns and a flat chest. She even worn glasses with swirl designs on them. You'd never tell it to Lee, but Donna was so homely that you couldn't believe she was a succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Lee was a cobalt skinned European dragon boy who looked like one of the jocks. He had a scar on his face and was staring at Topaz who waved at him. You're guessing that was Topaz's boyfriend. A Chinese dragon dating a European dragon. That's not something you see everyday. Also in the third row was a scarlet feathered hippogriff with the legs of a zebra wearing a pair of glasses who you also recognized. That was Grevy Keys, the science teacher's son. You don't know if he's like his mother and you sure don't want to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second row had five students, the first of which you also recognized, she was a lavender furred hue, a monster resembling a baboon with tiger limbs and a snake for a tail. That Nue was Glinda Osbourne. She was a rival student of Sapphire's that she couldn't stand. To the side of Glinda was a fat pure white glowing furred hellhound girl with five pairs of eyes running down to her skull-like snout. She was dressed like a delinquent and you make note to steer clear of that one. Next to her was a green skinned and slightly overweight looking werelizard boy who looked like a mix between a frilled lizard and an otaku and next to him was a vermillion skinned mock turtle punk girl with multiple piercings in her face. You hope to high heaven that Sapphire stood clear of her. Next to the mock turtle girl was one monster guy that you immediately glare at. He was an indigo skinned tengu who appeared to be dressed as a greaser, complete with a pompadour and jacket. He quickly put out a cigarette (which weren't allowed in school) as he smiled at Sapphire. You grit your teeth as you look at that tengu boy. He's not getting your daughter without a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the four students in the third row. There was an orange were crocodile girl with yellow stripes. She looked like a Goth girl and had a patch over one of her eyes for some reason. Next to the crocodile girl was an aqua skinned werecrab boy in a hood. He looked a lot like an emo. Next to him was a magenta furred drop bear girl, a monster resembling an obese carnivorous koala bear with a white main on her shoulders. She was holding hands with a crimson skinned python boy, a dragon resembling an actual python but with three eyes and six arms that doubled as legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slide down from the string on Sapphire's backpack, you look to see that the alleged classroom looks more like a a kitchen of some kind. \"Oh no.\" You groan. To confirm your suspicions, into the room walked the teacher. Her name was Uma D. Kay, she was a giant blue skinned boomer whose fashion sense and beehive hairstyle were stuck in the 1950s. You'd even wager a guess that that was when she died. Uma was the home etc. teacher, which explained the kitchen setup. But you wished you weren't in that sumo zombie's class because Uma had a crush on you so much that she asked you if you were planning to divorce Maggie and try your hand at a new girl, <i>right in front of Maggie</i>. You swear that if that woman weren't already dead, she'd have a death wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up into the classroom just as class begins. \"Good morning class.\" Says Uma. \"Good morning, Ms. Kay.\" Uma gives a smile that reveals a hole in her cheek, exposing her molars. \"Alright class. Today, I'll be splitting you up in teams of two. You gulp. Oh no. Who was she going to team Sapphire up with. \"Team one,\" says Uma. \"Topaz River and George Knight.\" Topaz walked up to her European dragon boyfriend as they both breathed out heart shaped flames. \"Team two, Ruby Welker and Donna Gin.\" Donna and Ruby walked together. \"Team three, Melissa Tortellini and Gou Jojima.\" The mock turtle punk and the frilled were lizard otaku boy teamed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma had to take out one of her eyeballs and wipe it off before she announced the remaining teams. \"Team four, Grevy Keys and Glinda Osbourne.\" Grevy flew up to Glinda and Glinda turned her head in disgust. Oblivious she didn't think much of Grevy. \"Team five, Helene Guinness and Eugene Brown.\" Helene, the delinquent hellhound girl walked up to the emo were crab who just said \"Whatever\". \"Team six, Emerald Morpheus and Joan Elton.\" Emerald walked up to the goth crocodile girl. \"Team seven, Sydney Osgood and Monty Cleese.\" The drop bear girl and her python boyfriend both smiled to each other. But then you realized something and gasped. That left only Sapphire and... \"Team eight, Sapphire Reaver and Keppei Suwabe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally scream as Sapphire is paired with that tengu greaser. He was obviously bad news and he seemed too happy to be paired with your daughter. You wish you could just strangle him, if you were a few hundred feet bigger. But it doesn't matter because class was in session. \"Alright class, I hope you studied since last class because today, we're going to be preparing one of my favorite dishes but also one of the hardest to cook. Vegetable devil lamb, right brain.\" To emphasize this, Uma hands each team the left half of some kind of strange green brain that had some algae growing on it. \"Remember class, this is a special preparation ingredient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll sixteen students including your daughter and niece turn on the stoves and prepare to cook as Uma walks around the class. You know you should be escaping but as you see Sapphire with Keppei you couldn't stand the fact that your own daughter was assigned as a partner to such an obvious creep. You were going to give him a piece of your mind and walk towards your daughter's station, safety be darned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut do you reach Sapphire...</span></div></div>",

You try to call out to her, but she can't hear you. Deciding to persevere you climb the remaining books and reach the top of the bag. When you get to the opening you climb out and end up tumbling down to the floor. When you pick yourself up you are promptly knocked back down by the ground rumbling. A pair of paws passes right by you and you look up to see who its is. You are met with a pair of underwear on a gigantic ass under a black skirt. Attached to the furry ass is the upper body of a bird. Its a gryphon, which means it must be Ophelia Keys, the science teacher. You get nervous and back up toward the feet of your daughter. Ophelia is one of the more dangerous teachers in the school. She's like a mad scientist and you've heard she's not too kind to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head closer to Sapphire Ophelia stops by her desk. You hear them talking and then Ophelia praises her. Science is Sapphire's best subject, so it makes sense the teacher would like her. Maybe she's only mean to humans. You ignore the chatter above and reach your daughter's foot. You take a breath and jump on in an attempt to get her attention. Unfortunately you fail and after a couple minutes of trying you tire out. While you rest she gets up and starts walking, making you hold on for dear life. You see that she's headed for the blackboard to write something for the class. While she does this you relax a little and catch your breath. Soon however Sapphire finishes and begins walking back to her desk. The motion launches you off of her foot and under a nearby desk. When the desk's owner returns you gulp when you see its Ophelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon sits down and begins going through some papers as the class works. You stand at her feet in fear, hoping she won't find you.  One paw comes forward and lands on top of you. She rolls you around like a ball of lint and eventually traps you between her toes. You try to break free but its no use. You're helpless as she plays with you like an insignificant little toy. Its not so bad at first, but as class goes on your body begins to ache. Not to mention her toes are starting to sweat a little and coat your body in it. When the bell rings you hear the students getting up, as does Ophelia. When she walks away from her desk she unclenches her toes and you spring free. With a gasp of air you run toward Sapphire, who is just leaving. You curse your luck at having just missed her, but someone else sees you. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

As she walks out of the classroom you see that she's got an hourglass body with curly red hair and freckles. She's also wearing a green shirt with a matching skirt. \"Um, excuse me.\" you call up to her. She looks down at you and smiles. \"Hey little guy. I was wondering if you were gonna speak up.\" she says. You notice she's got a thick Irish accent. \"Uh, forgive me for asking but what kind of monster are you?\" you ask. The girl laughs and pats your head. \"I'm a leprechaun.\" she says. \"My name's Goldie.\" Getting past that you remember that you need to find your daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now its my turn to ask questions.\" Goldie says before you can say anything. \"Who are you?\" You stand up in her hand and introduce yourself. \"My name is Neil Reaver. My daughter is a student here and I kind of got stuck in her bag. We got separated and I'm trying to find her.\" you explain. \"Whoa whoa, wait. You're a human and you have a monster for a daughter?\" she says. \"Well, it was sort of a miracle,.\" you tell her. \"Wow you're a lucky guy all right.\" Goldie tells you. \"More than you know, if you hadn't come at the right time I might have been Ms. Keys new test subject.\" you say. Goldie chuckles. \"Well I'm glad to help.\" You get back to the matter at hand and ask for her help. \"Do you think you could help me find my daughter?\" you ask. You're unsure of the teachers, so Goldie is your best bet. \"Sure, but after class. I can't be late.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Goldie sits through her class you find yourself extremely bored. It reminds you of why you're glad you're done with high school. While the teacher drones on you're in Goldie's bag. When the lesson ends she takes you out and begins searching for your daughter. \"So do you have a pot of gold?\" you ask her. \"Yes actually. Everyone in my family has their own.\" she answers. \"So if I catch you then you have to give it to me?\" you joke. The giant leprechaun leans her face in close and gives you a stare. \"Do you think you can manage to capture me?\" she asks in a mock threatening tone. \"Okay, point taken.\" you say with a laugh. \"I think I'm to old to be trying to catch a young girl like you anyway.\" Its at that moment the bell rings for the end of the day. \"Shoot! I need to get to work!\" Goldie says. She looks down at you in her palm guiltily. \"I'd feel a little bad if I didn't help you after I said I would.\" she tells you.

Sapphire says she's nice, but that might only be because she hasn't done anything to get sent to her office. \"Um, I'm not too sure about that.\" you say. \"A lot of the staff here don't really think much of humans.\" Goldie sighs and looks away for a second. \"I'm really sorry, but I can't be late for work.\" Then she looks back at you with an idea. \"I know, if you're scared of staying here I can just take you to work and we can call your family from there.\" That sounds good, you can just get Maggie to pick you up from Goldie's job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you're on the dashboard of Goldie's car as she drives to work. \"So where do you work?\" you ask. \"Oh just a little shoe shop.\" she answers. \"How well does the store do? Most of the monsters I know don't even wear shoes.\" you say. \"Well its a small shop, and we get by. Monsters like vampires and succubi wear shoes, and us leprechauns of course.\" she explains. As she says this she pulls into a parking lot near a chain of stores. She picks you up and gets out, heading for a store between two others. Upon entering you see aisles filled with shoes. Pretty impressive for such a small shop. \"Okay, lets get you straightened out before I get any customers.\" Goldie says. She takes you to the back and picks up the phone. You give her Maggie's number and the call is made. Goldie explains everything and then hangs up. \"Okay your wife said she'll be down to pick you up in about an hour. Until then just chill for a while.\" she says. \"Thanks Goldie.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Goldie is sorting shoes while you watch. You notice that every so often she opens a box and cleans a pair. \"Are you a neat freak?\" you ask. Goldie looks slightly embarrassed before answering. \"Kind of. Its a leprechaun thing. Whenever I see dirty shoes I can't help but clean them.\" she tells you. \"Is that why you work in a shoe store?\" you ask. \"No thats a coincidence.\" she says. \"I just had to get a job somewhere because I'm too young to work in my family's pub.\" She continues to work as you ask more questions. \"Whats your boss like?\" you ask. \"She's an elf, and she's really nice. She actually made some of the shoes we sell.\" Goldie says. This goes on until...</span></div></div>",

She goes back to sorting the inventory as her boss walks closer. She doesn't notice you on the floor where Goldie is crouching and you have to dodge her giant feet. You quickly dive out of the way of her shoes and land on your stomach. You gaze upward at the woman standing next to Goldie. Its remarkable just how much they look like humans. \"So how are things with you?\" the woman asks. \"Well at school today  found a human. He got lost looking for his daughter who, weird enough, is a monster.\" Goldie says. \"Did you help him find her?\" her boss asks. \"No actually, so I brought him...\" Goldie starts before dropping the shoes she's holding. She then frantically searches the floor until she finds you. \"Geez! I thought I lost you Mr. Reaver!\" she says relieved. \"Don't worry. I had to dodge some shoes but I'm fine.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh did I almost step on you?\" Goldie's boss says as she bends down to pick you up. \"Its nothing I'm not used to.\" you tell her. Goldie meanwhile is cleaning off the shoes she dropped. \"Well my name is Cordelia, and I'm sorry for almost crushing you.\" she says. \"No problem.\" you say. At that moment the bell on the front door rings and Goldie gets up to greet the customer. \"While she's helping them I guess I'll watch you.\" Cordelia says. The two of you head to the back while Goldie deals with the customer. \"So why are you here with Goldie?\" she asks. \"She helped me out when I got lost in the school and now I'm just waiting for my wife to pick me up.\" you explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you and Cordelia chat she sets you on a table while she starts to go through some stock. You get a good look at her round bottom as she does so. \"So did you really make some of these shoes?\" you ask. \"Yes, its sort of a hobby of mine.\" she says. \"Some of my work is out there with the rest of the inventory, but I also get some special requests.\" She's now going over some paperwork but still keeps an eye on you. \"So you must be pretty good for them to want you personally.\" you say. Cordelia blushes and sits down at the table. \"Oh no, I'm nothing special really.\" she says. \"I'm kind of nervous about my work, thats why I can only make shoes at night.\" The two of you continue to talk until... </span></div></div>",

Soon Goldie comes back and comes over to pick you up. \"Your wife is here, Mr. Reaver.\" she says. You hop into her hand and she carries you to the front. Cordelia follows, wanting to see your wife. When you get there Maggie snatches you up and gives you a big wet kiss. \"How in the world did you end up here?\" she asks. \"Well, I guess one thing just led to another.\" you tell her. Maggie rolls her eyes and looks at Goldie and Cordelia. \"Thank you so much for taking care of my husband. He's got a habit of ending up in strange places.\" she says. \"Don't mention it.\" Goldie says. \"I must admit though, I didn't expect his wife to be the sheriff. Who would have though such a small guy would be married to one of the biggest monsters.\" Cordelia says. Maggie and you both look at each other and chuckle. \"We get that a lot.\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I should get this little troublemaker home.\" Maggie says and turns to leave. \"Wait!\" Cordelia says. \"Actually I'd like to know if you would want a pair of shoes. I've never made them for a human, so I think it would be a challenge.\" You think for a second and agree. \"Sure, I kind of want to see your work.\" you tell her. \"Okay, but don't expect anything too great.\" she says humbly. Goldie butts in and rolls her eyes. \"Don't listen to her, she's awesome!\" she says. You and Maggie exit the store while Cordelia blushes and tries to quiet Goldie. \"Just come tomorrow and they'll be done!\" Cordelia calls out before you go. \"Well did you enjoy your little adventure?\" Maggie asks with a smirk. \"Hey, its not like I did it on purpose.\" you counter. She lifts you up for a kiss and then gets in the car. When you're secure she drives home. \"At least I get a free pair of shoes.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you head to the shop to pick up your shoes. Maggie drives while Sapphire holds you in the passenger seat. When you arrive you all head inside and see Goldie. \"Oh hey Mr. Reaver.\" she says. Cordelia comes from the back and sees you as well. \"Oh! I'll go get your shoes now.\" she says and walks away. While she's gone Sapphire and Goldie start talking. \"So you're the elusive daughter huh?\" Goldie says. \"Your dad went through a lot looking for you.\" Sapphire laughs a little. \"Yeah...well thank you for helping him.\" Sapphire responds. \"Is that your car out there? I wish I had one.\" she tells Goldie. The two of them get better acquainted while you wait for Cordelia. What next?</span></div></div>",

The two girls start to bond when Cordelia comes out with your shoes. \"Here they are!\" she announces. They look great and fit perfectly. \"I think this may be the best pair I've ever had!\" you tell her. She blushes and waves you off. \"Please they're nothing really.\" she says. After some small talk you and your family leave. Before you go however Sapphire speaks to Goldie. \"So would you like to come over to our house this weekend?' she asks. \"Yeah that would be great.\" Goldie answers. Then an idea hits your daughter. \"Oh I know! I'll invite my other friends so you can meet them too! We'll even have a sleepover!\" Then she looks at you and Maggie with big kitty cat eyes. The two of her tell her its okay, and she tells Goldie to come over on Friday. When the three of you are in the car Sapphire gives Maggie a hug and you a kiss. \"Thank guys! This is gonna be great!\" she says. \"I think Goldie will be a good friend dear.\" Maggie tells her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday night arrives and the doorbell rings. Sapphire answers and finds Onyx at the door. \"Looks like you're the first one here!\" Sapphire tells her. The lioness girl enters and soon the rest of the guests arrive. One by one they enter, until finally everyone's there. When Maggie comes out of the kitchen with you in hand she gets their attention. \"Okay girls, we'll stay out of your hair, so have fun!\" Maggie says. \"Yeah, and just make sure you all watch where you step.\" you add. \"Okay, thanks guys!\" Sapphire says as you and Maggie leave the room. Once they're alone the girls all relax, plopping onto the couch and floor. They put a movie on and begin talking. \"So this is Goldie guys.\" Sapphire says, introducing her newest friend. \"She helped my dad out the other day.\" Everyone introduces themselves and hit it off pretty well. Pearl walks up to her and looks her over. \"You said you're a leprechaun right?\" she asks. \"Uh, yeah.\" Goldie answers. Pearl looks up and notes the height difference. One of her eyes twitches for a moment and she gets an angry look, but then takes a breath and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile watching the movie the girls continue getting to know Goldie. \"So do you really have a pot of gold?\" Onyx asks her. Goldie laughs and rolls her eyes before answering. \"I get that question a lot, but yes. Everyone in my family has their own pot of gold.\" she says. \"Ruby leans forward. \"So how does that work?\" she asks. Her two heads each say part of the sentence. \"Well, I got mine when I was about thirteen. My mom said I had to make sure I keep it safe, and it was tradition.\" Goldie says. \"Do you keep it at the end of a rainbow?\" Pearl asks. \"Not exactly.\" the leprechaun tells her and leaves it at that.

Originally created by RedHurricane)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Neil Morpheus Reaver, a human living in the monster town of Dreadberry. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve adapted well to the situation and even married a monster native of the town. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been living in Dreadberry for twenty years, but you still get into trouble as with every human who chooses to live in the monster world. Then again, a lot can happen when you live in the monster equivalence of the sticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFamily Members<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Maggie Reaver<br>\r\nSpecies: Nemean Lion<br>\r\nHeight: 1000ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An obese white furred humanoid lioness with light blonde hair and bright green eyes. Mainly wears a green unitard. Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin and fur is as hard as steel, not even a nuke could wound her.<br>\r\nDescription: Maggie is your wife. Even though lion based monsters prey on humans, Maggie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a mean bone in her body and while she has a big appetite, humans are the one thing that she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat. Though she can be ferociously protective of both you and Sapphire and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afraid to roar. Maggie is also Dreadberry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sheriff and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever had, which makes you feel extremely safe with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sapphire Reaver<br>\r\nSpecies: Mer-Lion<br>\r\nHeight: 900ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A heavyset teenage lioness with cyan scaly skin of a fish, gills on her neck and long blue hair. Despite being half-human, she shares the same species with her great-grandmother and the only thing noticeably human about her is that she has your eyes. Body wise, she resembles a mer-lion version of her mom.<br>\r\nDescription: Sapphire is your and Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter that you somehow managed to sire. Despite being much bigger than you, Sapphire has never given you any trouble. In fact, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a model daughter who always tries to be as perfect as she can be. But because of this, she is usually stressed out over matters such as schoolwork. While Sapphire loves you, she is somewhat embarrassed by the fact that her father is so tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Cattleya Reaver<br>\r\nSpecies: Splintercat<br>\r\nHeight: 800ft<br>\r\nAppearance: Cattleya resembles a chubby, brown reddish furred lynx with a humanoid face and long brown hair with a white streaked ponytail. Being a Splintercat, Cattleya has a head as hard as a rock and the largest butt you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, even bigger than either of her daughters\u00e2\u0080\u0099.<br>\r\nDescription: Cattleya is Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother (Maggie gets her species from her late father you never met). While she loves her daughters and granddaughter, Cattleya is a horrible mother-in-law. The woman just plain hates humans, especially you because she thinks Maggie could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done better. As a result she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out to make your life a living nightmare. At one point she even tried to eat you, though she prefers to torture you by trying to crush you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Fiona Reaver<br>\r\nSpecies: Manticore<br>\r\nHeight: 1000ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant green skinned and purple haired monster resembling a lioness with a scorpion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail and three sets of sharp teeth. Fiona also has a pair of leather wings that are uncommon in her species. For clothing she wears a white tank top and black gym shorts. Ironically, she used to be very muscular, but ruined her body when she fell into depression and is even fatter than Maggie.<br>\r\nDescription: Fiona is Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s older sister and your sister-in-law. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not mean like Cattleya but you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy her visits because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always depressed. Fiona went through a nasty divorce years ago and is still upset about it. What makes her a problem is that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overly fond of you and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let the fact that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re married to her sister stop her from coming on to you. Ironically, Fiona works as a physical therapist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Meryl Morpheus<br>\r\nSpecies: Skeleton<br>\r\nHeight: 650ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A gigantic skeleton with burn marks on her skull resembling makeup but with her eyeballs in tact. She wears no clothes, but painted some of her bones purple. She appears to have long reddish brown hair, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a wig resembling her hair from when she was alive.<br>\r\nDescription: Meryl is your younger sister and one of your neighbors. She used to be a propane saleswoman but died in an explosion caused by her manager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s carelessness. However, she was buried in cursed ground and came back as a giant skeleton. Despite being undead, Meryl is still the same sister you knew when she was alive and always has your back. In fact, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one who introduced you to Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Flint Morpheus<br>\r\nSpecies: Golem<br>\r\nHeight: 650ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant slightly muscular red golem with beady eyes and no visible mouth. Looks as though he's made out of bricks Wears a blue shirt with an orange jacket, khaki pants and white socks with sandals.<br>\r\nDescription: Flint is Meryl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s husband and your brother in law. The golem rarely speaks but the two of you get along well what with him being one of the few male monsters in your life. Part of the reason you get along so well is that Flint is the only in-law you have that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause you trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Emerald Morpheus<br>\r\nSpecies: Ragdoll<br>\r\nHeight: 550ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A living green skinned patchwork doll with long blue hair, yellow eyes and a zipper on her mouth. Wears a patchwork dress with oversized black shoes and white mittens.<br>\r\nDescription: Emerald is Meryl and Flint\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter and your niece. Flint stitched her together while Meryl used a spell book to bring her to life since neither of them had reproductive organs. She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say much and you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember the last time she actually spoke. Emerald gets along well with Sapphire, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure what she thinks of her uncle being so small. She can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even wrap her head around the fact that her own mother used to be your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNeighbors<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Meagan Reynard<br>\r\nSpecies: Werefox<br>\r\nHeight: 660ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant fat red-orange furred fox with long dark hair and a beauty mark on her lower chin.

You broke up with her because she was too possessive of you and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still bitter that you dumped her and married Maggie. Meagan in fact hates you so much that she told you that if she ever saw you again, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d gobble you up on the spot. She even snapped her teeth in front of you to show how serious she was. Ever since you dumped her she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developed a taste for humans. She lives across the street from you and Maggie and glares at you whenever she sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sierra Cornwall<br>\r\nSpecies: Capricorn<br>\r\nHeight: 500ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A large monster resembling a furry white goat from the wait up, but with scaly purple legs of a fish from the waist down.

You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember the last time you saw her when she was sober and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know if she has a job. Sierra is in fact so drunk most of the time, that the milk in her udder permanently has alcohol in it. Since the spa you work at had a bar put in, you see her almost everyday. Much to Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annoyance, she tends to lock herself up in the jail cell after getting considerably drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Raven Dark<br>\r\nSpecies: Banshee<br>\r\nHeight: 695ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A pale skinned and voluptuous ghost woman wearing a Victorian era ballroom dress.

She moved in from Terrordale a few years back and you showed her around the neighborhood. Unfortunately Raven fell for you immediately and has been plotting to steal you from Maggie ever since.

Her only article of clothing is an ankh necklace.<br>\r\nDescription: Isis is a monster who was born in the human world and moved to Dreadberry. She never speaks to anybody so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what she thinks of humans. Usually everyone tries to avoid her because she never interacts with anyone. However, Isis has stared at you a few times and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why.

Thankfully she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a vegetarian and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind a human in the neighborhood. Summer is the least social monster you know after Isis and prefers not to get involved with anyone, though she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friendly enough with you. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the younger sister of Cree of Monster Gaol, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mad at her sister for marrying Aurelia, implying she might be prejudiced.

She sees the bright side of everything and unfortunately for you, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand that Cattleya and Meagan mean you harm. In short, Flora believes there is good in everyone and that everyone should get along. Flora is also neighbors with Summer and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to realize the latter isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly fond of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Lily Oxnard<br>\r\nSpecies: Minotaur<br>\r\nHeight: 800ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An enormous heavy set minotaur with bright red fur and hair as well as an udder even bigger than Sierra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Lily mainly wears a crimson jacket, beret and skirt and is usually seen smoking a cigarette.<br>\r\nDescription: Lily is one of Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closest friends, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also somewhat crazy. The woman is a conspiracy theorist who makes the most insane accusations and tend to use pseudonyms when talking to or signing anything for the government. She especially has trouble trusting certain species of monsters. You recently found out Lily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s husband Angus has been cheating on her but you have yet to tell anyone the bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Angus Oxnard<br>\r\nSpecies: Minotaur<br>\r\nHeight: 850ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A large muscular built black minotaur.

Of all Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends, Barbara Anne is the most friendly towards you. However, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also jealous of the fact that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only one between Maggie and her three closest friends who isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t married. You know for a fact that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bisexual and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been on dates with dozens of monsters, some of which she brings with her to meet Maggie. Too bad she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much too picky to decide on a mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Penny O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neil<br>\r\nSpecies: Wereseal<br>\r\nHeight: 850ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A titanic, blubbery and gray furred wereseal with blonde hair.

However, she is completely oblivious to humans and still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t figure out why Maggie married one. Too bad for you that Penny usually has her headphones on and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t usually notice you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re there. Penny is actually the first of the foursome to have been married but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never met her husband and you hear he never leaves the house. All you know for sure is Penny married outside of her species. Penny is also yours and Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other next door neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Prima Maston<br>\r\nSpecies: Woolly Mammoth<br>\r\nHeight: 1000ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A titanic mammoth, heavy in body shape with long white hair reaching down to her rear.

You mainly act as her assistant. Prima has a neutral attitude when it comes to humans and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that your species matters, but there are times when she can get stressed out due to you being her only employee and her business partner getting on her nerves. You find her species odd and wonder how a woolly mammoth counts as a monster but you dare not question it because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very touchy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Atlanta Scales<br>\r\nSpecies: Leviathan<br>\r\nHeight: 890ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A large hourglass shaped wingless dragon with webbed feet and hands, a long finned body like a fish and bright pink skin.

However, Atlanta thinks very little of humans and likes to refer to you as hers and Prima\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slave even though they pay you. Atlanta tends to treat you as little more than a slave in contrast to Prima who respects you as an employee and the two of them don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really get along well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Doz<br>\r\nSpecies: War Beast/Chimera<br>\r\nHeight: 850ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A strange creature resembling a mix between a wyvern and a Japanese hornet.<br>\r\nDescription: An addition from Ultimate Neo and the mother of his character Xyn of Monster Bedlam. She works as a bartender at the salon. Doz mistook it for a saloon because Atlanta made a mistake when she put up a help wanted poster and Prima decided to humor her. Doz is somewhat ditzy but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a cover for a serious personality when dealing with trouble. Doz also works as a manga artist under the pen name \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolly Baker\u00e2\u0080\u009d and her most famous manga is called Masked Hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ibuki Todoroki<br>\r\nSpecies: Baku<br>\r\nHeight: 560ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant monster resembling a tapir.

However, you consider her to be your least favorite customer. The woman always has her nose where it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t belong and is an incurable gossip. Another reason you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like her much is because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cattleya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best friend, although unlike Cattleya she isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t outright mean towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Moxie Axelrod<br>\r\nSpecies: Gremlin<br>\r\nHeight: 750ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An abnormally tall and voluptuous gremlin girl with red skin and long pale blonde hair. Mainly wears a pair of overalls with a striped shirt.\u00e2\u0080\u00a8Description: Moxie is a mechanic in town that comes in the salon on a regular basis because of the damage her work does to her nails. You know for a fact that Moxie is in a relationship with Lily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s husband Angus but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re keeping that information to yourself for now. After all, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to make the gremlin giantess mad at you, even if she is a home wrecker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Lee Gin<br>\r\nSpecies: Succubus<br>\r\nHeight: 680ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A gigantic and overweight succubus with gray skin and long light blue hair reaching down to her butt.

Mainly wears a skimpy leather bra with blue pants bearing bat designs<br>\r\nDescription: Lee is another regular at the spa you work at. Lee enjoys having power over tinier humans and whenever she shows up, you never know what she wants you to do. Though, given her job as a singer at a night club she shows up at least once a week. You heard that Lee used to be human but was impregnated with a baby succubus and her body was transmogrified to accommodate her giant offspring and the transformation made her personality a lot more demonic. Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter is currently the same age as Sapphire, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Irma Chillton<br>\r\nSpecies: Frost Giant<br>\r\nHeight: 600ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A light skinned frost giantess with long light blonde hair in a braided ponytail.

However, Irma is the absolute unluckiest person you know. Something bad is always happening to her and she gets injured on the job very easily. With the exception of Maggie and Jolene, everybody avoids her because of this very reputation as a jinx. As such, she always looks so sad when you see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jolene Piper<br>\r\nSpecies: Basilisk<br>\r\nHeight: 800ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A silver skinned monster resembling a female version of a cross between Godzilla and a snake.

However, she tends to rush in without thinking things through and Maggie has had to get her out of trouble time and time again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Prussia Kipling<br>\r\nSpecies: Weretiger<br>\r\nHeight: 1000ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An obese blue furred weretigress with long navy colored hair and purple stripes.

Her office is on the opposite side of the street as Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and the two of them don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get along well, somewhat rivals who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to work together unless they have to. While you are aware of her existence, Prussia has no idea that Maggie is married to a human and Maggie would prefer for you two not to meet because that tigress considers humans to be a delicacy and thinks Maggie is a fellow predator. Much to your frustration, because Prussia doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know Maggie is married, she has a secret crush on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Hailey Yorkshire<br>\r\nSpecies: Centicore<br>\r\nHeight: 750ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A monster resembling a black antelope with white diamond shaped spot and silver hair with long horns.

Whenever she calls Maggie, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually because something bad is happening. Maggie told you that Hailey outlived her human lover and has been in a bad mood ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSapphire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Friends<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ruby Welker<br>\r\nSpecies: Orthrus<br>\r\nHeight: 650ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A heavy set two-headed and gray furred werewolf who mainly dresses in Gothic clothing.

Ruby doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind that her best friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father is a human, but you find her difficult to talk to because of her two heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Topaz River<br>\r\nSpecies: Chinese Dragon<br>\r\nHeight: 900ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A yellow scaled Chinese dragoness with long black hair with green highlights. Mainly wears a green Chinese style dress.<br>\r\nDescription: Topaz is a transfer student who moved to Dreadberry with her parents years ago. Of all Sapphire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the calmest and wisest. But she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like being compared to western dragons who she considers to be barbaric.

However despite being friendly to other monsters, Onyx is highly predatory and your status as Sapphire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father is the only thing keeping her from eating you.

Because she isn't old enough to work at her family's pub, Goldie works at a shoe store under the employ of Cordelia, an elf giantess.

She has a mild attitude when it comes to the students, but you usually try to avoid her. Uma always asks Sapphire how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing and seems to have an unhealthy fascination with humans. What you find mostly annoying about Uma is the fact that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to respect that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re married as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s openly flirted with you, even directly in front of Maggie.

You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re afraid of what she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do to you if she saw you because you heard she was even worse towards humans than Mikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Aziza Kipplestein<br>\r\nSpecies: Ziz<br>\r\nHeight: 825ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An enormous red and orange feathered bird resembling an ostrich with the wings of an eagle that allow her to fly.

As far as teachers go, Aziza is somewhat absentminded and neurotic. Whenever she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caught by surprise, she has to panic. According to Atlanta, this is because Aziza is an old friend of hers and she was always caught between the arguments of Atlanta and a behemoth acquaintance of there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Aziza is harmless to humans though and is actually quite friendly towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Colleen Howler<br>\r\nSpecies: Werewolf<br>\r\nHeight: 760ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A large and fat red and white furred werewolf resembling a collie.

Because of this, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually the most harmless teacher in the school towards you and most of the time doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anything to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Nellie Hugo<br>\r\nSpecies: Carcolh<br>\r\nHeight: 850ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant bright red snail with a dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, a white underbelly and a giant shell on her back covered in spikes.

Nellie is hard and often cruel to your daughter which you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appreciate, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re afraid of what the dragon slug would do if she got her hands on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Morgan Wayne<br>\r\nSpecies: Mutated Werebat<br>\r\nHeight: 1700ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An abnormally large monster resembling a fruit bat with long purple-red hair and purple fur.

Because of her massive size, Morgan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office is underneath Nightmare HIgh. Thankfully Morgan only eats fruit, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not above using her towering height to be frightening and students and staff alike are utterly terrified of her. Despite her intimidating appearance, Sapphire has assured you Morgan isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean. Though this may be because Sapphire has never done anything to warrant the werebat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Fang Grunewald (Formerly Reaver)<br>\r\nSpecies: Saber-Tooth Tiger<br>\r\nHeight: 765ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant and skinny saber-toothed tiger with dark brown fur and long fangs.
