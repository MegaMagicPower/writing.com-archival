Instead, you spent your time reading the legends of great knights who charged into battle and slaughtered hundreds of monster girls. When you turned 18, you purchased your first sword and shield. It\u2019s been a year since then, and today, on your 19th birthday, you feel ready to set off on your quest. The only question is, where do you go from here? You could cut through the forest to the city of Galdaran and gather information there, but there have been reports of monster girls ambushing travelers on the road. Alternatively, you can travel into the mountain caves, in which you\u2019ve heard tales of magical artifacts guarded by fierce monster girls. Such artifacts should prove invaluable in your quest, but you doubt the monster girls would yield so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite the warnings of monster girl activity in the forest, you were confident that you should be able to handle yourself, and you were in fact eager to test yourself.  What better way than to try and deal with these brigands before making it to the city.  If you were lucky, you should even have a tale or two to tell for when you get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest itself was as grim and dark as the local tales suggested, and despite your earlier bravado, you felt your courage waning a bit as you stare into it's dark depths.  Still, your determination ultimately won out as the thought of turning back like a coward at the first sign of trouble helped stoke the flames of your bravery enough to step forward into the dark.  Thankfully the sun was high in the sky, casting decent light even within the darkness of the woods, and the road itself was still reasonably visable despite years of neglect.  Provided nothing stood in your way, you should be able to make it through in only a few hours...</span></div></div>",

You felt the need to stop and inhale more deeply to get a feel for the scent. Was it lavender? No, it's much too sweet for lavender. Honeysuckle? No, it's not intense. You went through the list of flowers and herbs you were familiar with, but there wasn't a single one that had a scent that matched this. You sniffed at the air (your mother always said you had the nose of a bloodhound) and found that the source of the alluring scent seemed to be coming from the left of the path. You took some steps from the path, but you couldn't see anything that would produce such a lovely scent. You took a few more paces, but to no avail. The source must be a good distance away from the path. Straying that far from the path is basically asking to encounter a monster girl, but there's something about that scent that's driving you batty, as if your body was being compelled to trek towards its source...</span></div></div>",

It was still early afternoon by the look of the sunlight, but it's not too easy to tell when looking through the canopy....oh well...you kept walking. The terrain around you began to change a little, the forest became less dense with trees, and more populous with flowers of all kind, the air became inundated with all their separate scents. Still the enrapturing aroma that caught your attention overpowered them all, leaving you wandering almost blindly into a small, picturesque clearing. You stood by an azure lake as clear as glass, small fish idly swimming, becoming lazy from the heat of the summer sun...by now, the scent has gotten a little sour, funky almost.

Still hovering in the air just above you, she slowly extended her foot, her little toes wiggling slightly, drawing your attention back to where it belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't it sound nice?  To just stay with me, your cute little fairy mistress, laying at my feet, licking them, smelling them.  No worries, no fears, no responsibilities.\"  she cooed.

Your knees were feeling quite weak, and it was all you could do to keep standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy merely giggled, floating just a bit closer, bringing that beautiful little foot closer to your eyes.  From this distance, you could see the faint polish on each of her toes, sparkling faintly, and you could do nothing but watch them helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" she asked, grinning widely, swaying her foot a bit more and laughing as she watched your head slowly sway back and forth as well.  \"I mean, you seem so very enraptured by my foot right now.  You don't want to leave, do you.  You want to stay here, with your little fairy mistress.\" she said, a faint hint of firmness in her voice which made it clear that this was not a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself nodding, her lyrical voice drifting through your mind.  You couldn't think of a good reason to leave.  All you wanted to do was stay here, to be at your mistresses foot, where you belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See.\" the fairy said, floating even closer, bringing her foot up so that it was nearly grazing your lips, \"You want to stay here.  To be my cute little pet, my personal little foot-pet.  Isn't that right, pet.\"  Again, her voice made it clear that this was not a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a low moan, you could do nothing but nod.  Her grin widening, the fairy pushed her little foot just a tiny bit further, and you could feel her petite little toe gently push past your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good pet.  Now, just go ahead and suck on your fairy mistress' toe.  Just breathe in deep as you drift away into an eternal dream, my cute little pet, and surrender yourself to your new mistress.\" she said, smiling fondly down at you as you began to obediently and mindlessly suckle on her toe, your breathing becoming deep as you took in her scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll thoughts of your quest vanished from your mind like smoke in the wind, leaving your mind blank and empty, filled with nothing but the scent and taste of your mistresses foot.  Falling to your knees, you continued to worship her little foot, your eyes closing in bliss as you surrendered completely.  Your days would be forever filled with love and affection from your mistress, and your every thought was devoted to her and her happiness and pleasure.  In return, you were treated well, like the devoted and beloved pet you were.</span></div></div>",

You were used to stories of cruel monsters that loved making others obsessed with their odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes more minutes of watching her, she finally seems to notice you.

You were confident you could take on the goblins and slimes roaming the forest, but not this! The fox girl and you continue to stare, each of you seemingly waiting for the other to make the first move. Wearing the same smirk, the kitsune covers herself with her tails and dresses in her red, silk kimono and begins walking towards you. Her bare feet plod along the soft grass, leaving faint footprints. You, of course, instinctively flinch at the approaching fox. She doesn't seem hostile, but kitsunes are known for their trickery. Kitsunes are <i>also</i> known for being incredibly powerful... and you're not even close to being ready to face one down in combat. As she walks forward, the smell that lead you to the lake is getting stronger, confirming your suspicions it was wafting from her feet. Seeing as getting in a fighting stance or turning tail might trigger some hunter instinct in her, you decide on the obvious, diplomatic approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hey there!\" You say, a bit uncomfortable as she stops a few feet from you. The girl raises an eyebrow to match her smirk as she giggles at your nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, howdy there, mister! Ah'm actually a bit surprised t' see a human way out here! Folk often know better than t' wander far off the beaten path.\" Her demeanor changes completely, causing you to blink a little in surprise. She sounds like a normal girl, not some haughty monster eager to enslave you. But again, you're dealing with a kitsune. Her personality and appearance could all be a trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I suppose so.\" You attempt to laugh to ease tension, but it betrays your obvious feelings of unease. The scent of her feet this close is now fully in your nostrils, but it's tolerable. \"I didn't run into any trouble, though. You're the first monster girl I met so far.\" The kitsune tilts her head at your remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now? I thought fer sure you'd run into a least a harpy out this deep in the woods...\" The fox girl rubs her arms a bit uncomfortably for some reason and her ears dip down. You pick up on this and ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... alright?\" Your human nature gets the better of you and you instinctively reach out to the human-looking girl. The kitsune steps back, kicking up some grass and more of her scent. The odd thing is it's not a bad smell, but a strong one. Like how even the best perfume can be unbearable in large amounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" She angrily shouts back, shrinking away like a wounded animal. Your hand retracts back to your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm sorry I asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde sighs a bit and smiles again. \"It's nothin'. Ah jus' have some... So how'd ya find me out here?\" She asks, changing the subject. \"This lake here ain't on any maps Ah know of.\" She looks up at you, her height a few inches shorter than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink in surprise again, a little embarrassed to answer. \"I, uh... I followed my nose. I had just left my home town when I got whiff of the most amazing scent I ever smelled, sweeter than any flower. Mom always said I had the nose of a bloodhound!\" You find yourself smiling as you recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ah knew it! It's cause of mah feet, ain't it?! They're the worst, stinkiest pair Ah ever- ...Did you say 'sweeter 'n any flower'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes?

Why is this such a huge deal for you, anyway?! I saw you washing your feet when I walked up! I've never heard of a monster girl doing something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well...\" The kitsune fidgets, debating if she should tell you. \"Mah feet sweat so much more than the average monster girl; even <i>they</i> don't want t' be near me!\" She gnashes her fangs, seething in anger. \"It's always 'Ew, it's the stinky-footed girl! Take a bath!' Or... 'Even <i>we</i> have standards!'\" Her fists clench, but she sighs and the anger drops from her face. \"But... you said they smelled sweet?\" Afraid of another outburst, you nod quickly. \"An'... even now?\" She looks down at the blades of grass between her toes and wiggles them, looking back up at your face with big, green, hopeful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon closer inspection it's a kitsune, fox monster girl known for powerful magic and talent for deceit. <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://safebooru.org//images/1176/b4d258c6e4621b1b79a7c380cca40917eaf1791d.png\">She has long red hair, and wears some kind of exotic clothing</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://safebooru.org//images/1176/b4d258c6e4621b1b79a7c380cca40917eaf1791d.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>. Luckily for you she seems busy drinking tea, and haven't noticed you yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you approach her peacefully? Or perhaps it's some kind of trap for travellers, in which case you can try to catch her by surprise and attack? Or maybe just leave her alone, since there's no saying what she can do to you once you are noticed...</span></div></div>",

Sweat beads up on your face as you carefully sneak back into the forest. Deathly silence surrounds you with every step you take until the shrine is out of view. You have yet to pull a sigh of relief, fearing that the kitsune' s ears would pick it up. For the next five minutes, you tip toe through the underbrush with your head turning around every five seconds. It was only when you heard the sounds of a flowing river that you relaxed from your tense state. You may have decided the admittedly cowardice route but it was all worth it to keep safe. The surrounding area gives off a strange sense of calm as you sit down to further your relaxation. Hearing the water rush through the deep river only fed your growing need to rest, now laying down in the grass. There wasn't any real danger hopefully, what monster girls would come all the way down here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, we're lost.\" \"Come on Marie, I have a natural sense of direction.\" \"We passed this bend in the river at least two times and that portal is nowhere in sight.\" You turn about, somewhat annoyed by the female voices disrupting your nap. \"Well this is what happens when you drag me to Cuddlefish's little experiments. Besides, I have a seriously unfresh headache.\" The voices seemed closer, and a little more distorted then you figured. \"To make matters worse, our voices sound ridiculous! What language are we even....\" \"Wait...whose that?\" \"I don't know..but.....Marie? What are you doing?!\" You hear the girls approach you and begin wondering wether or not to get up right now. You hear shoes hit the dirt and find a rather fishy smell invading your nose. \"I don't know Callie....but something in my head is telling me this is right....we....must....dominate.\" You have a very clear idea what's going on here, but now wonder what to do.</span></div></div>",

If so, you may have to turn back, and you would rather not have to face the inevitable jeers that would come with your less than triumphant return less than an hour after you began...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were suddenly dashed as you become aware of a faint sound cutting through the eerie silence of the forest!

Never seen a green girl before?\" the goblin teased, her voice high pitched yet somewhat pleasant to listen to.  It had a girlish, almost child-like quality to it, yet she looked anything but childish.  Despite her small stature, merely three to four feet in height, she was supple and curvy in all the right places.  Her hips were wide and feminine, tapering into a slim yet taut waist.  Her breasts were small yet still quite noticeable, perky and bouncing delightfully with her giggles.  Her bright yellow eyes stared at you with amusement, and her soft looking lips continued to wear that saucy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInadvertently, your eyes wandered down, trailing along her small, soft looking legs, finally resting on her petite little feet.

Instead, you continued to watch her, her feet continuing to sway back and forth.  It was a rather pleasant view, you had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you are looking a bit more relaxed now.\" you heard her say, her voice softer, lower, almost a whisper.

It's okay to watch.\" she continued, her voice seeming to get even softer, yet you could hear it more clearly.  Slowly, without realizing it, your sword began to slip from your increasingly loose grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look really tired.\" she spoke again, and without thinking about it, you nodded.

So much easier to watch my foot from there, isn't it?\" the goblin whispered, her smile wide and devious, the scent of her arousal now hanging heavy in the air.  \"Now that you're on your knees, just crawl a little closer.  Thaa~at's it... just a little closer... good boy.\" she giggled.  Her foot was now barely moving as the boy slowly crawled the last few feet, her toes now pointed directly at him, wiggling slightly, holding his gaze trapped.  Finally, he was kneeling right before her, his now vacant eyes focused completely on her little foot which now hovered mere inches in front of him.

She bit her lip, watching as he took long, deep breaths, filling his nose with her scent.  \"Mmmm... yeah, that's it... breathe in nice and deep... breathe in... and out... with each breathe in, you fill your nose with my scent... with each breathe out, you release more and more of your will, your resistance... in... out... in... out...\" she crooned, wiggling her toes a bit, letting him breathe in deeply of the scent between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a mere goblin, she had learned quite a bit on just how to enthrall a human male.

Your knees feel weak as your airways are polluted with the stench of this shoe. Nanao keeps it held there, and with another sniff, her stench sends you off to dreamland...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in some strange hut. You've been stripped and bound with rope! Nanao is sitting on a throne made of hides and bones, and all manner of catgirls are standing around, watching you!

You sigh and wipe the sweat from your brow, happy to avoid a potential ambush with a monster girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin walking again, but something on the path causes you to stumble. You stagger a couple steps, then turn around and see what caused you to lose balance. It seems that the squirrel wasn't the only thing occupying the bushes, as its escape caused an oil lamp to become dislodged from the bush as well. It must've fallen from a trader's caravan into the bush. Your luck just keeps getting better! You pick up the lamp and take a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lamp was cast in bronze and was adorned with rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and diamonds. This lamp would fetch quite a price! You were almost shaking with excitement. As you examined the lamp, you noticed a series of intricate runes engraved across its surface. A bit of dust the lamp picked up from its tumble prevented the runes from being legible, however. You rubbed the dirt from the lamp, but as you did, the lamp began to glow with a blinding light! The sudden brightness caused you to drop the lamp and raise your hands to your eyes. The light subsided, but a thick blue smoke began to bellow from the lamp's nozzle. The smoke rose a few feet above the ground, but strangely enough, did not rise any higher than that. After a few seconds, the smoke stopped pouring as the mass hung above the lamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your very eyes, the smoke began to condense itself into a human-like shape! When it finished, it was shaped like a normal human woman, albeit blue. She was wearing an intricate tiara adorned with the same gems as the lamp that held her. She was dressed in a fine silk bra and matching pants, both dyed red. Her lack of shoes showed off her matching red toenails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so awestruck that you hardly noticed her begin to speak. \"Finally, after centuries of imprisonment within that lamp, I've been freed. You there, young man,\" she gestured to you, \"were you the one who has freed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" you reply, your voice shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I am the great djinni Tabia.

I thought genie's were fairy tales, nothing but stories told to children!\" She sighs and looks mildly offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please refrain from calling me that word, master. It was crafted centuries ago as a form of derogatory term. To put it into perspective, how would you like it if I called you a rodent fit for nothing but death under my heel?\" Her eyes flared up at the end, filled with immense power and rage. All of it focused on you. Maybe you should refrain from calling her genie. She quickly calmed down, and seemed mildly embarrassed even. \"My apologies, master. I allowed my anger to get the better of me. I just really hate stereotypes. I promise it won't happen again. Should I begin explaining the rules behind my service, master?\" She arched an eyebrow in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah sure.\" You manage to realize that your voice was at least an octave higher than it should be, but all things considered you decide to pat yourself on the back for talking at all. \"Is this like a three wishes deal or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes a gesture that you roughly translate to \"Eh, kind of\" and then speaks. \"Eh, kind of.\" Well, I suppose you were spot on then. \"You do get three wishes, but there are some caveats. First of all, you cant wish for more wishes. Period. You also cannot wish for history to change. What is written is written, simple as that. You may not wish for ultimate power either, it would take all the fun out of the adventure.\" She seemed to wink and nod in your direction, but slightly above you, like there was someone else there. \"They know what I am talking about. Anyway, there is a whole list of other restrictions.\" She pauses and snaps her fingers causing an almost infinite parchment to appear in her hands and all around her. \"But those are the three big ones. To save us time, since I am assuming you want to move on some time this lifetime, if you wish for something I cannot do I will tell you. Most of this list is simply variations of those three things anyway.\" She snaps her fingers again and the parchment is gone. \"Now that that's all out of the way, what can I do for you master?\" She concludes with a smile and a bow, classy gal that she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still a little gob smacked but at least you know all the rules now. You figure you should probably make a wish now, but your kind of puzzled as to what you should wish for. The logical part of your brain say's that you should wish for money or weapons, things that will be useful for the journey ahead. The other, more basic side of your brain keeps looking at her feet. She is a beautiful woman, no doubt, but her feet are utterly remarkable! Perfectly shaped, not too small or too large, clean and well manicured. The shade of red nail polish is even your favorite!

There's dark colored armor covering her chest, arms and legs, but it seems more decorative than meant to actually protect.

She is also physically clearly much stronger than you, judging from a giant scythe looking weapon she holds in one of her hands at the moment as she stands in your way.

I chosen you over... 5 other people who were passing by today!\"The dragon newt says still looking determined<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you just come back to your parents or something?\" You say, just wanting to finish this pointless encounter and go to the nearby village at last<br>\r\n\"How dare you?! I am 30 years old already!\" The dragon girl puffs her cheeks in annoyance, looking rather funny, nonetheless 30 years doesn't sound too impressive for a specie said to be able to live for at least 800 years...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you are older than me then.\" You say rolling your eyes hoping that she will let you pass at last<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and for your insolence I want you to massage my feet now!\" Said Anira as she sat down on the nearby rock<br>\r\n\"Wait what?!\" You say barely able to keep up with way that girl's mind works<br>\r\n\"You heard me! As my servant you should give me a foot rub now! After that we will make the plan about how to conquer that nearby village!\" Said the dragon newt, clearly already considering you her servant whether you like it or not<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand... perhaps if you play along she will join you on your journey? She doesn't seem especially smart, so you should be able to easily manipulate her to go wherever you want. On the other hand, maybe you should try out the ring on her now?

Great Lioness?\" You ask in surprise, never having heard of anything like that<br>\r\n\"Yes, the Great Lioness is the protector of our village, and in return we give her tribute in form of our animals and produce. She can get pretty... irritable if somebody interrupts her sleeping though...\" The old man explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... it's not some kind of deity, but a person?\" You asked, rather confused why would someone have this seemingly near religious reverence in a village<br>\r\n\"I suppose outsiders like you would consider her... a lion monster girl? She wandered here a year ago, and offered us protection in return for regular tributes. She has really good hearing too, even better than my wife, and my wife can hear when I'm gossiping about her on other side of the village!\" Old man replied and quietly laughed at his own little joke<br>\r\n\"That sounds like extortion to me...\" You said, having doubts that monster girl would do something like that out of kindness, and deciding to ignore the rather lame joke<br>\r\n\"Well, you can call it however you want... but she protected us from multiple bandit or Monster Queen agent raids already. Either way traveler, I hope you enjoy your time here, and don't disturb the Great Lioness.\" The old man said, giving a quick polite bow before returning back to the village<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the warning, your curiosity got the better of you, and you decided to at least see that Great Lioness the old man spoke about... hopefully the locals wouldn't give you trouble as long as you stayed quiet. Approaching the big tent that you assumed belonged to her, you quickly moved the cloth covering entrance to the side and took a look inside..<br>\r\nSure enough, you saw a lion girl with long blonde hair, lion tail, and a hat made out of a white lionhead(Picture for reference: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/ZnjyoxR\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/ZnjyoxR</a> )... maybe a trophy of hers? She sat on a throne seemingly made out of animal bones and furs, probably for added menacing effect to those coming in. Just as the old man said, she appeared to be dozing off, and you could hear quiet snoring coming from her... despite sitting on that throne. She also seemed to have a bed on the side... but presumably didn't use it during the day, just so that she could instantly be on her throne if necessary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell if her protection of the village was all that good or people were just threatened by her into thinking so... as a hero, you certainly could just try barging in and trying to end her reign, but if she really was as strong as she sounded from old man's words it could be a bad idea.

I protect them from bandits and those Monster Queen's weird foot-obsessed lackeys, in return I get shelter and food.\" The Great Lioness explained briefly before putting her axe on her shoulder in menacing way<br>\r\n\"I never heard of a monster girl who would consider other monster girls foot obsessed lackeys...\" You replied, taking out your sword in case the lioness would try charging at you all of a sudden.<br>\r\n\"Why would I allow some random humans to touch my feet? It's disgusting. If someone would want to touch my feet, they would have to deserve it. But enough talk already, I'm in the mood to beat you up for interrupting my nap!\" Sur'Kha said holding her axe ready to strike...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I said we don't have to fight!\" You said desperately, but Sur'Kha seemed unimpressed<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure villagers told you it's a bad idea to wake me up from my naps... so now the least you can do is give me some fun by giving me a bit of a challenge!\" The Great Lioness smirked as she prepared to attack you!</span></div></div>",

Little did you know while you tried your best to be quiet, she awoken from sleep but remained still so she can take advantage of your supposed sneak attack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached near her, you bent down on your leg and tried to put the ring on her left toe but to your surprise she turned herself over and used her dirty feet to grab your face and thrust you forward on the ground.  As you hit the ground you were in shock to how she awoke from her sleep so fast.  As you tried to regain your stance, she got up and walked towards you.  As you were halfway up she used her right foot to kick you down, pushing you back down on the dirty ground, \"AHH\" you shouted.  The Lizard girl smiled widely \"Iiit's been too long~\"  The Lizard girl proceeded to walk up and down on you, trampling you.  The trampling caused you to wince, her feet were so big, size 9 in length, she giggles as she jumped on your chest, bending her knees to take out any resistance you may of had. After that she steps backwards over your crotch, along your thighs and knees, putting you in more pain before going back to your upper body.  She used her right toes to grab on your nose and look at her.  She was staring at you with her yellow bright eyes, smiling, letting you know that she owns you.  She lets go of your nose and used her right foot to stomp on you once and then plant her dirty foot on your side of your face, on the cheek, hooking it firmly to keep you pinned down.  <br>\r\n\"Foooooliiish huuman maaannn~\" she crushes you with her strong dirty foot \"Foooliiisssh indeed~\"  You grabbed on her ankle to try to push her foot off of your face, but it wasn't moving.  She was amused to see that you still resisted her \"What fuun!~\" she rubs her foot on your face so effortlessly, sliding it around and putting her toes on your lips, sliding it.  You could almost taste the dirt and sweat of her toes until she lifted her foot slightly, she looked at you for a moment then smothers your face, \"Yooou arrre soo foooliiish to belieeeve you could taaaaklke me ouuut!~\"<br>\r\nShe shoved her soft, warm, dirty and sweaty foot onto your face. You tried your best to keep her foot out of your mouth but it furthers the wants of the Lizard girl to do so to you.  She licks her lips and decided to sit on your chest, placing both her dirty feet on your throat \"Wooorssship mee, little huuuman~\" you tried pushing her off of you but you were met with ill effect, you strength was weakening and she loved that the fact you were in despair.  She put pressure on your throat for a moment then slides both her feet inwards, from throat to forehead, then positioned over your face. You immediately smell a strong odour that fills your nostrils.  Her dirty, sweaty feet are dripping with sweat, which already begins to fall on to your helpless face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look upon the Lizard girl's dirty feet, you remembered that you always fantasied about defeating the Monster Queen and saving the world, not being smothered underfoot of a Lizard girl, you cannot help but feel powerless by the predicament that you are in.  The will to go on was all but gone, now that you are underfoot of a monster girl.  You at least thought if you were to lose, it would at least been the Monster Queen, but no, it had to be a Lizard girl, dominating you completely!  Your mind becomes clouded as Lizard girl's powerful dirty feet rub and down your face, making you feel increasingly weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taaaaake it, like the foot bitch yooou aaaarrrre, HAahahaaha!~\" The Lizard girl laughs at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet seem to become increasingly sweaty, as the friction from rubbing against your cheeks, mouth and forehead seem to cause further sweat to drip over your face. <br>\r\nYour mouth was flush against her soft dirty heel and your nose being flattened by her toes. <br>\r\nShe was easily able to put you on her foot hold without any resistance. In less then 5 minutes, you went down on the ground and at the mercy of a monster girl.bare feet, smothering you like dirt. <br>\r\nAs the Lizard girl push her feet firmly along your face, rubbing up and down, she became so erotic that she jammed her filthy toes into your mouth, stretching out your lips as far as they can extend. You coughed and gagged on the foot attack as she wiggled her toes in your mouth.  You were in a very weak state that you couldn't even try to push her toes out of your mouth.  Her long, sweaty, dirty toes were playing with your tongue.  The taste was salty and absolutely vile!  The combination of dirt and sweat created a muddy mixture, and you were being forced to taste the salty results.  The Lizard girl was so turned on that she grabs your tongue with her toes, forcing you to lick between each one.  Even as you clean the dirt from between her toes you don't complain or fight back, you are completely at this monster girl's mercy.  <br>\r\nThough you remembered that you're better than this, you couldn't take it anymore, as you tried to withdraw your tongue and pushing her off once more, she saw this rebellion within you and once again grabs your tongue with her toes and slowly begins to pull it out of your mouth, biting her lip as she does so.  Moving your tongue into position with her toes she gently releases it before moving her soles along the length of your tongue.<br>\r\nShe ran her dirty soles up and down your exposed tongue, wiping across it as if it was a doormat. Her salty dirty foot sweat left a bitter taste in your mouth, and you felt like you were going to be sick.  You could taste the dirt on her smooth foot.  As she continued to use your tongue, you slowly began to like it, you liked how your tongue was being used her soles, but you couldn't stop resisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stop forcing you to worship her foot and chokes you once more with her feet, telling you \"Iiff you continue to resissst meee, I wiiilll haaaave noo problem offfing you!~\" she moved her right foot to your cheek and flexed her toes while using her left foot to choke you out \"DOoo you undersssstand?~\" You nodded as best you could, then she release the pressure from your throat and used her left foot to grab your tongue to floss out the mounds of dirt and sweat between her toes. She wiggled the toes on her other foot right under your nose. leaving you no choice but to sniff up her foot funk. The assault on your senses is overwhelming, and despite after a few minutes, the recently licked toes now wiggling under your nose smell just as foul as the grimy toes now dancing across your tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed to be an hour, her feet were completely clean, no dirt what so ever until see walks around barefoot again.  You were so exhausted that you couldn't move an inch.  The lizard girl got off of your chest and was pleased how you served her well, once off she walked right near your head and said \"Yoooou were a greeeeat sssslave, eveeen with ssssome trouble you caaaaused meee, your servicessss waaaaassss a delight!~\" she extended her right foot to your face, crushing your cheek once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wiiith that ssssaid, whaaat ssssshould I do wiiith yoooou?~\"</span></div></div>",

Only a small cloth around your private parts remains.

You know she will overpower you any second if you try anything. Furthermore, the leash and her heavy gear make it difficult to escape her. You are still unsure whether it was a good idea to obey her or not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the cave and walk through the mountain paths, She allows you to walk on your hands and your feet so that your kneecaps wouldn't be utterly shattered on the rocky surface. You think to yourself: \"Maybe she isn't so bad after a-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit!\" Your Lizard mistress says, you instantly sit down and she grabs something out of her bag.

Also, clean them for me.\" Ofcourse, by now you love the smell of her sweaty feet but, \"how would I clean these then?\" you ask with an innocent tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your tongue my ssssssilly pet.\" She says with an evil smile on her face, locking her eyes with yours. You start licking and you get aroused almost immediatily. You can taste her delicious, erotic, mature and dried up sweat from every inch of that sandal. You lick again and again and again!

The taste of her used sandal is just heavenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places her foot on the back of your head and pushes your face into the ground, flat onto her sandal that is bound to your face. \"Enjoying it, are we?

She then comes to a hold and looks around, the sun is almost setting and it might be wise for you two to find a place to stay. You see her frown and then tug your leash, you walk into a small and narrow path, surrounded by high rocky mountains. After a short walk you see a small opening, a cave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks into the cave, and sits down, \"here boy.\" Your lizard owner says. You follow and sit down next to her, she then unties the rope behind your head and inspects her sandal. \"Hmm... I am impressed, you cleaned it very well and you seemed to enjoy it too.\" She then takes the leather backpack from your back and puts it on the ground, she takes a whole lot of rope out of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your belly, pet. We are going to stay here for the night.\" She then puts her foot on the back of your head and pushes your face roughly into the cavefloor, \"stay still!\" Not wanting to anger the luscious reptile you simply stay still and let her have her way. Within a matter of seconds your hands and feet are bound behind your back, very tightly. Then, she attaches your bound legs and bound feet to one another, bending them above your back. Before you know it, she has effectively hogtied you! Like a hunted animal you squirm in your restraints...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sshhhh pet, this is just to make sure you wont escape!\" Well, escaping is indeed going to be very difficult like this... She then grabs out a blanket from her gear and puts it on the ground, she lays down on it and her feet are right in front of your face. She then moves onto her belly and looks at her map. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"thirsty pet?\" She asks, with her toes wiggling only inches away from your face. \"Y-y-yes!\" She instantly slaps your face with her foot, \"yes who?\", with a burning cheek you reply, \"Yes Master! Sorry master...\"<br>\r\nHer tail then goes towards her head, \"see my dirty feet? Been walking barefoot all day, they are sssssso dusty and sore!\" On closer inspection, you indeed see her entire white-green sole is now almost fully light-grey from today's walk. \"You will clean them, but let me help you.\" You hear her spit on her tail and then her tail goes to her feet and drops her spit onto her dirty soles. She does this at least six or seven more times, till both of her feet are covered in a mixture of her own spit along with dirt and sweat from her own feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then moves closer to you till her feet are right below your face, \"cleaning time pet. Now!\" Somewhat reluctantly you give a small lick and you are overwhelmed by how good this mixture tastes! Her long size 10 soles are as beautifully silky as ever and her saliva doesn't taste that bad... You lick again and again, increasing your pace and swallowing all her spit and sweat from her soles. Her tail then moves over your head and caresses the back of your head, probably a sign that you are doing a good job!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about an hour you are licking her feet and swallowing whatever your tongue comes across. She then turns around to her back and swiftly inspects her sole from a distance. \"The toes now honey.\" She seems rather happy with your treatment and you are instantly licking her toes clean, sucking on her long sweaty toes one by one. You also do your best to lick in-between her toes. The skin between her toes is very soft and sweaty, and you love the taste of all the mature lizard sweat that had accumulated in these narrow spaces between her long toes. You lick between her toes with a very slow pace, trying to make your tongue as wide as possible and almost massage her this way; something she seems to enjoy. \"Hmmmm, good boy!\" She coos while scribbling something on her map. After a few minutes you are done licking her toes and you are just placing kisses all over her sole to entertain her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is some dirt under my long nails after a walk like that, clean them for me will you?\" Your lizard owner says with a sweet voice. You slowly move your tongue towards her toes and dig the tip of your tongue into her nail trying to get the dirt from below hair nails onto your tongue. \"Swallow it pet, that issss your only dinner.\" It takes a while but you start to get the hang of it and you swallow all of the dirt you find. After a few minutes her soles and nails are looking as clean as they ever could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stands up and inspects her feet. \"Hmmm, pretty well done.\" You can see her body is still sweating from the walk, she takes a small rag out of her backpack and starts to wipe off the sweat off her body. Over her belly, between her luscious breasts, her legs and finally, her arm pits, which she is almost scrubbing with it for a full minute. Then she takes a whiff and her face turns away instantly. She then moves to you and pushes the sweat-drenched rag into your face. \"Breathe in. Sssssmell your owner.\" You breathe in and you instantly fall onto your side, struggling in your hogtied-situation as you breathe in armpit sweat from the luscious reptile. \"Hahaha, you seem to enjoy thissss!\" The rag is entirely drenched and the smell of her armpits is very strong. \"Hmm, but you can still breathe through your nose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walks a few steps back and takes her underwear off, basically a rag that was firmly bound around her groin. You can see it is warm, damp, wet and sweaty. She looks at you with a mischevous grin and you try to wobble backwards in your hogtied restraints but you can hardly move an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hands she holds two completely drenched rags, one soaked with her armpit sweat and the other are basically a pair of moist panties. She kneels in front of you and whisper in your ear: \"Which would you like in your mouth? You'll be smelling the other one for the rest of the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer: \"In my mouth I would like... \"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wiggle around a bit and then she grabs another clean rag and ties it firmly around your head, to keep her rag-panties in place inside your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but notice she is actually becoming more motherly and much more sensitive in her way with dealing with you. It's almost as if obeying her makes her treat you better...  However, you have the panties of such a beautiful creature in your mouth, you surely couldn't pass up this opportunity, could you? With your tongue you start exploring the wet rag inside your mouth and you taste all kinds of musky and intense flavors, which by itself is already making you rock a boner. Maybe obeying her isn't so bad after all, apart from all the semi-sexual bullying... Which you expect is about to continue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then slowly places her foot on your head, \"so, you want to smell this rag soaked with my armpit sweat the entire night? I can see you already have a boner from all our little games, hmmm... Well, here we go!\" She then kneels and firmly binds her soaked rag around your face, twisting it in a way so that the wettest part is right against your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you are gagged with her rag-panties you have no choice but to breathe in her armpit-rag... Oh boy! The stench is unreal! You kind of want to scream from the intense smell of this sweat-rag, but on the other hand the mature and erotic smell of the tall, luscious lizard is rather arousing... The more you look at her the more beautiful you think she is... Why hadn't you noticed earlier how stunning your captor looks!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is standing there, in the dim lights of a lantern in a dark cave, with her hands on her hips, looking at you with a victorious grin while you are smelling her armpit sweat. She is just about 7 foot tall, she has green skin with very soft, light-green skin on her feet, hands, neck and face (and some other areas). She has a very voluptuous body, curved heavily in the perfect spots. She then has long silky hands and feet, with long fingers and toes. Her feet must be atleast size 10 from the looks of it. The way she moves her silky skin in a snake-like fashion makes it seem as if her body is almost always moist at every spot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices that you are inspecting her and she puts a bit of pressure on her foot on the back of your head. \"Hmm... Getting interested in your owner, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile smelling and tasting her sweat, thinking about how heavenly it is to worship her feet, you have no reason anymore to hide your desires. Although somewhat reluctantly, you nod in agreement and take another big whiff of the rag full of her armpit sweat. \"Awwwh, great! I love playing with submissive little boys like you... Say what, I'll be the alpha and you'll be my good little beta-boy, is that clear?\" Her tail moves towards your face and shoves the sweat-soaked rag right up at your nose, rubbing it back and forth against your nose while you're breathing... Your boner starts to get more and more pronounced.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nObviously, your reptile owner sees your sexual arousal and comments: \"Ha, I'll take that as a yes! Let's sleep here for tonight and walk to my sisterssss tomorrow.\" She walks towards you and grabs you by your collar with her hand, she then whispers in your ear: \"We lizards are cold-blooded you know, so we love to have some warm-blooded subs warming ussss at night... Boy, you should feel honored, YOU willl be my personal body-pillow tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blood flows from your wound making the vampires lick their lips and decend upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all try to set their fangs in you, your limbs, torso and face is quickly used as a feast as all of the vampires are in a huge euphoria of pleasure and blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the vampires get up and leave the room to complete their assigned mission. You are nothing more than a dry pile of skin and bones. The vampire leader stands alone above you, she moves her feet on your dead face and applies her weight. Then she whispers some foreign words which causes your entire body to twitch around..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and you cant believe it.. You are somehow alive.. however you cant feel anything, and you realise that you dont need to breath air... Your skin is pale and you are incredible thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire leader smiles and tells you that you are now her undead slave for all eternity. She alone controls your life now and there is nothing that you can do. All it takes is for her to speak a command and you will act upon it without hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, you start your life as an obedient undead slave to your new vampire mistress. <br>\r\nYou are shackled at the camp and used by all the vampires in all manners of ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout you the human kingdom gets destroyed and all humans are either killed or enslaved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are placed under the throne of your vampire mistress and used as a footstool for eternity... That is until she gets bored with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lost.. Game over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surprisingly she wasnt wearing much other jewelry than a tiara most likely made of silver with some wierd dark crystals, and also a necklace wit the same kind of crystal only this one had a wierd green glow to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen smiles deviously and it seems like she has already felt your fear and awe as she continues towards her throne.

She gets up from her throne, as if she is to make a statement to the huge crowd that has gathered in the hall since the whole conversation began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicks you so that you lay down on your back, that way she can place her foot on top of your body.. covering all of it, she makes your face stay in between her big and second toe.. you are muffled by the sweaty flesh and toe jam that now covers all of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My beloved Monster girl subjects! the time has finally come for us to crush the last resistance of the human kingdom.

You truly fear this being that you have been placed beneath...How could anyone ever think that they would be able to defeat such a powerful foe... you hope with all of your heart that the rest of the human race will just lay down their arms and give up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen gives out the orders to her army, and prepares them all to march towards the forrest in the early morning. Then she moves her foot away and takes you with her into her personal chambers, here you are stripped completely naked and collared, the collar connecting to a chain that leads to a toe ring on her big toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have proven resourceful slave, so i will uphold my end of the bargain.

Your head and kiss the big toe of her filthy feet \" yes my goddess, it would be a dream come true\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen has completely broken you, as she lays back on her royal couch she orders you to rub her feet while she takes in the moment in all its entirety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day you were used in all manners of degrading and digusting tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were forced to worship her feet constantly, she loved when you cringed at the smell of her feet and furthermore when you moved around because of the disgusting taste of her feet. You were used as a \"tool\" in which she could \"thrust\" into herself  to \"relieve her stress\". Both in her most sacred of treasures, and in her foul smelling \"cavern\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day the Queen prepared to lead her forces into battle, when she met the last forces of the human kingdom she was met with alot of resistance which resulting in the humans loosing almost half of the forces. The commander of the humans finally gave up and so did the king who was executed publicly by the Queens most trusted general. The execution method being trampling until the king was flat and stuck to the generals foot. The General then sat down and kicked her feet up, showing everyone in the main courtyard that their king was gone. His crown, once a symbol of his divine power handed down through the many centuries of his kin.. now.. a simple toe ring for the general of his kins mortal enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Queen holds a huge ceremony in which she proclaimed herself to be the one and true Queen of all the lands. She removed her boot to publicly humiliate you in front of your people, you did as instructed and was blessed with the secrets of your human kingdom that the Queen had stolen. With that done you were chained underneath her sole, with your face up against the crevice of her toes so that she could always step on you when out on errands.. and without ever fearing that she would come to loose her most loving slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the monster girls cheered as they abused all their newly aquired slaves, the frog girls covering their slaves in their slimy toe dirt. The vampires hypnotizing their victims into degrading themselves for their licking. <br>\r\nThe trolls and giantess smothering their slaves beneath their gruesome and huge feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the many animal monster girls like the rabbits and cat girls were granted passage into the city, never would a monster girl ever have to live without a home... and without a trusty and devoted human slave under their perfect feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this truly the end that you sought? or was this all a part of the prophecy? Could all of this maybe just be a warning for what to come if the hero fails his journey? or is it all just a bad nightmare? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nnotes from author, i hoped that you liked it. its the first time that i have written an ending on this thing and i had so many ideas lol. However sometimes its better to just get the ending done without adding to much stuff. There is still alot of different roads to choose from that can result in different outcomes. I want to thank the creator of this interactive for making such a good written fantasy world. There are so many possibility and angles just waiting to be written, and i hope that many others will write on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She pulls a lever and the wall opens, showing you a big open place with a small scaffold on the floor. \"Get in there will you, you are going to serve me for a while... I appreciate what you did for me, but, I stole you for this purpose after all so... get in there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGorgia's 7 foot body, full of muscles and her stern look don't give you much choice...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She moves her toes in different ways, making you lick each one of them, every inch of each of her toes.

After a dragging her sole across your tongue a few times, she moves to the other foot. Having you start at licking her toes again and then in between them. After a few minutes, your tongue and mouth are full of the taste of her sweat, and it leaves you drooling...

She uses a key to get you out of your prison and leads you out in the back where you are to be chained for the next day. However the Nightelf bartender has some other plans for you, it would seem that you have become famous in the Monster girl capital for your little \"stunt\" towards the Queen. Now it would seem that most Monster girls would do almost anything to get the chance to keep you under their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nightelf bartender switches to her night gown, and lies down on her bed. You are chained to the foot of her bed and collared to a short chain that is connected to an anklet on her right foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nightelf explains that this is to be your new life, you will be put into a contraption under the bar desk in the day time. To worship the sore soles of your new mistress as she works hard in the bar, and in the night time you will work as her slave at the end of her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get free but it is useless, this might well be the end of your story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first few days passes by, you are uses thoroughly by the bartender, her bare feet always being sweaty and sore from walking around barefoot all day. She takes much delight in stepping on your face while pouring drinks, commanding you to keep your tongue in between her toes as she moans and laughs in pure happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first few nights, you are to rub her feet while she sleeps, and if she wakes up during the night and your are not rubbing her feet. Then you are kicked multiple times in the face until you beg for forgiveness and tell her that she is your absolute goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only takes a couple of weeks before you are completely broken, she doesnt even have to command you anymore. She just shows you the part of the foot that she wants to have licked, sniffed, kissed or rubbed and you go straight to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so broken and tamed that you litteraly beg her to trample and grind your face in the bar, the same goes with the face kicking in the bed. You beg her everyday and she usually grants you your wish if she accept to do something even more humiliating. Last time you had to be her living foot stool while she clipped her toenails and made you eat them and also thanking her for the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while being trampled in the bar, you tell your goddess everything about the human kingdom, including where the recruitment villages are and how many of the kingdoms forces there is left. This causes the nightelf to smile and laugh at how weak you are for selling out your race. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decides that she wants to rewards you for having shown such great initative and trust by telling her all that. The reward being that she chooses to do an ancient elven ritual of binding a persons essence to an item. In this instance its a toe ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis means that you will always belong to her, and always be beside her. She can shrink you at will and stomp you all that she want without anything happening to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human kingdom is destroyed and you remain the footslave of your new Goddess for eternity.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You hack and slash your way through the monster girls, your sword going through them as if they were made of butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take great pleasure in hacking them down.. knowing that one less human is going to be tortured by a monster girl. Trolls, kitsune, spider girls, bunny girls, succubi.. all fall before you the same as you look towards the main circle where the Queen certainly must be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as you push on your sword begins to feel frail and broken, you know that you will need to find something quick to replace it as soon as it breaks.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you thought, as soon as you impale a giant orc girl the sword breaks all the way down to the hilt causing you bash the orcs face in with the pommel of the hilt. You take a crude long dagger from the orcs belt and finish her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look around and see some dark elves in fine armor, perhaps their equipment would be more fitting for a warrior such as yourself. You storm towards them, and they jump over you while trying to take you down with their graceful lethality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever you have the spirit of a warrior.. You wont let yourself go down so easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accept the stabs and cuts by the elves, and break their bodies against the ground. You take the sword and shield of one of the dead elves. You dont like the feel of the sword, it feels a bit too light however it will make due. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush towards the inner circle, most monster girls choose to flee in terror of the blood drenched warrior who fears no one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the monster girl Queen in the distant sitting on a huge Golden throne on a platform that is getting pushed by a bunch of human slaves. This sight enrages you even more causing you to cut everyone down that stands in your way with one quick cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you move closer to the Queen you hear something heavy move through the air and all of a sudden you see a giant sword planted in the ground in front of you.

You run towards her and slide under her giant blade that cuts a dozen of monster girls that were far to slow to move away. <br>\r\nThis pisses her off however she has to move the giant blade back before she can make another slash, you use this opportunity to jump to her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to kick you away, but you quickly get a firm grip on her armor and move up towards her back. <br>\r\nShe lets go of her sword and tries to get a hold of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And punishing you for killing her beloved sister, which she hold so dear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay under her feet and cleaning her feet for the 20th time today, you believe that one day soon she will forgive you and begin to love you. All while Hildur sits back and enjoy herself, while she in secret deploys more and more soldiers to fight against the Human Kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day while licking her sole, a messenger comes running into the throne room, she declares that the rest of the human kingdom has been destroyed and that the rest of the humans have been enslaved. Hildur is now the absolute ruler of the monster girl empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this sends chills down your spine as you realise what Hildur has been doing to you this entire time. You feel a deep void inside of yourself.. A deep shame.. you have failed your entire kingdom and race.. all for the false promise and hope for getting a chance with this massive monster girl.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still in your thoughts, Hildur wiggles her toes and pushes her sole into your face while telling you to get back to work. <br>\r\nYou hesitate and wonder if you should say something to her, and if it would help your situation or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave! get back to work now! my feet are dirty and are in need of your service.. This is what you wanted isnt it? to serve a superior beings feet... You did say that you would do anything for me\" she points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no way back, your race is enslaved and your kingdom is destroyed....you might as well just accept things as they are.. You have lost to this goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bow your head and begin to lick her dirty sole again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job slave, i knew that you would realise that this is your true calling\" Hildur says with a wide smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I really thought that i would need to break you or something for you to keep being my slave.. But it looks like you have already accepted your place beneath me.. I must say i really thought that you were smarter than this.. It only took me one sentence and you gave yourself to be completely. You will serve me for a long time, there is no way back.. You have no one other than me to rely on... So kiss my feet and say \"yes my goddess, your wish is my command\" and Then i will reward you with the chance to begin your toe jam cleaning duty... I know.. I am way to gracious. \" She says while smothering you under her giant feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to kiss her feet, which makes her laugh even louder... then to hold up her end of the deal, you are met with the disgusting sight of the space in between her toes... You know what is expected of you, so you get to work immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your life now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became Hildurs slave, and doomed your entire race to slavery under the disgusting feet of the monster girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGame over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every night you were to take care of your new goddess and her filthy feet that had become even dirtier after an entire day of traveling and fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the beginning it took alot of effort from you to take care of her feet while also trying to seem like it wasnt the most horrible situation in your life. And as you had thought about before, you still felt that your goddess was watching you and waiting for you to show that you werent a servant of the kingdom. Every time you did fail with something, your Goddess was quick to \"reward\" you with some extra chores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were constantly frightened of what would happen you finally got to the Capital of the monster girls kingdom.. You werent registered as a foot servant.. which could cause a problem in terms of the things that you had told your new goddess. However maybe she didnt care.. or maybe she was just happy to have a new and loyal slave.. Time would tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally arrived at the Fortress of the Monster girls capital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hildur arrived at the gates, alot of the monster girls asked her about her business and who she was. She told them all that she was to have an audience with the Queen.. The guards laughed at her which caused her to eliminate them immediately... while she spoke about how the kingdom had become sloppy in terms of soldiers and their training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHildur arrived at the royal throne room where the terrifying dark elf known to all as the Monster Queen was sitting. Clad in her armor and with her blades on the side on the throne. Though.. as many monster girls she was completely barefoot... which were really dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who dares to walk into the royal throne room of the Monster girl kingdom without a scheduled audience and even after slaughtering guards of said kingdom?\" the Queen beckons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Do you really not remember me big sis? Has it really been such a long time since i left for my holy quest?\" Hildur said smiling with tears of joy running down her cheeks. With you gagged with toe jam and bound to her belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hildur?? is it really you?? What happened? Why have you been gone for such a long time? Why didnt you return??\" The queen said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those filthy humans trapped me with ancient magic as i was about to get the crystal that i was sent out to retrieve... luckily.. one of your servants.. who i am assuming that you had sent..happened to go through the ruins and freed me\" Hildur said happy while embracing her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen was happy... But then backed away while smiling \" What servant?\". The Queen asked some of her staff if any registered slaves had been sent to those ruins to which they answered that there had been any. However.. There was a surviving Agent of the kingdom who had returned to the Capital after her whole squad was killed by a brutal human warrior who seemed like he took joys in killing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen hearing this Hildur began to laugh with an angry undertone.. The Queen was shocked and looked serious at her younger sister as she was nervous about what was about to happen. You were nervous as well.. scared for your life you tried to get the toe jam out of your mouth so that you could support your role in all of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHildur then grabbed you from the belt and threw you on the floor in the middle of her and the Queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooooo... You are a servant to the monster kingdom are you?\" she said while laughing... \" This makes everything so much better.. You have been willingly worshipping my feet and degrading yourself all this time.. without being a true servant of the Kingdom?? Where my feet really that beautiful?\" She laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen finally understanding what has happened joined her sister in laughing and degrading you <br>\r\n\" Wait Hildur.. Are you seriously telling me that this worm freed you from your imprisonment... then fully surrendered to you... lied and called himself a servant and that he was on a mission.. and then worshipped your feet... This is probably the best story i have heard in a long looong time\" she said.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen picked you up and looked at you.. \"I think... that since you gave yourself willingly to Hildur.. and since you apparently are a slave to my Kingdom and race... I think you should be \"rewarded\" with being Hildurs permanent slave... and with the new crystal... im gonna make your life... a living heaven to you... not only are you going to be serving Hildurs feet contantly.... You will be \"rewarded\" by being devoured by her.. and when you then return from your \"journey\" we will simply just revive you with the crystal... There is alot of energy in this crystal.. And i would gladly bless one of my subjects and servants for that matter in such a way\" She says while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... This is what you want... right?\" she says while slowly crushing you in her hand... until you give up because of the pain and agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis causes Hildur to laugh with her sister as she takes you with her into her private quarters..<br>\r\n\"Ohh my little slave.. i hope that you are a happy little slave..Not only did you get rewarded by me, to be my personal little foot slave... You also got rewarded by the Queen herself.. and dont worry after you have done your chores and cleaned my feet after today... You will get to travel through me \" she said while bringing you in for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is now your life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery morning when Hildur wakes up and you \"return from your journey from inside her\" you are washed and put to work at her feet.. She takes great pleasure in making you clean her toes and instep.. Then when she is out to do her work she puts you in her under garments, always face first into her backside.. There you have to wait until she has a break or is returning to her quarters where you undergo the process of cleaning, rubbing, and kissing her dirty, pale and elven feet. Then before she goes to bed, you are pushed deep inside of her backside.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere you...after many ours of squirming around in pain inside of her end up being absorbed by her.. all which causes great pleasure for Hildur who moans in approval to you trying to get out of her backsides opening.. which she with her index finger forces you up inside of her again as she goes to sleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day you even got so lucky that Hildur wanted to play with you in a even more intimate way. This was truly a blessing that very few dedicated slaves got to try out, you were to be bound at your hands and legs so that you were unable to move. Then you were used as a \"female stress reliever\" who were to be thrusted into the crotch of hildur until she had been pleasured.. Then after cleaning her up as a dedicated slave would do.. You were to journey through her, by being pushed up her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kept on going for a long time.... You became totally broken.. You did everything to please your new Goddess and everyday you begged her with your entire being that you could avoid the daily journeys through your goddess. However she kept reminding you of what an honor it was to get such a blessing for a lowly human slave like yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn wasnt it truly a blessing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the aid of Hildurs martial prowess and pure power, the Monster Queen and her monster girl armies quickly defeated the remaining forces of the Human kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as many siblings do.. Hildur quickly became jealous of her Older sister, and began a civil war that split the Monster Girl kingdom in half... Humans were then given a chance to raise a resistance that could fight against the race that enslaved them for so many years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this was all the work of the \"chosen one\" maybe the prophecy was true after all, Your presence and actions did take a part in causing the fall of the original Monster girl Kingdom. Maybe your forefathers could forgive you for your sorry state in life, and grant you their blessing in the future where you might be released by your divine and beautiful goddess.. that is... if the Crystal that keeps you alive after your journeys doesnt run out of power until then.. Or if Hildur gets bored of you.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pray with everything in your body and mind... as you are swallowing her disgusting and sour toe jam... that it will never happen. </span></div></div>",

You find a piece of parchment with a smudged out work.. something that starts with an I... however the years of tear has made it unable to read it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the crystal and exit the the ruins which leaves you at the entrance to the caves. <br>\r\nYou know of the route to the Monster Girl capital, however maybe it would be wise to return to the nearest human outpost to return the Crystal to help the armies of the kingdom push back the monster girls. </span></div></div>",

However.. being the slave of a band of vampire does require something special.. Something more than just cleaning a few feet..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampires all flock around you while asking their leader if.. they could get a taste of your warm and fresh blood.. They havent tasted warm and fresh blood for days... being used to they rations of human blood on barrels, and animal blood in the worst of times...It is a quite rare luxury to taste the fresh blood straight from the source. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader takes a few moments to think about it, however she finally agrees that you are to be their foot slave...AND their portable blood bag... However all of the vampires get very strict orders about not to drink to much of your blood... You are first and foremost the pet of the leader and it is only because of her generous spirit that they get to even get the option to taste your blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampires all thank their gracious leader who then leaves you over to their care as they bind you to 2 large poles so that you cant resist them... one of the vampires then ask you about where you would want to be feasted from.. You try to beg them not to feast on you.. but they take it as you being a disobedient slave.. and chooses to feast from your neck as a punishment... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then begin to feast of you, and you end of being almost empty of blood causing you to blackout... you make up to seeing a really angry vampire leader about to punish her sisters... However before she can punish them.. you crawl over to the feet of your goddess and kiss the tops her feet.. This causes her to bow down to help you.. However... being the broken slave that you are..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her that she shouldnt punish the sisters.. you explain that it must have been your fault, as your blood must have been all too sweet for them to handle... you just hope that your goddess can administer the blood the next time... so that your life wouldnt get threatened again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Goddess assures you that it was never the attention to almost kill you.. especially not after all that you have shown that evening. You are carried into the vampire leaders tent, and your leash is connected to the foot of the vampire leaders bed.  Your new goddess tells you that your reward from before was have your face pressed against her feet while she slept... However since you were so drained, she would rather have you rest so that you could become well against, your goddess ordered you to sleep with her boots. Because in her mind, the smell of her disgusting souls will help you get well quicker... You do as your new goddess demands... and you go to bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple of days you are used in all manners of ways... Being forced to worship feet, trampled and kicked to relive stress and being a training tool for the vampires... You are being feasted on.. and if you are lucky you are blessed with being your goddesses personal slave when she seeks \"relief\" in the night... You are constantly being used as a living fuck toy by the vampires... also by the underlings when your goddess isnt around... They often threaten you and punish you to ensure that you are also to be their obedient plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive to the capital you have been completely brainwashed and broken by the use of the vampire. <br>\r\nYou have become a loyal pet to your new goddess... so much that she finds after some months search.. finds a wierd crystal that makes it possible to make you unable to die.. making you her obedient pet... for eternity..</span></div></div>",

Then the horn sound comes again and it is closer this time, causing the troll to kick you over and walk on top of you. The troll not realising how heavy she is and how huge her feet are compared to you squashes you completely into her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to cream for mercy to your goddess, however all of trolls are occupied with getting themselves over to the army. You feel your body starting to give in to the weight of each step as you become more and more squished into the sole of the troll. Your cries are now completely muffled by the trolls dirty sole, you cant move or do anything other than being stuck to foot of your new goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some hours of marching a dark elf monster girl marching behind your troll goddess notices that the troll has stepped on something, when she gets the troll to look she laughs out loud as she sees your lifeless mangled corpse completely stuck to her foot. To further the humiliation, she keeps you stuck until you one day wither off her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the trolls have fought in the great war against the human kingdom, resulting in the monster girls winning without loses. The trolls return to their lair where they feast and enjoy themselves.

The leader interrupts them by telling them that you are a threat to the monster girl empire, and by attacking the empires agents you have violated the highest laws of the empire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire leader can do what she wants to you without any court or systematic judgement. <br>\r\n\"You have violated our laws human, and you have caused me and my fellow agents alot of harm\" the leader said with a serious tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have decided that you will be condemned to death by stomping\" The leader said while grind her foot around in your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to yell and scream but you are muffled under the dirty and disgusting sole of the monster girl. <br>\r\nIt doesnt take long before the vampire leader adds more weight to her foot, causing you to feel alot of pain. <br>\r\nThen she lifts her foot up and begins to merciless stomp you while the Vampire agents stand around her and count the amount of times that she stomps your face in .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time her dirty sole connects with your face you are met with the foul stench of her dirty feet.

All you can do is see the foot coming down on your face and then get raised again. After a few more stomps again, your vision begins to blacken as you fall into unconsciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you experience s the sound of the vampire leader laughing at you as she moves her feet around while she toys with your dead face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen When you are completely gone the Leader adds all of her weight resulting her stomping your head completely flat without anything cracking or breaking. The other vampires then grab your legs and pull your lifeless corpse with them.

I'm not priest or shaman, gods don't watch over me. I need a blessing from one of them, only then will I be ready to depart on my quest.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a certain shrine nearby, which also served as a house of a powerful priestess, renowned across the land as one of the kingdom's greatest monster girl exterminators. She defended many towns and villages from monster attack.Whether you were rich or poor, powerful or weak, smart or stupid, each human life was precious in her eyes, and she would come to your aid. You still vividly remember that one time you were in need of her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been two years since them time our village was plagued by giant footprints that suddenly began appearing on the roadsides near our village. With monster girls being a thing in this world, it's no surprise that people began worrying that they must've been left by one of them. Things got worse when people started finding crushed corpses in those footprints, as well as chewed out human bones near them. The village began sending search parties every night in order to find and kill the beast, but they were never able to find anything. Whatever it was, it preferred dealing with smaller prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening you were all alone on your farm, the rest of your family had some business to deal with in the village. It's been a normal, quiet evening, until you began hearing some commotion outside. You quickly left your home, a pitchwork in your hand, in order to deal with whatever the problem was. What you saw terrified you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young man, no older than you, running for his life, and a giant girl \"slowly\" following him, laughing all the way. The giantess had a few distinctive features: two long horns sprouting from her head, a long, ginger hair, and soul-piercing red eyes. Her body was covered in some black-striped,yellow cloth, probably made out of a few tigers. Although she was gigantic, her body was in structure similar to a younger human. You knew well that she wasn't young, though. She was an oni, an ancient, horned beast from old myths and legends. Those demons are as old as they're big, and this one was very big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes trailed back to the boy, clearly exhausted from all the running. You were debating whether to try and help him, or stay back and protect your home. The inner hero finally won, and you broke into a run. Shortly after you did, the boy finally fell on the ground, unable to move. The oni smiled, her prey finally worn out, allowing her to take a look around the place... And finally notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze as her eyes met your own, the blood-red orbs spelling your doom, the sight instantly sucking out all of your bravado. With a sudden jump in energy, you turned around and began running rowards the village, the only safe place around. He heard the giantess laugh in your direction, and a sound of heavy steps, followed by a scream and a wet crunch. Looks like she forgot about her previous victim, and focused on a new prey. Although her steps were big, you were just too far away from her, and the risk of you reaching the village's walls before she cathes up to you was too high. Thus, she broke into a run herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden increase in earthshakes made running away very difficult. It would be difficult to stand under those circumstances, let alone run. You quickly fell on your knees and began  crawling away. There was no hope of outrunning her in this way, the quakes growing louder and louder. When they were literally right behind you, you jumped into a run once again, only to immediately crash into a giant foot that suddenly appeared before you. You fell on your back, looking up at a smiling face on the oni girl. A cruel smile, to this day still haunting you in your dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view of her face was quickly replaced by the dirty sole of her enormous foot. The thing was massive, able to easily cover your body from head to toe under just the arch itself if she wished to do it. Instead, she's decided to put your body under the ball of her foot, with your head sticking in between her big and second toe, just so you could see that smile again. She began squeezing it \"lightly\", putting you through incredible pain. You seriously thought your head was going to burst just from the pressure. Your screaming head an undortunate side effect: some sweat that accumulated in-between her toes found its way into your open mouth, forcing you to cough and gag, and the disgusting taste of the bodily fluid almost making you vomit. The oni found this predicament very amusing, and so instead she stopped squeezing your head, and instead pressed you head into the crevice in-between her toes, slwoly rolling it around, using your still open mouth and hair to clean it as much as she could. When she deemed the job well done, she released your head once again, and move her foot so that you'd be right under her arch. She pressed down, forcing you to scream out loud in pain, and once again take some sweat and dirt into your mouth. She wasn't giving you a break from the pain either, the pressure just kept on building and building. You thought your bones were about to snap, but just as they were about to reach their limits, she let go. You let out a big sigh, taking in the fresh air. You opened to your eyes to great the evening sky, but instead you were greeted by an image that's still burned in your memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oni stood to her full height, easily dwaring you, making you feel like an insect. Her foot was hanging high above, positioned right above your body. This was it, she was going for the kill. You had no strength left in you to move out of the way. You looked her one last time in the eyes, those blood-red eyes. She gave you a wink, and you broke up crying. Her foot fell, this was the end... When suddenly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burst of light filled you vision. Though it was bright, it wasn't painful to look at. You were watching as the oni was being slowly vanquished by the column of holy light she was being bathed in. When it finally stopped, the oni was gone, only a small pile of ash left on the ground. Up above it you saw a silhoutte of some woman, hovering in the air. After a closer look you've realized you're looking at the priestess from the nearby shrine, or at least that's who you thought she was. You never saw her in person before, only heard her appearance being described by folks from the village. She was clad in red-white overalls, including a red top with white sleeves, and a red skirt with white wavy patterns on it. Her feet were covered by white tabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priestess landed on top of the oni's remains, skattering her ashes to the wind. You've heard the oni simply impossible to kill permanently, they will eventually regenerate, getting rid of them is only temporary. That day the priestess made one powerful enemy, just to save one soul. You wanted to thank her, to get on the ground and kiss her tabi out of gratitude. Alas, you were too tired to do anything. Your head fell back to the ground as you finally let yourself pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you were back in your bed, your family standing around it, happy that you finally regained consciousness. They asked you what happened, and so you explained them what happened the last night. Their faces went from pure shock and terror to those of relief. Your dad sent two of your younger brothers with a few sacks of our finest corn and rye to the shrine as a way to show gratitude for saving his son's life. A few days later, when your wounds healed and your strength and vigor came back, you were ready to go back in the fields and work off those sacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour long reminescing of this event made the trip towards the shrine pass very quickly. You were able to finally see the stone pillars that would then lead towards the shrine itself. You sped up your pace, motivated by the prospect of being guided and strengthened by the gods themselves, and becoming the next defender of those lands. When you finally reached the shrine...</span></div></div>",

There's a chance that something could've happened to the priestess, and if that's the case, you can't simply leave her. It's at least worth checking around if she's fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... H-Hello!? Is anyone here!?\" You called out in the shrine's direction. No response, as expected. Slowly, you approahed the shrine's main entrance, your hand reaching for the door.

You immediately begin coughing and wheezing from the horrid smell. It made you want to vomit, no, it made you want to die, for even death was preferable to the hell that was her foot stench.<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to get your sword?\" She laughed as her foot drenched your body in her sweat, \"Did you honestly think I wouldn't think of that?\"<br>\r\n\"Your kind ain't known for their intelligence,\" You taunted, even though you didn't think there was a stigma either way.<br>\r\nHer grin fell a bit before she gradually started to squeeze your head between her toes, \"You want me to kill you?\" She threatened, increasing the pressure.<br>\r\nYou winced and began to cry, but stayed silent, hoping only for it to be over soon, hoping to get away from this nightmare figure and her nasty feet.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it,\" She chuckled sadistically. \"You want me to kill you... Nope,\" She said as she relived the pressure. <br>\r\nNow you did begin you cry, this was beyond cruel, she was just going to prolong this for who knows how long. \"Please, just kill me,\" you whimper.<br>\r\n\"No,\" She said simply as she lifted her toes over your face, letting the sweat and dirt drip on your face in the most humiliating, stomach churning way as she wriggled her toes on your face as you winced in disgust. <br>\r\n\"No, I think I'll keep you as a foot cleaner. Might as well start now, I imagine the taste of my sweat will remind you of when you were little, hmm?\" She said as she pressed her enormous big toe on your pursed lips.<br>\r\nYour heart sank and you thought you might throw up just at the thought of what she was implying. <br>\r\n\"Open your mouth, little boy. Clean my big toe,\" She ordered, her face grinning evilly in anticipation. <br>\r\nYou refuse, tears still streaming from your eyes in terror and disgust at her feet.<br>\r\n\"Suck my toe, or things will just get worse from here.\"</span></div></div>",

Trust being essential in our relationship, if we wish to achieve our goals.\"<br>\r\n\"Did that have to be that long, couldn't you tell earlier?\" You ask, still skeptical and angered with the priestess.<br>\r\nThe priestess sighed, \"The incantation works as a form of hypnotization, like a dream shared with the spell caster, me, in this case. During this time, you fall into a deep trace, while I remain perfectly conscious, sharing your \"dream\" from an outside perspective, and in this case, took the form of your tormentor,\" she said, almost defeatedly. \"So time feels much longer for you, your minutes were my mere seconds,\" She said as she opened the door further to welcome you inside.<br>\r\nYou hesitate from entering to ask one more question, \"Did it really have to be that scenario?\"<br>\r\nThe priestess looks down at the ground and then back up at you, \"Your mind creates the scenario, not the spell caster, although once made a part of your nightmare, I had to keep up the illusion, if not, the spell would have failed. That and I have yet to master this particular spell, so it was, admittedly, flawed in it's casting and for that, I sincerely apologize.\" She stared at you a moment longer, conflict in her eyes, \"And I am also half monster, and my own desires may have influenced the outcome, but I can assure you, I never meant for... that.\"<br>\r\n\"Your half monster?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"Yes, and that is not information I normally volunteer. But for you, it is an offering of good faith.\"<br>\r\n\"How do I know, you are not just using a glamour?\" You ask one final question before making your decision whether to follow her or not.<br>\r\n\"Can you read my thoughts?\" She asks, showing a bit of impatience.<br>\r\n\"It's not likely,\" you shrug.<br>\r\n\"Well, your just going to have to trust me,\" She says, beckoning you to enter the temple.<br>\r\nYou sigh, you know you hadn't come all the ways up here to just walk away. You decide to follow her inside.<br>\r\nThe door closes shut behind you as you stare up at the large cathedral ceiling and intricately carved statues. <br>\r\n\"Before you ask the obvious,\" The priestess begins, glancing over her shoulder at you, \"I am half oni, but I maintain human form due to a combination of magic and genetic \"defects\". And I decided to become a priestess after witnessing first hand the horror the monsters inflict on the humans.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that why there are no other priests or priestesses up here with you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is also why I am not formally trained. I knew in most places I would be killed on sight unless I could figure out a way to blend in. So, when I came up here on this mountain, I found this temple, ruins overrun with wildlife when I first came upon it, but full of knowledge. I used this knowledge to teach myself to use magic, now I use this wherever I can, to help whoever I can,\" The priestess said as you and her walked through the halls.<br>\r\n\"I am also sure your wondering why I would send for you, a lowly village boy. What could I possibly need from you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"May have crossed my mind.\" You reply.<br>\r\n\"There is a task I need done, one you have an infinitely better chance of pulling off than I. But I knew you wouldn't stand a chance charging off into the unknown in your state, you'd be nothing but a piece of meat among wolves,\" She said, chuckling a bit.<br>\r\nYou feel a bit insulted as-.<br>\r\n\"Don't even start in feeling that way, I was just going to tell you that you have greatness, er, the potential of greatness. But charging off blindly would just be a waste, one far too many make. And after what happened when you were young, well, I feel a bit responsible for you. So, I want to start you off right.\"<br>\r\n\"And how is 'right', exactly?\" You ask.<br>\r\nShe turns around to look at you as you come to a fork in the halls, \"Depends on you,\" she says as she begin to point to the right hall. \"That way is the arena, I can teach you in the art of combat, and before you tell me that you know how to swing a sword, let me tell you that I've watched you train and in a real fight you'd more likely hurt yourself than any foe.\"<br>\r\nOnce again, you are insulted, but really, the more you think about it- on second thought-, no she really was right.<br>\r\n\"On the left is the mage tower and library, I can teach you to use magic and can enchant you and your weapons, armor, exedra. But-, let's just say, you won't like what some of that entails.\"<br>\r\n\"Why, what does it entail?\"<br>\r\n\"To learn fast, like you need to. Pain, disgust and fear, a lot of pain, disgust and fear. And trust, I'm big on that.\"<br>\r\nYou wipe your hand over your face, \"It's just lie one of those 'choose your own adventure' books,\" You lament.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One sardonic thought crossed your mind as you realized each path was to entail quite a bit of suffering: \"Why choose the lesser evil?\" And as stupid as the thought was you knew that, while the reasoning was skewed and more or less just your own ironic edgy humor acting up after a (hallucinated) traumatic event, the result would be the same. <br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" The Priestess hummed, looking at you, \"You want to learn magic, I had not expected that.\"<br>\r\n\"I was actually still thinking on it,\" You reply, starting to consider combat.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I can tell you will choose magic.\"<br>\r\nYou sigh, \"Okay, fine, what will the training entail?\"<br>\r\nThe Priestess turned walking further down the hall, her white robes trailing behind her, she wordlessly motioned for you to follow, \"You will not enjoy it. And for this reason, once you say yes, there will be no backing out, because you will try, and if I allow you to do that, you will not receive any power. So, as final confirmation-.\"<br>\r\nYou stop in defiance, knowing she's avoiding the topic, and at this point you feel a bit like you are being coerced into something you don't fully understand, \"No, you tell me what the hell you plan on doing to me before I consent to anything,\" You say firmly... The was before a wave of fear came over you as the woman, clad fully in white turned around to look at you, a bit of frustration in her icy eyes.<br>\r\n\"I understand your skepticism, boy, but I was the one that saved you from being stuck to Titania's foot when you were a child, and whatever that involved, so I don't think a bit of trust is too much to ask.\"<br>\r\nYou considered her words as you stared back at her. But before you could say anything, the Priestess' expression softened and she began to speak once more, this time quieter and less frustrated.<br>\r\n\"... But I gave you a choice, and the notion of freewill is meaningless of you are not properly informed,\" she said with a sigh.<br>\r\nThe Priestess walked up to you, almost uncomfortable close, \"Time is a commodity we do not have, you do no have. And magic, the kind that you use in the field, not in a temple, takes years to learn, traditionally that is, far longer than the human lifespan. So to get around this, an alternate path to the arcane had to be made, but like I said, it's not pretty... And you can wipe those fears from your mind I can promise you that you won't be losing any appendages,\" She says with a slight chuckle before returning to her more cerebral nature. \"No, it involves the fears or phobias of the learner, not just like a person with arachnophobia holding a tarantula either; prolonged exposure, periodically over a very long time\"<br>\r\n\"So, does it involve overcoming one's fear?\"<br>\r\n\"No, it involves experiencing fear, and engraining that fear into a person's mind so deep it will-... Yeah, you get the picture. And considering Titania already managed to plant the seed for that fear, and then there was that incident out there, no telling how far we will have to go to push it further, but while it will be harder, it will be quicker.\"<br>\r\n\"So you're going to throw me to a bunch of monsters and let them torture me?\" You ask, cringing slightly.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to periodically read an incantation to imbue you with magic, while I carry out the torture...\" The Priestess said as she reached down to unzip her boot before you could hardly process what she was doing. \"Just so you get an idea what this will be like,\" She said as she popped her foot out of the white boot.<br>\r\nThe horrifying stench clouded your senses immediately as her sweat literally dripped to the floor from the tips of her large toes. You gag on the stench as you question how and why, such an inconceivably angelic figure would have such feet.<br>\r\n\"I told you, just because I'm on your side doesn't mean I'm not still a monster,\" She said as she spread her foul toes, allowing her toe jam to ooze from the crevices, your eyes began to water at the smell and your mind race as you realized what she was going to do to you.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"It's been so long,\" She laments under her breath almost orgasmically, and so quiet you could only barely make out what was said.</font><br>\r\nYou look back up at her and for a split second she had a slight, sadistic smile as she stared back at you before snapping back to her more sensible side.<br>\r\n\"I really am sorry, if I could pass this task to anyone else I would,\" She says regretfully.<br>\r\nYou sigh while you nod your head slightly, now knowing what this meant, cringing all while you accepted.<br>\r\n\"I do hope we can still be friends though, y'know, outside of our sessions,\" The Priestess says awkwardly, \"Just try to think of me differently when I'm-, okay?\"<br>\r\n***If you, on the off chance decide not to pursue this path, just refer back to the previous chapter.***</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortunately, the Priestess had some mercy and allowed you get settled in a room within the temple and get some rest after everything you had been through, before putting you under her feet. Unfortunately however, was the place you were put; the basement. The dark, dank, basement. Even worse, it seemed to be some sort of prison, even worse than that was how large the cells were, it didn't take you long to deduce what these cells were made to hold. But even as large as the room was, you felt a bit claustrophobic, and that may have to do with the lack of bars and more in line of big metal doors with a little circular window. It felt like solitary confinement.<br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry, kid, I cleared out the monsters and creepy crawlies down here ages ago,\" Said the familiar voice from the doorway of your cell/room.<br>\r\nYour turned as you prepared your bed, slightly startled, and then even more startled when you saw the Priestess' eyes giving off a faint blue glow on the shadows, fortunately though she had put her boots back on.<br>\r\n\"I am sorry you have to be down here though, it always freaked me out a bit down here. But, it is the safest place to be,\" She said with a sigh, \"It is for this reason, I have decided to accompany you down here.\"<br>\r\nYou look at her a moment, she looked at you with a sort of kindness not unlike a mother gives a scared child, and while you appreciated this kindness, you didn't want her to think of you as a lamb that must be babied. \"You mean, you'll-?\" You asked, motioning with your eyes to the bed, an awkward look your face.<br>\r\nThe Priestess looked from you to the bed before giving a warm chuckle, \"No, that's not what I meant. I'm going to be down the hall a few blocks, so if you need anything just knock,\" She said, seeming to try and give a reassuring smile, but from the shadows where she was, and considering her teeth and lips seemed to give off a slight glow with some sort of magic as well, she just seemed creepy. And she seemed to notice your disconcertion and in her attempt to lighten your view of her she changed her expression to a more playful one, but she looked even creepier, like a predator stalking it's prey through the dark.<br>\r\n\"And if I, y'know, hear anything over here, I just wanted you to know I won't shame you for it or anything. I understand people have urges, I mean how do you think I stayed up here so long without going crazy?\" She continued, never breaking eye contact.<br>\r\nThe more she talked the more you felt really uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"In fact if you want maybe I could come over and help-...\" She continued, stepping out of the shadows toward you before pausing and really looking at your face. She gave a forced giggle, \"Um, that was a joke. Why are you-...?\"<br>\r\nAs soon as she said that you did the first thing you knew how to lighten the tension, \"Oh, haha, now I get it. Ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\nThe Priestess paused as she watched you spare her the continuing feeling of awkwardness, \"Yeah, see, I've got a sense of humor,\" She said with slightly less forced laughter.<br>\r\nYou went back to setting up your room as you carried on the giggling comically long, \"Seriously though, you don't need to move down here with me, I'll be fine. I mean, I don't want to-...\"<br>\r\nThe Priestess looked at you more troubled now, \"Kid, I just can't stay up there in my cozy bed knowing you're down here, especially considering everything I'm going to have put you through,\" She said, her voice quiet and full of guilt.<br>\r\nYou nod your head slightly, feeling a bit of pity for the Priestess. This wasn't going to be easy on either of you.<br>\r\nThe Priestess looked back up you, a bit of forced playfulness returning, \"So instead I've decided to stay in my cozy bed down here... That was also a joke,\" She said smiling toward you. \"G'night, kid.\"<br>\r\nYou give her a small smile back as she closes your door.<br>\r\nThen, you realize that this was a prison cell and she just shut the door-.<br>\r\n\"I removed the locks,\" The Priestess yelled from down the hall, putting you at ease a bit.<br>\r\nYou climbed into your hammock and produced a book on magic you had picked up from the temple's library before putting out the gas sconce above your head and going to sleep.<br>\r\nBut during the darkness of sleep something happens... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) &lt;\u2014 Pay no attention to Lenny.</font><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are surrounded by waves, waves of air and noise in the light. You feel the colors blue, white, and black as you float as nothing through nothing. It was like-.<br>\r\n<i>Squeak. Squeeeak.</i><br>\r\nYour mind started to return to reality as the quiet but still sharp sound of rusty hinges echoed in your skull.<br>\r\n<i>Clink.</i> That sound was unmistakably the sound of door closing.<br>\r\nIt took a few short moments for your physical body to start to respond to your mind's commands and once it did, you opened your eyes to nothing but complete crushing blackness. There was an all to familiar, foul smell in the air, and a weight on your chest. <br>\r\nAs you realized what was happening you felt something lightly trace across your lips with an unnerving giggle, your eyes went wide, you clenched your mouth shut and bolted up.<br>\r\n\"That ain't gonna save ya, kid,\" The Priestess said with a chuckle as she pushed your head back down into your pillow by lightly stomping your face with her huge grimy foot.<br>\r\nShe reached up and flicked on the gas light, revealing her form. She was a fairly small oni, standing over you at around 12 feet tall, but still enormous to you, with two small horns sticking out of her long and wild white hair. Covering her was a white, torn, translucent gown, which also served to hammer home the dissonance of a monster torturing you while looking like an angel. Her skin was so pale it was almost luminous in the darkness, and now that she was fully transformed, her eyes mouth, and even her nails really did glow. <br>\r\nYou stared up at her from beneath one of her massive soles as she wriggled her sweaty toes over your nose, almost drowning you in her foul toe jam and stench. <br>\r\nThe Priestess grinned widely down at you, and that was enough for tears to start welling in your eyes under the weight of the torture and extreme terror.<br>\r\nThen she lifted her foot to inspect your face and stared at you a moment before giving a girlish but unmistakably evil laugh, \"There's my fucking footprint of sweat on your face,\" She said between laughing hysterically.<br>\r\nIn your mind you asked yourself how such a woman you had known could be so-, so evil. This was the woman who had saved your life from something like this, she had been kind, almost motherly even. But now she was some kind of nightmarish torturer, not just doing what had to be done, but enjoying it and going as far as to humiliate you.<br>\r\nThe Priestess continued laughing before lifting her foot over your face again, the sweat and grime dripping on your face from the tips of her blue glowing toes, \"Oh well, I suppose I should probably get on with the incantation,\" She said with a sigh.<br>\r\n\"You've not been doing that-?!\" You scream.<br>\r\nThe Priestess planted her foot back on your face, again drenching you in the filth of her soles, \"I think I'll enchant you with increased durability and endurance first, it'll enhance your physical form,\" She said, running a finger down her jaw. She laughed again, \"Well, if you thought endless exercises were brutal, this is how you get fit...\" She grabbed your face with her toes, leaving you to scream in the suffocating prison of sweat and toe jam, \"... The bad way,\" She quipped before releasing your now sweat-drenched face.<br>\r\nYou laid back choking on the stench as you desperately attempted to catch your breath, the smell was so thick around your head now you could cut it with a knife. As you breathed and gagged on the smell of the Priestess' toes you found yourself beginning to pass out, your vision was distorting and going dark, and your reality started to shift. <br>\r\n\"Oh, no you don't,\" The Priestess said with a bit of panic as she \"lightly\" slapped your face with her foot. <br>\r\nEven as your mind started to slip you could still feel the waves of magic hitting you, forcing you back to the horrifying reality. <br>\r\n\"Sorry kid, but if you go unconscious, this is all for nothing, I really don't want that,\" She said as the spell brought you wide awake again.<br>\r\nYou looked up at the Priestess, and even as she held you beneath her feet, her face seemed to spell compassion and guilt once more- before morphing back into once of gleeful sadism.<br>\r\n\"Alright, kid, I'm going to start but first, I'm going to have you open your mouth,\" She said tapping her big toe on your mouth, and already you could feel the sweat coating your lips.<br>\r\nYou shake your head, knowing she will take any chance she can get to drive her toes in your mouth.<br>\r\nThe Priestess grits her teeth impatiently, \"I said; OPEN WIDE, KID!\" She says as she painfully shoves her big toe into your mouth. <br>\r\nYou sob pitifully as she begins the incantation. The Priestess' toe got to know every single tastebud in your mouth, swirling it around as you drank down her foot sweat.<br>\r\nYou try to focus on the goal, but this is too much, and just plain cruel, and you knew under no circumstances would she stop. You bite down hard on her toe, but it does nothing but scrape off more grime for you to swallow.<br>\r\nThe Priestess smiled down at you as you attempted this, \"I should make you do that all over my foot, give it a real deep clean,\" She said with a chuckle before forcing her other four toes into your mouth as well.<br>\r\nNow, your jaw felt like it was going to break as she wriggled her toes on your tongue. You almost forgot that the dirt and sweat, or even the stench wasn't the worst thing in store for you. It was the toe jam, and now that all five toes were in your mouth you could start to feel it ooze onto your tongue.<br>\r\n\"No! No! No! No!\" You try and scream as you flay around, trying anything to escape before you really taste it.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you wondering what my toe gunk tastes like?\" The Priestess says, making your heart drop in horror.<br>\r\nYou sob, violently shaking your head, begging her not to do what you knew she would.<br>\r\nThe Priestess grabs hold of you tongue with her nasty toes. Now, you got the full effect of the foul substance as it covered your tongue. You screamed as best as you could due to the overload of nastiness.<br>\r\nThe Priestess laughed as you tried in vain to pull your tongue back, then she kicked it up a notch by running your tongue through the crevices of each of her toes, making you lick out all the sweat and toe grunge there. <br>\r\nAt this point all you could do is cry in despair as you were used, as you were made to suck and swallow the filth. <br>\r\nThe Priestess seemed to note your despair and resignation with a curious tilt of her head, but you were sure she was more concerned with the lack of fear now. She even wiggled her toes inside your mouth and shoved her feet further into your mouth to get a reaction. And she did, but nothing on the level she wanted. <br>\r\nThe Priestess pulled her toes out of your mouth before inspecting her now clean toes, \"It's been ages since I've had a proper foot worship session like that,\" She said, finally moving off of you. \"The effects of that incantation should take effect by tomorrow,\" She said before turning to look at you, \"Oh yeah, I gotta thank you for that, kid. And, I'm also sorry,\" She said with a mix of sadistic joy and compassionate shame before walking toward the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Priestess turns around to you just as she was going to leave, a huge smile on her face, \"Actually, I think I want to play a game with you,\" She says with glee.<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" You say with your voice cracking a bit as, just when you thought the nightmare had ended, you were being dragged back in.<br>\r\n\"No?\" She asked mockingly, walking toward you, uncomfortably close as she leaned down to you, asserting her power over you. \"You should be happy, you're getting what you wanted, you think the kind of power you came up here for will come easy? Did you expect? You think the monster out in the wilds will be so kind as to simply lie down for you?\" She yelled into your face like a drill sergeant before grabbing you by the neck and throwing you to the ground.<br>\r\nHer grip, nor the landing all that painful, but her sudden outburst was frightening. You stare up at her as she shoves her other, still horrendously filthy foot over you, effectively pinning you below her.<br>\r\n\"I should see if we can squeeze in another incantation right now,\" The Priestess said as she spread her toes and the toe jam began oozing over your face as you wretched and heaved in disgust.<br>\r\n\"But that would be boring,\" She said as she lifted her foot off of you.<br>\r\nThe Priestess moved across the room from you, her dirty foot leaving prints of filth on the floor, she turned back around toward you, \"You should go hide,\" She said, pointing her toe at you, \"This temple is huge, you should have no problem staying hidden until morning.\"<br>\r\nYou shudder at the idea of playing hide and seek with this woman, in a dark, seemingly infinite series of ancient rooms and hallways.<br>\r\n\"But if I catch you, guess what I'll do?\" The Priestess says excitedly. \"I am going to shrink you, and put you in my boot for the morning. Believe me, hell could not compare,\" She said with a cruel laugh.<br>\r\nYou stared back at her, wide eyed, you did not want to find out what the inside of her footwear was like.<br>\r\n\"Run,\" She whispers, her grin growing unnervingly wide.<br>\r\nYou bolt up off the floor and almost trip over yourself down the halls of the basement before heading up the stairs into the main floor of the temple. As you ran out into the larger than life halls, any sense of exhaustion was lost on you. Maybe it was the endurance incantation working quicker than expected due to the trauma, or maybe it was the images of The Priestess' grimy, sweaty feet flashing in your mind, and the thought of what being inside her boots would be like that worked like a horse whip. <br>\r\nWhat concerned you more than running out of steam was the fact that your footsteps echoed loudly through the halls as you ran across the pale moonbeams that shined through the ceiling. <br>\r\nYou looked behind you as you ran, even though you knew that not looking behind you was practically the first rule of running away from things. But there was nothing but a dark, empty hall behind you. You turned forward again before rounding a corner. You weren't thinking as you turned, and only after the point of no return did you think that around sharp corners is one of the stock places to hide.<br>\r\nBut there was nothing, just an empty hall, again.<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief as you look around for a way out of the hall. <br>\r\n\"Fee fy fo fum, kid,\" The Priestess's voice calls out from behind you.<br>\r\nYou freeze and look behind you. She wasn't on the same hall as you, but she was definitely on the same level, and approaching, thought rather slowly judging by the speed of the footsteps, and... yep, it sounded like she had her boots on.<br>\r\nQuickly thinking, you ran past a door next on the side of the hall and pulled it open before slamming it shut, only for it to slowly creak back, leaving it slightly ajar. You then quickly hid behind one of the many large pillars that lined the halls further down.<br>\r\nAnd behind the pillar you breathed as quietly as possible as you heard the footsteps approaching down the hall.<br>\r\n<i>Click, click. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Click, click.</font> <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Click, click.</font></i><br>\r\nYou shook with fear behind the pillar as she walked behind it, your hands came up and covered your mouth and nose to prevent your heavy breathing to be heard, as you waited for her to leave.<br>\r\nBehind the pillar you could hear the Priestess humming to herself as she walked through the doorway, even going as far as to lock the door behind her, thinking she would have you locked in.<br>\r\nYou waited a few moments, still not comfortable with really trying to catch your breath as you heard her tear the other room apart searching for you.<br>\r\nAfter a few short seconds more you sneakily snuck over to the other side of the hall to find another door. You found a large set of double doors fairly quickly and, as quietly as possible you opened the door and crept inside.<br>\r\nYou found yourself at a stairwell, and deciding that the Priestess would probably think you were on the same level you decided to head up to the top floor, the attic would probably be the best.<br>\r\nEventually, you reached the end of the ascent at the third floor, careful to always be on the alert for the Priestess coming up behind you. But that was the advantage her wearing boots to intimidate gave you, you could be quiet while she could not.<br>\r\nYou opened the door to the top floor you doubted if it was the attic though, and to your surprise you were in a tower that had been fashioned into a bedroom that overlooked the entire mountain and the plains below that.<br>\r\nLooking out the window you could see the lights from your village and off in the distance you could see the faint glow of the city of Galdran on the horizon. No wonder The Priestess always knew when your village needed aid, all she ever had to do was look out her damn window.<br>\r\nAnd as if the very thought of her beckoned her to you, you could hear the distinct clicking of the Priestess' high heeled boots coming the stairs. Panic started to set in as you frantically looked around the room for a place to hide.<br>\r\nUnder the bed, maybe. Yeah, you might as well climb into her boots yourself, that would be the first place she'd check.<br>\r\nBut as you looked around the room more, and as her footsteps got closer and closer, you realized you were out of time, and out of options. Under the bed it was then.<br>\r\nOpening the door the first thing you saw from under the mattress was her white boots, now much larger than the last time you had seen them due to her now 12 foot tall form. You once again held your breath as she began to search the room.</span></div></div>",

Even as quick as the smell of her foot clouded the air around you, the dread hit you quicker, the moment that you heard her giggle, you knew you were fucked.<br>\r\n\"I can hear your breathing dow there, kid,\" The Priestess said as she stepped toward you, her right foot making a disgusting squishing noise every time it made contact with the floor.<br>\r\nIn panic you quickly crawl out from under the bed in an attempt to put some distance between the two of you.<br>\r\nInstead you felt the Priestess' foot step onto the back of your head, holding you in place at the floor, \"You played a good game, I'll admit I even had to use a few sense heightening spells to find you. I didn't think I'd have to use that. And even then you lasted a lot longer than I thought you would,\" She rambled as you struggled to  remove her foot as her sweat trickled down onto your face.<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure to give you a useful enchantment while you're in my boots, I'm thinking...-\" The Priestess said, wriggling her toes before you felt a slight decrease in pressure.<br>\r\nYou knew this was your moment and with a burst of adrenaline you took it without hesitation. You reached back and grabbed hod of her ankle before twisting it just enough for her to lose balance. <br>\r\nThe Priestess stumbled back, her glowing eyes wide with sudden fright as you crawled to other side of the room, \"Good one, you're just full of surprises tonight!\" She said with an unnervingly aroused grin.<br>\r\nYou wordlessly picked yourself up off the floor trying to keep the bed between the two of you, your heart beating in your ears as you tried to think you way out of this situation.<br>\r\nThe Priestess glowered menacingly at you, her eyes shining through the strands of hair that hung down over her face. Never breaking eye contact she reached down and picked up her boot, \"Tell you what, kid, if you can get past me and back out that door, I'll let you loose. But if I catch you, and, let's be honest, we both know I will, I am going to leave you in my boots for at least until...\" She said, looking back at the clock as you followed her gaze, \"Until 7:00 in the morning I guess,\" She said casually.<br>\r\nThat was going to be around 6 hours, and you knew that was going to be 6 hours too long to be under her feet.<br>\r\nYou reached over and grabbed a small clock on the nightstand and held it in throwing position, ready to pitch it at her before you made your dash behind her.<br>\r\nThe Priestess pulled her boot back in a similar position, and as you panicked and decided to throw the clock as well, she decided to throw her boot as well.<br>\r\nAlmost instantly everything went dark for you as your body fell backward onto the floor, and as soon as you took a breath you realized you head was inside her boot. You coughed and gagged on the stench in the darkness as you reached up to pull the boot off of you. But before you could you felt The Priestess' body fall on top of you<br>\r\n\"Nice arm!\" The Priestess exclaimed as she pulled her boot off of your head, revealing her batshit insane face. But instantly you noticed a small bit of blood coming from her mouth where you assume the clock hit her. <br>\r\n\"But now, I gotta punish you for that,\" She said, \"Yeah, not only are you spending the next several hours in my boot, your mouth is staying open as well,\" She said with a loud howl of laughter. \"And you know what that means.\"<br>\r\nYou began to cry, but you knew this was a losing battle to fight her, so in desperation, you tried to appeal to her humanity, \"Please don't you scream,\" you're voice cracking under the weight of despair. <br>\r\nThe Priestess looked at you with glee as she stood up over you, pinning you beneath her sole, \"Oh beg some more. I love how you cry beneath my nasty feet,\" She said as she reached down her underwear and started to moan an incantation.<br>\r\nWith that you started to get smaller as her foot got bigger and bigger until your whole body was beneath it, and you knew that whatever humanity she had before was gone now, she was fully a monster.<br>\r\nAs soon as The Priestess thought you were small enough to fit comfortably (for her) in her boot she stepped off of you and held you in front of her face, \"Before I debilitate your jaw, I want to hear you beg one more time for me to spare you,\" She said, a sadistic twinkle in her eye.<br>\r\n\"Fuck you,\" You blurt out.<br>\r\nThe Priestess laughed, \"Keep talking like that and I might put you down there so you can do it yourself. In time, I probably will,\" She said before saying a few magical words to open your mouth and then dropping you down into her boot.<br>\r\nBefore you even hit the sweaty insole with a nauseating squish you were inhaling the paralyzing footstench inside the foul chasm. You stood up and realized with disgust that you nearly stuck to the soaking insole. And this was up on the heel part of the high heeled boot, and you could not help but dread what it was like down in the toe area.<br>\r\n\"Her comes my nasty foot,\" The Priestess said with a chuckle as she lowered her foot down into the boot, her toes wriggling in excitement as she stared into your frightened eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Where do you end up beneath her foot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder her heel you will be painfully smashed and ground into the insole (You cannot be crushed while shrunk), you will likely be eating dead skin and dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder her toes will be fairly painless (unless The Priestess decides to squeeze you between her toes), but you will be swamped in footsweat and will probably be eating more toe grunge than you ever wanted to.</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You fell onto your back with a slight splash of foot sweat. <br>\r\nYou moaned in disgust as you dragged yourself through the 1 inch (to you) layer of foot sweat to the end of the boot to maybe at least spare yourself the horror of being caught beneath The Priestess' toes. But you were too late as her wriggling toes quickly slid over you as your mouth was held open by some terrible magic, all you could do was scream in terror and revulsion.<br>\r\nThe inside of the boot would have been completely dark if for the light radiating off of the Priestess' toe nails that allowed you to see up close the unholy torment that was to befall you. It was just like being under her feet before but this time the stench was magnified 100 fold and when her sweat and toe jam oozed over your face and into your mouth, it covered your entire head.<br>\r\nAs you were forced to drink The Priestess' foot sweat and eat out the toe jam from the crevices between her toes your body began to convulse and spurt and sputter as the tears ran down your face. You gagged and coughed, and you didn't know why you did not vomit, but you guessed that the only reason you were not throwing up, blacking out, or even dying from the smell and taste of her feet was some sort of magic she was imbuing you with.<br>\r\nYou could feel the Priestess sit down, even though she kept the pressure of her toes on your face on as she forced you to lick underneath and between each of her toes, the stomach churning taste in you mouth making you sob in despair. <br>\r\nThen you heard her start to moan an incantation, and you knew exactly what she was doing, \"Cry for me,\" She purred as she scrunched and kneaded your head under her toes, drowning you in her foul sweat as she rubbed her toes over your face. <br>\r\nThis continued for several minutes as the Priestess moaned along with your cries inside her footwear, until you felt her shake and shudder as she finished the incantation. \"Fuck! Titania may be a bitch but she sure knows how to have fun!\" She exclaimed. \"You can go ahead and blackout now, but I think I'm just going to keep going,\" The Priestess said before she lifted her toes over your face before trapping your face underneath her big toe as she forced you to lick the grime from it.<br>\r\nAfter whatever magic bind to reality was severed, it was not long before you drifted off into blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor hours you remained just vaguely aware of what was being done to you, that was until you awoke to the sound of the Priestess' soft, sprightly humming and, to your horror, you were still trapped under her toes. But seemed different, for one, you were seemed a bit larger, enough so your legs were down on either side of her heel and your head was still beneath her toes. And also, it appeared either you were large enough, or the Priestess was now small enough for the tip of her big toe to be inside your mouth. And when you looked over you noticed that the only light down in the boot now was from what looked like a giant glow stick that cast a greenish light.<br>\r\nYou groaned and shook your head as you tried to spit out The Priestess' toe.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're awake,\" The Priestess said, her voice back to being what you had come to expect from her, without the taunting madness and sadism that had rang in her tone hours ago. And you would have thought she was back to normal if not for the fact that you were still being kept under her feet.<br>\r\nThe Priestess pulled her toe out of your mouth as she continued humming, \"I'm sorry about last night, but I do think you'll be happy with the effects of the incantation,\" She said with obviously feigned professionalism.<br>\r\nYou wanted to burst out screaming at her in anger but unfortunately your jaw still wasn't working.<br>\r\n\"It's only a few minutes to 7:00, I'll let you out then,\" She said with a slight shift of her weight off of you.<br>\r\nShit, she really took that schedule seriously.<br>\r\nOver the next several minutes it seemed The Priestess' toes were either trying to rush into your open mouth, squeeze your head beneath them, or cram your face into the filth between them. Needless to say, it was a long few minutes, but it wasn't any worse than anything else you had endured.<br>\r\nAbove you could could feel The Priestess begin walking as almost every step had accompanying it the unpleasant sensations of having the breath stomped out of you, and one of her toes jamming into your mouth.<br>\r\n\"I made breakfast,\" The Priestess said, wriggling a toe in your mouth, \"I'm just going to take you to the shower and get you back to normal size. Or I mean, I could just keep you that size, you'd certainly be easier to hide if trouble were to come by,\" She mentioned, sending a bit of fear through you as you considered being held captive by this crazy woman. \"But, on second thought, I think you've proved yourself fairly adequate in combat. I underestimated you once, I don't make the same mistake twice,\" She said cheerfully as you heard a door open. \"My mouth still kinda hurts, still, I think the clock took the brunt of it,\" She added under her breath, reminding you of the clock incident.<br>\r\nYou felt the Priestess sit down before she reached down the pull her boot off.<br>\r\nYou felt her foot slide off of you, leaving you to wallow in her foot sweat before the boot was tipped upside down and you fell out drowning you in blinding light for the first time in what felt like eternity. And suddenly you were laying on a white tile floor in an almost complexly white, sterile room that you could only assume was the showers. And you were normal sized, which came as a shock after hours of being only inches tall. Slowly the blinding whiteness ceased and you regained control of your numb mouth.<br>\r\nYou wordlessly glowered up at the Priestess as she sat on the bench in front of you, the only remainder of her oni form being the two little horns protruding from her platinum hair. And then there was the slight split in her lip as a reminder of the fight, as if either of you needed another one.<br>\r\nThe Priestess stared back at you for a moment before diverting her gaze in guilt, \"I'm really, <i>really</i> sorry, kid-.\"<br>\r\n\"Fuck off,\" You managed to hiss through the numbness in your jaw.<br>\r\nThe Priestess continued to stare into space, hardly reacting to your outburst. \"Yeah, I deserved that,\" She sighed softly before standing up, \"I'll be out in the dining room when you come out, you can call me all the names you want when over breakfast,\" She said as she walked out of the room, leaving the door to swing back and forth in her wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Why is this sentence here?

Every corner of your mouth begun to ache as feeling returned. All the saliva normally swirling around tastes like it's been replaced by the Priestesses sharp salty foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds of spitting followed. After, you pick yourself up and turn on the shower. The water did little to ease your distress. The smell of vinegar and fine cheese seemingly burnt into your nose, the only part of your body in more pain than your jaw. You rinse your mouth out a few times, your tongue finding a layer of toe gunk caught between each set of your gums and cheek. You clear it out with your finger after the near paralyzing refresher. After a few more painful rinses you decide to stop. You aren't sure if the smell had left you, or if it ever would, but you were hungry for something that wasn't foot funk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk toward the dining room, slowly as you lament facing the priestess. Thoughts swirl through your mind on what to say. You wanted to curse her out. Scream over the terrible torments you have had to suffer. AND for her torturing you this morning in her \"nice\" mode. Though, you gained two powers that would have taken you years of experience otherwise, and triggering the priestesses crulelty is not on the top of your to-do list. Perhaps she feels a small fraction of the terrible pain you feel? You bend the corner and see the priestess sitting at a dining table, a plate set for you.</span></div></div>",

The maiden turns around and clears all the holy objects off from the top of the altar, all of the divine symbols of your goddess tossed aside so that she may have a proper place to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the altar as a makeshift bench the mysterious girl crosses one leg over the other so that her foot swings freely just a few inches from your face. You are filled with confusion and anger, unsure of what exactly to make of this situation before you. Reaching down she slides her heel out of her shoe and lets her footwear dangle lazily from her toes. As you crane your neck up to look at her you finally notice the faint shimmering of magic around her. Of course, it all makes sense now, she used illusion magic to make herself appear human, a trap commonly used by powerful monster girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you only now just realizing your foolish mistake little knight?\" She laughs down from her position above you, clearly this isn't her first time using this trick. \"You boys always fall for the simple damsel in distress trick, you make it all too easy for me!~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Who?...\" You try too speak but you mind is still reeling, still attempting to make sense of all of this. \"Just what...are you exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you still don't even know what hit you huh? How sad...\" She then moved the toe of her shoe under your chin and moved your head so that you were looking up into her eyes. \"Maybe if you show me the proper respect I deserve I will grant you the honor of knowing who so easily bested you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You want me to beg?...\" You swallow hard and struggle to maintain eye contact with her, the power she radiates is strange and almost otherworldly. \"...Just for a simple introduction?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile gently fades away from her face, \"Are you seriously that dense? You are in no position to start questioning me! Now quit stalling and do as I say!\" She leans in, her hungry purple eyes glare at you with a barely restrained anger. \"Unless you want me to force you into obedience, go ahead and try me.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no doubt about it. The fox-like ears coming out of her flowing, golden hair, as well as a set of 9 golden tails twirling behind her could mean only one thing: you were facing a kitsune, and an incredibly powerful one at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's body was that of a human woman, a mature and beautiful one at that. With kitsune it's hard to tell if it's her body, of a possessed one, or a trick, a mirage masking a more hideous form. Regardless of its origins, you had to admit that this monster girl had good taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes only added to her looks. She was wearing a traditional outfit similar to those worn by ancient shrine maidens: a yellow hakama over a white kimono. On her feet was a pari of tall, black geta, adorned with golden waves. On her left foot was a red-white sock, which weirdly enough reminded you of something, or someone. By contrast, her right foot was resting in her geta without a sock, completely bare to the world, giving you a good look at her long, gold-painted toenails, although calling them \"claws\" would be just as accurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has something caught your attention?\" the monster girl asked in a mocking tone, intrigued by the attention you were giving her feet. You quickly shifted your eyes to look into her own. As red as a ground cherry they were, you didn't like that at all. It remineded you of that oni girl. You took a fighting stance, ready to attack at any moment. First things first, though, you needed some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wretched fiend! What business have you here? This sacred place is off-limits to you kind!\" Even though you tried to come as intimidating, the kitsune responded with a giggle, once that made you quite uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teehee, you're such a cute little thing, I almost feel sorry for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for me!?\" You shouted back \"Answers my question, or you'll be the one regretting this encounter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox girl stopped laughing, but the smile still lingered on her lips. *Sigh* \"Silly boys these days, always confusing bravery with bravado.\" She began to stare at the sky as she continued \"Aw, what the hell, you're not leaving this place anyway, so I might as well tell you what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox sat down at the steps of the shrine, inviting you to do the same. You weren't foolish enough to fall for an obvious trick, especially after that \"not leaving\" part, but you did sheath your weapon. The kisune loudly sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself. Now, handsome knight, to answer that question of yours. I'm here on a special errand from the Monster Queen herself. My task was to deal with a human uprising, led by the previous owner of this shrine. As you might guess, I was successful, and the insurgence has been dealt with. Currently I'm waiting here for the Monster Queen's next orders, while dealing with the occasional intruders, be it other valiant heros like you, praygin for a blessing, but getting a curse instead, or common burglars, seeking riches, and paying dearly for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it could, your jaw would most definitely be on the floor. This kitsune, an agent of the Monster Queen herself? She must be even more powerful than you thought. To bring the priestess down, as well as a whole army down with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W... W-what happened to the priestess?\" You asked, visibly shaking, clearly overwhelmed by the information you just received \"W-where i-is she? She c-couldn't h-have d... d-d-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Died? Hah, don't make me laugh, that would be too simple, and too light of a punishment for her. She's currently being punished for her transgressions againt the Monster Queen. The punishment is supposed to last 100 years, but I give her 10 years before she snaps and dies. Still better than her men, they just have to last 10 years, yet each one of them snaps after just a day of punishment. I took a small break from punishing them, see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said it, the kitsune took her right foot out of her geta, and rose it towards your face, giving you a good look at its sole, and what a dirty sole it was. From her to toes, it was covered in sweat, with some lint and dirt stuck to it. Even though you were quite a distance away from here, a peculiar smell reached your nostrils. The funky smell was definitely coming from her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, a foul beast indeed. I wouldn't expect the likes of you, even this high in hierarchy, to take good care of your bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl pouted, before giving you a toothy grin, shwoing off her fangs. \"Aw, don't be so mean. You'll change your mind soon, you'll have no choice but to live with it for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" You asked, half out of fear, but half out of curiosity \"What does your punishment entail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitsune giggled maniacally, creeping you out. \"You still haven't figured it out? I turned them all into socks! And I'll turn you into one too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. Complete and utter silence. You were slwoly processing what she just said. With each second your face was getting paler and paler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... Socks? You turn people into socks?...\" Your looked at the kitsune's left foot \"Then that means it's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BINGO!\" the monster girl shouted, enthusiastically taking her left foot of the geta and raising it next to the left one, giving you a good look at the red-white striped sock. It was relatively clean, though there were some darker spots on it, no doubt caused by the fox's sweating. Those stains would forever taint the priestess' body and appearance, were she to ever be released from this torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, though the girl was foolish, she does make a very good sock. She's going to last me for a good while. Who knows, maybe she will survive those 100 years. I wouldn't bet on it if I were you.\" The girl put back both of her feet into the geta, and began to slowly walk towards you. \"The same can't be said for my other socks. They wear out so easily. A tear here, a tear there, and before you know it, it's completely unusable. I then have to destroy it, and bind the human's soul to my foot for all eternity. It feels quite nice, but I'd rather just have another good sock. Will you be the one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue wisps began to form at the tips of the monster girl's nine tails, and her eyes began to glow blue as well. She was quickly whispering something under her nose, most likely a curse that turned so many humans before you into her footwear. You had to act fast, you don't want to end up as a sock, but you also want to help the priestess! What to do, what to do!?</span></div></div>",

The Kitsune girl, confused by this action, stops her muttering. \"What are y-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please spare me! I'm just a fool who...ugh...w-who...\" Now that you're on your knees like this, her foot odor is tainting every breath you take! It's horrible! And she's got her damn geta on! \"w...who-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox suddenly bursts out into laughter! For a good twenty seconds, she merely laughs at you as you suffer on her foot stench and try to keep your breakfast down long enough to keep begging. \"Finally! A human who knows his place! In all the centuries I've been alive, this is the first time I've seen one of your kind actually use his brain! A shame you already seem to be having trouble with my feet.

Your eyes widen at the implication. \"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thaaaat's right! What you're smelling right now is far weaker than normal! I've been around for nearly a millennium! Surely you didn't think THIS was the scent of nearly a thousand years without washing my feet!\" She wiggles her foul toes and you nearly throw up from the stench it kicks up! \"Hmmm...alright! Since you're the first human to give me the proper respect...I'll go easy on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-easy?\" You ask. Given that this is apparently a super weak version of her foot odor, you're not sure you can even handle easy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm! We're going to play a little game! If you win, you can have the priestess back. If you lose, I'll bestow a curse upon you! The curse will make you unable to refuse anyone who asks you to sniff their feet. Annnd...you'll never acclimate to the smell~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and if I don't want to play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes begin to glow blue again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! What's the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple! It's a guessing game! I'm going to take you back to a village of Kitsune and blindfold you! Then you're going to sniff nine pairs of feet and guess how many tails each girl has! If you get more right than wrong...you win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillingly sniffing monster girl feet!? \"You've got to be joking! That's disgusting! I'll never-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of sock do you want to be? Low cut? A stocking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...when do we leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune giggles and pulls her bare foot out of its sandal. \"Right now!\" She mashes the foul thing against your face, and now her eyes glow purple! \"Sniff.\" Suddenly, you find yourself taking in a deep whiff! And holy hell does it reek! Your eyes cross as the nasty stench slams into your mind! It's so...f...foul...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything goes black.</span></div></div>",

It's muffled though, so you can't make out what they're saying. Eventually, the door opens, and you hear two sets of footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" You hear the Nine-Tail say. \"Now just put your foot on his nose, take the barrier down, and tell him to sniff!\" Barrier? Why would...oh, they're keeping you from getting extra whiffs to guess from. Damn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune in question walks up, giggling to herself as she does. \"You ready for my stinky feet? Doesn't matter!\" She mashes your face beneath a filthy foot. \"Sniff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid of what will happen if you don't comply, you brace yourself and take a deep whiff only to immediately recoil and hit the back of the cage! Eugh! That's horrible! You cough and rub your nose, trying to clear out the horrible stench. Your eyes are watering! \"U...ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well human? How many tails do I have? Hmmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheesh...you can practically hear the smugness coming from her! You don't have much context for Kitsune foot odor, but given that you didn't pass out, she's probably on the low end. \"Uuuhhh...three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong!\" She shouts. \"I've only got one tail! You're bad at this. Hope you're looking forward to one of us making your dick stink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear her skip away, leaving you with one thought. ONE tail!? Her feet are that bad at ONE!? You've made a grave mistake in agreeing to this. Though..given the alternative...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're thinking, the next Kitsune enters the room. \"Come, human. I haven't got all day.\" You sigh and crawl forward until you reach the front of the cage and another foot presses on your face. \"Sniff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is going to be hell, isn't it? You grimace and sni-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, you wake back up. \"Th...that was revolting! How in the world can anything have feet so foul!?\" You'd only experienced the stench for a brief moment, but it was nothing short of pure hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You clearly don't have much experience with our kind. Answer the question, human. How many tails do I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nine! I can't imagine anything smelling worse than th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong. I have seven. Are you sure this human is worth the effort to curse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's definitely a wimp.\" Says the Nine Tail, \"but it'll be funny to watch him collapse before every monster he sees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seven tailed fox scoffs and walks out, leaving you dumbfounded. These monster girls are so powerful! You hardly have time to register what you just heard before another walks in. \"Come on human! Get your nose in there good! I want you to get the fuuullll scent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate this...you shouldn't have ever left your home! You should have been a farmer! But...it's far too late now...you press your nose to the newest foot and sniff it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain is blasted with a third dose of rotten, cheesy stink! As the foot is pulled away, you clasp your throat and writhe on the ground as your blindfold is soaked with tears and the air is filled with the sound of your suffering and choking! At this point, passing out would be preferable to the nose pain and nausea. You unfortunately remain conscious, though just barely. Well, it's more than one and less than seven...not a lot to go on. \"Fhk...fhh...five?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah! I've got three! It's cute that you keep high-balling us though! Too bad you only have two wrong answers left! It's fun to watch you at our feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit! This is bad! Though...you'll at least recognize the two-tail now! Probably...the next Kitsune approaches and puts her foot up to the cage. Knowing the drill by now, you press your nose to it, grimacing at the filth you can feel coating her sole. \"Sniff!\" You take in your next sniff of fox feet and shriek at the disgusting scent! The smell burns your nose, lungs, eyes, everything! You whimper and stumble back before flopping over, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake back up again, you can still feel the burning sensation in your nose. Ugh...well, they were worse than three, not as bad as seven... \"f-four?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, so close! First time you've low balled it though! I've got five!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks. You've already gotten four out of nine wrong! You have to be perfect from here on out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next fox approaches and puts her foot up. \"Ready?\" You aren't...you really aren't! Still, you put your face up to the new foot... \"sniff it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVile doesn't even begin to describe what you breathe in! The stench is just...unreal! Of course, you black out instantly. But when you wake up...your brain is a mess! \"Fhfh...feet...feeeeeet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nine-Tail giggles, \"whoops! He broke! Hold on!\" She chants a little incantation, and your mind unfries! \"How about it? How many tails?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's got to be nine, right? They literally broke your bra-wait. The Nine-Tail probably would have made you sniff HER, right? The person who said sniff definitely wasn't her! Which means... \"eight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune all pause, and then the Nine-Tail speaks again. \"Well, congratulations human...\" Yes! Finally you got one ri- \"you get to feel Kitsune feet on your dick! And be cursed by me! What an honor!\" Your blindfold vanishes, and you see eight other Kitsune in the room. The Nine-Tail was indeed the one with her foot up to the cage! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? B-but you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changed my voice so you couldn't cheat and use something other than your nose! Bet you thought you were clever, huh? Now, let's see...who gets to mark the human's cock?\"</span></div></div>",

The girl quickly looks up, she has slightly-below-shoulder length brown hair, and from her dog-like features, you are able to quickly realize that she is probably a kobold!(Think less of a MGE kobold, and more of Polt from Monster Musume, since her feet are more human-like).<br>\r\n\"Oi, we were 'ere first maggot! Get outta 'ere!\" She says, from her thick accent you quickly realize she was the first of the voices you heard before<br>\r\nHearing her however, the other two also come to look, and so, you soon see them emerging form the ruins on your left and right sides. One on the right is a catgirl, just as you suspected, she has averagely long brown hair, and a tanned skin, with a playful smirk that gives you a feeling she might be a bit of a trickster. One on the left looks tallest of the three, and has long blonde hair, judging from the stripes on her tail and ears, as well as the claws, she is probably a tiger girl, her expression is a rather serious one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, looks like we have a human here, nya... I didn't have my feet pampered properly ever since we deserted. Say, if you kneel down and worship my feet, I might share some of the treasure with you.\" Said the catgirl, raising her leg, currently covered by a shoe, as if to tease you<br>\r\n\"We ain't sharin' no treasure just 'cause your sweaty feets get sum lickin'!\" Said the kobold girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not interested in any treasure, I am looking for the priestess from this shrine.\" You said, deciding to make it clear you don't want trouble... even if you were disgusted when seeing what's left of respected priestess' shrine being robbed like that<br>\r\n\"That's even better nya! We can show you where she was taken... if you convince us of course, nya...\" Said the catgirl, obviously meaning worshipping her feet again<br>\r\n\"Oi! If you're gonna get yer feet pampered, then I wanna get mine pampered too!\" Said the kobold girl, pointing at her feet which were covered only by sandals, giving you a nice view of their tops, aside from claw-like toenails and little bit of fur covering them, they were pretty much shaped just like human feet.<br>\r\n\"I don't want to touch your feet at all!\" You said<br>\r\n\"You pamper us, or we beat you up.\" The tiger girl suddenly says on your left, she seems like a person of few words, and to your bad luck it seems like she also wants her feet worshipped<br>\r\n\"Ya, wot she said'!\" The kobold girl confirmed the tiger girl's words<br>\r\n\"Nyaaa... seems like those two won't let you go now human.\" Said the catgirl, and you seen her remove one of her shoes, revealing her beautiful looking pale foot, covered by a toeless sock, which gave you a nice view of her toes, with slightly claw-like shaped toenails(But not as claw-like as the kobold's).<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just start and get this over with quicker, nya?\" The catgirl said teasingly, sitting on a piece of the stairs that somehow held together when the shrine burnt, and extended her foot towards you... wiggling her toes invitingly.</span></div></div>",

The monster girls are too surprised to react before she throws three strangely shiny pieces of paper towards them... the tiger and the kobold both get hit, while the catgirl manages to evade it by pure luck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the heck, nya?!\" She exclaims, suddenly looking fearfully towards her companions... who started to shine almost blinding light while seeming to be in some kind of stasis, before actually blinding you for a moment... and turning into a little tiger kitten and a little kobold puppy respectively, without any human features whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take those other two fiends, and leave this sacred place alone before I cut you down with my naginata!\" The girl said, she seemed about your age, with long brown colored hair, and due to nature of situation you just avoided, you also noticed she had sandals and white socks on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, nya! We will get revenge for this though!\" The catgirl said, quickly grabbing the adorable new animal forms of the other two before running away, and disappearing into the bushes, she even forgot the shoe she took off before starting to tease you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot for the help.\" You say, approaching the mysterious girl<br>\r\n\"Hmph, it was nothing. I couldn't let that scum loot the shrine... or rather what's left of it. You made a nice distraction for them though.\" The girl said, a bit coldly for someone who just saved you...<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... do you know what happened here? I wanted to get a blessing before going on a quest to stop the Monster Girl Empire, but I found it like this.\" You decided to ask<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know... I just arrived here few hours ago, travelling between shrines around this country as part of my shrine maiden training. It was like this when I arrived, but then I went to look around for some clues, and those three suddenly appeared.\" The girl explained<br>\r\n\"Shrine maiden?\" You ask, unfamiliar with that title, the girl was probably a foreigner<br>\r\n\"I'm a foreigner in case my clothes didn't clue you off yet. I guess... you could say I am like your priestesses, just with additional combat training regarding combat against demons and monsters.\" The girl explained, seeming a bit irritated having to explain that, she probably was getting asked about it a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... that explains how you were able to easily get rid of those three like that.\" You say<br>\r\n\"Well of course. I've defeated much stronger monsters and monster girls than some three random deserters.\" The girl says rather pridefully, she certainly seemed to like being complimented at least...<br>\r\n\"Are those two you hit with those papers going to stay animals forever?\" You decided to ask one more question<br>\r\n\"No, doing that would require a more complex sealing ritual... they should stay that way for at least few hours though. And if they are dumb enough to return, I might introduce them to my naginata.\" The shrine maiden girl said showing off her halberd-like weapon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name by the way, if you don't mind me asking? Mine's David.\" You decided that you should introduce yourself to your savior at last, even if she didn't seem too interested in talking to you much<br>\r\n\"Taina, though I don't know why would you need it. I doubt we are going to meet again.\" She said, once again sounding annoyed by your questions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... I was hoping that you wouldn't mind if I joined up with you for a while? The roads are dangerous recently, and I would like to find out what happened to the priestess from here.\" You decide to ask, that girl clearly has more combat experience than you, and if she is going around between shrines then she could help you get to the next one and get the blessings you wanted!<br>\r\n\"And why would I need you for? You couldn't do anything against those three, and if not for me you would probably be under their feet.\" Taina pointed out... and you have to admit she had a point, but maybe if you offered her something else she could still be convinced?</span></div></div>",

Are you some kind of pervert?\" She asked, clearly having serious doubts about your motivations for the offer<br>\r\n\"Well I sort of assumed that your feet should be much nicer than some random deserter monster girl. Besides if you travel so much, you could probably use a little relief, and I could use help with finding out what happened here and reaching next shrine, we could help each other.\" You said<br>\r\n\"H-huh?! Well obviously they are nicer than some monster's! And I guess I could use a masseur to massage my feet after a long day...\" Taina suddenly seemed interested in your idea after you given your reasons, and seeming a bit insulted that you had any doubts about her feet being prettier than monster girl's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaina then went towards the miraculously surviving stairs of the burned temple, sitting on them like the catgirl did before, and removing one of her sandals, and crossing her legs, leaving her foot covered only by white sock in the air...<br>\r\n\"Get to it then, if you do a good job I might consider letting you come with me.\" The shrine maiden said in kind of commanding tone, she certainly didn't act like most priestesses around here... those were pretty much all extremely polite, caring, kind, and spiritual... Taina seemed rather bossy, prideful, and showoffy on the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach and take a seat on the ground in front of Taina's foot you can quickly smell a slight smell of sweat coming from it, even despite the sock covering it... she surely didn't lie about having to walk a lot, though probably it was still less smelly and much cleaner than a monster girl who made sure to keep her foot sweaty for days, Taina probably at least washed them when she had a chance... strangely enough however it wasn't like either catgirl's or shrine maiden's foot disgusted you... in fact it was alluring in it's own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting any more time you put your hands and start rubbing Taina's sole through her sock... only for the shrine maiden to give a light kick to your hands at the moment you touch it! For a moment you throught she was ticklish... but it didn't seem to be the case as her face was annoyed rather than smiling.<br>\r\n\"Take the sock off first! Geez, do I have to explain to you how to give a proper foot rub?\" She said in irritated tone, but despite that she seemed to be strangely looking forward to the massage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much choice, wanting to accompany her for a while, you quickly put your hands back on her foot, pinching the tip of her sock and the toes, and slowly pulling it off, revealing a surprisingly pretty looking a little bit below average sized foot, the toes wiggle a bit in front of you as Taina feels the fresh air on them. <br>\r\n\"You might as well take the other one now too. Fresh air feels nice on them after a day like this...\" Taina said in kind of relaxed tone, putting her now bare foot in your lap, and extending the other still socked one towards you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any arguments you pull off the other sock, revealing a the cute foot of the shrine maiden and seeing another nice little wiggling spectacle from her toes. Once that was done, you proceeded to rub the sole of the Taina's foot with your thumbs, it felt a little bit wet to the touch, but that was to be expected. To your own surprise, you also discovered that the slight smell coming from shrine maiden's foot didn't bother you at all. Could it be you were into feet? If so, it definitely would be a problem when fighting monster girl empire with all of it's monster girls obsessed with dominating people using their feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, not bad at all... for the first try at least.\" Taina said, seeming to compliment you in her own way? Her toes flexed cutely with increasing frequency as your hands moved up on her foot, rubbing away the tiredness of Taina's day... you could also feel increasingly attracted to Taina's cute feet, hopefully you will be able to keep control of your impulses, or all of your work here might end up for naught if she is weirded out by you doing something to her feet out of nowhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rat girl just smiled, grabbing your tongue with her left toes, and using her right foot to smother your face.  You were squirming against this, trying to find an escape from the flavor of her dirty toes but in doing so, the rat girl got so aroused she shoved her foot deeper and deeper into your mouth until up to her heel was almost in your mouth, you couldn't breathe.

Her sweaty dirty toes squirm inside your mouth as your tongue licks big hunks of toe jam and dirt out from her smelly toes and sole, you then swallow it and it taste is unbearable.  The rat girl slid her foot off your mouth and onto your throat, getting up and putting pressure for only a moment until she placed her feet flat on the dirty ground wiping her feet to get more dirt before propping up her right heel to your face, \"It is good that vermin obey their owners.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more you obey the closer to being free you would get.  That was her thinking, she believed that I would believe in her lie to freedom, a sick ploy to worship her dirty, filthy feet and become her foot slave.

I just need her to believe that I have fallen for her and when she least expects it, boom, knockout.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am a knight, not a foot servant, I am a man, not a thing, and I am the sword that will cut this sick world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your thought ended she smothers your face beneath her dirty right foot, rolling you beneath her soles and grinding you under her heel while wiggling her toes playfully the whole while.  You willing opened your mouth to stick out your tongue and started licking her foot, she was surprised by this, after a moment she laughs out wildly and says \"I knew you couldn't resist my dirty feet!\" your reply was more licking. \"Make sure to get in between the toes,\" she says.  The ball of her foot to her toes is now filling your mouth as you lick up and down getting all the sweat and dirt off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what it felt like hours, the foot session was over the rat girl grabbed you by the arm and pushed you towards the cave where she popped up \"Let's go vermin, you need to rest up.\"  You stood where you were and turned to her, \"Oh great Mistress you should go first, I am but a mere bug to you, please go first and I will follow you like the bug I am.\"  You kneel.<br>\r\nThe rat girl put her right foot on your cheek, grinding, \"Stupid vermin when I say go,\" she puts her foot down and grabs your shoulder \"GO!\"<br>\r\nWithin that moment you grabbed her arm, as the rat girl was stunned by your action, you elbowed her on the right side of her face then followed-up a uppercut.  She hits the wall, falls down on the ground, surprised, and gets knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall down onto the ground, on your knees, and smile \"Finally, I am free from this foul beast.\" You take a short break and think to yourself that, that was easy, knocking her out like that.  \"Eh, maybe I understimate myself.\"  <br>\r\nAs you were in thought you heard something big coming from the left direction of the cave, so you stood up and went on your way to the right direction of the cave in hope of an exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you encounter any more monsters or are you free?</span></div></div>",

Then, she raised up her foot by the heel, allowing you access to her dirt-caked sole. You had to reach up to get to her toes, but she deliberately hung them out of reach. \"Come on, footboy! Just reach a little higher!\" She giggled at your efforts before mercifully lowering her toes. You licked at the undersides of her toes, and while not as smelly as in-between the nasty digits, still left you dazed. You moved from there, to her ball, to her sole, and finally, to her heel. All the while, you tried to find a silver lining in the situation. At least her feet were soft, and somewhat taken care of, and they felt warm against your naked body, which would otherwise be shivering against the cold floor of the cave. If you just think positive, maybe you can get through this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours, and after suffering hundreds of the spider girl's taunts, you finally cleaned her feet from heel to toe, and even under her black nails. You felt sick and bloated after consuming the foul foot feast. You laid on the ground and clutched your stomach. The spider girl grabbed you with one of her six hands and laid you across her palm as she elevated you to eye-level. Her compound eyes glared at you as her fangs twisted into a smirk. \"Awwww, what's wrong? Did you stuff yourself on my pretty feet?\" Laughter. \"Well, get used to it! You're gonna eat from these feet for as long as I have a hold of you! Anyways, I <i>guess</i> you did an okay job, so I won't kill you... not today, at least.\"</span></div></div>",

With another hand she pushed on her fangs, causing a drop of venom to fall on the web. \"Go ahead and eat it.\" You were hesitant, which was quite an understandable idea in your case. However, the look in the spider girl's eyes gave you some kind of calming semblance. Reaching out, you tear at the web and swallow. It was as distasteful as the foot gunk, but already the area around you was shrinking. \"Just keep eating dear, then we can plan out the rest of your life as my boyfriend.\" You shiver, remembering that was part of the deal...at least the part she wanted. At last you grew back to your average size, and the spider wrapped all her arms around you. \"I am never going to let you out of my sight.\" You sighed, knowing that you were rather hopeless.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the course of the next couple of weeks, this routine of being shrunk, cleaning your captor's filthy, dirt-speckled feet at miniature size, growing back, and being squeezed like a pillow next to her in a cobweb bed stayed largely the same. By the tenth day, you knew the slopes and contours of her feet very intimately, learning the exact points where she was the most sensitive. Sometimes instead of letting you worship her right away, she just kept you underfoot, lodging you under her warm, sweaty toes in her entirely threadbare sandals. Occasionally, she got her feet dirty on purpose, and made you administer multiple cleanings a day. But what really got to you the most was when she pinned you down by your puny dick with just her toes, and just left it there, edging you while you worshipped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all the monotony, what did change was her treatment of you; when you first met her, she teased you with reckless abandon, caring little about how you felt; but recently, her comments became more...gentle. Loving, almost. However, as time went on, she talked more sparsely, choosing to just stare down at you with an intense, forlorn expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, you went through the same old song and dance again, tonguing away at her dirty soles, when you felt a sudden urge to kiss her toes. Being too preoccupied with the daily grind to notice the ridiculousness of what you were doing, you gave the damp pad of her bulbous big toe a brief, yet passionate smooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour captor squeaked and retracted her foot, leaving you alone on the cold cave floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnngh...\" she moaned, \"D-do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words shocked you out of your stupor and made you nervous; this was a break in the routine. In response to your inaction, she squeezed your face into the moist and terribly pungent crevice between her big and second toe, causing you to gasp her sharp, vinegary stench in mid-inhale. You gave the side of her big toe a quick, hard peck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That! More, do that more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to stop now\u2014not that you really did in the first place\u2014you continue to pepper the delicate flesh of her toes with kisses, being sure to really give it your all. A chorus of lewd noises erupted out of the spider girl\u2019s mouth, which she desperately tried to cover. It\u2019s pretty strange; is she doing it out of embarrassment? Or, just maybe\u2026does she care about your wellbeing? Normal sounds are pretty loud to you in your shrunken state, so maybe she\u2019s trying to protect you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlustered, you continue to please your goddess\u2014no, stop that, she kidnapped you\u2014to the best of your ability. When you finish with the crevice you\u2019re on, you quickly move on to the second and third toes, at times nibbling at the soft, filthy skin. She\u2019s kept her mouth muffled (though it doesn\u2019t do much to stifle her cute squealing from your latest cleaning tactic), but she\u2019s also hiding her face with the rest of her hands, like a bashful schoolgirl. Occasionally though, she peeks out from her fingers, and gives you a longing\u2014almost...hopeful?\u2014glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell your captor is enjoying your work. She\u2019s gasping and purring and grunting; in one of the rare moments you can see past her foot, you can see that one of her hands, now gloveless, has slipped down her scarlet laced panties. A blush spreads across your face and you kiss with a renewed zeal; you feel quite accomplished, being able to bring her pleasure even at your miniscule size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hard work did not go unrewarded; as you worship each individual toe and the spaces between them, the big toe you started with inches towards your crotch, ever so subtly. When you began to work on the fourth toe, the lurking digit pounced onto your crotch and rubbed deeply. You shudder; you didn\u2019t even notice that while you\u2019ve been smothering these feet with affection (or is it the other way around?), you\u2019ve become rock hard. The firm, slow stroking of the massive toe pad sent shockwaves through your entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this made it possible for you to simply enjoy your rightful place at this monster girl\u2019s feet. Even the heady musk of the ped you were appreciating wasn\u2019t enough to dull your pleasure\u2014on the contrary, it only heightened your reverence for the god-like sole above you. You buck into the heft of the toe flesh, your mind blurred by the incredible sensation of being jerked to completion by a single digit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the toe shifts off of you, leaving you to whine at the loss of warmth and pressure; but just as soon as it moved, your cock was slipped into a new location: between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey keep the tempo from before, jerking up and down, up and down\u2014you didn\u2019t know if you could take much more of it. With your newfound freedom of movement due to not being pinned down, you thrust into the toes, your hips moving in tandem with their delicate ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you give the digits a tight hug, you can feel it; you can\u2019t take much more, and in a moment of mind-blowing ecstasy, the toes slam down on your torso, lodging your member deeper into their sweaty grip than ever before, and you cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the most intense orgasm of your life, your seed spills into every crevice and wrinkle of the toe space, filling them completely. In the afterglow, the digits squeeze lovingly around your form. Fatigue washes over you, and the last thing you hear before you resign yourself to sleep is the sharp, high-pitched breath of your captor as she reaches her own limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you find yourself...</span></div></div>",

Your height comes up to her ample breasts. \"You said we can enjoy each other...I suppose that means you have something to offer me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cyclops pauses, examining you with her bulbous eye. She rests her tongue against the inside of her cheek in thought. \"That depends, on how you make my feet feel. Do as I wish an in return, my feet will make you feel like the male you are.\" You're unsure what exactly she means, but you can certainly tell she's enjoying it. Her finger has still been pointing to her feet this whole time. Still, you feel like stalling. \"What does that mean?\" You giggle playfully, backing away with a smirk. She snorts in amusement, and drops her pointing finger. Again, she pauses, this time raising her sole for you to see, holding it up at the height of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell makes you pale. It reeks horribly of cheese and stagnant vinegar! The sole is thick, and wider than your face, and about 15 inches long. They are filthy. Years of living in this cave without access to fresh water have made them impossibly grimy and grungy. You can't do much but stare in horror. The Cyclops finally lets out a low, lusty laugh. She interprets your staring as awestruck desire and licks her lips. \"I mean that I will give you the fate all men desire. After you clean my feet I shall take you home, and smother you beneath my soles, pressing deeply for days on end until your skull and brain have a permanent imprint of my foot.\" She puts her foot down and gets too close. Her nasty stink is showering you. She breathes on you as she whispers. \"and then there'll be nothing for you to worry about except worshipping me and our children...and feeding from our feet...\" Her hands are raising, it seems that you've riled her up too much!</span></div></div>",

The snake lady closest to your head looks at you, you finally get a good view of them. They seem to be 7 feet tall, with green skin and are quite muscalar and big in size, their skin is very smooth except for some rougher scales here and there. They have snake-like eyes and their feet must be atleast size 12s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm..\" Says one of your kidnappers, \"you awoke much faster than our previous victim. Hope you don't end up like him though, he was so useless that we had to dispose of him a while back. Good thing we found you! Our blacksmith will love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your blacksmith? Was does that have to do with anything? Let me g-...\" Before you can finish your sentence the snake lady takes off one of her sandals and binds it to your face, with the insole directly onto your nose and mouth. \"Lick that instead of talking.\" She taps your head with a club that she put you out with earlier, reminding you of who is in charge. Without much choice you start licking the sandal and you can just taste the sweat of your seductive kidnapper. You gotta say, her feet atleast look gorgeous, so it's not that bad to be licking this sweat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later you feel a blindfold going over your eyes. \"Shush now sandal-licker, just keep licking and smelling, I wanna hear you breathe in my sweat too.\" You then hear another voice, \"My god Sanila, you are definitely strict for this one, but he definitely seems more lively than the previous ones. You think we can sell this one to Tevuula, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep licking and smelling the sweaty insole of your snake kidnapper. Every breath starts to arouse you and you start to lick faster as well... you hear a satisfactory sigh from above you. Apparently your sandal duties are pleasing your current owner. You keep licking and smelling, hoping to not anger her. The words of the other woman did however peak your interest... It seems that these two snake ladies are some kind of slavers that caught you... Was it all a trap then, back at the armory? It seems like they want to sell you to this Tevuula person... Whoever that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanila then answers the other snake lady, \"Yes, I was thinking this one might be good enough for Tevuula... But I am not sure yet... There is also Megira who would love him I am sure and then he'd be more likely to be with us too.\" The women then come to a standstill and Sanila presses her foot against the sandal that you are licking, \"hey sandal-licker, I think I know something fun, you can decide; Do you want to go to Megira or Tevuula? Megira is our town's druid, she is likely going to do some magical experiments with you, I heard she's been into shrinking lately. We're kinda close with her so then you may still meet us too... Not so bad since you seem to enjoy my sandal...\" Sanila says with a seductive tone while her foot suddenly moves towards your boner and gently slides across its length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get even harder from that and start to breathe in more deeply. \"Or... Do you want us to sell you to Tevuula? She is our blacksmith and she needs someone to help her with her constant perspiration problem. She will likely just keep you for herself in her armory though, she is a big and strong snake lady, almost 8 feet, if you're into that.\" Sanila says with an almost whispering tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanila then places her foot on your head, \"So, what's it gonna be, Tevuula the blacksmith or Megira the druid?\"</span></div></div>",

Come, let's get you to her.\" You keep breathing the smell of her sandals while the snake ladies carry on into the village. You can't see anything but you hear chatter here and there, although you don't seem to be that much of an anomaly in the eyes of the villagers. Apparently it's normal to be brought in here as a hunting reward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear Sanila's voice, ''Hey Megira, we got you one for your experiments!'' You try to move, but you are still firmly restrained. Then, after a few seconds you are dropped onto the ground, Sanila then takes her sandal away from ur face and puts it back on. She then takes the blindfold off, you see Sanila's gorgeous slender body, but then also someone behind her. This person is holding a strange staff and wears a lot of bracelets, she is a bit older than most and has a more mature and vicious look in her eyes. She is about as tall as Sanila is. She then walks up to you, ''my name is Megira, I will be using you for my experiments. I hope you are ready.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes into her hut and then comes back with a special powder. She then takes one of her sandals off, and you see a silhouette carved out in the insole of her sandal, just like... just like a mini-human would fit exactly in there! You even see some very small metal bars that can be clicked into place. She holds the sandal below your face, the smell then hits you! \"Yes, my new experimental lamb, these are the sandals I wear all the time, I am a bit older and I get very sweaty. This is going to be your new home.\" She then sprays some powder over you and you start shrinking rapidly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the strangest sensation as every part of your body starts to shrink, you then fall down, all the ropes securing you are now way too loose and big for you, same for all the clothes you have been wearing. Naked, you fall down, and then Megira catches you in the sandal. With her index finger she quickly puts you in the cut-out space and lays you on your back in her sandal, then she clicks the iron bars shut, securing your ankles, wrists and waist firmly against the sandal. Then the three women look at you, Megira speaks up first: \"Now that looks like a great insole for me to use. What do you think ladies?\" Sanila can't stop laughing and says, ''Yes! Hahahaha! Oh, please, can I use him someday too?\" Megira looks at her with a smirk, ''I'll think about it Sanila. Let me test him first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see Megira's foot come towards you, her sole is very soft, despite her rough scales on the other parts of her skin. Her leathery skin is as soft as silk, although it is a bit more rough and mature than Sanila's. It seems to be a bit more calloused and sweaty in general, then, Megira's foot rests upon your body and she starts to firmly secure the sandal around her foot. \"Ahhh... Great! Let the testing begin...''</span></div></div>",

What are they planning?!\" Then you hear loud and echoing foot steps and a loud groan as the door opens. \"Sanila is that you? You slithering snake... Ugh... Oh, you brought me a slave have you? About time. Hope this one is sturdy enough. Here's the coins, I aint messing around, get him in there right away.\" Tevuula says with a much deeper and stern voice than Senila, she seems very serious, strict and... bothered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear Senila grab something from her backpack, \"okay little slave boy, just smell this and go to sleep for a little bit okay?\" Before you realize what is going on Senila puts some magical powder right below your nose on her sandal and the moment you inhale... You... Get so... Sleepy... And... Darkness takes you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long while you wake up, and you hear Tevuula at the door. \"Thanks for helping with installing him, you asked quite a few coins for this though but, alright... I'll go use him for a while now.\" With a sigh Tevuula closes the door, \"damned snakes, Always trying to get the most out of everything. Guess my snake traits are just for show.\" Tevuula then walks closer, \"Yes slave-boy, they call the me the Orc-lady here, just because of how I behave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then start to realize your predicament... Your body is fully bound and seems to be in some kind of coffin or box, under the floor. Your face is peaking through a hole, and you are completely immobilized, not even able to move an inch. You then see that you are under some kind of anvil with a big chair in front of it. \"So, slave-boy... You are now my new footrest which I asked Selina about ages ago. Finally they found one for me. Guess you're the Lucky one...\" Tevuula steps closer and sits in her chair, she seems to be atleast 8 feet tall and has two gigantic feet, probably size 14s! You see her body, she is tall and very muscular and broad, with big hands and big feet. You also see sweat almost everywhere on her body, she must work really hard and the armory is also really hot... Despite her masculine features you definitely see that she has amazing curves and a beautiful feminine face. Then, you see an evil smile appear on her face... Uh-oh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Footrest, as you can see, I get very sweat when working. Your task is to tend to my feet and specifically my toes. As you can see they are rather big...\" Tevuula then hovers one of her feet above your head \"...And also really sweaty like the rest of my body. You are going to lick that sweat off all day and smell my feet like a good footrest. While I work, you are going to solve this perspiration problem for me. Got that? If you even think of disobeying I will smack you face with my hammer and you are in no position at all to even move so, you better obey my every command, is that clear, bitch-boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntimidated by her strong presence and strict tone you answer, \"yes Tevuula...\" Tevuula then sits on her chair and gets to work. Her foot then moves towards your face, with her big toe and index toe going around your nose, forcing you to smell right in between her toes. The smell of her sweat instantly hits you, this woman must be sweating all day... And... You're going to smell this all day? Every breath you notice her mature and intense sweat and you start to inhale deeper and deeper, enticed by the smell somehow... \"Breathe deeper, you like that smell don't you? Senila told me you might like that.\" Tevuula then spreads her toes more and pushes the part between her toes firmly onto your nose and wiggles her toes a bit \"Again. Now breathe in deeper. You're gonna smell this a lot.\" You breathe in deeper and get hit by the smell even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold your breath.\" As ordered, you hold your breath, and as half a minute passes by you feel Tevuula positioning her toes around her nose, so that the openings of your nostrils are firmly secured and pressing into the area between her toes, pushing into her toejam. \"Now breathe.\" You then breathe in deep, and you have to breathe in reaaaaal deep because your nose is so firmly pressed against her toejam that you can hardly get air in. You take really deep breaths of really sweaty air, every single breath is deep and long and you get aroused more and more by ever breath. You can almost taste her sweat already. You keep breathing in deeper and deeper and the smell of her extremely wet and sweaty toes just makes you rock hard. \"Now, I am going to ignore you and work for a while, so, start licking boy. Looks like you love the smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs ordered, you then extend your tongue and start licking the ball of her foot, inch by inch. Your tongue is quickly covered in sweat and grime, cleaning her sole like a good slave. Now you are truly overwhelmed by her sweat, smelling it through intense breathes from in between her toes while also tasting it in your mouth. Every lick reminds you of your position and you just... start to... Love this taste? You're not sure what is going on but, you start licking faster and faster, trying to lick up as much sweat as you can. The taste of her sweat is very mature and somewhat sour and it seems rather addictive. You keep on licking her smooth soles and she starts to slowly move her foot around so you can get to new unlicked spots that are still drenched in sweat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these duties, your day continues...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are a great addition to the store!\" Tevuula then walks to her stove, \"I've been making some dinner in the meantime. Surely you want some too, don't you?\" Tevuula puts her sandals back on and prepares some food for herself. You couldn't even smell what she was making due to licking and smelling her feet all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, she sits down on the chair and starts eating, then at some point, she spits down a mouthful of her food onto the ground. It is right in front of you and you see it glistering with her saliva. She then grinds through it with her sandal and places it right at your mouth. \"You have the honor of eating my saliva-soaked foot directly from my dirty sandal. Now, eat.\" Tevuula said with a stern voice. You know to obey your alpha lizard by now and start licking the bottom of her sandal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every lick you taste a slight bit of how good her food is, it seems to be some kind of rice with some cooked vegetables and a bit of meat here and there. However, for the most part, you taste her saliva and the grime from her sandal. She spits like this a few times and you lick it off her sandal every single time, sucking and licking the sole clean. Once she is done she binds her sandal to your face with the sole on your mouth. \"Clean it bitch, I want it clean.\" You obediently lick and lick... And lick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like half an hour you are certain that her sandal is clean. She then takes it off of you, \"Hmmm... Pretty well done, I guess I...\"</span></div></div>",

Hmmm, how shall I punish you I wonder...\" Tevuula says with a mean look. You feel your throat swollen from fear, what will she do to you?! She then stands up and asks some random people from the streets to come inside for a cleaning. Tevuula comes back inside with three women, one of which seems familiar. Tevuula then rests one her big feet on her head, asserting her position and reminding you of your position. \"Okay ladies, you may start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first woman sits on Tevuula's chair. She is normally built, shorter than Tevuula and a seemingly a lot younger. She seems to look like Sanila a lot, with a curved, smooth and slender body. Unlike Tevuula, she has a very kind and friendly look in her eyes. She then says, \"Oh Tev, I can make him clean my sandals right? You sure he won't mind?\" Tev simply nods to her, \"just do it, he's my slave anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then places her sandal on your mouth and you start licking, she starts dragging it across your tongue, over and over. She starts at the heel and drags it all the way to her toes, with every stroke your tongue becomes dirtier and you clean it over and over, swallowing whatever is on her sandal. \"Sorry... I had to do a long walk today to another town, so they are probably not really clean...\" You certainly taste that, yet, you have to obey Tevuula and keep licking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the lady seems satisfied and simply walks away while looking at you with an expression of pitty. Another lady then sits down, it is Sanila! \"Oh... What a coincidence! Well, Tev told me you are being punished so, go on and clean my sandals for me.\" Sanila then takes one of her sandals off and binds it over your nose. \"Smell that while licking the sole of the other one.\" She drags the sole across your tongue and with every breath you smell her worn sandals, the scent of her sweat is very intense and starts making you moan a bit. \"Ahhh? Good boy, keep smelling like that, and don't forget to lick too! My sandals are really in some need of cleaning!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep licking and the taste is just aweful, yet you have no choice and do your best to get Sanila's sandals clean. Sanila then says, \"well, they miiiight be so dirty because I walked through a lot of taverns today and right before that, I had a lizard lady in town lick my sandals clean.\" Sanila then continues, \"Yeh, she actually has a thing for feet, can you imagine?\" Tev laughs a little and responds, \"well, this one will have that too very soon!\" Both women then laugh and you simply keep licking. You start to taste the grime mixed with the saliva from a woman unknown to you. After licking a while Sanila finally seems satisfied and takes her sandal off of you. \"Ahhh... Good boy. See you another time, I'm gonna get some more drinks!\" Sanila then runs off like the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one more woman shows up, she is rather old, probably the oldest you've seen. She asks Tevuula, \"Hey, I didn't wear any sandals today, that is okay too right?\" Tevuula nods, \"that may be even better...\" Then, a moment later you see a big size 12 foot places in front of you, rugged, calloused and wrinkled, this woman is definitely one of the village elders. Despite that, her mature-looking soles are a dark shade of brown from all the walking she had done, let alone, very sweaty! She then places one foot over the other, slightly pinching your nose between her biggest toes. \"Smell that young one!\" You take a deep whiff and are hit by an extremely sweaty smell. \"Haha! Guess this old rag still has some great scents down there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then drags her foot across your lips, prompting you to lick it. You start licking and the taste is a mix between dirt and sweat, gathered from a rugged and calloused surface. You keep licking and licking, she even puts her toes in your mouth and has you lick in between them seperately. \"Ahh good, great feeling some tongue against my wrinkled toes... Ahh... Now clean under my nails too!\" The elder said. You then lick under her long nails and collect all the grime you can. After a little while she switches her feet and the process starts over. Licking the sweat and dirt from her feet. Then finally, after another while she walks off on her bare feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTevuula steps in front of you, \"learned your lesson? Next time I'll ask the hunters instead, they always have the most sweaty feet you know. Well, probably only matched by mine.\" Tevuula then puts her sandals back on, \"so... You've had dinner, time to prepare you for the night!\" Tevuula says with a smile, clearly not even giving you a choice!</span></div></div>",

She puts her sandals on, \"I am just going around the block here to gather some things...\" Tevuula then leaves the house and you remain where you are, restrained in your facebox in the floor. You slowly relax and breathe more easily, but then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTevuula enters with a big sack full of... things? Tevuula walks near you and then sits down, she turns the bag inside out and before you all kinds of things drop down... They are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandals and other footwear!\" Tevuula says with an evil smile. \"These are from the hunter girls nearby, Yavali was nice enough to borrow me these since they were really used. The hunting group just came back from wearing these for over two weeks, constantly sweating while doing so!\" Tevuula then rummages through the myriad of footwear. \"Look, we got some nice sweaty and worn sandals for you, who knows what girl they belong too... Oh and, these things!\" Tevuula grabs a bunch of silk socks, they used to be grey but, they are almost fully dark grey by now and look compeltely wet and worn. \"Okay. Time to get you ready for the night, open up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obediently open up your mouth and within seconds a pair of super sweaty and wet socks are shoved in your mouth. Then another pair she binds around your mouth to keep you nicely gagged. She then takes two more socks and turns then inside out, she then places the toe-sections, the wettest and warmest directly onto your nose. She then wraps another pair around your head to keep the socks firmly pressing onto and partially into your nose. You can only breathe through your nose and with every breath you have to deeply inhale to get some air, completely through these sweaty socks. You almost get a little dizzy from the smell that you have to intesively endure with every breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then wraps another pair around your eyes, actively blindfolding you. Then she binds a few Sandals to your face, increasing the sweaty smell you're enduring with every breath. She then puts the left-over foot wear on the bag. \"Oh my, quite a task, but we got you nicely suited up for the night, I didn't want you to get cold you know!\" Tevuula says with a chuckle, \"you really enjoy this anyway, don't you, bitchboy?\" Her tone suddenly shifted to a more stern one. \"Inhale as deep as you can, lemme hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhale a little bit and then take the deepest breath you can. You moan a little while doing so and Tevuula enjoys your predicament, \"okay, keep that up my loyal footrest.\" She then sits in her chair and rests both of her feet on your head. \"I am just gonna drink a beer to relax and read some book about this lusty lizard maid, it's pretty great! Well... Not like you'd care... Come come, inhale again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so continues your evening, you inhale deeper and deeper, then exhale and then inhale again. Every breath makes you smell the sweat coming from the socks and sandals of the female hunters. Meanwhile, Tevuula seems to greatly enjoy your services to the local hunters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one of the hunter women walks in, she has a rather muscular build, she seems to be very fast and agile, curved in the right spaces, yet a lot less bulky and tall than Tevuula herself. \"Hey Tevuula, just wanted to check on what you were doing with-...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, my!? Is that? Oh my!!!\" The hunter woman says with shock. Tevuula then answers, \"Hey there Yavali, yeah, that is my house-bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tevuula.. that's...\" The lady says. You interupt her with your own thoughts, \"finally, someone that actually pitties me and doesn't just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's AMAZING Tevuula!\" The lady continues. Well, say goodbye to your hopes, everyone in this village is probably just out to humialite a human lad such as yourself. The woman comes closer and looks at you. \"Wow, he's wearing Nigeina's socks... Oh my, how unlucky!\" She pauses for a moment to observe your predicament. \"You know, Nigeina has pretty big feet and she is the scout so, she runs the most by far! She sweats SO much, I hope you're enjoying her socks pressed onto your nose haha!\" She then taps ur cheek with her finger, \"Hmm... He's moaning from time to time, I guess he really enjoys it... Do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looks at Tevuula, \"Hey Tev, can I maybe take him from you? In return we will give you our best specimen to replace him! It's just, our slave is getting a bit older now, but I guess that's no problem for you is it?\" Tevuula looks at Yavali, \"Hmmm... well, you know what, I think it'll be fun to see what this bitchboy decides. Maybe he likes my foot-torture after all? Just moan loudly twice for yes, and once for no.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[What do you answer?]</span></div></div>",

Amazing!. You will be the new slave of the hunters then!\" Yavali looks you and gives a wink. Yavali then runs off and Tevuula starts getting you out of the contraption in the floor, removing all the hunters' gear from your face. \"You are gonna wish you had stayed with me, little one. But, all is good, she will teach you a lesson. You just got fooled by her smile and her happy demeanor.\" Tevuula says, while slowly undoing all the locks. She then lifts you up like it's nothing and puts you in a tub with water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of some rough scrubbing and getting touched all over by Tevuula, she notices your boner. \"Ah, so you really like how I handle you now huh? Too bad little one.\" Tevuula then grabs some cuffs and a collar with a long chain. She cuffs your hands behind your back, and puts the collar around your neck and ties it to a pillar in her workshop, she then blindfolds you as well and says her goodbyes; \"Good luck you little man, you'll need it.\" After a few minutes, Yavali comes back. \"Ohhh, there is my little slave, well Tev, here is yours!\" You then hear Tevuula get her new slave settled in, while Yavali walks up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you're gonna be the hunters' new slave. That gear you just smelled was nothing compared to what youre gonna get.\" Yavali said with an evil tone. She then took you by your collar and lead you around town to the Hunter's barracks. Inside you hear a lot of ladies yell and shout, apparently they are rather enthousiastic about a new slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYavali looks at you, and asks the group of huntresses: \"so, where do we to take this new slave? Will he be a footwarmer on our trips or do we install him here?\" Yavali shouts through the barracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme hear what you want my sisters!\" Yavali cries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[What do the huntresses shout?]</span></div></div>",

You're gonna be a good horsie for us...\" She then grabs your balls and fondles them, \"are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly nod and let out a little moan. Yavali and another lady walk up to you. \"Hi, I am Nigeina, you are going to pull this cart for us. Now, let us get you suited up for your task.\" She takes off your blindfold and you see all kinds of leather in front you. The ladies start with undoing your cuffs and then wrap your arms around your back, with each hand touching the other arm's elbow. Then with a dozen of leather straps and metal clasps they restrain your arms together, very tightly. They then put some leather shoes on for you, with a pretty soft and thick sole, probably the best part of this dress-up party...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, it's going to be great! Don't worry about a thing okay?\" Nigeina says. The tall snake-lady then puts a big leather strap around your belly, and secures it with chains to the cart. You are now in front of the cart, securely tied to it. \"Alright, now to finish this...\" Nigeina then puts a big mask over your head, completely sealing you in darkness. Only your mouth and nose are accessable. Yavali then comes back, \"Ah, well done Nigeina, I'll finish him up. Could I have ur socks?\" Nigeina takes her socks off and you can just hear how wet they are. Yavali then takes them and throws them on the floor in the middle of the barracks. \"Ladies! Spitting challenge! Whoever can hit it three times from across the tables will get two meals tonight!\" The huntresses start to giggle, eventually evolving into some strong competitive shouts. You hear them spit over and over, till finally there is a winner. You hear most of the ladies sob about their loss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- \"Aww, I only hit it twice!\"<br>\r\n- \"Dang, I was just a second too late with my third blob...\"<br>\r\n- \"Hmmm... Maybe I shouldn't have spit such huge quantities everytime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-gulp- You think to yourself, so, this is going to be a sock drenched in the Nigeina's sweat and a combination of spit from almost all the competent spitters amongst the huntresses. You wonder what they're going to do with something li-... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYavali then interrupts your thoughts. \"Okay slave boy, open up.\" In your situation of complete bondage and blindness, you have no choice. You hesitantly open your mouth, Yavali then shoves the spit and sweat-drenched sock into your mouth. \"Good boy, make sure it's clean by the time we arrive at your camp location.\" Nigeina then caresses your head, \"tastes good doesn't it?\" Yavali then walks up to you again and binds a smelly sandal to your face, but this smell... You recognize it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes slave,\" Yavali says while gently rubbing your nipples. \"These are a parting gift from Tevuula, her old sandals that she doesnt use anymore. We gave her some new ones in return. I can just see the prints of her feet in there and they smell so much, wheew!\" Yavali then pushes the sandals firmly onto your face, \"lemme hear you breath cart-boy...\" Knowing your position, you breathe in deeply and Tavali sees your genitals react to it. \"Ohh... So you like smelling that? You'll have a great time with us then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYavali and Negeina then secure some more straps around you firmly attaching you to the cart. Then finally, Yavali clasps a big metal collar around your neck. She then caresses your cheek and gently pulls the collar, \"ready for departure?\" Negeina then gently fondles with your balls, \"Oh! Look at him! Yes I think he is ready, Yavali!\" You feel utterly used by these huntresses, your arms bound, wearing a gimp mask while your mouth and nose are being overloaded with erotic senses; the smell and taste of snake-women sweat. Yavali then sits on the cart, and places her feet on your shoulders. \"Move. now!\" Yavali's tone is stern and commanding, not really what you expected from the happy and giggling girl that entered Tevuula's shop on the very same day. Negeina then takes your collar and walks in front, she then presses Tevuula's sandal against your nose, \"breathe in again, we'll be doing some amazing training with you, don't worry! Chop chop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking and the cart starts the move, the erotic smell of Tevuula's sandals, in combination with the taste of Negeina's sweat and the spit of the huntresses makes altogether the only fuel that you're walking on. However, it sure smells and tastes nice you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYavali then shouts, \"Off to the hunting grounds ladies, follow the cart, feel free to use or play with the horse anytime!\" You shiver at the thought of being at the mercy of these wild huntresses, but you pay no mind and slowly pick up a steady pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, your \"epic hunting\" journey begins... Albeit not quite what you had in mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you are still massaging Tilly's huge foot you are looking at her sexy sole studying it more closely than you expected too, her foot was long and wide with a perfect paddle shape to it her sole was surprisingly plump and meaty. Tilly's sole had not a hint of callous or blemish to it.   Her toes were medium length and extremely plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her sole a little more earnestly now you hear her let out the littlest of moans.  Looking past her foot to her face you see that her cute little green face had a blueish colored blush to it.  She then says \"Mista Tilly has neva had her pups touched before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little awkward now you ask her \"Ow sorry about doing it without your permission, do you like it at least?\"   She could see that you felt a little embarrassed she blurts out quickly \"No No Tilly like it.  Like it a lot.\"  Now blushing, even more, she looking down says \"Mista seems to like it a lot\" pointing over her shoulder at the tent you are pitching in your pants.  You hadn't even realized that you had gotten an erection that fast now a whole new wave of embarrassment washed over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of her foot you go to try and stand up saying \"Ow I am so sor\"  but she interrupts you mid-sentence putting her foot in your face as she turned to try and get at your pants to open them all the while saying \"No Mista please don't Tilly wants to help you.\"  </span></div></div>",

Working to get you erection out of your pants she finally gets it free with having to work so hard her face was now mere inches from your groin.  Just then you erection finally breaks free of your pants popping out it almost hits her in the face causing her to jump and let out the cutest little squeal with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused you to laugh a little but she seemed to pay you no mind she was transfixed on your erect dick looking at it with an expression of both lust and a touch of fear.  Blushing now your self you say to her \"You ok down there.\" Chuckling nervously now you say due to her silence you say jokingly \"Kinda small isn't it?\"  That finally snaps her out of her trance Tilly snaps her head around looking you in the face with her little hand pointing to your dick saying \"Dis is what you call small Mista?\"  Now laughing heartily at that you finally manage to say\" Well I'm a little above average but I'm not huge.\"  With the emphasis in her voice, she blurts out \"well Mista you are to Tilly dats for sure.\"  Now that your ego has been thoroughly stroked you are hoping that she might oblige stroking you for real with her huge feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on your dick again Tilly reaches her small hand up and grabs your dick her hand was quite small and she could just get her hand around the girth of your member.  Absentmindedly she says \"it's so warm and hard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting you a little off the way she had said it, you ask her \"other than its size is it that much different to a goblin penis?\"  Tilly looks up at you and says \"well da goblin cock is much smaller and they are cold to da touch not like your cock Mista yours is da biggest Tilly has ever saw and Tilly has neva touched something so warm on a body before.\"  It's then that you realize that her foot had been kind of cold to the touch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were lost in your own thoughts she started to move her hand up your shaft getting to the head of your dick gently squeezing it she says \"wow its so soft and smooth\"  saying it almost breathlessly leaning in she opens her mouth licking the head of your dick sending shivers down your spine the cold wet sensation of her tongue on your member was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had kept licking the head of your dick like a lollypop saying \"Yum Mista you taste some kinda good. \"  Licking the tip one last time she opens her mouth and pulls your mushroom cap into her mouth swirling her tongue around your head as she sucked on it causing you to let out a moan from the pleasure you had never had a blowjob feel like this the sensation of her mouth being cold on your hard dick was indescribable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to work on the head of your dick she was now making cute little noises and moans with the slurping sound coming from her. it's then that you notice her flexing and wiggling her toes as she worked your dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to control our self anymore you grab her foot again and start to lick her sexy huge sole the taste of her sole was amazing it had a slightly salty, sweet taste to it.  The feeling of you licking her soft sole with your warm moist tongue caused her to gasp with pleasure and surprise.  With a feeling of being blue-balled, you wished she wouldn't have stopped.  Speaking up you say \"why did you stop that felt amazing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha doing to me pups down der Mista?  Smiling you says \"well you're making me feel good so I thought I would return the favor did you not like it?\"  \"No No Mista dat felt great please don't stop I won't stop for  you Tilly needs to taste your milk gotta see if it tastes better too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to your dick she puls the head of your dick back into her mouth this time though she sucks on the head for a few moments and then tries to take as much of you as she can. trying to deep throat you going down slowly more and more to your surprise she gets almost half of your length into her before she just can't take any more of you down her throat.  You are now licking her sole more and more alternating between long slow licks and fast little licks across her sole.  You are rapidly falling in love with the taste of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past her sole you see her looking at you with the best smile she can manage with half your dick down her throat she then begins to bob her head up and down your dick now making sure to swirl her tongue around the head of your dick everytime she was back at it gradually going faster and faster getting louder with her moans as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly was now going almost as fast as she could milking your dick relentlessly she wanted you to cum, no she needed you to cum and you knew it and you were happy to oblige her feeling that you were close you grab her foot moving her foot down to were you could suck her toes pulling her surprisingly large big toe into your mouth giving her the same treatment she had given the head of your dick by swirling your tongue around her big toe as you sucked on it causing her to let out a very sultry moan with as much of your dick down her throat as she could manage the feeling of her mouth and throat shuddering with the rest of her body causing you to lose control.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErupting what had to be the largest load of your life deep down Tilly's throat spasming over and over again she managed to get the head of your dick back into her mouth before you were finished unleashing a few more good shots into her waiting mouth you finally quit spasming after unleashing half a dozen large shots of cum the last few landing squarely into her hopefull mouth pulling her lips off your dick with a satisfying plop sound she is swirling your cum around in her mouth before looking at you opening her mouth showing that it was quite full of your cum before swallowing it down with gulp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing now you pull her big toe out of your mouth and say to her \"That felt amazing i have never had a blowjob feel that good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at you with a seductive look she says \"Mista ya got tha best tastin milk I've ever had, and that thing you are doin to ma pups Tilly has never had anyone do anything to my pups before.\"  Now blushing her self </span></div></div>",

You speak up and say \"Trust me I would love to do everything you could want to do but look how much bigger I am than you I'm afraid I will hurt you. I don't want to see any harm come to you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised by your kindness at worrying about her safety and the fact you admitted that you a human wanted to do things with her a goblin, made her feel so happy.  Genuinely smiling down at you she says \"Don't you go worrying about ol Tilly here I've never had one this big but I've been around long enough to know what I can handle \"looking over at your dick longingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ngetting the feeling that she was far older and more experienced that you had expected your lack of experience with goblins shown threw when you asked her \"but you look so young how old are you.\"  Chuckling at what you had said Tilly answers back \"Ow Mista you don't know goblins to well do ya, ol Tilly, here is 92 years old you don't need to worry about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling dumbfounded by what she had said thinking to yourself \"92 no wonder that felt so amazing she is way more experienced than you could have ever thought or could ever be.\"  Hell, you had only ever been with one woman and she was the local call girl because she was the only one you could manage the courage to go to and that had cost you a whole silver.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the troubled look on your face Tilly thinks she has said something wrong by telling you her age she sits up and says nervously \"Don't you be afraid of ma age Mista I'm in the prime of me life we goblins can live to be 300 or older if we take care of our selves I can.\"  grabbing her and giving her a hug to reassure her you say \"Tilly I'm not upset about your age I'm just sorry because I'm just a little intimidated by how much experience you have I have only ever been with one woman and it was but for one night.\"   Releasing her from the huge she has a big Cheshire grin on her face \"Well Mista of Tilly here is about to rock your world rolling off of you she stands up and says \"well now Mista I can't be the only one to strip now can I.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she starts to take off her patchwork dress watching it hit the ground you saw that she had no bra on but she was wearing panties looking at her body she has a very sexy shapely body that was hidden under that ugly dress turning to face you you see she has some small perky little nipples that contrasted against her bright green skin by being a dark forest green color.  Lost in her surprising beauty she says \"Don't be shy now Mista I've seen the important bit already.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up yourself you drop your sword belt and shield then take off your cloke.  Next removing your shirt she is surprised you are built quite sturdily.  Nodding with approval you finally undo the last of what is holding up your pants and drop them after kicking off your boots now revealing your whole set of reproductive organs to her Tilly lets out a gasp as she is looking at your balls \"walking over to you grabbing ahold of your sack she looks up at you in wonder saying \"No wonder you let out so much milk your Pecker is 3 times the size of a goblins but ya balls are 10 times the size of em\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow feeling a little pride in yourself you still know that you are more than a little backed up you haven't had any release for over a month so you know full well that your balls were full to the brim and ready to be emptied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step back you grab your cloke and lay it out sitting back down on it you see Tilly finally drop her last little bit of clothing on to the ground you were quite happy that the carpet matched the silver drapes.  She had a well manicured little patch of silver pubic hair.  It was a striking accent to her bright green body which was now driving you quite mad with lust.  Walking over to you she lifted up her right foot touching your chest with it pushing you back giving her no resistance you lay back as she straddles your waist as she sits down pressing your hard dick down onto your stomach with her cute green pussy lips resting on the bottom of your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to grind back and forth up and down on your shaft getting your back to full mast she was already so moist you could feel her dripping on your dick the sensation of her grinding on you was maddening all you wanted was to feel what it would be like to be inside her.  Smiling wickedly down at you as she pawed at your chest \"are ya ready Mista cus I'm about to rock your world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting back up off of you she reaches down and grabs your hard as steel dick moving it into position she gives you one last look and licks her lips as she closes her striking golden eyes beginning to lower herself down onto your waiting cock you feel the tip of your dick pressing against her pussy feeling just how tight her little hole is you are thankful that she is already this wet as you were going to need some help just to get into her.  After a few seconds of pressing gently down onto your dick realizing that wasn't going to cut it she takes a deep breath and puts some force into it when finally you feet her spread apart and with a gasp, the head of your dick was now inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting down on her lower lip Tilly blurts out \"By the gods your so big and hot.\"  Speaking up you say \"are you sure you can take me you only got the tip in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at you with a fire in her eyes you can tell she needs this far more than you had expected.  Seeing the resolve in her eyes and the fact that you were beyond the point of no return you give her a wink and move your hips a little to give her some encouragement, unfortunately, she also moved down at the same time so before she could stop her self you found yourself bottoming her out.  The head of your dick now firmly pressing against her cervix,  to your surprise she took almost all you had to offer with only about an inch of you still out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then you feel it her tight little pussy went into overdrive clamping down onto you pulsating as you saw her gasp with pain and extasy your thrust had hit her so by surprise and the fact you were hitting ever part of her stretching out ever part of her little pussy had caused her to orgasm almost instantly.  Shaking now and breathing heavy she manages to open her eyes looking down at you saying cockily \"and you thought I couldn't handle ya big cock.\" leaning back you could see a slight bulge poking out of her belly she looks down to see it and just grins leaning back forward a little you now feeling her beginning to ride up and down your dick slowly at first she was going mad with pleasure the feeling of your dick filling every part of her tight little pussy was driving her mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was that her tight little pussy was strangling your dick to the point you were already about to burst.  Unable to control your self you blurt out \"God your so tight I can't last much longer.\"  Smirking down at you she says \"what's the matta Mista cant take ol Tilly's perfect pussy.  Thought I was the one who was going to struggle with your big ol co\"  but before she could finish her sentence you erupt into her tight little pussy blow a load equal to or bigger deep into her tight pussy grunting hard as you blow load after load of your cum right into her womb causing her to clamp down with another spell of orgasms as she felt your hot cum erupt into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweating and breathing heavily now she had almost fallen over but you had somehow managed to catch her and had her head laying on your chest your half mast cock was still deep inside her.  lifting her head up she says \"Mista your milk is so hot in me belly I can't describe how good it feels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlifting her self up off your cock you can see the cum pouring out of her rubbing her self now she says \"You bout blew me top Mista I couldn't take another drop of ya milk in me belly.\"  lifting her hand up with some of your cum on her fingertips licking it off it drove you mad with lust all over again.  Getting hard all over again this time you were going to take the rains you had what was on your mind the whole time grabbing her and pulling her in for a deep kiss you lay her down on her back grabbing her ankles lifting her feet up you on your knees aim your dick at her waiting pussy you lean in inserting your self back into her waiting pussy it was quite a bit easyer this time with having already churned her up well enough to were you fit a little bit better this time around moving methodically at first she was moaning with pleasure flexing her massive soles and toes with each thrust leaning down you lick her awaiting soles causing her to tighten up like you had expected working over her soles lightly biting at them causing her to giggle between the moans pulling both her bulbous big toes into your mouth sucking vigorously on them causing her to have yet another orgasm feeling her pussy tighten and spasm on your cock was causing you to go even fast now feeling the head of your dick pounding on her cervix driving her mad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing this for as long as you could manage you feel that you're at your limit again but this time you pull out and move her massive soles down to your waiting dick thrusting it hard into her buttery soft left sole as you erupt on last time coating her light green arch with a cream coating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling over next to her fully exhausted by all the exertion you look at her and say \"this has to be a dream.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"By the gods, I hope not\"  Is all Tilly could muster as she laid next to you.  Finally calming down and getting your breathing back to normal you were still swimming on cloud 9.  Unbeknownst to you standing not 50 feet away from the two of you was a 7 foot + ogre girl she had been standing there the whole time watching the two of you go at it you being the novice you were she had been shadowing the both of you since you had first saved Tilly form the other monster girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally decided to come out of the shadow and make her presence Known walking calmly over to the two of you she stands over you with one foot on either side of your head.  Finally turning your head to look at TIlly you are greeted by only the sight of a giant boot-clad foot.  At first, you were just in awe at the sheer size of the foot in your view but then you snap back to your senses flipping over as fast as you could going for your sword only to have a massive boot come down onto your hand pinning it to the ground hard.  Yelling out in pain you hear a stern but also alluring voice with a similar accent to Tillys say \"Don't try to go for it again or ill break your arm.\"  the voice left no doubt in your mind that she meant it.  Turning your head to look at your attacker you are dumbstruck she is beautiful her face is like that of an angle her the only thing that really gave away her race was the fact that she had too small tusks poking up out past her lower lip.  Her skin was a pale grey with what looked like tribal tattoos on her arms and legs that were lilac in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling both amazed at her beauty but afraid of her for her sheer size. You stopped trying to go for your sword and you felt the pressure on your arm lesson but she did not release your arm from under her boot.  Just when you knew that she had you just where she wanted you, you hear Tilly run up to her and shout \"By the ancestors, Lindy you let him up now or I swear ill curse your bones.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at what she had said the ogre finally says \"he is the one who went for the blade, I'm not hurting him.\"  Still filled with anger Tilly shouts at her one more time \"Then get your giant grubby boot off his arm before you break it.\"  Looking back down at you she asks \"do you swear on your ancestors that you won't go for the blade again.\"  Thinking hard about your options you finally say \"I won't go for the blade again.\"  \"Make sure you don't I won't be as forgiving next time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting her on the leg with her tinny little fists Tilly says \"Dam it Lindy I said to let him up.\"   Finally taking the giant boot off your arm and standing a few steps back the ogre woman stands there ready for you to do something stupid.. not wanting to raise her ire any more than you already had you pull your arm back away from your sword rubbing your wrist before you say \"can I at least put my pants back on.\"  The ogre girl says what feel like being modest now?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly laughs at that as she walks over to grab your pants saying \"Mista here got nuffin to be bashful bout he's got him a real winner down der.\"   Handing you your pants you stand up putting them on you then turn t face your attacker as she stood there it became obvious that she was at least a foot and a half taller than you.  and you stood just over 6 feet tall.  looking up at her you finally say \"I think I heard her say your name was Lindy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nimmediately correcting you \"My name is Linda you will call me as such.\"  Tilly chimes in as she was putting her dress back on \"Nock it off Lindy he's a really nice guy especially for a human he was nice to me and \"now blushing a deep blue flush on her beautiful little green face\" well you saw the last part I guess.\"  Firing back she says \"your lucky I was here to watch as much noise as you were making I'm surprised half the forest didn't come to find out what was going on.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around you realize it was now mid-afternoon you two had been going at it for far longer than you had expected.   looking over to Tilly again you feel a slight twang of sadness as she put her sandals back on her giant feet.  Linda happened to notice this but chose to keep it to herself for now speaking up she says \"well let's make for my camp it'll be dark before long and you know full well what lurks these fields at night.\"   Not knowing your self you look at Tilly and say \"what is she talking about?\"  Tilly showing a little nervousness as she says \"Shes right at night you can find a wraith wanderin in these fields and she will kill any human she finds on sight.\"  Linda correcting her with \"and monster girl if she feels like it remember grandma.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiming in with \"wait what grandma.\"  looking at Tilly then Linda then back at Tilly only for the both of them to start laughing.  Tilly says to you \"Me and Lindy her got the same Great Grandpa he was a human who got with both our great grandmas so were related that way but Lindy and I were raised by my Grandma  technically her great aunt but we just called her grandma.\"  Laughing Linda says \"I miss that crazy old goblin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly lowers her head a little say \"yea I sure miss her too.\"  Looking up at you she says \"she would have liked you too.\"  putting the last of your gear back on you walk over to your sword belt looking over at Linda you say \"I'm just putting it back on I won't pull it on you.\"  Nodding at this but still not lowering her guard you put your belt back on but then take a piece of leather and tie your sword so you cant pull it form your shieth.  Visably feeling a little more at ease the three of you head across the field into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking for what seemed like an hour all the while Linda and Tilly were having a conversation about why Tilly had wandered off from Linda that morning and the events that had transpired.  Finally getting to Linda's campsite you look it is a well-made camp good cover from the elements it had a well-built leanto and the remanents of a fire.  Grabbing some logs Linda threw them into the old fire pit and began getting a fire going.  Looking at you she says can you get some water from the rive its about 50 yards that way pointing over her shoulder.  nodding to her you pick up the pot that was beside her and head to the river getting their you get the water and head back to camp getting close you can hear Linda and Tilly talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou hear Linda ask \" Ok I get wanting to have sex he does have a nice penis but what is with the going after your feet thing?\"  \" I don't know why Mista kept going after me pups but it sure felt great while he did it.\"  Linda then chimes in with \"Not gonna lie I kinda want to know what its like.\" Looking down at her boot-clad feet she says \"Thies old things are a little too small for my feet and my pups are barkin that's for sure.\" Walking back into camp you surprise them with how quick you had come back.  putting the pot over the fire you drop your pack and say \"I have some dried beans and salted pork in my pack if you want that for supper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at that Linda says \"um salt pork ain't had that in a while.\"  Pulling it form you pack you put the beans in the pot to soak.  sitting down on a stump near the fire Linda looks over at you and plainly says \" So Mista I get the sex but what is with going after little Tillys big ol feet like you did?\"  Now blushing yourself you finally muster the nerve and say \"well its kind of a quirk of mine I have what we call a foot fetish in the human world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what you meant Linda says \"what is a foot fetish?\"  Looking over at her you say \"well it means I am attracted to feet as much or more than any other body part.\"  Listening to what you had said she then looks down at her boot-clad feet and back up at you but before she could say anything else you say to her \"yes I would be happy to rub your feet.\"  Now blushing herself just a little she tries to play it off by saying \"Well if you insist.\"  Tilly speaks up now and says \"don't play dumb Lindy you know you want him to do it as much as I do.\"  Now walking over next to her sitting down on the same log Tilly asks you \"I do have one question Mista what is it about me pups that you like?  I mean there to big fer me body and ugly.\"  chuckling a little you say to her \"well that's what attracts me to your feet so much is because they are so big for your size I have a thing for big soft sexy feet and I looks like your cousin is in the same boat as you with having feet too big for their frame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting out laughing Tilly says \"Hit the nail on the head there Mista.\"  It's then that Linda bumps her saying \"it's not my fault everyone in the family has feet that are just too big.\"  Walking over to them you reach down and pull off Tilly's sandals setting them on the ground you turn to Linda motioning her to lift her foot up.  Now acting like she was shy she didn't lift her foot it's then that Tilly gives her a chiding saying \"Don't be bashful now or are you afraid.\"  Now with the challenge before her she lifts her left foot up so that you could grab her boot as you grab onto the heel of the boot and start pulling she speaks up and says \"I've been in them all day so my pups might be barking.\"  Smiling at her you say \"I think ill be fine.\" pulling hard on the boot you could tell it really was a bit to small for her pulling much harder than you expected to you finally get the boot to start to pull free pulling it off now as the top of the boot past her heel you saw that she wasn't wearing any socks you could see that her heel was bulbous and round and looked to be incredibly soft reveling the rest of her giant foot you looked intently at her sole her feet were much like Tillys they were long and a little wider by comparison if they were the same size her feet were just as if not thicker and meatier her toes were much the same being medium length and very plump  her soles were this amazing light grey with a hint of pink form the swelling from being in shoes that are too small <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then</span></div></div>",

It's then that you get the distinct smell of sweat it wasn't overpowering but it was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Linda blush now you smile up at her and say \"See not to bad.\"  setting her foot down on your knee you grab her other massive boot doing the same to it as you pull it off.  Looking at them you see that the sole is just leather and the sides were just deer hide with the fur still on it thinking to your self I could make her some new ones of these if we could get a boar and a deer.  Setting the boot down with the other you go back to looking at her right sole grabbing it with both hands you begin to dig your thumbs into her arch working them in circles Linda let off a couple of moans before saying \"Ok I wanted to know what this feels like.  it's heaven.\"  looking over at Tilly she was met with the biggest smirk on Tillys cut little green face before she says back \"Wait till he starts with his tongue\"  Taking Tillys hint you go for it and lick Lindas massive sole with a long slow hard lick up her sole from her huge bulbous heel all the way up to her toes causing her to let out a gasp of surprise flexing her toes scrunching up her soles you were lost in your lust for a few moments at just how sexy her sole is and just how many wrinkles her buttery soft sole had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts then that you feel something rubbing your hard member threw your pants looking down you see Tillys sexy green toes rubbing your member looking over at her she says \"looks like he's ready to come out and play again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda moving her left foot so she could see what Tilly was talking about she is greeted with a view of Tilly's foot rubbing your very evident erection in your pants then saying \"You really do fine big feet attractive don't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling you say \"Only the sexy ones.\" Giving her a wink as you lean in and start licking her big toe working on it for a few moments before you open your mouth just as wide as you could it took a lot of effort but you just managed to her big toe into your mouth it was a little uncomfortable and on the verge of hurting but the feeling of her toe was so self-gratifying sucking on it you could just manga to move your tongue from side to side on her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was now blushing a bright shade of red and was uncontrollably moaning as you sucked on her massive big toe.  Closing her eyes and biting her lower lip as you were working on her big toe you hear Tilly chime in with \"I know right amazing, isn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her toe out of your mouth you are both relieved and saddened that you have her toe out of your mouth giving the big toe one last kiss on the tip of it as you move your head back to look her in the face.

This was now driving your crazy with lust looking intently at her working your member you couldn't wait to pull him out of his little cage and let him go wild on her massive soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Linda's credit despite how massive her feet and toes were she was extremely dexterous with her toes managing to undo the lace to your pants and unbutton them with just her toes. Pulling your pants apart she works her toes into you pants managing to work your member free she now had him out and at full attention.  Smiling down at you she says \"Your actually bigger than I thought not bad.\"  Gripping your shaft in between her big and first toe she began to move them up and down your shaft.  You lean your head back closing your eyes you say \"Man Linda your huge toes are so soft and huge they feel sublime.\"  Just then you get a cool sensation of Tillys toes rubbing and gripping your balls under Lindas Massive foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of warm and cool on you was indescribable they were working in perfect unison despite the fact you had already blown your load several times that day you could still tell that with the both of them working on your Member you wouldn't be able to last much longer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was easily able to work up and down your shaft with her big toe, being a little over twice as wide and 2/3 the length of your dick it was easy to keep control of your member as she worked up and down your dick making sure to grip and squeeze your head as she got to it driving you wild your pre was now leaking like a faucet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes and looking at Linda you are immediately gripped with a sensation of absolute terror about 10 feet behind Tilly and Linda stood an eight-foot-tall hooded figure just close enough to were you could see the black-clad figure in the light form your fire the figure was intently watching what was going on between you and your two companions.  Not wanting to let it know you had seen it you under your breath say \"Whatever you do don't stop till I tell you.\"  Linda noticing your tone change saw the fear in your eyes despite you trying to hide it.  She winked at you and said, \"Are you close?\"  Her tone gave away she was on edge now you say back to her \"Yes, maybe 10 more minutes.\"  Putting stress on the 10 you hope she figured out what you meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to work you like nothing was happening and that was the only reason you were still hard.  Tilly was still oblivious to what was going on.  Closing your eyes and leaning in like you were about to burst you say under your breath once you were sure that the figure couldn't see your mouth in case they could read lips you said just loud enough so that Linda could hear you \"when I give the signal jump up and grab Tilly and make a break for the woods and find somewhere to hide ill buy you two some time and then run myself well meet back up here at dawn\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back and looking her in the eye you could tell she didn't want to hear anything about running but she knew full well what was behind her and that it was either they run and live or you all fight and die.  Finally resigned to her fate she looks up at you and nods you slowly move your and up to her foot and tap your leg 3 times then look at her she nods that she got what you meant, go on three you then tap her foot once twice and finally the third time pulling her foot away from you at lightning speed she grabs an oblivious Tilly and make for the woods shouting I'm sorry as she went you without missing a beat grab up your copper sword and a log form the fire with the other hand and make for the cloaked figure closing half the distance and cutting it off as it had started to go after Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there your dick still hanging out with a sword in one hand and basically a torch in your other you felt more than a little exposed but all that was on your mind was I have to buy them as much time as I can.  It's then that you hear a very sultry laugh come from the hooded figure She then finally spoke up and said in a sarcastic tone \"Sorry for ruining your fun,  Nice dick by the way.\"  Knowing that she is just messing with your head you say back with as cocky of a tone as you could manage to bluff up \"Well your more than welcome to get over here and finish the job.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping beyond hope that she didn't hear how scared you really were.  Its then that she lets out a hearty laugh saying \"poor baby\" lifting up her right leg and revealing her huge right foot from under the black cloak her foot was about the same size as Lindas but it was faintly glowing and blue you could almost see through it, it was translucent due to her being a Wraith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this you are both terrified and aroused by what you were seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on Linda was moving like a bat out of hell in the few minutes since she had grabbed Tilly she had already covered a little over 300 yards and was now down by the river and moving in the river to hide her footprints.  Finally stopping to catch her breath she sets Tilly down and takes her hand off her mouth but says to Tilly very quit but leaving no room for misunderstanding\"  whatever you do stay quiet and be ready to run.\"  Seeing that she was deathly serious Tilly says \"what in the nine hells is going on, why the hell did we abandon Mista.\"  Seeing the pain in Linda's eyes as she says \"The Wraith was behind us and he saw her and is buying us time to get away.\"  Tilly started to freak out says \"we can't leave him we have to go back for him and save him.\"  Lowering her head Linda says \"he's already dead by now  All we can do is make his sacrifice worthwhile by getting away.\"  Tilly began to softly cry at hearing that unable to control her self now that she knew her friend and lover was most likely dead making sure that she got away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her translucent blue foot you look back up at the faceless hood before you say to her \"Not bad I wonder if it's as soft as Lindas.\"   Hearing her chuckle again amused at your fake bravado she says back\" Poor little man I might just give you one last release before I drain your life if you can satisfy me.\"  Knowing now that she had all intentions of draining your life force you think to your self \"well I've always heard that that is a painless way to go so there is that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been at least five minutes now so you were confident that Linda was far enough that you had at least given them a good headstart but you needed to give them more time.  Looking at the moon you could tell it was after midnight now but how close to dawn you couldn't tell it could be an hour or it could be 4 all you could do was hope that you could entertain her long enough to last till dawn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hoping your bluff was holding you say to her \"Well don't be a tease come over by the fire and put that big sexy foot to use.\"  now cautiously moving toward the stump you had been sitting on never lowering your guard as you moved she shadowed your movements moving as if she was floating you sat down on your stump never releasing your grip on the sword or log knowing the sword would do little but you knew that fire at the least could hurt her if only you had been smart enough to have your sword blessed by the priest before you had left the town it could hurt her as it was now it was merely a comfort to you at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved over to the log Linda had been at towering over you she pulled her hood back revealing her beautiful face she had long dark blue translucent hair to go with her pale blue translucent face and body her eyes were the most terrifying part they were solid black with the exception of glowing blue dots for pupils.  She looked down at you with the wicked grin of a cat who has caught her mouse.  Speaking up she says \"I know full well what you are doing trying to waste my time so the other two could get away and I will say Good show sir good show.\"  Almost feeling relieved she shut that hope down by continuing with \"but that won't save you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing full well she was fully set on killing you,  you say to her \"well what do you have in mind with me before you kill me I have no illusions that I can win this fight but I can still hurt you with this fire so I want to hear what you plan and if it involves you leaving them alone I might just go along without a fight.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at this revelation she says with the utmost confidence \"well my good sir I have never had a man play with my feet so if you can satisfy that for me I will make your death painless if I am not satisfied I will rip your soul out slowly and painfully and then hunt your friends for the aggravation.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou</span></div></div>",

Feeling that your best chance to buy time was actually to play along if you can satisfy her curiosity for long enough you might just last till dawn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally adopting a look of resignation she gets a rather wicked grin across her face as you break down and says as you drop your sword and the burning long \"As long as I have your word that you will leave them be.\"  Letting out the evilest laugh you have ever heard she says \"ow I have given you no word to keep I simply look at it as you have no other alternative my pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to control your self you actually flinch a little at hearing her call you her pet.  Still fighting in your mind to do what you must you have to kill as much time as you can dawn was less than an hour away and she seemed oblivious to this fact due to being drunk on the fact she was winning so easily.  Your only hope was the fact her hubris could still be her downfall.  Looking up at her you say dropping all pretenses of bravado in your voice hoping that she would think you resigned to your fate \"so what do you want me to do to your feet first?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling wickedly again she sits down onto the log Linda was sitting on now crossing her right leg over her left revealing her foot again flexing her huge toes as she lifted her foot up and down at the ankle giving you a look at her sole saying to you with all the pride and arrogance she could muster in her voice \"Aren't we being a good little pet my sweet little snack.  I think I will start with a simple foot  massage I have never had one and you like you are at least not inept at giving them.\"  Lifting her leg she moves her right foot into you lap placing her foot right on top of your now deflated dick her foot was actually solid feeling her heel resting right on your dick was ice cold but super soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping at the cold sensation and the fact she wasn't very gentle about putting her massive foot into your lap  she lets out a laugh before putting even more pressure onto your dick saying \"well my pet better hurry or I might just skip right to dessert.\"  Licking her lips as she sad that you reach both hands up and begin to massage the ball of her massive foot working your thumbs in circles you were actually amazed her feet were beautiful toes were a little longer than Lindas but just as plump her soles were even softer but ice cold.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her eyes off of her foot you look up at her and she is staring down at you intently with an actual cut little smirk on her face she says \"well my pet you are actually living up to my expectation if you do good enough I might just keep you and feed slowly off you\"  lowering her self to were she was face to face with you she says \"don't disappoint and you might just last a year maybe more depends on how strong your constitution is.\"  licking her lips again before leaning the rest of the way in before licking your face before moving back to her original position saying \"ow you do taste good.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing your work as best as you can you take as much care and time at making sure she enjoyed your work first moving down to her arch working hard to elicit as much pleasure out of her as you could now sweating from being so afraid of your impending doom it was unnerving to be both terrified to death and completely aroused at the same time.  Moving up to her toes now you had been working on her foot for a good 15 minutes now working your thumbs into her massive big toe, she let out a little moan before closing her eyes as she says \"good my little pet no begin to worship my feet like you did the ogre.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning in you lick her big toe with a quick lick.  To your surprise, it actually tasted like sea salt caramel.  Going back in you start to take harder and longer licks before lifting her massive foot up so you could lick her sole from heel to toe doing it slowly with a long broad lick up the middle of her sole you actually saw her shiver a little with pleasure before she let out a moan of pleasure.  Opening her eyes again she looks down at you again with those unsettling black eyes of hers as she says \"Very good my pet but I need a little taste my self.\"  pushing her foot forward she grabs your shirt with her toes pulling you in with surprising strength she grabs you and give you a harsh deep kiss as she was wrapping her tongue around yours you suddenly felt your energy leaving you at an alarming rate she only held the kiss for a few moments but you could tell she has absorbed a huge amount of your energy.  Releasing you from her grip and pushing you down to the ground with her foot you lay down on the ground feeling utterly spent for a few moments before she says to you with utter lust and satisfaction in her voice \"ow my pet I haven't had one with your strength of will in years I could suck the life form you for years I think if I can pace myself.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at you with both lust and hunger clearly on her face she says to you \"my, my you are a delicious one my pet the last man I found that much would have killed him instantly,  you have enough fortitude that I only took 6 months off your life I am quite impressed.\"  Laying there in utter horror at what you had just felt you look past her at the horizon to see light just starting to break but it would still be 10 minutes before the light would reach you-you had to hang on you had to survive.  Trying to sit up now she pushed you back down with her foot saying \"No, no my pet i am impressed that you can move that quickly after being fed on but I have other plans for the way things are going to go from here lifting her left foot up now she presses your erect dick down onto your stomach and began to rub her big toe up and down your shaft  cooing as she says \"ow such a nice warm hard little plaything.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past her again you see the light coming ever closer only 5 more minutes left till it reaches you and she was so engrossed toying with you that she was oblivious to her situation.  Letting up your dick she put it between her big and first toe alternating up and down your shaft with either toe.  The feeling was amazing you have already begun to leak pre-cum onto her toes laughing at this she says to you \"ow what's the matter my little pet are we getting close if you cum before I say you can I will finish you here and now.\"  Fighting it as hard as you could to last she continued that for a few minutes.  Impressed that you had lasted that long  she says down to you \"Very good my pet but now I will truly test you.\" Moving her foot up she began to rub the head of your dick with her butter-soft sole going back and forth the feeling was amazing to you her sole was so soft it felt like her foot was absorbing your dick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you saw your dick beginning to penetrate her sole and begin to be absorbed into her foot being able to see you dick in her opake blue foot was both amazing and terrifying as she pulled you dick all the way into her massive foot you couldn't help but say that it felt like being in an ice cold vagina feeling the inside of her foot pussy begin to pulsate and milk your dick you tried to move to get away but her other foot was resting on your chest holding you firm to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing maniacally at you she says \"No, no my pet our game is almost over.\"  now moving her foot up and down your dick working it in and out of her foot pussy she was doing her best to milk you dry and you knew full well you couldn't last she only had to do it for a minute when you couldn't hold back anymore and you erupted into her seeing your load shoot out into her due to her translucent it was then she let out the most sultry moan you had ever heard says \"By the gods that feels amazing your seed is so full of life I simply hate to waste you.\"  Suddenly you could feel your enegy beeing pulled out of you like the kiss form before trying to fight it as bes you could she says to you \"Yes fight it my pet give me all you have the fight makes the taste all the sweeter.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>*NOTE: This storyline will take place in a sort of mix between futuristic and medieval technology, so the setting sort of follows it's own rules.*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a large abandoned mansion outside your village. The mansion sits at the top of a cliff and looks down across the ocean on one side and your village on the other. For years the silhouette of the structure had loomed over your village, it seemed light had never shined on that place once during all the times you had looked up at it. <br>\r\nStrange sounds could sometimes be heard echoing down the cliffside and once in awhile someone would go up and see what was happening, but one of two things was all that ever happened. <br>\r\nEither those that ventured up had returned with no more information than they had left with, finding nothing and saying that it was just an abandoned mansion. <br>\r\nOr, on much less frequent occasions, the adventurers would return, hysterical with fear, some even much so that later, when questioned, they had blacked out the experience all together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou distinctly remember an event from your childhood where a young man named Jamin, the son of one of your parent's friends, had decided to see what was up with the house and see if it would be a decent place to hang out. Like a clubhouse to get away from the, sometimes overbearing, adults. Nobody saw Jamin for 3 days. But you were sure that you saw lights on up at the mansion at night, and you were pretty sure you heard female laughter from the mansion those few nights, you had just figured Jamin had brought a few of his friends up with him and one of them happened to be female and she happened to laugh a lot. Now, looking back, you realize that the reality was not at all innocent, and you cringed to wonder what was being done to Jamin as those laughs echoed down the cliffs.<br>\r\nIn the early morning, Jamin had wandered back into the village, terror written across his face and tears in his wide eyes. But that wasn't the only thing on his face, a huge, grimy footprint had been stamped into his face. It took days to get him cleaned up after that. Years for him to not freak out whenever he saw a white dress or a woman's bare foot.<br>\r\nWorse, whenever he was questioned about his experience, he would only ever say: \"The Scary Lady stepped on me.\" or \"The Scary Lady put me under her feet.\" usually with a mental breakdown to accompany it. And after awhile, everyone just stopped mentioning it around him or his family.<br>\r\nBut you had done your research, read every book you could on how monsters behaved and what their strengths and weaknesses were. And you suspected this to be the work of a ghost. It made sense, because what terrified Jamin was definitely a monster, but most monsters would have tried to attack the village by now, try to kidnap someone, or do <i>something</i>. But nothing of the sort had occurred, and the only incident involving whatever was up there was whenever someone stepped into it's turf. And the only type of monster that you could think of that was confined to such a small space, without involving any sort of magic or advanced technology was ghosts, due to their nature of having to be quite powerful to function outside of their haunting ground. To your knowledge, only very powerful and ancient ghost could penetrate the boundaries, and considering this ghost was still confined, you were guessing she was not extremely powerful. <br>\r\nYou had studied how to hunt ghosts, not with swords, not even sacred objects did much but put up a fairly weak ward against them. No, the way to deal with a ghost was by binding it and berating it into submission with spells until it is in complete submission. There was no way to actually kill something that was technically already dead, so the best option was to control it.<br>\r\nYou had tried this technique a few times, and you could finally manage to gently call a horse telepathically. You did not plan on being so gentle with whatever was up there.<br>\r\nYou packed up wit you needed; sage, a few sacred objects, a small dagger (just in case shit got real), a few voice recorders, and a Ouija Board to communicate with whatever spirit in case it won't cooperate with the recorders. <br>\r\nBut you knew that the Ouija Board would be useless at best, and dangerous at worst without another person to play with. Moreover, going up alone was rather foolish in and of itself. Do you find a partner or risk it and go it alone?</span></div></div>",

With your backpack you stood in the dark and cold rain, waiting for an answer as the neon sign above you flickered enough to illuminate your face for the peek-hole in the door.<br>\r\nFinally you heard footsteps approaching the doorstep before the door opened a few moments later, \"Okay, you don't look like the pizza guy,\" Mary said, tilting her head.<br>\r\n\"I'm heading up to the mansion, I think I know what's up there,\" You telepathically replied, just to show her you could do it.<br>\r\nMary looked into your eyes, a wide smile forming across her face as she said, also telepathically, \"I used to be a priestess in training, y'know? I think we may have a chance at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, you could faintly hear the music blasting from Mary's headphones as you walked up the overgrown path along the cliffside to the mansion. Even more audible was the sound of Mary singing along to the music, and while you made sure not to mention it, you sincerely hoped she was a better mage than she was a singer.  But in spite of her untuned voice, her spritely mood put you at ease. <br>\r\nYou looked up the path to see the mansion as it loomed against the dim light of dusk over the ocean, the mansion itself looked evil, like how you'd imagine the doorstep of hell itself. It was even more imposing considering it's history.<br>\r\nYou looked down the other side of the hill it was on, the side that faced away from the village, where you noticed a small cemetery. <br>\r\nThe ancient graves were partially hidden by the dead grass of autumn, visible only by silhouette through the swaying grass as the wind blew through over the hills. <br>\r\nYou decide to go check out the cemetery before heading right to the mansion, you had a better chance of finding ghosts at full night anyway, granted, ghost were also slightly stronger at night.<br>\r\nYou walked over to the graves, stepping over the collapsed iron fence as you held out the flashlight in front of you, glancing at each of the stones. As you read the names you wondered which person had performed whatever ritual to become a ghost after death. Then you wondered if none of them were, maybe the ghost was an outside influence? Maybe the ghost had traveled here through an object? Maybe the ghost had already been here and had just been waiting to gain enough power to interact with others? Maybe, the ghost had trapped the previous inhabitants in the house and had tortured them to death with her feet?<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I needed that thought,\" Mary said next to you, her voice completely deadpan.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you wouldn't have it if you stayed out of my head,\" You retort, not too comforted by your sudden horrific thought.<br>\r\n\"You try being able to read minds and not use it all the time,\" Mary said, now staring up at the mansion, \"Great, <i>now</i> I'm scared.\"<br>\r\nYou walk toward the mansion, quickly but hesitantly. You didn't want to deal with anymore thought like that to make you scared, some ghosts could feed off of fear, so you knew that the more confident you were the better.<br>\r\nYou approach the closed door, not but several feet from it now. You looked up at the windows, expecting the curtain to move unnaturally, or a figure to be watching you. But there was nothing but darkness in those windows, then you looked down to the door again as you reached out your hand to grab the handle.<br>\r\nIn the crack of the door, now ajar, was a face peering out at you. You jumped back with a small grunt of fright as you got a good look at the inhuman face, female and looking directly at you through the strands of black hair that hung over her face with her crazed, red eye, grinning impossibly wide, showing her sharp, shark-like teeth. The skin was chalk white and it's the sclera around her crimson iris was an oily black just like the liquid that streamed down her cheek.<br>\r\nYou stood staring back at her as Mary screams behind you. The Ghost then moved back behind the door, never speaking and never breaking eye contact, and never breaking that freaky-ass grin.<br>\r\nYou quickly recover from the shock as you grab your camera and rush behind the door and attempt to take the Ghost's picture to trap it in the physical realm. But the Ghost was gone. <br>\r\n\"I hate fucking ghost girls!\" Mary screams in frustration behind you.</span></div></div>",

It was so bright in fact that you winced slightly as your eyes adjusted.<br>\r\n\"Son of a <i>fuck</i>, that thing is bright,\" Mary mumbled, lifting her arm to shield her eyes.<br>\r\nYou did not react, but it did catch you a bit off guard just how profane and casual Mary was, you hadn't expected someone of her background to carry herself so. Not that it bothered you, she just wasn't quite what you had expected.<br>\r\nYou looked down at the floor to see a trail of large footprints that led into a shadowy doorway next to the base of the stairs. They looked to be of some black grimy residue, perhaps like dirty water, or more likely, foot sweat. Just looking at it made you sick, let alone the faint smell of foot sweat and dirt. But your disgust paled in comparison to your fear when you saw what lay in one of the footprints. A picture of you, a picture you did not recognize, extremely close to your face, which looked absolutely terrified. And this ghost had stepped on it with her disgusting feet. The implications disturbed you deeply.<br>\r\n\"Don't think about it too hard,\" Mary spoke from behind you. \"In my experience with ghosts, fear is there best weapon, the more frightened you are the more you give them. She's jut trying to get inside your head.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay,\" You say shakily as you move on, now looking up at the huge, crystal chandelier, covered in dust with cobwebs hanging from it like. Then you began walking to your right and into the kitchen, trying to ignore the trail of footprints knowing they were likely a trap considering how obvious they were, and the fact that she could just have easily not left them by shifting out of physical form.<br>\r\nAs you shined the beam into the kitchen you noticed all the furniture was turned upside down, managing, against all logic, to remain balanced. You had heard about poltergeists displaying this sort of bizarre behavior. Bizarre even by monster standards. <br>\r\nDirectly above your head you could hear, and even feel, the sounds of something up there moving. <i>Scrraaape! Creeeaaak.</i> And, as if you needed further confirmation that you were not imagining things out of fear, you felt the dust fall into your hair<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go explore the other rooms,\" You say moving away from the falling dust to prevent it getting in your eyes. \"I want to see where the best place is to use the Ouija board or set up some audio recorders. If she isn't coming out now, I think it's safe to say she's not going to unless we can talk first.<br>\r\n\"She's trying to be sneaky; knows she can't take us both at once,\" Mary nodded, producing her phone and holding it in front of her face, presumably to use some program to locate negative energy within  the house, \"She's already made it clear as fucking crystal what she wants with you, so she's probably just waiting for you to get scared enough to make a mistake, so I'll cover you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what you thought was likely an hour, you peeked up into the attic from the rickety ladder you stood on and instantly, you were greeted with a sick stench, one that you recognized from the footprints when you first entered the front door. And right then you knew you had found your hotspot to use the Ouija and EVP devices. Not that you wanted to spend any amount of time in a place that smelled, or felt like this. <br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm getting some-,\" Mary said behind you.<br>\r\n\"Yep, you got some readings,\" you said with a gag as you lifted your sleeve to your nose to filter the stench. \"<i>Fuck</i>,\" You curse under your breath as you struggle to climb into the attic through the small hatch. Then you saw a small window on the other side of the attic with a rocking chair next to it, you doubted it would help to reduce the stink by a lot, but it was a start and with time it may manage to make it bearable. Other than that, the attic looked mostly like how you would expect it, dark, dusty, and crowded with antiques you internally considered the worth of. But, it would have to be a particularly pricey item for you to run the risk of this, or any entity in this house attaching itself to the item and then haunting you or whoever bought the item. Then again, money is money, and these are trying times.<br>\r\nYou walked over to the window, noting how long a way it was down considering you were on the fourth floor and atop a cliffside on this side of the mansion. You lifted the panel with little resistance, letting the wind billow in and clean out some of the air, of course it also stirred up a bit of dust and you knew that could be problematic. But considering how breezy it was, you were hoping it may not take as long as you had thou-.<br>\r\n<i>Wait, did that rocking chair just move?</i><br>\r\nYou snapped your gaze to look at the rocking chair. Empty and still as a statue. You tried to convince yourself you had just imagined it, or that the wind really was <i>that</i> strong. But when you turned around and made eye contact with Mary, you could tell by the look on her face, she saw it too, probably better than you did considering her line of sight.<br>\r\n<i>Clunk.</i> You snapped you head first back to the rocking chair, which still looked still and unassuming, then you realized the window had been slammed shut.<br>\r\nYou pushed the chair away from you before trying to push the window open again. But it wouldn't. It felt as if it were bolted shut. <br>\r\nMary walked up next to you with something in her hand, \"Let me try.\"<br>\r\nYou stepped out of the way just in time to see the crowbar in her hand as she swung it, shattering the window, and the windowpane with zero effort before pushing out the broken remains onto the rocks below.<br>\r\n\"I ain't smelling that bitch's foot stench,\" Mary says under her breath as she nonchalantly drops the crowbar on the floor and walks back to the center of the floor before sitting down indian-style. \"I get ahold of this bitch, she'll be begging for me to die a second time,\" She says, a slight smirk on her face.<br>\r\nYou figured she was probably angry after losing her temple to a monster attack, but you were also eager to get this hunt under way, and you knew she probably was as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OPTION 1). Encourage Mary to vent and whatever that entails. <b>+15 Affinity w/ Mary</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOPTION 2). Get on with the Ouija Board session. <b>+10 Affinity w/ Ghost (for better or worse)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>***You start the relationship with each character at 30.***</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The Affinity system will determine how that character will treat you and how they will feel about certain decisions. Keep in mind that characters will show affection and distain in their own ways so take that as a note of caution when raising or lowering affinity too far beyond the starting number. And that's all I'm going to say otherwise I will just further complicate it and not even I will be able to keep it straight.</i></span></div></div>",

After seeing all that I plan on humiliating those that commit these atrocities similarly,\" She said with dissonant excitability.<br>\r\n\"How? I mean, I've not ever seen a human with feet like a monster girl's. Not nearly as-\" You asked. <br>\r\n\"Toxic? Believe me, mine are,\" She said, rushing to untie her converses, \"I'll prove it,\" She said with a grin.<br>\r\nYou were ready to tell her there was no need, but then you saw her pull her foot out from the shoe and present it to you. While Mary's foot was not particularly dirty, it was certainly sweaty and smelly, and there was a bit of black filth between her toes that had smeared a bit over her sole.<br>\r\n\"C'over here and smell 'em,\" Mary urged you, biting her lower lip and giving you a lusty look while wriggling her toe jam covered toes. \"If you can even bring yourself to sniff between my toes <i>once</i>, I guess I will have to work harder,\" She teased.<br>\r\nYou really did not want to do this, but Mary was pretty attractive and this may have been your chance. Furthermore, Mary was a potential long-term ally and you wanted to nurture that relationship as much as possible.<br>\r\n\"I'll give you five bucks to sniff between my toes,\" Mary dared in a singsong voice, even waving the bill around a bit.<br>\r\nAgainst every part of yourself you walked over to Mary and sat down across from her, all the while she never broke eye contact. <br>\r\n\"Fine,\" You sigh, dreading the terrible, if brief torture that was to befall you.<br>\r\nMary grinned terribly as she lifted her foot to your face and trapped your nose within the unholy smells of her toes. You sniff and your eyes begin to water for the stink and you cough as you inhaled a few drops of her sweat. <br>\r\n\"You fucking idiot, you actually took the dare! And your afraid of feet!\" Mary laughed, not cruelly but as if she had just seen the absurdly impossible.<br>\r\nYou pulled your face out of her toes and you grimace as your coughing continued.<br>\r\n\"I'll give you ten more bucks here, and ten more when we get back, <i>and</i> a bottle of soda I brought,\" Mary began as you cringed. \"If you open up your mouth and clean my dirty, dirty toes, even between them, and eat all my toe grunge. You can't spit anything out.\"<br>\r\n\"That's a bit over the line,\" You say nervously.<br>\r\nMary sighed, \"Fine, you'll get fifty dollars total.

Plus, hey, free soda. Then again, this technically makes you a whore... The thought makes your cheeks burn even hotter.<br>\r\n\"Well? What's it gonna be?\" Mary asks somewhat impatient, wiggling her grimy toes tantalizingly in front of your face as if that would convince you.<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't... cleaning your feet ruin all the work you put into them this far?\" You ask, somewhat confused where this whole bet idea came from. Mary shrugs her shoulders in response.<br>\r\n\"Eh, you have a point. But seeing as how my toes did nothing but make you cough and tear up, they'd be no match for an actual monster girl.\"<br>\r\nShe's right. Her feet may be fragrant, but compared to the stale, musty scent of the ghost in the room, Mary might as well be a patch of spring flowers.<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" she continues, \"Not like I have anyone to tell me how powerful they are. You get used to your own smell after a while. What would I do, walk up to a stranger and ask them to sniff 'em?\"<br>\r\n\"So this is kinda like a sparring match or something.\" You add. Mary's eyes light up and her smile widens as she sees you start to come around.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right! I can see how strong my feet are, and you can see how strong your resistance is. Aaand fifty bucks~.\" She waves the money around once more, grinning, fully convinced she has you.<br>\r\nHer bold confidence and somewhat flirty demeanor has just about won you over, but a final thought crosses your mind.<br>\r\n\"What about the ghost? She's probably hiding in the shadows watching us...\" You look around the dusty room for any glimpse of the specter.<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>her</i>?\" Mary looks around the room with you, chuckling darkly. It's actually somewhat intimidating. \"That bitch can watch all she wants...\" Mary's eyes return to yours, but they look more stern.<br>\r\n\"Open.\"<br>\r\nYou obeyed without hesitation, jaw dropping open almost as if your body decided to act on its own. Mary's sudden dominant streak seemed to awaken some sort of submissive streak in you.<br>\r\nSoon, something warm entered your mouth, followed by an explosion on your tastebuds. Mary's foot had been hovering in front of your face as you talked, so you got somewhat used to the smell. But the taste? Nothing could have prepared you. A soft sigh escaped her mouth as she bit her bottom lip. <br>\r\n\"Gooood boy...\" She grinned down at you with that same lusty look from before. \"Be sure to tell me how my feet affect you. Any strange feelings or weaknesses you get, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Mmeah...\" You mumble out, still trying to adjust to the invader in your mouth. It was just her big toe so far, so you could manage.  But it was still an overwhelming flavor, the salt almost burning a hole through your tongue. And speaking of tongues, you have still not even started licking yet, just letting the pad of her toe rest inside. Mary notices this too.<br>\r\n\"Yo, I ain't paying you to warm my toes, I said fuckin' clean them!\" Her stern voice came back and you instantly found yourself swirling your tongue around the toe, almost in a panic, the salty assault on your mouth returning at full force. And then it happened...<br>\r\nYou reached the 'grunge' as she called it.<br>\r\nMary let out a surprised gasp at the feeling as your tongue swished through her big and second toes, picking it up. You couldn't help but cringe at the taste and texture, every part of you screaming to spit, but you made a deal. Shutting your eyes, you prepare to swallow the mouthful and get it over with, when Mary angles her foot up so you look her in the eyes.<br>\r\n\"Uh uh...\" She playfully wags a finger at you. \"Gotta look and swallow~.\" She giggles.<br>\r\nHer words aren't lost on you and you feel your cheeks burn hotter than ever. You have half a mind to tell her that wasn't part of the deal, but in the end decide to do as she says. Looking dead into her eyes, you swallow down the crud as fast as you can.<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! I thought for sure you'd chicken out this time!\" She laughs loudly, a tear rolling down her cheek, obviously enjoying this a bit too much.<br>\r\n\"Mmmf...\" You huff out in response, her teasing and toejam sapping any backtalk you might have had earlier.<br>\r\nMary's laughter slows down and she wipes the tear away. \"Haaa... Oh man... Now then, I see you've gotten acquainted with Miss Big. Would you like to meet her sisters?\" She giggles girlishly, drumming her other toes on your cheek. It wasn't a question.<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you nod. Not like she was going to let you say 'no' anyway.  Opening your mouth wider, you allow her stuff the rest of her toes inside. Mary's foot wasn't huge, but it sure wasn't dainty. In fact, it was almost-<br>\r\n\"The perfect fit?\" Mary asks, literally finishing your thought. \"I was thinking that, too. Maybe your mouth was made for my foot?\" She giggled again. And from the position you're in, you can't really argue.</span></div></div>",

You were almost instinctually going to set the bag on the rickety old rocking chair next to you, but just as you turned to look at the chair, you got an unnatural chill up your spine, and you knew that was a bad idea. <br>\r\n\"Go head,\" Mary urged impatiently, \"Set it in the chair. It'll show her your not scared,\" She said motioning her hand toward the chair.<br>\r\nPut on the spot all of a sudden, you looked back and forth between the chair and Mary as you wondered what to do. Then you saw the rocking chair jerk toward you slightly, making a hellish scraping noise across the floor. Yep, that decided it.<br>\r\nYou shook you head as you quickly walked away from the chair and toward Mary, never setting your backpack down, \"Nope. Nope. Nope,\" You mutter beneath your breath.<br>\r\nYou made sure to position yourself where you could see the rocking chair across the room with Mary to your left and your back to the hatch and your face to the window before sitting down on the floor and unzipping the bag.<br>\r\nYou produced the board, a few candles, and a lighter and set them down next to you, where Mary almost instantly picked them up and began lighting them and forming a circle around the board. You produced a camera from the bag and took a moment to adjust the settings before setting it down opposite you and Mary so that it could capture the session. You wanted proof if something happened, and you also wanted to look over the footage in case it caught something you or Mary didn't. <br>\r\n\"Okay, I think we're ready to start,\" You say under your breath as you place the LED lighted planchette on the board.<br>\r\n\"Who should ask the questions? You or I?\" Mary inquires, placing two of her fingers on the planchette. <br>\r\nYou knew Mary was eager to be the one to talk to the spirit, but you weren't sure that was a good idea considering how angry she was and how much negative energy she could incite. Furthermore, as much as it disgusted you that the ghost wanted you, you knew you could work that in your favor by being provocative, thus using yourself as bait. And if your could lure her into the physical realm, and then take a picture with your old, antique camera, you could trap her in the physical realm long enough to bind her to your command. <br>\r\n\"I think it would be best if I did,\" You replied to Mary, hoping she wouldn't press the matter.<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Mary scoffed, slightly perturbed.  <br>\r\nYou placed your fingers on the planchette, careful to keep your fingers just barely touching the board to allow for the best communication.<br>\r\n\"We know you're here, we would like to talk,\" You said, your hand shaking slightly as a sense of even more overwhelming dread came over you. You felt like she was right behind you. But you didn't turn round, you didn't want to let her know she was getting to you.<br>\r\nThe planchette didn't move, but you did feel it vibrate slightly, but that could have been attributed to your quivering fingers.<br>\r\n\"Your being too nice,\" Mary argued, \"You need to provoke these kinds of spirits. After all, she wants to scare and dominate you, wouldn't she crave that more if you were a dick to her?\" <br>\r\nYou looked at Mary, fear still in your eyes, \"I'll let you try in a minute,\" you hiss.<br>\r\nMary sighed in staring back down at the planchette.<br>\r\nMeanwhile you ponder another thing to say. There was a moment of silence between you and Mary, accompanied only by the sound of the howling wind outside and the faint smell of the ghost's feet, whose toes were likely wriggling in anticipation of savagely dominating you. The thought made you cringe, and cringe even more as you realized you were screwing yourself over by using yourself as bait.<br>\r\nYou sighed in dread as you decided to bring out the big guns as a last effort to elicit a response before handing the communication role over to Mary. \"Can you tell me about that photo you stepped on downstairs?\" <br>\r\nMary looks up at you as you stare down at the board, her eyes wide in shock...</span></div></div>",

Even so, you press on.<br>\r\nYou try and think of another question to stall for time before Rei catches on to you and Mary's plan but-...<br>\r\n\"Don't open your mouth,\" Mary said simply, making your blood run cold.<br>\r\nYou wanted to ask why, but you didn't dare risk opening your mouth to say anything.<br>\r\nBut that question would be answered in the following seconds anyway, and in the most hair raising way you could think of.<br>\r\nYou watched in petrified terror as Rei's wide, shapely, but massive and horrifically filthy foot slowly extended out in front of your face over your right shoulder. Her toenails were painted black and her skin was chalk white but her toes and soles were blackened with grime mixed with sweat. You cringed at the sight of the gunk in the crevices between her toes as she spread them with a long moan behind you.<br>\r\nThen you began to retch and gag on the ghastly smell, it burned in your nostrils and you felt your eyes already begin to tear up. You could feel more pressure on your shoulder as she began to relax her calf before curling her foot back toward your face, letting you take in the sight of her dirt crusted, sweat dripping sole.<br>\r\nYou found it hard to move, perhaps for your mortal terror, but even if it was easy, you willed yourself not to do so. You needed to distract Rei just long enough for Mary to take a picture.<br>\r\nTears ran down your face both for the intensifying smell and the horror as she curled her big toe back to poke your lips. <br>\r\n\"Open,\" Rei whispered, sounding uncomfortably close your head and sending shivers of disgust and dread down through your body. <br>\r\nAnd with her black colored footsweat dripping on your tightly closed lips you had a decision to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1).

You coughed and sputtered on the taste of the foul liquid, determined to keep your teeth tightly clenched as she began working on wriggling her toes in.<br>\r\nIn your ear- no, not your ear; your head, there was a voice, a slithering hiss inside your skull, \"With fearful manner... Beneath the feet of arcane beings... Eternity tortured... You will be... Timeless lament... Accept fate... Accept fear... So welcome to my world...\"<br>\r\nThen with a slight giggle, you felt a sharp pain in the back of your neck, it was just enough to cause you to instinctually let out a frightened yelp even if you knew what the entity was attempting.<br>\r\nRei, just as you had known and feared she would, used the opportunity to push her big toe between your teeth, but not all the way into your mouth, just enough to keep it open.<br>\r\nMary's eyes went wide as she pulled the camera off the floor, staring back at you and your tormentor.<br>\r\nYou bit down hard on Rei's toe to see if the pain would cause her to recoil; it was like trying to crush a jawbreaker but with a fleshy texture; useless and unpleasant as your teeth scraped off copious amount of black dirt and drops of sweat that fell onto your tongue.<br>\r\nRei's only reaction was a mocking chuckle as you tried shaking your head, just enough to get her toe out, but her toe remained firmly in place. <br>\r\nThen you heard her breathy voice on your right ear as her right hand reached around to hold your face at her torturous foot; \"Accept my eternal torment, boy,\" she said as she slowly extended her other four toes over your nose and almost into your eyes. And with that, your face was buried in the stench and toe grunge of Rei's feet as your nostrils and lungs burned from the foul smell. Tears ran down your face both from the disgust of the scent, and the paralyzing terror as it became clear you would not be leaving this mansion without Rei first having her way with you.<br>\r\nThen, you could feel her toe start to push past your teeth, and you knew there was nothing you could do to stop her, instead you preemptively pulled your tongue back in desperate hope to avoid the full extent of her torture. <br>\r\nYou felt a slight squeeze around your abdomen as you looked down to find Rei's other ghostly white leg slithering around you, pulling you closer to her and further into the shadow behind you.<br>\r\nMary audibly flicked the camera on, and you knew at this point Rei must have known what was happening, but instead of reacting in such a way to at least end your torment she merely continued until her big toe was shoved all the way into your mouth.<br>\r\nRei gave a loud laugh, feminine and cruel.<br>\r\nYou screamed, short and muffled as her foul toe face-fucked you, even worse was that, despite your efforts her toe found your tongue and dominated it in horrible fashion. You coughed and groaned as her massive toe slid across your anguished tastebuds, leaving trails of black, oozing foot-sweat and toe-grime filling your mouth.. <br>\r\nFinally, you caught a glimpse of fury in your partner's eyes, and within an instant, you saw the wrath overcome fear as she pulled the camera up to snap the capturing image.<br>\r\nBut Rei was not without her reaction as she quickly pulled you back into the darkness, and you could feel yourself begin to lose your grip on consciousness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oily blackness of unconsciousness enveloped you as you floated through the air. But you were headed home victorious regardless. You were sure with you acting as bait, and Mary; in all her contempt for the monsters, would be able to fight and capture Rei. And despite your fearful fainting, you would have escaped the full horror of the vile spirit's toes you would have been subjected to. No, you were were sure everything was going to be okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour senses slowly began to return and the first thing you feel is the hardness of your cradle, ungiving and smooth. This was not your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next second you smelled the rancid air. This was not your room's scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fluttered open, expecting to gaze upon your room, and perhaps your mother's or Mary's smiling face. But it was only then that the full extent of your failure sank in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surrounded you, this enclosure, this cell, dark and oppressive; was not your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the face that stared back down at you from atop the side of the bed to your right, eyes wide in excitmente and sharpened teeth bared in an unnaturally large rictus grin; was not Mary, and it was not your mother. But it was no stranger to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sank at the sight and you shut your eyes in terrified denial. And for what stretched to an uncomfortable amount of time you stayed, unwilling to open your eyes for fear of what you may see. However, thankfully you could not yet smell the stench of Rei's dreadful peds. It seems as though she was the type to toy with her prey and savor her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had a moment to compose yourself, and accept that whatever had happened you were now at the feet of a frightful ghost girl that wanted nothing more than to torture you to death beneath her nasty soles. And that she would be drowning you in her foot sweat very soon unless you found a way to escape her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you opted to try and deal with the situation, even in your limiting position. With your eyes still fearfully closed you attempted to roll yourself beneath the bed as a first step toward any desperate escape. You wanted to be back in your bed, back with your family, not under the vile feet of Rei's evil desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you attempted movement and your body refused, your muscles limp despite your commands, your last bit of any hope went crashing down to the floor where your body still laid, both soon to be tormented by Rei's blackened soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctually, as your mind reeled for any other panicked solution, your eyes opened. And as soon as you realized what your were doing you tried to shut them again, but it as too late, you were already taking in what you saw. Which was nothing. In fact, Rei was no where in sight from your position; lying on the floor along the side of the bed. But this gave you no light of hope, it only made you dread her inevitable appearance moreso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after several minutes of terror soaked straining against your paralysis and waiting for Rei to present herself you heard the sound of the rusty springs of the mattress above you squeak slightly. It was very quiet, almost faint, but it was enough to cause you to stop and consider that Rei had not left. She had and remains atop the mattress, silently savoring your fear until she becomes bored. And this was confirmed by the deep orgasmic moan that followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was followed by the sight of Rei's long, pale leg stretching out from atop the bed, a huge, black high heeled shoe hanging from her foot looming over your face, grimy foot sweat periodically dripping out of it and onto the floor beside your face. The stench was getting worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take heed, mortal boy,\" Rei hissed as her shoe fell to the floor in the pool of sweat that was building dangerously close to your face with loud *Clump*, leaving only a large blackened, sopping wet sock barely dangling from her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For if you believe that there is any chance of salvation from what is to befall you, I will assure you the contrary,\" Rei continued as she swung her sock just enough to cause it to fall, joining her high heel with a sickening *Slap* as a bit of her sweat from it flicked onto your face. It was absolutely nauseating and the intensifying stench caused you to begin a short fit of violent coughing as it poisoned your lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, your reaction amused Rei as she gave a slight giggle before sitting herself up to stare down at you with her crazed, crimson eyes as she swung uer other leg over the bed to join the other as she hovered her two bare, nasty feet above your face. It was then that you noticed just how much larger Rei was than you. In fact, it seemed as though she had somehow reduced your size to at most two and a half feet tall, evidently a more desirable size for Rei to dominate. The idea of Rei having this kind of power and possibly more, disturbed you greatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl, your last remaining hope of escape, yes? She failed to even get so much as get a picture before I was upon her,\" Rei grinned, taking great pleasure in rubbing in how doomed you were. And you knew that she was trying to break you, and even while you knew you were unlikely to make it out of this, you would work your best to deny her the pleasure of letting her know how much this broke and terrified you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may wonder where your friend is now?\" The cruel spirit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did wonder, but you assumed the worst if what Rei was saying was true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Note how I have but presented but one shoe and one sock?\" She continued, motioning with her grimy toes to the filthy items to your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately understood the horrific implications of Mary's current situation, but Rei decided to rub it in a bit more anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how she screamed as I shoved my sock, that have been on my feet for the past few hundred years, into her mouth. Her fear as she first tasted the vileness was delicous. But after her remarks concerning my foot stench, I knew it would be a shame to waste that potential, so I bound my other reeking shoe to her face,\" Rei laughed as she slowly extended her massive toes to your face, making more of her foot sweat and toejam drip onto your tortured face as you grimaced in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would assume by now she is realizing, as you are, neither of you will be escaping my feet. She will spend the rest of her life sucking the sweat and grime from my socks, and you will remain beneath my soles, and not even in death will you find release, for you will only fall further into my control,\" Rei smiled, every second her toes got closer to your face, and the stench multiplied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei cocked her head to the side slightly, a look of thoughtfulness in her wide eyes, \"But perhaps we should build to the true horror that is my toes in your mouth? I think I may sit myself upon your face so you may pleasure me first. But make no mistake, while it will not my feet, you will not enjoy it, and you should be very afraid,\" The ghost threatened, considering her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not like the idea of Rei sitting on your face or making you \"pleasure her\" but the thought of her toes in you mouth for longer than they had been already or her sweaty soles on your face was just as terrifying at least. No matter what she picked, it could only end in tears and quite possibly years in therapy for you, that is if you made it out alive at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(((I'd like to apologize for any errors in the above entry, but I'm also going to make excuses for myself by saying mentioning the fact that I wrote this on mobile so at least I can use that as some rationalization for my lack of \"Underrstended Engrish\".

Lol, I have too much time on my hands.) </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long moment of silence enveloped you as you stared up from the floor at the sadistic specter, the dim light only barely illuminating her cruel face. In fact, it seemed the unsettling scarlett lights in her eyes did more to allow you to watch as her mouth curled up into a frightening, razor lined grin as her gaze pierced your soul with gleeful cruelty. Rei had made up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only whimper in terror as she tapped her grungy toes on the floor next to your face, lightly scratching the side of your head with her toenails and smearing a bit of her grime off on you. You tried to turn your face from the sickening sensation, but to little effect due to the paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, it has been so long since my feet had a proper mouth fucking-,\u201d Rei murmured as her toes pressed and rubbed harder against your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed, your mind racing to come to a solution, some way to stop this from happening to you. You refused to accept it. You called on any god that would answer but all you got was Rei\u2019s nightmarishly filthy foot drawing ever closer, across your cheek, towards your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-Centuries in fact. You see, in life I was Nobility, as a smart boy like yourself may have deduced by my manner,\u201d she boasted, clearly jerking off her own ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opted to use Rei\u2019s moment of haughtiness to try and gain a clearer perspective, try and muster the mental energy to push off the paralyzing fingers of whatever influence Rei had you under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for a moment you thought there was some progress being made. You could almost feel the intangible bars holding you down begin to bend.<br>\r\nAnd you could almost make out a speck of light at the end of tunnel, you just had to keep working at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei\u2019s eyes shined with glee as she observed the light of hope return to your gaze. And for a moment she let you revel in the illusion of even the possibility of escape. But as her eyes caught your finger begin to twitch, she decided that you were far too close to escaping and you had to be pushed back into despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hem of her transparent kimono brushed your nose as your tormentress raised her enormous foot above your horrified face. It was even bigger now with you diminished size, the ball of her sole alone easily wider than your face, which now would fit nicely in between her arches. Your stomach curled at the thought, but you still attempted to keep pushing against the paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with a sinister smirk Rei flexed her foot above your face. The sight of her disgusting soles was enough to make you cringe, but the smell was far worse. The stench seemed to pierce your senses and drift into your very incorporeal soul. You were almost sick in your stomach from it, and you knew this was merely the genesis of Rei\u2019s vile domination of your senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, you could feel your fingers start to move and you could almost begin to make a fist. You just had to bide your time long enough to keep her going until you were able to fight back, run away and get some help to rescue Mary. It might not have been the most elaborate or unexpected plan, but it was your only option to escape this horror. And you certainly weren\u2019t going to just let her do this to you and Mary without a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used to have hand picked peasants from the settlement that became your lovely little city down the hill, brought to me. Boys and girls, it didn\u2019t matter,\u201d Rei continued waning almost nostalgic on her life, when she had it, as she laid her huge toes across your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sank in panic, and you really were sick now, merely from the fearful anticipation of what she was going to do next. Your nostrils began to burn from the terrible odor of her toes and you could feel the tears stream down the sides of your face from the terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even so, all you would let your mind focus on was moving. And you could begin to move your elbows and twitch your knees slightly. But you refrained from letting Rei know any of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, these peasants thought they would live a life of luxury in my house as they served me,\u201d The filthy apparition explained as she pointed her big, second and third toes down onto your lips. Letting you simmer in your disgust and horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you can probably assume how that all turned out for them,\u201d Rei continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer big toe was now lightly tracing your lips in a disturbingly intimate fashion. And you fell into a fit of coughing as a bit of her toe sweat slipped onto your tongue. Trying your best not to open your mouth and give Rei a chance to shove her vile toes down your throat, you sputtered at the revolting taste. But Rei could have done that at her leisure regardless with your jaw mostly limp from the paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste of her sweat was salty and sour, and as you tasted it Rei laughed at your horror. You could not imagine what the rest of her feet would do to your mouth. And unless you could remain focused on breaking the paralysis, you would find out very soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough, my last visitor, another boy from your little city, managed to fight me off and run away, before he tasted my feet in whole. But I am stronger now, and if I may be so bold, you managing to break the paralysis as much as you have\u2026\u201d She began, leaning down to stare directly into your helpless face. Her toes stayed firmly over your mouth as her pale, vaguely asian features filled your field of vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Makes me pretty fucking horny for you,\u201d Rei whispered in a tone that seemed to be trying to be sensual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as she said this. The last thing you wanted was having a monster girl, let alone one this frighteningly evil, developing some kind of twisted crush on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t as hard as you cringed when Rei stood back up to her full, towering height and took action against your resistance. Not the action you had expected, but enough to escalate the torment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes snaked up your face and over your nose until the ball of her wide sole was resting on your lips and the tips of her big and second toes were covering your field of vision. Drops of Rei\u2019s foot sweat stung your eyes, which only made you cry more. But more pressingly, she had buried your nose deep in her toe crevice, right in the highest concentration of sweat, toejam, and stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Rei\u2019s eyebrow raised with a smirk. You knew what she wanted, and she knew that you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew holding your breath would be pointless, all she had do was wait and you would eventually have to take a large intake of her terrible stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you only took in short, shallow breaths to avoid the bulk of the stink. But even the through your limited breaths the smell was mind-numbingly horrific. It was enough to make you shudder and whimper beneath her nasty sole. But you could still feel progress being made on the paralysis, albeit slower due to the painful distraction her stench in your nostrils posed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei\u2019s smirk faded as she observed your resourcefulness. Her toes wrapped around your nose and squeezed tightly, suffocating you under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew exactly what she was playing towards and you struggled as hard as you could against her. Even desperate enough to open your mouth under her foot to try and get some bit of oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic overcame you as your body screamed for air and Rei denied it to you by slipping the ball of her foot over your mouth as a seal. And you managed only in getting another foul taste of her feet as the tip of your tongue touched her sole. The nastiness of even such slight contact was immeasurable, causing more tears to flow from your eyes as you anticipated her toes in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not until you were on the cusp of unconsciousness that Rei released your nose allowing you to breath once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as your lungs instinctively took in a deep inhale, with it came the ghost girl\u2019s reek, directly from between her toes and into your nostrils. The smell was absolutely foul, enough to cause an unexpected sound to form from your lips under her feet. A scream, muffled by her nasty foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei, looking disturbingly satisfied by your demonstration of horror, bit her lower lip as her hand drifted toward her crotch. And you were shocked by her vileness as she tortured you with her reeking feet for her sexual pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were forced to take in breath after breath of the rancid odor between her toes as you struggled to catch your breath. Each time you moaned in disgust as Rei's foot reek felt like it was burning your nose and seemed to poison your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more importantly, any mental strength you had to fight off the paralysis had faded. It, along with any hope you had remaining were crushed beneath the poisoning, vile reek of Rei\u2019s feet. And every time you tried to make an attempt to escape the horror, the same horror would pull you back, screaming and crying as you inhaled another bit of her stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei smirked at your crushed hope, almost wishing you had held onto it a bit longer for her to torment. And for a moment she considered letting up enough for you to discover it once again. But as her fingers began slowly pleasuring her sensual area, she knew it was time she stop playing with her food. It was time she start escalating the torment substantially.But first she wanted to torture your spirit, which had proved to be just as much a delight as your face was beneath her.  </span></div></div>",

Her weight was probably only thing she made you endure that was not brutally painful on your senses but it was enough to make your breathing even more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed up at your tormentress as she cocked her head slightly, her red eyes showing only a feigned sense of compassion, but a frightening amount of all too genuine lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei\u2019s toes spread as she wiped at your tears, her grime smearing across your face. \u201cShh\u2026 Shh\u2026 Shh\u2026 It\u2019s okay,\u201d she assured, of course, making it even more not okay. \u201cYou\u2019ve fought better than anyone else I\u2019ve seen. And honestly, I\u2019m impressed. In fact, maybe if you hadn\u2019t underestimated the task you took when coming up here, you would have become something of a hero. Maybe even turning the tide of the war,\u201d she continued, rubbing in your failure, letting you marinate in your despair, but strangely also feeding your ego. \u201cBut you\u2019ve done enough. You\u2019ve earned my favor. And I\u2019ll keep you under my feet forever and ever, and ever,\u201d she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimpered, not wanting to give her the satisfaction of seeing you completely burst out into tears and pathetic begging. But as you coughed on the sour smell between Rei\u2019s toes you choked down a sob. This could not be what the rest of your existence would reek of; this ghost\u2019s toes. This was nothing short of hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhh\u2026 There\u2019s no escape. There's nothing you can do to stop me. So I\u2019ll just take over, and you won\u2019t have to worry about anything else\u2026\u201d Rei bared her sharp fangs in a hair raising smile as her foot slid even further up your face. And once she had planted one half of your red, tear stained face beneath the arch of her left foot she raised the other sole to match it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your face smothered beneath her feet, you were left in torturous darkness and her sweat began pouring into every orifice. It stung your eyes and the rancid taste left you shuddering beneath the ghost\u2019s grime. Combined with the paralysis it created a sensation not dissimilar to being buried alive beneath the phantom's peds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed and sobbed into Rei\u2019s revolting soles as she balanced on your face, her sweat and toe grime slowly dripping and oozing down the sides of your face and onto the creaky wood floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you felt her noxious toes wriggle through your hair you kept trying in vain to fight back. But even as despair crept over you, attempting to smother out even your hope and will beneath this monster\u2019s soles, you kept batting it away. All else had been taken from you, all you had left was hope. And you could only be inspired to keep trying to fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an eternity smothered under Rei\u2019s arches, but finally you felt her feet lift off of your face, leaving her black, grimy prints in your skin. You coughed and gasped for even slightly less toxic air before opening your eyes to gaze up at the dominating face of Rei. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was levitating herself above you, her feet dangling down just inches above your lips. You closed your mouth tightly, pursing your lips in a disgusted grimace as soon as you foresaw what she was going to you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei cocked her head as she stared at you, her wild, black hair hanging down in strands over her face, \u201cBeg me not to do this,\u201d she hissed, poking her big toe on your lips, tensing up slightly as she prepared to shove it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent in terrified, tear stained defiance, but defiance nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei stared back at you with a curious glint in her crimson gaze, \u201cMost would be beyond broken now... But not you, you\u2019re still fighting me,\u201d she whispered, staring lustfully into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes you steeled yourself as you felt Rei\u2019s grimy toe wriggle through your lips and now against your teeth. You felt so helpless and all you could do was shiver in horror and quietly whimper on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to look at me as I toe fuck your face. Open your eyes and look at me!\u201d Rei orders, snapping her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still quietly refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen your eyes or I will bring in your little girlfriend so you can watch as she gets face fucked by my feet as well!\u201d Rei giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally caved and opened your eyes to look her in eyes. You knew she would follow through with her threat, she was more than cruel enough to and you couldn\u2019t live with that guilt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, struck a cord, I see,\u201d Rei smirked as she twisted her toe on your lips, sweat and grime oozing down onto your tongue, burning your mouth. \u201cPerhaps I should bring her in anyways, just to see what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, any semblance of courage you had was crushed. You broke down, a sobbing wreck as you realized that Rei would not stop, there would be no line she would not cross and you and Mary would be tortured by her forever. All because of some dumb curiosity you had cooked up for yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at Rei's cruel face with tear soaked eyes, and you considered that she was all you would ever see again. You would never see friends or family, only this unholy abomination and her repulsive feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would never smell freshly cut grass, or your mother\u2019s cooking. There would only be Rei\u2019s burning odor in your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you again taste pie, or steak, or ice cream. Because the taste of Rei\u2019s sweat and toejam would forever fill your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour spirit finally broken to the sound of the ghost woman\u2019s incessant, mocking laugh, you begged. \u201cPlease, just stop!\u201d You screamed, your voice cracking through sobs and whimpers. \u201cJust let me go! I want to go home!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei stared back at you with the creepiest look of self-satisfaction you had ever seen as she slowly began pushing her big toe down into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! NO! Please stop!\u201d You begged, but your only response was a smug giggle and a soul crushingly nasty gagging as Rei\u2019s big toe slid over your taste buds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked at the full taste of her toe as her sweat burned in your mouth, the sour taste contorting your face as you cried for help that you knew was not coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh\u2026 Shh\u2026 Shhhh\u2026\u201d Rei mocked as she pressed the bottom of her toe against your tongue before wriggling it all over your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Every time you would recoil your tongue Rei would reach further down your throat to wrap it around her toe again. All the while she fingered herself, staring you in the eyes, fueled by your fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could swear that this should have killed you. It was like acid in your mouth, but it would not actually damage you, it would only make you suffer the burning sensation and the disgust, knowing that it came from the ghost\u2019s feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei pulled her toe from your mouth and reveled in your continued cries as you pleaded with her to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, just let me go!\u201d You screamed, your voice hoarse as you still choked on her vile sweat and toejam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I would. But your mouth gives me such a good foot cleaning,\u201d Rei moaned, shuddering as she remained on the cusp of orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her toes again, you were once more gagged by her foot, as all five of her grungy toes brutally dominated your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed and sobbed incomprehensibly as your body began convulsing and sputtering from the unfathomable nastiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei spread and wriggled her toes in your mouth as her chest rose and fell in climax. And as she reveled in your horror, her moans turned to ghostly laughter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tears streamed down Mary\u2019s red and tortured face as she sat bound, naked and humiliated in a dark, oppressive room, choking on the burning, sour taste of the ghost\u2019s sweat soaked sock. Each second, she shuddered as the seemingly endless stream of Rei\u2019s sweat and grime trickled down her throat, unable to even spit the vileness out, as the gag ensured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while her nose was scorched by the rancid stench of the ghost\u2019s foul, and well worn shoe that had been bound to her head. Every time Mary looked down into it, she saw the large, black imprint of her tormentress\u2019 foot, and every time she nearly felt she was going to hurl from the nastiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by far the most potent torment that the malevolent spirit had inflicted upon Mary was being ever projected in front of her by the only light source in the room. An old television set flickered lightly before her, continuously broadcasting your torture at Rei\u2019s disgusting feet for Mary to watch. And all in real time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time Mary heard you sob beneath the ghost\u2019s feet she grunted in rage and struggled against her binds.  And each time she wracked her brain a bit harder for a way out, although she remained skeptical if she would even find where you were being kept in this labyrinth of a house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she knew she had a moral obligation not to leave you to this barbaric torture. She should have talked you out of this foolish endeavor, on the fucking spot. It was one thing for you to be unaware of the horrors that a monster could inflict, but Mary had first hand experience. And worse, was that she knew exactly why she had been so eager to march with you into the jaws of this hell. It had been only for her rage, and her desire to inflict some petty vengeance on the monstrous populace. And to her shame, Mary realized she was not entirely oblivious to this fact as she agreed to assist you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Mary retched at the taste of sweat soaked sock wedged into her maw, she continued to work at her binds, contorting herself to try and pull herself free. Using a trick she had learned years ago, she began twisting her wrists around to expand the binds as she had since Rei had left her alone, and then she relaxed them before pulling free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with the binds off of her, and her hands free to move as the pleased, Mary wasted no time in frantically pulling the reeking shoe off of her face. And then coughing the rancid sock out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing and gagging freely as the ghost\u2019s repulsive footwear slapped onto the floor, Mary shuddered slightly at the sight of it, spitting incessantly in a desperate attempt to get the taste out of her mouth. But it did not take Mary long to realize that the taste was not leaving anytime soon, although not for her lack of trying to be rid of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her mouth, Mary struggled slightly not to make too much noise for risk of the unclean specter hearing and coming to investigate. Even though she somewhat doubted the ghost would leave you unless she felt it was urgent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly rubbing her wrists, the skin raw as she winced slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndoing the ropes around her ankles, Mary stood and began moving around the room, feeling about with her hands to find where the vile spirit had hidden her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Rei had made a large show of stomping the camera you and Mary planned to use into bits, but Mary had more than one trick up her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral moments of wandering about the room later, the only sounds to accompany her being your tortured sobs from the television set and her own unsteady breathing, Mary's hand fell onto the familiar feeling of her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the zipper, she reached inside to grab her cell phone, which the phantom seemed to have left untouched, likely due to her ignorance over what it was, and what the device was capable of. She guessed that Rei hadn't likely left these halls for centuries, so it was no surprise that the significance of modern technology was lost on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning it on, it provided her with at least enough light to make out what was in front of her. And while it would not be as effective as the old camera, since the image it would take would lack the physical solidity, it would bind the ghost to the material realm at least for a very short while. Which should have been enough time to whack her over the head to daze her and then bind her to something. Even literally if that was what she had to resort to. It was a crude method that could easily go wrong if Rei proved to be the stubborn type. But Mary had her ways to draw submission from unruly monsters. And just to add insult to injury, Mary had chosen to pull out her own shoelace to be used as the binding agent for her spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on her clothes, Mary began searching for the exit. It didn't take her long to find it, but the door was, predictably, locked. Mary sighed, having hoped that Rei really was so arrogant as to leave the door wide open. But she seemed to be quite a bit smarter than Mary would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a hairpin from her head she began working to pick the lock. It took her several minutes but eventually to door creaked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly making her way out into the maze of dark, narrow corridors, armed with only her phone, shoelace, and her wits. Mary was quite deliberate with each step she took, careful not to make any sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally emerging into back into the lobby where you and she first entered, the first thing she noted was the lack of any doors or windows now. It was like a prison, or a tomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary turned as a faint sound like a cry for help echoed through the house. Frantically trying to locate the sound, Mary choose the corridor it seemed the be coming from and began marching down it.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't make out what was inside because of the planks that boarded up the place, though you didn't care about it so you made your way to the door.  Once you opened it, it creaked loudly: \"Oh my, this got interesting, hope no \"monster girl\" heard it\".  Before going inside you remembered that in some old folk stories, the doors shut for no reason and that you were locked inside in places like this, so you looked around for a big rock and put in between the doorway just case anything happens.  As you walked in you also remembered that Ghosts feed off fear or something along those lines so you took a deep breath and put your chin up high and prepared for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mansion was very dark: \"I should have brought a lighter or a small flashlight to see where I am going, I don't want to use up my pow-\"  The lights turned on.  \"er-Okay, the kid was right, there is a monster girl somewhere here, time for a brave face!\"  You prepared your dagger as well as the sacred objects, you walk inside the Mansion.  The place looked well maintained for no humans living here, there is two hallways on the bottom floor and one large staircase leading up to left and right stairs.  From telling from the outside before stepping in, you believe it has three floors.  Though as you walk in, it begs the question, why hasn't this place not been checked upon by the village?  As you took another step the door behind you made a big bang.  Bang \"WHAT?\" you looked shocked and confused, you ran to the door to try and open it but it was shut tight, you tried using your dragger but it made no effect on the door and so did the sacred objects.  \"Darn monster magic.  How raw.\"  As you made your comment a female laughter was heard in the mansion, you had only one opinion, take control of the ghost to get out or die in this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two rooms on the left and right side in the bottom floor and an upstairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way should I go?</span></div></div>",

She was covered in dark brown fur from head to toe, with some lighter brown patches across her body. Two perky rabbit hears stood out from her long, brown hair. Instead of a humanoid nose, she possessed a bright pink bunny nose with whiskers poking from them. Her large, perky breasts and childbearing hips made you feel\u2026 inadequate, to say the least. Lastly, she had very large, paw-like feet, leading to her innate jumping and kicking abilities. If you had to guess, they were about twice the size of your pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny girl merely stood still as you sized her up, but she noticed you pause at her feet. Just as she expected. She smirked before she spoke to you in a flirtatious voice. \u201cC\u2019mon, you really think you can fight me with that dinky little thing? You and I both know I can just kick that out of your hands and down you in seconds.\u201d You grimaced.

You were a tad more clever than she gave you credit for. Before she was able to connect a kick to your hand, you spun slightly so your shield caught the blow. Just as you were ready to counter, a second kick hit your shield! The bunny girl sent kick after kick into your shield with no signs of slowing! It dawned on you that this was her plan all along: if she kept up the offensive, you could never get a blow in. You couldn't even take steps to retreat without risking your stance breaking. She had you trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few dozen punishing kicks, your wooden shield couldn't take the pressure any longer. It shattered into pieces, leaving you wide open! With your stance staggered and with no shield, you were left wide open. The bunny girl gave you one final kick into your chest, this one much more forceful than the others. You were sent flying through the air, and to make matters worse, you dropped your sword during the tumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to recompose yourself and hope to retreat, but the bunny girl was already over you.

Anywhere between four and forty bunny girls can inhabit a single warren, and they tend to share everything they have...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get up off the dirt floor, but you found that your hands and legs were tied together. Not only that, but your clothing has been confiscated as well! You try to move your hands to cover your shame, but it works as well as you'd expect. Naked, bound, and humiliated, you were left with very little options. You decided to do the only thing you really could do: you began to crawl. It was agonizingly slow, but every inch gained was an inch closer to freedom. The doorway (sans door, of course) was just a yard away. Past it were a series of tunnels, and past those, the rest of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so deep in thought about your daring escape that you didn't notice the furred foot in front of you until you bumped into it. You looked up, only to make eye contact with the very same bunny girl that defeated you. She was accompanied by a slightly taller bunny girl. This one had white fur in contrast to the shorter girl's dark brown. Additionally, her ears flopped down the side of her head instead of standing erect like the brown one's. \"I told you, Jenny, I got a real live human! She even crawled right to her goddess's feet!\" bragged the brown bunny girl to the white one. \"Huh, I thought you were exaggerating, but you really got one of the pinkies!\" The taller white bunny girl, Jenny, put a hand on the brown rabbit girl's head and ruffled her hair, much to her displeasure. \"Our little Daisy is all grown up now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, I'm a GODDESS now!\" whined Daisy. \"Don't disparage me in front of my own subjects!\" \"Alright, alright. anything that makes you feel better. What does she do anyways, beside writhe around in the dirt?\" Daisy looked at Jenny like she just asked a completely nonsensical question. \"She licks feet, duh!\" Daisy turned her attention to you. \"Slave girl, kiss my toes!\" You remained perfectly still, determined to keep what little dignity you had left. Daisy turned back to her bunny colleague. \"Hehe, I'm still working on it.\" She turned back to you. \"You DARE disobey me?\" Daisy gave you a punishing kick to your ribs. Two of them easily cracked with the bunny girl's sheer force. You screamed out in pain, leaving Daisy ample opportunity to shove her toes into your mouth. The toes muffled your screeching, and Daisy's cheerful giggling drowned out any sounds you could possibly make. \"See, look? She's happily sucking on my toes right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sucking\" was hardly the right word. It was more like drooling. You felt like you could vomit from the pain, but nothing was going to come up. Each and every breath struggled to get from your nose to your lungs. Despite laying perfectly still, your world was spinning. The pain from the kick was worse than any pain you've ever suffered in your entire life. Your body couldn't take it anymore. Your eyes closed and you let the relatively blissful peace of unconsciousness take you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sighed. \"I'll go get the bandages...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke (again)...</span></div></div>",

It was a larger room with several piles of leaves, one of which you were laid upon. You figured that this is where the bunny girls sleep. You took a quick examination of yourself. You were still nude, but your bonds were gone, and your abdomen was wrapped up in bandages. Your ribs stung, but hardly hurt as much as they did when they were first broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see the white rabbit girl standing above you. \"Feeling better, pet?\" she asked you, teasingly. You tried to get up and give her a piece of your mind, but your ribs disagreed with you, and sent searing pain through your chest at the slightest movement. \"Now, now. It'll take awhile for those to heal, but don't worry, you'll be able to serve us in no time! Now, as for payment for fixing you up...\" Jenny puts her toes on your lips. Her white soles were stained brown with dirt, as expected for someone who lives in a very literally dirty home. \"C'mon, give them a kiss, or I'll break you even worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. You couldn't fight anymore. Your breaths were still labored, anymore damage could possibly cause permanent damage, or even kill you. You pursed your lips and kissed Jenny's toes with a <i>mwah</i> sound. Jenny smiled at you. \"Good, very good! This one has some hope for her yet! Now, stick out your tongue.\" You hesitate, but inevitably obey. Jenny takes your tongue between each of her white toes, flossing the dirt and toejam from inbetween each one. You wanted to cry from the foul taste, but you couldn't. Jenny stuffed her disgusting heel into your mouth, which caused you to gag. Jenny took great delight in torturing you with her dirty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, someone else entered the room. It was...</span></div></div>",

Maybe you could handle a goblin or an imp, but the bunny girl's strong feet would send you flying before you knew it. There's a time to fight, and there's a time to swallow your pride and live another day. You shudder, then fall to your hands and knees to the bunny girl's feet. You look up at her with fire in your eyes, and she returns the glare with a smug smirk of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good! Now, say ahhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth, and its immediately violated by five dirty bunny toes. You gag involuntarily as the bunny girl wiggles her toes inside of your mouth. Their taste is salty, but for some reason, you don't entirely mind it. No, the worst part is the humiliation you're facing. Less than an hour into your quest and you've already thrown yourself to the feet of your enemy? The Goddess would surely be ashamed of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny girl jostles her foot. \"C'mon, I don't feel any licking. I want my feet cleaned!\" You hesitantly run your tongue across the bunny girl's toes, removing the dirt from them. Your tongue finds its way to the crevices between the bunny's toes, where your tongue makes quick work of separating the dirt from the brown fur. The bunny girl removes her toes from your mouth and presents her sole. The brown sole is even browner due to the addition of dirt. It hangs inches away from your face, just barely out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I want you to beg for the privilege to lick my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe this! This bunny bitch was making you lick her feet, and she had the gall to make you beg for her? \"Never, you disgusting creature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny girl dropped her heel onto the back of your neck, slamming your head into the ground. You yelped from the pain. \"Oh, really? It's either that, or I stomp your pathetic body into the dirt. Now, I'll let you back up when I hear some begging~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth and began to beg. \"Puh... P-please let me lick your feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just because you asked! Not everyone gets to suck on my perfect paws, it's honestly the highest honor for a dirty human~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny girl lifted her heel from your head and presented her sole to you again, this time in reach of you. You stuck out your tongue and began lapping at the sole. The darker brown of her sole gave out to lighter brown as the dirt cleared away. The entire process was repeated for the second foot: the toe sucking, the disparaging begging, the sole licking, the horrible, callous laughter of the bunny... the worst part? Even after you were done, you still had the dirty, musky taste of feet in your mouth, as if it was an invisible scar to remind you of the deeds you just performed... or, it'll probably come out with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, you rise to your feet, albeit a little shaken from your experience. You steady yourself and face the bunny girl who looks at you with smug satisfaction. \"Wow, I haven't had a human lick my feet that well in ages. You really have a carrer ahead of you in foot-licking!\" Your anger began to boil over as you shouted at the bunny. \"Remove yourself from the path, you beast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the bunny girl respond?</span></div></div>",

Before disappearing from your view, she looked over her shoulder at you with a smirk and said \"If you ever come to your senses and realize you need these sweet feet, you know where to find me~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gripped the hilt of your sword and seethed silently. You continued walking down the path while constantly watching your back for monsters. You were wary before the encounter with the bunny girl, but now you were downright paranoid. Every rustle of a tree branch caused by a stray bird sent shivers up your spine. You knuckles turned white with their forceful grip on your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk was fast approaching, and the light filtering through the trees shone less and less. Thankfully, Galdaran was naught but a stone's throw away. You approached the towering city gates with wonder. You've certainly never seen anything like this back at home. Before you could pass through, a guard... splashed you with water? Great, now you were tired AND wet. \"Hey, what was that for?\" you shout at him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, ma'am, but we've received reports of succubi disguising themselves as human to pass through and spirit men away from their homes. Considering your skin didn't melt off your bones after being exposed to holy water, you must be human. You may pass, and enjoy your stay in Galdaran.\" You grumbled in response as you passed through the gates. You were hardly in the mood for pleasantries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at this time of day, Galdaran was bustling. Couples were walking the cobblestone streets, merchants on carpets were hocking their exotic goods, and patrons were passing in and out of brightly-lit taverns. Speaking of which, you sure were thirsty. Besides, you needed something to wash the taste of feet out of your mouth. You walked into the first one you saw. Strangely enough, it was called \"The Needy Harlot\". Seedy, yes, but any port in a storm. Despite the name, the atmosphere was surprisingly nice, rather than the den of debauchery you were expecting. The red-haired busty barmaid greeted you as you took a seat at the bar. \"Welcome to the Needy Harlot, what can I get for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A flagon of ale and a room for the night, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaallright, that'll be five gold pieces!\" You slide her the gold pieces, and she slides you a room key in return. She made small talk with you as she poured your ale. \"So, where're you from, stranger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A small hamlet to the west.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did you get an itch to see how us cityfolk live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm here as part of a journey to slay the monster queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barmaid looked at you funny. \"You? No offense hon, but you're a tad wiry. Some of the bigger monsters would crush you into submission!\" You glared at the barmaid in return. \"The monster girls have taken everything from me, and I'm ready to die if it means I can drag a few monster girls to hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, hon,\" uttered the barmaid as she sat down the flagon of ale in front of you. \"Just remember, there's worse things than death out there. Watch yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would've asked her what she meant by that if you weren't so thirsty. You downed the flagon quickly and retreated to your room. There wasn't much to it: A bed that can comfortably fit two, a chest with a latch to fit your belongings in, and a sole window that looked out onto the city. You tossed your sword and shield into the chest and crawled into bed. The day's events left you exhausted, and you were ready to sleep. Tomorrow, you'll have your bearings regained, and hopefully you can recruit some adventurers to aid you in your cause.</span></div></div>",

With that in mind, you followed the signs in the city leading to a blacksmith's workshop. It didn't take you too long to find it, along with a pretty fancy sign outside saying \"<i>Burning Scales Blacksmith! Best steel in whole Galdaran!</i>\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went inside through the front door, and your eyes opened wide as soon as you noticed the figure sitting at the desk... it was a monster girl! She had tan skin with visible brown scales on some of her body(Especially her arms) clad into light metal armor stylized to look like part of her scales, it also left very little to the imagination, she had a long red hair tied in a ponytail. For a moment you thought that she could be a dragon... one of the strongest types of monster girls, what would she be doing in middle of a city like that? Did she took over the blacksmith and held the owner hostage or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster girl didn't seem to have noticed you enter, she was sitting rather casually with her bare feet propped up on the desk, reading some kind of book related to blacksmithing techniques. Her feet similar to human's yet with distinct sharp claws instead of normal nails, as well as some visible scales on their tops. The soles glistened slightly from sweat, but she seemed unbothered about showing them off like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever just as you moved, hesitating whether or not to leave the building, the red haired seemed to have heard your steps and put down her book, looking straight at you.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my workshop! Wanna buy something?\" The monster girl said, flashing a grin towards you while still keeping her feet on the desk, she didn't seem hostile though<br>\r\n\"Your workshop? But you are...\" You started saying in surprise but the red haired monster girl interrupted<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I'm a salamander. I assume you must be new in town then?\" The monster girl rolled her eyes, she must have been getting surprised people like that a lot<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. I just never seen a monster girl peacefully coexisting with humans before.\" You replied honestly<br>\r\n\"Haha! If you told me that few years ago, I would totally agree! You see, it's kinda long story, but to put it shortly, old man who owned that workshop before saved my life, and pretty much raised me as his daughter, so once he was gone... I decided to take over his business.\" The monster girl said, only losing her grin for a moment when mentioning the old man being gone<br>\r\n\"And it's not like I am some kinda special case, there are a few other monster girls living here in town. It's not like all of us serve the Monster Queen you know?\" The salamander continued after a moment, still keeping her confident grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were certainly surprised to hear that, after the raid on your village you tended to see all monster girls as evil, you would never imagine that some of them would actually be allowed to live among humans.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you can call me Keira, the best blacksmith in Galdaran! So what is it that you came here for?\"The salamander finally introduced herself, and once again asked<br>\r\n\"Well... I was hoping to get myself some new armor, and perhaps decent sword and shield? The ones I have are a bit old and rusty...\" You said<br>\r\n\"Aye, I could see that. Full set like that is gonna cost quite a bit though... you sure you have enough coin for that?\" The salamander girl asked, clearly judging based on your clothes<br>\r\n\"How much is needed?\" You asked<br>\r\n\"A completely new light armor, a good blade and shield... I reckon it's gonna be about 500 gold pieces.\" Said the salamander after thinking for a moment<br>\r\nYour eyes open wide, obviously you didn't have that kind of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what could I get for about... 100 gold pieces?\" You ask a bit nervously upon checking your finances<br>\r\n\"A brand new frying pan maybe?\" The salamander girl said a bit jokingly<br>\r\n\"Dammit... I guess I will be leaving then.\" You say in resigned tone, but just as you about to turn, you notice the salamander girl thinking about something for a moment, and turning towards you again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wait a sec! I... might have a special deal for you.\" Said Keira grinning confidently... but this time there seemed to be a hint of a blush on her face<br>\r\n\"Huh? Really?\" You ask as you approach the desk again<br>\r\n\"Aye! You will give me that 100 gold, and I will make you your brand new equipment... but in exchange you will worship my feet.\" The salamander girl's blush became more noticeable, but she didn't lose her confident grin as she pointed towards her bare feet with her scaly arm and wiggled her clawed toes teasingly<br>\r\n\"W-what?!\" You said at the sudden proposition<br>\r\n\"Come on, it's a once-in-a-lifetime offer! You pamper my feet, and get nice equipment for less than half the price! If you are into this kind of stuff, then it's a total win-win for us both...\" Keira said, her feet still propped up on the desk, flexing her toes, she seemed strangely excited about that idea... you knew that monster girls really enjoy all kinds of foot pampering, and living peacefully among humans Keira probably didn't have many occassions to get them worshipped... you definitely could use that equipment too, but is it worth humiliating yourself for it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You considered getting up but as you listened closer, the yelling sounded kind of....whiny...and only from one person. Within seconds, the door to the tavern slammed open. In it's way was a tall, sender figure hosting a furious face. This face quickly subsided as she walked into the tavern, with all eyes on her. In this den of beer and less than high society, she stuck out with a pink, almost regal gown and a cone hat you remember seeing in pictures of princesses. Around her pink arm was a rather large candy large, held closely and if it was a real cane. \"Good evening miss.\" The newcomer spoke in an upper crust tone, \"My name is Baroness Von Bon Bon, I require two things from you and I would like them chop chop. One, an understanding of where in Dice' s name I am and one glass of your most high vintage soda if you please.\" The woman at the counter blushed with indignation, obviously not taking kindly to the additude of this newcomer. \"Listen Miss Pink Skin, I don't know who think you are but I put up with quite a few weirdos here in Galdran. But I will not be talked down to by come candy colored, poorly dressed.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the server had any time to finish her sentance, Miss....Bon Bon swirled her candy cane about until she held it with both hands. It was then you saw the small hole in the bottom, which quickly shot out multicolored....somethings with surprising force. The bullets spread out as if having minds of thjer own, hitting the exit sign, a spitoon, and your empty mug. Swinging her stick back towards the server with feverish yellow eyes and a <b>very</b> disturbing grin, sat down at the bar. \"Must I make myself any clearer than that?\" The server silently disappeared under the counter, her hands giving a rolled up map and a bottle. This Baroness had calmed down, and you were certainly intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=baroness+von+bon+bon&amp;client=ms-android-hms-tmobile-us&amp;prmd=isvn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7hMWHmpTaAhVxja0KHesbC4YQ_AUIESgB#\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.google.com/search?q=baroness...</a></span></div></div>",

A combination of both the mug shattering in front of you and the shots pulled off by this Baroness created a mix of fear and admiration in you. And if she could do that to a human she wasn't even aiming for, your mind whirred at the thought of what it could do when aimed between the eyes of whatever monster came across your path! You knew that, at the very least, you had to try and talk to her. If nothing else, she might tell you where she found that impressive weapon. Taking a breath, you stood up and sauntered towards where the pink woman was sitting with the map in hand. \"Excuse me...miss?\" Von Bon Bon said nothing, more than likely she didn't hear you. Taking a chance, you reached out to tap her on the shoulder. All it took was one tap when it seemed her head decided to be an owl as it spun around to face you. \"Listen to me very carefully you guttersnipe, I am new in this land I admit but no one and I mean <b>no one</b> touches my dress without permission. I will forgive you just this once if you can tell me where here is...\" Bon Bon pointed to the center of a large cross on the map; The Queen's Castle. \"That miss...\" \"Either address me by my full name or Madame if you please.\" \"...Madame, that is the location of the home of the Monster Girl Queen. It's out farther west but...\" \"There's a good girl.\" Rolling up the map, Bon Bon pulled herelf from her seat, slapped a golden mint on the counter and headed for the door. You quickly followed after her, trying to keep her attention. \"Baroness Von Bon Bon, the land is treacherous and filled with horrible monsters. You can't possibly make it on your own.\" Bon Bon raised her candy cane back up, her head turning back to you. \"Are you implying that I cannot defend myself?\" \"Of course not...but...I was planning on going that way myself to slay the horrid queen. But what matter do you have with her?\" \"That is a private matter.\" Bon Bon put her stick back down, eyeing you about. \"Although you are right peasant. I suppose I could use a second wheel. I suppose you seem capable of being my temporary knight. Just remember who is in charge here and we can get along fine.\" Although this 'Baroness' mannerisms were already making you annoyed, you knew the old adage that beggers couldn't be choosers. And so you followed behind your new leader as she marched right out of Galdran.</span></div></div>",

All the while, Bon Bon kept up a simple pace with her candy cane back around her arm. No sounds besides the sounds of footwear against the dirt and normal birds chirping in the wind came about. Realizing you were safe for the moment, you cleared your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Baroness Von Bon Bon...where are you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink woman turned her head to you in an uninterested glance before rolling her eyes and silently turning back.

Ha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBon Bon's head spun back around, the unsettling grin from before back again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That redixulaous charlatan is the reason I have been dumped into this horrid land in the first place! I am going to see that brute suffer and/\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've seen the Monster Queen?\" Bob Bon stopped dead in her tracks, only giving you a second to react before you nearly brush against her dress. Turning her whole body around, she grabbed you by the cheeks with one hand and spoke in a voice like black licorice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall only say this once girl. A knight is not to speak out of turn with thier better. Certainly not a baroness like me, understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly the words you wanted to say were quite foul and deragatory along with dismissive of her behavior. But the cold and piercing glow of her yellow eyes could only make you nod your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl, to awsner your question; yes. I was in my castle, attempting to calmly celebrate the freeing of my soul from a rather unscrupulous sort when I was brought into a throne room far unlike my own. The very nerve of that freak, attempting to entice me into 'partnership' as she called it with my freedom and her horrid feet as bargining chips. Naturally I decided such crassness could only be awsnered by execution but I soon found myself at the mercy of this brutish slime which catapulted me around here. I am going to give that fake queen a piece of my mind and force her to take me home. I mean the cheek of that oohhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBon Bon continued rambling to herself, something about candied yams and cups or whatever.

Still mumbling to herself, the Baroness is unaware of her passing a particularly high patch of 'grass' Within seconds however, bith of you were instantly aware of a large mound of dirt blasting away as a figure obscured by the dirt came out. As you wiped the earth from your eyes, you had only a short time to examine the creature before you. She was a tall and rather slender sort, her grassy hair a dead giveaway to her orange body. Her big eyes stared right into your own as she tackled you. \"Hey there cutie, ya ever hear that my mind a good for your eyes?\" You say nothing to the carrot girl as you try to struggle in her grip. \"Hmm...no? Well than get ready cause after you taste my glorious feet, all you'll care to see is why you and your girlfriend over there belong to me.\" \"Girlfriend?!\" Your yell of confusion and anger proved to be unwise as your mouth was soon filled with with the filthy feet of the carrot. \"Go ahead girl, eat your vegtables, they are good for you after all.\" You could feel the girl trying to scrap her ankles against your teeth, tricking you into biting them off. Looking about, you spot Von Bon Bon a few feet away glancing not at you but at the dirt covering her dress. You roll your eyes as the carrot girl keeps trying to push her dirt covered feet farther into your mouth. You could already feel some flakes coming of them as your teeth betray your unwantingness to eat her horrid feet. \"Bon Bon!\" You mumble, trying to catch her attention.\"I could use a little help here!\" Bon Bon still said nothing, though her face had turned from horrified to clearly upset. \"Forget her and listen to me cute stuff, I just might introduce you to some of my other friends when I'm done with you both. Oh it would be like having a big ol' bowl of vegetable...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound pierced your ears, coming without warning and silencing your captor. The large carrot fell to the ground, wind whistling through it's three new holes. You pull the earthy feet out of your mouth, taking a second to notice the two inch gash she made with your teeth, another few seconds and you would have fallen for sure. \"Look at this...\" You turned to Bon Bon, wiping the dirt away from her clothes with limited results. \"My dress is ruined. This is all your fault! It's a good thing you aren't a knight because failure to protect your Baroness on such a level would get you imprisonment where I live. The whole reason I allowed you to follow me was to protect me from those things and a fine job you're doing so far.\" \"Now you hold on just a minute!\" Your temper up and smile turned down, you begin stomping towards the brat. \"First of all, I was the one who invited you on this quest of mine. You just took the reigns and started acting like you own me. Secondly, you were the one in front. \"Thirdly, I'm gonna take a small guess and say that back wherever you live, your just as bratty and selfish with everyone else who crosses your path. I mean I was almost brainwashed by a monster and all you can do is stand there and worry about your dress. In fact, I am almost willing to bet you just foisted the title of Baroness on yourself to fool others to think you're important!\" As you take a breath from your yelling, you notice Bon Bon' s face. It seemed almost...alien to everything else you've seen from her in the short time you've seen her. You couldn't tell if she was dumbfounded or upset but you could tell she was holding in something. \"You...rude....such intolerance of your superior shall not go unpunished...and I have the perfect punishment for one such as yourself....\"</span></div></div>",

Her small toes wiggle slightly, constantly scrunching up and retreating. \"Believe me, I do not like this, but it is the only way a rude, unloyal, peasant like you seems to punished in this land.\" \"You cannot help but take a whiff as her smooth foot shuffles across your face. You had expected a scent of some kind of candy, but instead the subtle aromas of lavender and cake attack your senses. Nevertheless, you continue struggling if only through reflexes of feet. All the while, you can hear the Baroness groan with disgust. \"Honestly, the things one must do to keep the servants in line. If Sally ever finds this out, I might never hear the end of it. Just knowing my feet are pressed against this girls face....NO this is her punishment. She certainly doesn't seem to like it...the way she struggles and weighs under my foot...what is it about feet in this world? Whatever? What time is it? A few minutes?...\" The pink appendage quickly lifts itself from your face, finding its way back into it's shoe. \"I hope you have learned your lesson girl, because the time will only increase if I have to do that again. Now let's get moving, the map says there is only one village on this journey and we're about to hit it.\" You nod, picking yourself up and shivering as you follow behind the woman...all the while realizing..</span></div></div>",

At first you thought it must be a decoration,,, but they seemed to move slightly from time to time, just like a part of the body would.<br>\r\nCould it be the imposing woman was a monster of some kind? But then why would she be allowed at the temple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you never seen a Valkyrie before?\" A voice suddenly spoke next to you, making you jump in surprise!<br>\r\n\"Hehe, sorry for scaring you, but I couldn't help but see you staring at the Valkyrie staying at our temple.\" The voice belonged to a cheerful looking young woman, dressed in strangely skimpy version of a typical priestess outfit, she had long pink colored hair.<br>\r\n\"Oh... um, well I never knew monster girls were allowed into the temples.\" You reply to the young priestess<br>\r\n\"Valkyries aren't considered monsters though, didn't you know? Most of the angels, while rare and sharing characteristics with monster girls, aren't considered a part of them. At least if they don't become corrupted through becoming addicted to human spirit energy, only then they become considered actual monster girls.\" Explained the young priestess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" You answer, the rarity of the angels definitely explain why you never heard of them during your training as a priestess, probably only temples in biggest cities like Galdran are lucky enough to have an actual angel in their temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is not the only angel at the temple either! I am actually a <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://mgewiki.com/w/Houri\"> houri </a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://mgewiki.com/w/Houri\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>, a servant of the goddess of love. You can call me Hana!\" Said the girl whom you assumed to be a priestess<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" You gasp in surprise, you never thought that the girl you talked to was an angel! She didn't even have visible wings.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, a lot of people doesn't notice that in my case. As a lower ranked servant of the goddess of love, my wings aren't visible most of the time.\"Said Hana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this temple ran entirely by you two?\" You asked, as you didn't see any other priestesses nearby<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, the human priestesses are just in the temple at the moment preparing it for the believers today, they don't let us angels work too much for them. By the way, why did you decide to visit the temple?\" The pink haired angel asked curiously<br>\r\n\"Well... to be honest I want to destroy the monster girl empire. But I wanted a blessing and advice from the temple first.\" You explained honestly, not wanting to lie or hide anything from an angel<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... Kasandra will surely be interested to hear that! The duty of Valkyries is to find and guide heroes that will save the world from the darkness, currently represented by the Monster Queen. She is a bit of a stick in the mud, and might try to test you at first, but will definitely help you!\" Said the houri girl and then seemed to think for a moment<br>\r\n\"Oh! And I can give you a blessing! Being blessed even by a low-ranking angel like me is much stronger than ones by most human priestesses!\" The pink haired angel added after a moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, you would just do that?\" You asked, a bit surprised how helpful the angel girl was<br>\r\n\"Yes, you seem like a pure soul, so I see no problem with that! There's only one detail you might not like...\"Said Hana<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"You asked<br>\r\n\"Well... since I am servant of goddess of love, I can only give blessing through intimate physical contact. Don't worry though! We wouldn't have to go all the way... the priestesses in here would probably disapprove too. But it should be enough if you could worship my feet?\" Said the angel girl, with a slightly uneasy smile<br>\r\nYour eyes open wide, it does make some sense... and certainly it's not as humiliating to worship a divine being's feet instead of random monster... but did you really want to do that? Perhaps it would be better to go straight to the valkyrie girl and ask for guidance in your quest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't dirty, I promise!\" Hana added and raised her foot covered only by a sandal to give you a better view... it seemed just like normal human's, although with certain divine aura to it... definitely  much nicer than the vile foot of that rabbit girl you met on your way there, but still... were you ready to slightly humiliate yourself again? Even if it was to gain a blessing and not technically forced?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your hesitation, Hana retracted her foot.<br>\r\n\"No pressure of course, I understand it might be a bit much to get a blessing.\" She said smiling kindly</span></div></div>",

She then stands still and arches the foot your under, squeezing your face right onto the ball of her foot. \"Sandal, lick.\" You start licking and can't help getting excited, are these Valkyrie some kind of monster girls after all?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra stands there for a minute while you are licking the ball of her foot. \"back to smelling now.\" You retract your tongue and raise your chin, trying to breathe in the smell of the sole of her feet as best as you can. She then picks up the pace once more, and walks for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours pass, you start to get used to the constant pressure on your body. However, Kasandra's feet are getting more and more sweaty. Your face is now drenched in the sweat of Kasandra's feet, even slightly filling your nostrils. It is becoming more and more difficult to breathe, but alas, you cannot move, no matter how hard you try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra then finally sits down on a rock, \"phew, time for a break\" she says, whiping the sweat from her forehead. She then crosses her legs, with you in the foot that is currently on the bottom. \"Go on, lick.\" As if waiting for the command, you cannot wait to taste Kasandra's beautiful soles again! Like a dog you start lapping at the ball of her foot. Kassandra then arches her foot and pressures her toes into the ground. Your head is now forced in between her index and her middle toe. \"Lick in between that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho needs to defeat a monster queen if you can do this all day?! You start to lick the cravice between her toes enthousiastically. You can taste her erotic sweat much more in here. With all your might you try to make love to the space in between her toes, licking up all her toejam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then forcefully moves her toes around, making sure you can get to lick in between each of her toes. After about half an hour of licking toejam she undoes the laces of her sandal. After a minute or so, her feet comes off of you and you take a few deep breaths. Kasandra looks at you, stuck in her sandal's sole. \"Enjoyed the ride? Looks like your body has really enjoyed it.\" Before you can reply, she picks you up by your head and puts you in her other sandal. \"Here is a fresh one human. Enjoy the ride.\" You try to move around but before you can do anything her new foot firmly presses you into the body-sized cravices of her sandal's sole. She then moves her feet a bit and the sweat from her sole gets dragged all over your body, especially your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kasandra is firmly tying up her laces, putting you into a new leathery cage of foot-sweat, you get aroused even more. Kasandra then starts walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother several hours pass before she comes to a standstill. Your face is drenched with her foot-sweat, your lungs and nostrils only contain air that has Kasandra's smell all over it. Your body is almost going numb from ecstacy when you suddenly hear Kasandra's voice along with the sound of approaching footsteps:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello mother!\"</span></div></div>",

Kasandra comes to a hold and sits down on a rock. \"Mother, I have a human with me that wants our blessing. I have come here to bring her to you.\" Kasandra then unties the laces of her sandal. Finally, her foot leaves your body and you are firmly stuck in the sole of her sandal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kassy, that looks good indeed, my daughter. Let me finish the ritual and give this human a blessing.\" Then you can see Kasandra's mother close in on you. She is taller and a bit more muscular than Kasanda, her skin is also less pale and just slightly tanned. To your surprise, her feet are even bigger than Kasandra's! She must have atleast size 12s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello human, my name is Metana, I am the chieftan of the local Valkyrie clan. I will give you your blessing if you complete my trial.\" She then takes off her knee-high sandals and once again you see a shape cut out in the sole, just about your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana picks you up by your head, \"you initiated the trial, so you will have to obey me. Make yourself comfortable human.\" Metana puts you in her own sandal and then one of her massive feet covers your body. Your head is right between her big toe and her index toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet are not as soft and smooth as Kasandra's, instead, they are much more mature, a bit more wrinkled, calloused and very sweaty. You can feel Metana tie up the laces of her sandal, firmly pressing your face into the space between her toes. The rest of your body is being kept in place by her foot. <br>\r\n\"We still have quite a long way ahead of us, human.\" Says Metana while she stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Kassy, thanks for deliviring the human to me.\" From a short distance you hear Kasandra, \"no problem mother. I will go back to the shrine now.\" You hear Kasandra's footsteps fade into the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana starts walking and it looks like the family has parted ways. Every step of the way you are being crushed by Metana beautifully arched soles. \"Human. I am not as sweet as Kasandra...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think to yourself, NOT as sweet? Kasandra was already quite demanding! Then Metana continues, \"you will hump my foot with your entire body, I want you to constantly massage my foot by grinding your body against my foot. In turn, that will get you very aroused and maybe make the trip less boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much of a choice you start grinding your body against Metana's foot. \"Yes human, just like that. Now start licking too, my toes are sweaty, I want you to lick those callus-spots on my toes. I've heard that human saliva can revitalize a Valkyrie's skin, so I want you to try that out for me. Get licking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to rapidly lick the calloused parts of her toes, sweaty and rough at the same time, you lick and suck these spots to the best of your ability. \"Oh yeh, and eat any dead skin you come across. Giving me a pedicure with your mouth is the least you can do, human.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start moaning from the arousal of your situation. The fact that you cannot move and have to obey this random Valkyrie woman, the smell of her feet, the touch of her soles against your body and the taste of her mature and sweaty soles turn you on so much! You spend hours licking and smelling Metana's feet. Every step of the way, the pressure of Metana's foot reminds you of her dominance over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of walking, humping and licking, Metana finally comes to a halt. You're numbed from your tasks and you just keep licking her sweaty skin like a braindead zombie at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here at Arngarde, human. You seemed to enjoy serving us Valkyrie, your body is steaming hot down there. So... What exactly do you want, our blessing or to serve us for eternity?\"</span></div></div>",

For example, you may still have your eyes or arms, sticking out of the table, as if you merged together with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then sits down and unties the laces of her sandal. \"However, there is a catch, once you change into an object, you'll need a monster girl with magical powers to turn you back to normal... So choose wisely.\" Her foot then comes off of your weak body, drenched in her delicious sweat. You struggle to stand and lay down for a second. \"Time to change you back... Or, actually...\" Metana gets an evil grin on her face, \"would you maybe want to test your melding powers right here, I could change you back afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure if you can trust Metana fully yet, but she has kept her end of giving you your blessing thus far...

You quickly wrap a rag around you and then Metana looks at you, \"so we need an object for you to meld with...\" Metana looks around the room and then takes off her other sandal. You can see her wiggle her long toes and slightly bend her long arched sole, atleast size 12. You can see the sweat dripping from the sole, which makes sense because that is the sole you haven't tended to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then points to the sweaty sandal she just took off, \"go on, meld with that. Put your hands on it and then say \"I will fuse with this object in the name of the Valkyrie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Metana with a bit of a frown, you are somewhat hesitant. However, you have to face off against the queen, you need to understand the ins and outs of your powers!

However, you seem to have lost control over the rest of your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize, it feels as if your whole body is trapped within the sandal, except for your nose and mouth. Your nose and mouth have fused with the sole of her sandal. Your nose is right at the toe section and your mouth is right below that, both able to breathe and function normally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear Metana laugh, \"haha! That is exactly what I was hoping for!\" Metana then places her foot on 'you'. Her foot covers the sole of her sandal, with the ball of her foot covering your mouth while your nose is right in between her toes. Despite enjoying the situation, you ask Metana, \"wait uhm, Metana? Could you please change me back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Metana then laughs, change you back? Haha! Ofcourse not! This was my plan all along. You better be really obedient or I will stomp your mouth and nose flat, besides, you kind of need me to change you back, so you better behave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it all dawns to you, looks like you are now stuck inside Metana's sandal, only able to use your nose and mouth while her feet pressure you...</span></div></div>",

As you may have noticed, my feet get really sweaty. Maybe I will have a use for your mouth later on.\" Metana then starts to walk. Metana's feet are covering you so well that apparently nobody can see that your nose and mouth are below her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then walks through the village. Every step of the way, you breathe in her toejam directly, this is made worse by how much Metana is wiggling her toes, releasing its erotic smell constantly. She then walks out of town and seems to wait for a short while. Then you hear a familiar voice, \"hello mother!\"... Uh-oh, it is Kasandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then beckons Kasandra to come with her, they sit on a rock and then Metana whispers, \"I made that human meld with my sandal. Want to try it out?\" Kasandra then looks at her mother's feet. \"Oh, yes mother! I can't wait to degrade some humans again! Luckily we have the same size!\" Then you feel Metana untying the laces of her sandals and she switches sandals with Kasandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, Kasandra's tall, arched feet place on 'you'. Her toes cover up your nose and the ball of her foot presses firmly onto you mouth.

You then hear her, \"start licking. Now.\" You know, you don't have much of a choice and you start to lick the ball of Kasandra's foot, practically making love to it. Kasandra keeps playfully wiggling her toes around your nose, making sure you get the most out of smelling her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a long journey ahead of us, sandal. But I am sure you love my feet anyways, don't you?\" You then answer in-between your licking duties, \"yes miss Kasandra!\" Kasandra then picks up the pace, \"good, now I don't want to ever hear you talk unless I ask you something. Back to licking for you now, make my feet feel good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep licking... and licking... and licking... Meanwhile, you are smelling the sweat of Kasandra's toes with every breath you take. Her feet are atleast a little smoother than her mother's, but nonetheless just as sweaty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel so powerless, you cannot move any muscle in your body nor can you see. Somehow, you can still hear, but most of your attention goes to the taste and smell of Kasandra's feet and the pressure she puts on your body. It seems as if your nervous system has fused with the sandal, making you feel under pressure at every step of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra then sits down against a tree and stretches her legs, while resting she starts playing with your nose. Her toes shut your nose every few seconds and then release it again, making you breathe the smell from in between her toes more intensely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra then talks to herself: \"Hmmm... What to do with you? Should I keep you, or bring you back to my mother?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Smelling my feet all day and getting to lick my sandals. Maybe I'll let you lick my feet another time.\" She then turns around the sandal on your face, so that you are facing the upper part of her other sandal's sole again. \"This is what you will be licking and smelling tonight, is that clear?\" Kasandra then closes the tent, puts out the campfire and goes to sleep. You lay there, with her sandal covering your mouth and nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night seems to take ages, but you are atleast blessed to be smelling Kasandra's sweat all night long.

Guess I have you for that.\" Kasandra then sits on a tree stump and places you on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda wanted a bath but, I guess you will have to clean the sweat and dirt from my feet now. Tongue out, now.\" You extend your tongue, Kasandra then whipes her bare soles over your tongue, with very slow drags, all the way from her heels to her toes. \"I walked through the forest for a bit, they must be covered in dirt and sweat, but I guess you don't mind that.\" Indeed you don't!

Good luck!\" Kasandra then unties the laces of her sandals and offers you to the trolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds the cheiftan of the troll-women claims you as her prize. The blue-skinned, two-toed amazon of a woman places you on the floor. She is an athletic woman with a muscular build. She then places one of her feet on you. Instantly it hits you; why Kasandra said that Trolls have the smelliest feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer two toes fit perfectly around your nose, forcing your nose exactly between her two big toes. You instantly start to smell her toejam, which is insanely sweaty. Meanwhile, her soles seem very sweaty, rugged and calloused. Nevertheless, the heavy touch of her feet and the pressure of her strong body arouses you. Let alone that the smell between her two toes is the sweatiest you have ever smelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start taking bigger whiffs of your new owner's toes, to her pleasure. \"Oh, you seem an eager soul huh? Guess you like my feet already. Good. We trolls sweat A LOT, so much even that all our sandals get slippery and we tend to walk barefoot instead. However, you may solve that issue for me, aye?\" The troll-captain puts a bit more pressure on you, \"Get licking, aye!\" You extend your tongue and start to lick the sole of the Troll-lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, her soles are drenched with sweat, her rugged and calloused feet almost seem soft because of the layer of sweat that is on it. You do your best to lick and suck all the sweat from as far as you can reach with your tongue. Meanwhile, you take heavy breaths through your nose. She then stomps you on the ground: \"Sandal! Breathe harder and faster, it cools my toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObeying your new owner, you start to smell through your nose faster and more intensily. The whole situation is extremely arousing, a new owner who straight up dominates you, having you tonguebath and smell her feet like no tomorrow. You do your best to keep your owner happy, meanwhile, she ties the laces of the sandals around her feet, very tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts walking for miles, apparently with her gang. They seem to not sit still and prefer hunting over asking for tolls from strangers. After a few hours you are still at it, still licking the soles of your new owner and smelling the space between her toes. She even presses her toes kind of firmly onto you nose, making you breathe even harder and deeper. \"My toes too hot.\" She then bends one of her toes and it ends up directly in your mouth, she plunges it in and out of your mouth, forcing you to suck all the sweat and dirt off of it. When it leaves your mouth, the other one enters. You lick all around the sweaty and calloused toes that enter your mouth, trying to lick every inch clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll-lady then places her toes back in place, firmly around your nose. \"Keep breathing through that nose, come on!\" You quickly pick up the pace again and start breathing in quicky. Her toejam seems to be intact, a smell that has been turning you on for hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another while of licking her sole and smelling the cravice between her toes, she then finally comes to a halt. \"You know, you Lucky. We orcs have similar feet. So, I will now swap.\" Without further a-do, she takes both her sandals off and then you realize what she meant. She can wear you on her other foot too! She switches the sandal and you shocked by how extremely sweaty her other foot is. Sweat is even entering your nose, simply from inhaling. She then has one of her toes enter your mouth again while she is walking, casually having you suck on her toe whenever she wants it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another while of licking and smelling it finally seems to be night and the trolls set up camp. The trolls then all gather together around a campfire and the chieftain puts you on the floor. \"It is dinner time for you, sandal. Keep your tongue out, you're going to clean all of us.\" Within a moment's notice, the first troll lady already stands up and starts whiping her soles on your tongue and making you suck her two big toes. As expected, her soles are very dirty, very calloused and very very very sweaty. It seems apparent that all the other trolls walk barefoot... Which means that you are going to lick a lot of sweat and dirt now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis procedure took hours, atleast 8 different pair of feet have abused your tongue and nose at this point. You swallowed and licked so much dirt and sweat, this was indeed enough as dinner. You are still working on cleaning the inside of your mouth. Then the chieftain comes and picks you up, \"time to sleep.\" She puts you on the feet of a random troll lady, who then giggles and puts her big toe in your mouth, even bigger than chieftain's! She then presses her other foot firmly against your nose, specifically he space between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it smells different than the chieftain, it just as sweaty and there is just as much toejam. Every breath you are reminded of your new position... After a while your mind finally dozes off, night has fallen.</span></div></div>",

Your nose firmly pressed between her two big toes and your tongue licking the rugged ball of her foot the entire day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep my feet cool.\" Is the command you hear the most, breathing as heavily as you can through your nose, trying to cool off her toes a little bit. This means that every second you spend as her personal insole that you smell her toes optimally, especially between them. Though, the smell of her intensely sweaty feet never gets old. Every day you look forward to smelling your owner's sweaty toejam again with your nose pressed right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow and then you are to suck on her toes to cool them off a bit more. However, her toes are rather big; making it seem like she's making you give blowjobs to her toes on a daily basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of every day, all the troll-women get to use you, cleaning their dirty feet on your tongue, with the grime from under their feet serving as your dinner. You spend most of your time licking in between their toes and licking slightly under their toenails. However, you enjoy being a public foot-cleaner for this clan of troll-women, they give you purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the night, the chieftain binds you to a random troll girl's feet, which you have to service for the entire night, until the next day when the cycle continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is now your daily routine, as a personal insole to a troll-lady, who loves using you to cool off her feet and humiliating you in front of the other troll-women. Who would've thought that Metana's trick to make you meld with her sandal would have you end up here, a personal bitch of a troll-lady, licking and smelling troll feet all day and all night. Oh well, looks like this is it for you... A life as a troll-lady's insole, well done!</span></div></div>",

I walked here barefoot so I could use a tongue right now.\" Uh-oh, you start to think that maybe you were better off with Kasandra! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra then heads back into the village after putting her own sandals back on. Metana then sits down on a rock. \"Tongue out.\" You extend your tongue and Metana starts dragging her dirty, long, arched and mature souls across your tongue with a very slow motion. Your tongue is dragging across her soles from hel heel all the way to the tip of her toes. You try to make your tongue as broad as possible to get as much dirt and sweat from her feet on your tongue. \"Swallow.\" Metana commands with a cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly retract your tongue and start swallowing everything you got onto your tongue and lips and then you extend it again. Metana quickly starts to drag her other foot across your tongue too, and then then puts her toes on your mouth. \"Between the toes too.\" You stretch your tongue between each of her long toes and gather all the toejam you can find. Gosh! Metana's calloused, mature and arched soles turn you on so much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, time to meet my sisters...\" Metana then puts you on her foot and starts walking. It doesn't take long and she enters a hut, you hear two unfamiliar voices. \"Freja and Dyra, meet my new companion; sandal.\" Metana walks into the room, sits on a chair and takes you off her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sound and heat of the atmosphere you conclude that you are in a small nordic hut, not much bigger than an avarage living room. In the middle there is a table with three chairs, where the sisters usually chat with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then puts you on the ground near the table, \"look, it has a mouth and a nose. Basically, we can feed it anything we want and make it worship our feet whenever we want. So, I was thinking, let's feed it some of our nails and dead skin, I am sure the sandal will appreciate that!\" You shudder at the thought, are you going to be a bin for the dead skins and nails of Metana and her sisters?! The women then all use various tools to scratch off dead skin and clip their nails, the women chat with one another and you remain waiting under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana bends down and holds a bowl. \"This is all of our dead skin and nails.\" Metana picks you up and puts you on the table, she then grabs a small spoon and scoops some of her and her sister's feet waste onto the spoon. \"Open.\" You open your mouth wide and Metana empties the spoon in your mouth, making you chew and taste sweaty dead skin and dirty nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreja then looks closer, \"woah Metana, you really made that thing into your bitch. But isn't it dry eating it like that?\" Metana then spits into the bowl a few times. \"Not anymore.\" Before you got down the last bite, Metana already has the next spoon ready, covered with saliva, \"Open.\" You open up again and now taste Metana's spit alongside the dead skin and nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoon after spoon you obey, eat and swallow. You have no idea how long it takes or how many more spoons she can fill. You simply obey and swallow whatever your owner feels like feeding you. Metana definitely knows how to make you feel subservient to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then places you under the table, \"you can now lick off the excess dead skin from our feet. Tongue out.\" You stick your tongue out and feel an unfamiliar sole against your tongue. \"Ohh feels nice, I always get so sweaty from hunting...\" Freja says, her soles are thinner and longer than Metana's but also much sweatier, she must have size 13s or something! You do your best to lap at the sole of her feet, trying to get as much sweat and calloused skin on your tongue. Her exceptionally long toes drag across your tongue and sometimes enter your mouth, forcing you to suck her toes with utmost care, massaging each of her toes with your tongue. After a few more minutes she seems satisfied, you then feel the next pair approach your nose; Dyra's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I walked barefoot all day, I hope you don't mind.\" You are glad she gave you a warning as dirt and grime are spread onto your tongue while you do your best to clean her soles. Her feet seems about the same size as Metana's, but her toes are a little longer and her feet are much more calloused, which is no surprise given that she wears no sandals at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a bit longer to clean Dyra's feet, but eventually you manage, your tongue covered in dirt. It takes you a minute to swallow everything you licked up. Then, Metana's familiar feet are pressed onto your tongue, like a loyal dog you start lapping at her sole again. For about an hour, the three women have you service their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, the women are going to eat, you feel Dyra's hand pick you up and she wears you under her foot, still somewhat dirty. \"If you keep licking you can maybe properly clean my foot this time.\" Like a slave, you instantly obey her command and start licking her sole, hoping to please her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the women sit down and eat. Later that evening, they return. Dyra then takes you off and you are placed on the floor, in a pile of used sandals. Freja then picks you up and brings one of her sandals to your tongue, \"clean it.\" you start licking and swallowing whatever comes onto your tongue, Freja's sandals seem quite dirty and they probably haven't been cleaned for a while. She then puts you on the floor and binds one of her sandals to you, firmly pressing the insole against your nose and mouth. \"Enjoy that for the night.\" Not much later everything goes silent, you are left on the floor, smelling and licking Freja's sweaty insole, the imprints of her arches and toes clearly marked into the sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the next morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You get instantly aroused again by the smell of Metana's toes, wiggling at your nose to tease you. Meanwhile you are putting most effort into pleasing her sole by licking the calloused ball of her foot every step of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this is your new life sandal, aren't you glad that you made me test your powers? You can now be my insole for the rest of your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's how it is. Every day, Metana starts walking with you, to the shrine where you met Kasandra, sometimes running errands to different places. You spend most of the day as Metana's insole, licking and smelling her mature and incredibly sexy feet, which you love to do. Every two hours, Metana stops for a bit, unties the sandals slightly and places each of her toes into your mouth, one by one, making you lick and suck the sweat from her toes and in between them. She usually gives a cold reaction: \"Okay, now back to sniffing and licking the balls.\" As she then puts you firmly under her sole again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery afternoon, you are to service Metana and her sisters. It ususally starts with eating some toenails or dead skin. Then, Freja has you lick off the sweat from her long feet and her long toes, making you suck them every day. Dyra then has you clean the dirt off of her feet and finally, Metana usually goes last, blessing your tongue once more with her beautiful soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the evenings Dyra wears you, to relax her feet and to make sure you clean all the dirt from her feet. She often loosens the sandal a bit so she can move her foot around and direct you where to lick while the ladies are enjoying their dinner. You spend most of the time licking dirt and sweat from in between her toes. Luckily, her feet are just as hot as Metana's, arched with long toes, proper size 12s, albeit that Dyra's feet are much more calloused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the night falls, Freja grabs hold of you, she often has you lick some of the sister's sandals clean but afterwards she is very generous. She places you at the foot-end of her bed and toys with your mouth with her incredibly sexy and long toes, you usually spend the entire night licking and sucking on her toes, even when she is asleep. It is your job to make sure her toes don't have a single drop of sweat on them by morning. A job you happily fulfill every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Metana grabs you and the routine starts all over... Every day of your life; as Metana's personal insole, also serving her sisters with pleasure! Well done! </span></div></div>",

Let me test your servitude first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes off her other sandal and lays you on top of it. \"See all that dead skin lying around on that sweaty sandal? Eat it, human.\" Like a beast, you start to scourge the surface of the sandal, licking and chewing on all the dead skin you can find. You take big whiffs every so often to get reminded of Metana's erotic smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you really want to serve the Valkyrie then?\" Metana stands up tall, \"you will loose your identity, your name, your gender, your ability to talk... You will be installed as a living footstool. When you started this ritual, you said you would bargain your soul with the Gods as your witness.

Metana smiles, \"alright, let us get you ready then.\" Metana picks you up and places you on her shoulder as she  walks into the town of Arngarde. It is a nordic town, full of wooden buildings, symbols of dragons and Valkyries walk around the narrow streets. It is a bit of a dark village, with cold weather. The only sounds you really hear come from the tavern up ahead. To your surprise, you don't see any humans or other races in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then enters a small dark building, where you see an altar just like in the shrine where you were shrunk. Metana places you on the altar, \"this soul will be granted the blessing of eternal servitude. May its soul be given to the Valkyrie with the Gods as our witness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Dzzzzz-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again your body starts glowing! You feel a strange sensation and you start to grow rapidly as you take on your normal size again. \"We just reverted the shrinking here, come, we have to hurry.\" Metana throws a rag at you and she tells you to follow her. You follow Metana closely through the town of Arngarde, most other Valkyrie's look at you with a strange expression, some kind of victorious smile is on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then opens a door that leads you to a big hall, a wall of sound rushes at you. In this tavern-like building you see long tables and very long benches. Each of these benches are filled with Valkyrie drinking and eating, every table contains a massive feast. However, under all these tables you see lines of tall wooden boxes, closed with chains and locks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk closer to the tables, you see heads coming out of the wooden boxes. These heads are directly on the floor, blindfolded and facing upwards. Each of these heads is being used by several Valkyrie women. You recognize all these heads to be humans, like you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of these captured humans are used in different ways. Some are licking the feet of a Valkyrie above them, others are cleaning sandals, others are eating from Valkyrie's feet and some have sandals and boots tied to their faces while they are not in use. Some victims face the wrath of agitated Valkyrie maidens, being trampled, spit upon or forced to partake in breathplay games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana swings an arm around your neck, \"now don't be scared, this is what you wanted. Come with me.\" Nobody pays attention to you in the chaos of this oversized tavern. Metana then finds a seemingly empty box. She opens the box and whispers in your ear, \"now lie in there and be a good piece of furniture.\" As soon as you hesitate, Metana manhandles you into the box and restrains your arms and legs with metal clamps that were fitted into the wooden box. With your arms and legs restrained, you give up, this is what you wanted after all, isn't it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then fits your neck into the hole. Most of the box is actually rather comfortable, you lie on a set of cushions and blankets and the hole around your neck is padded with leather. Then, Metana closes the wooden box and secures the locks and chains around it. Now you really cannot move, your body is restrained within a massive box and only your head is showing. Even your neck is restrained by the tight hole that is encircling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then sits on a bench above you, each of her feet next to your head. \"So, this is what you wanted right? You will now be a public-use foostool for the Valkyrie for as long as you live.\" Your vision is then taken away when Metana tightly folds a massive blindfold around your head several times. \"You are not allowed to speak or resist, you simply have to obey whoever is feeling like using you. That means you will have to serve random Valkyrie women all day long. Speaking of which... Think I'll give you a test run...\" </span></div></div>",

Metana slowly drags the sole of her sandal across your tongue. \"This is your new life now human, if you're lucky, me and my daughter will visit you now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Metana keeps slowly dragging the bottom of her sandals across your tongue. \"swallow.\" Without hesitation you start swallowing and cleaning your tongue in your mouth. You taste all kinds of dirt and grime, but none of that matters now, you are just furniture for the Valkyrie. Thus, you just put your tongue out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good doormat. If you keep acting so obedient you will have a good life as a doormat here.\" Metana then starts dragging her other sandal across your tongue, back and forth. She then looks at the bottom of her soles, \"that looks alright to me.\" Metana takes off her sandals and puts one of her bare feet on your mouth. \"time to lick the sweat off, go on.\" Like a dog you start lapping at Metana's erotic and mature soles, the taste of her sweat is as intense as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of licking her soles, you start getting in between her toes. Metana seems to ignore you by now, she ordered a drink and is talking with some other women. Not like it matters, your only purpose here is simply to obey, no matter how long. Metana then moves several calloused spots near your mouth, which is an indication for you to suck and lick those spots with great care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thorough tongue bath, Metana puts one of her feet in your mouth, you are not quite gagging on it, but your mouth is completely filled, forcing you to breathe through your nose. Metana then puts her other foot on your nose, specifically her toes, forcing you to smell deeply from in between her toes. Every few seconds she pinches ur nostrils shut, and then releases them later, to make you breathe heavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this endless breathplay game, Metana sometimes holds your nose for almost a minute, after which you start breathing heavily, inhaling the intense sweat and toejam from in between her toes. Meanwhile, your tongue is being used as a towel for her long toes that are inside your mouth. Metana seems to pay no attention to you at all, she simply grinds her toes across your nose, over and over, till you have smelled every inch of them. After an hour or so, Metana seems to have finished her meal and she looks down at you. \"You are loving this, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you a hear a familiar voice... \"Hey mom, is that... Who I think it is?\" Kasandra seems to have caught up with the two of you, \"yes darling, this thing wanted to be furniture for the Valkyrie.\" Kasandra seems a bit amazed, \"wow, I wasnt sure if this one would end up here but, oh well, good job mother!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then releases her foot from your mouth and steps aside. She uses your hair as a towel for her feet, to get your saliva off her soles. She then puts her sandals on again. \"Go ahead darling, I think this one wants something to eat now.\" Metana then stands up and leaves. Kasandra then takes her mother's spot and sits down, placing both her smooth and pale feet next to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra looks down at you, \"guess it's feeding time, hmm?\"</span></div></div>",

Then, one of the waitresses walks towards you. She is a tall redhead nordic women, with tall feet and a curvaceous body. She looks like most other Valkyrie, except she is wearing a specific outfit.

Tongue out.\" You put your tongue out and then before you can say anything, the waitress drags the disgusting soles of her sandals across your tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra then laughs, \"haha, yes footstool, feeding time here means that you get to lick the sandals of a waitress, which are stained with all kinds of spilled drinks, sweat and food and whatever else.\" The waitress then spits on the floor, grinds her sandal into it and then brings it back to your mouth, \"you missed a spot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout protest you lick the beautiful waitress' own spit of her sandals, along with whatever kind of food you can find. Kasandra seems to enjoy your predicament, \"Wow Hilda, you are quite good at handling these things.\" Hilda, the waitress, switches to her other sandal and has you lick that one clean too. You obediently lap up whatever you can find on the waitress' soles and swallow it down. Hilda then takes off her sandals and walks off, \"I'll be back after my shift Kassy!\" Kasandra waves at her friend and then turns to you with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra then walks to a nearby group of Valkyrie maidens and takes their sandals with her. She then kneels at your face and places about five pairs of sandals next to you. \"I think it is time you start to understand what it means to be of public use. Tongue out.\" You put your tongue out and Kasandra drags the soles of the sandals of the random women across your tongue. After she is satisfied she has you smell the upper part of the soles. Your mouth is full of dirt and grime and your nostrils are filled with the scent of sweat of several women. However, Kasandra just keeps going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra even turned this into a game, you had to pair the sandals based on their smell. Everytime you had it wrong you had to smell them again... And again... And again...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter about an hour you are finally finished with Kasandra's task of public usage. \"Hmm... Not bad, maybe you will get used to this after all! But don't worry, I'll come back every single day to train you.\" Not the most positive thing for you to hear... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra opens her bag and grabs a rag out of it, drenched in sweat. \"open up, wide.\" You open your mouth and Kasandra puts the sweaty rag inside your mouth. \"I guess you don't mind that I cleaned my feet with that rag earlier.\" Kasandra then binds Hilda's sandals to your face, with the insides of her soles on your nose. Kasandra then places her own foot in her usual sandals on your forehead. \"Guess you're going to get used to what Hilda smells like, are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra then puts the blindfold back around your face and takes a seat above you. She rests both her feet on Hilda's sandal, making its sweat-soaked leathery sole dig into your nose. \"I really can't believe you volunteered for this, but, oh well, I will have great fun humiliating you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kasandra grabs something to eat, she eventually departs and leaves you as-is, gagged and smelling Hilda's worn sandals.

Gosh, Kasandra can be such a bully, haha. Well, it's nothing in comparison to what I have in store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then takes her sandals off your face and the rag out of your mouth. \"Because my sandals where here, I had to work barefooted, so, you will get another serving of food, aren't you lucky!?\" Hilda laughs and all you do is obediently open your mouth and stretch out your tongue. This is the position you signed up for, so you have to back it up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then orders some food and drags her feet across your tongue. You taste a mixture of everything, spilled food and drinks, sweat, dirt, dust and many other things. She then places her toes on your mouth. Without any command, you start licking and sucking on her toes, acting as a personal foot-cleaner for Hilda. Her arched and long soles taste delicious, despite the filth that is on them. You love dragging your tongue across the long, warm and sweaty soles of her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are actually aroused by the way in which Hilda is making a mess of you, not able to resist anything the beautiful redhead has in store for you. You then start licking and sucking on her toes again. After 30 minutes or so, Hilda seems satisfied and dries her feet in your hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth has an aftertaste of whatever was on the floor in this tavern. \"Good job footstool, let's make this into a routine!\" Hilda then puts her sandals on and leaves you be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute, a new woman is sitting above you. You feel her feet tap at your lips, you instantly open your mouth and start licking. The taste is unfamiliar, the woman pays no attention to you and simply drags her sweaty soles across your tongue. Like most Valkyrie, her feet are rather big, with long soles and long toes, her feet are a bit rougher, kind of like Metana's. You diligently lick the woman's feet till she is satisfied. You lick specifically gently and suck a little bit on the calloused spots on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the woman pays no attention to you at all. She just leaves without a word. You remain there, blindfolded, restrained, with your mouth wide open. Then someone is dragging their sandal across your tongue. \"Feeding time.\" You hear an unfamiliar voice, this must be another waitress who is having you clean her sandals. You lick and swallow whatever comes on your tongue and do your best to clean the soles of her sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there is silence for a while, until you hear two familiar voices, Metana and Kasandra! Metana strarts dragging the soles of her sandals across your tongue again. \"Looks like Hilda had some fun with you too!\" Metana says. Meanwhile, Kasandra places her foot on your forehead to remind you of your position. Metana then takes off her other sandal and has you smell her toes, as sweaty as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then says to you, \"you must be glad to serve the Valkyrie, aren't you?\" She then grabs something from besides your wooden prison. \"I haven't told you but, each of the waitresses can claim one of the footstools as their own. Guess what, Hilda claimed you!\" Kasandra then continues, \"Hilda's name is on your prison. But don't worry you're still a public service slut. It just means that when the tavern is closed, you will be smelling Hilda's sandals, and she will place all her pairs here for you to clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetana then wears one of Hilda's sandals, \"Hmm... didn't know this girl already had size 12s too.\" Metana then drags the bottom of Hilda's dirty sandals across your tongue. \"Luckily for you, Hilda has a lot of sandals, haha!\" Metana laughs as you lick the dirt from the sandals she is wearing. \"Good footstool. Be a good shoe-cleaner for Hilda!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so, the two women seem to have had their fun, making you lick and worship Hilda's sandals. Kasandra then picks up another pair, \"but these are the worst, her working sandals. We will tie these to your face and then you can sleep.\" As promised, Kasandra ties Hilda's sandals to your face and then both women leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gets very silent in the tavern. All you hear are the moans of other footstools, also smelling the foot-stench of their owners. You spend the entire night licking and smelling the inner sole of Hilda's sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

Each of these women have long, tall, arched feet with long toes. Some of them have very smooth soles and others are more calloused and mature. Nevertheless, each of their feet taste and smell heavenly. After a few months you start to be able to differentiate between each of the Valkyrie's based on the smell and taste of their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- \"Time for another feet pedicure, footstool.\"<br>\r\nMetana uses you almost every day, you spend a lot of time licking and smelling her delicious, mature and sweaty feet. You got really addicted to her arched and calloused soles, doing ur best to make her feet feel as good as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Feeding time again. Open up.\"<br>\r\nHilda is also a very recurring customer, she often has you clean her sandals in-between shifts and has you lick her bare feet at the end of her shift. She makes sure to work atleast several hours on her bare feet, just for you to lick them clean afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heya, ready for some fun?\"<br>\r\nKasandra often comes to humiliate you by bringing you the stinkiest feet; Like telling some of the older Valkyrie to use you or making you lick and smell sandals of the sweatiest Valkyrie. On very Lucky days, Kasandra lets you smell her own feet, which you have to beg for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of every day, you get to smell Hilda's delicious sandals again. This is basically your life now, who cares about defeating the Queen. You are just here to be a footstool for all the Valkyrie, each of their feet so heavenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now a permanent piece of furniture in Arngarde. Well done!</span></div></div>",

The nubby horns poking from her scarlet hair, the piercing, cat-like yellow eyes, the bright, cherry-red lipstick... all tell-tale signs of a succubus. Her pearly fangs shone brightly through the dark as she smirked at you. \"Ooooooh, we're gonna have so much <i>fun!</i> I love it when my partner struggles, it gets me SO hot and bothered...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike hell you were gonna let this whorish creature have her way with you! You reached up, grabbed her by the neck, and threw her across the room! Surprisingly, she offered little resistance. She must not have expected for you to strike first! She hit the wall with a light thud and fell to the floor. Thinking quickly, you sprang from bed and grabbed your sword and shield. You had just enough time to spin around and block a fist from the succubus. She bounced from the shield and pouted at you in response. \"Awww, what's wrong? We don't have to fight, I'm only here to give you what you want~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she trying to manipulate you into lowering your guard, or is she just daft!? \"I don't want anything from you, fiend! Begone, or I will cut you down in the name of the Goddess!\" The succubus raises a hand clad in a black leather glove to her mouth and giggles in response. \"Oh, don't you? Then tell me, honey, why is it that you're absolutely OVERFLOWING with sexual energy? I could see the stuff pouring out from your window! I'm just trying to do you a favor and let you get it all out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated for a brief second. Ever since you've set out on your journey, you have felt a stirring from your nethers... is that why you submitted so easily to the bunny girl? No, that can't be it, this succubus is obviously lying to you to get into your pants. She's probably what's causing you to feel so turned on right now! \"Y-you're doing no favors for me, monster! I know your kind, and I know you caused that weird sexual dream about feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus raised an eyebrow. \"Dream about feet...? Sweetheart, you truly overestimate me! Yes, I had my feet in your face, that's where my sex-enhancing pheromones come from, but my pheromones can't influence your dreams, they only enhance your natural desires. The truth is... you love feet, and they turn you on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stifle a gasp. There's no way... there's no way! You HATE feet! Their taste, their delicate aroma, their shapely toes, how you're always thinking about them... everything about them is such a massive turn-on! Er, turn-off! ...you can't possibly be entertaining the idea that you're attracted to monster girl feet... can you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus knew she was getting into your head, and decided it was the time to seal the deal. She lifted one foot, exposing her sweaty sole. \"Today's your lucky day! I'm gonna let you indulge in your little fetish! Just kneel down and kiss my sole, and I'll fulfill all your sexual fantasies...\"</span></div></div>",

You drop to your knees with a fairly loud *thunk* against the wooden floor and say \"Please forgive me Goddess\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly lower your head towards her gorgeous feet and leave a lovingly slow and lustful kiss on the middle of the top of her right foot and follow up by  kissing her sole at a faster and faster pace until she lets off a giggle mixed with a moan \"Heheoooohh! Why don't you do what you really want to do human? Come on, suck my toes!\" Without delay, you being engulfing her toes and sucking on them, 2 or 3 at a time then you started sucking them each individually. Her toes had a salty taste to them, but not too salty. It as actually very tasty you thought. \"Wow, you must really be into this! You have been sucking for almost 2 and a half hours!\" You froze at the words 2 and a half hours. Did she put you in a trance? \"B-but.. how?\" She cocked her head slightly and nudged your mouth with her foot, prompting you to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began worshiping her soles, which shared the delicious salty taste of her toes. You closed your eyes and continued licking and sucking and kissing. Again, the succubus announces how long you have spent indulging yourself and this time you didn't even care. The succubus was so gorgeous and alluring that you seemed to not care about anything anymore. You begin to stand up, putting her spit drenched feet on the floor. You realize what you have done, remembering your quest, why you hated monster girls. Yet here you are, the moment you are faced with the enemy you set out to destroy, you drop to your knees and beg to lick their feet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to rethink your quest, and perhaps you should take a different approach to how you deal with the monster girls. These girls are obviously superior to you, besting you in every way you try to combat them! Instead of fighting them, maybe you should seek out these girls and when they challenge you, you will submit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO! My quest is to destroy these monsters! I will not stop until I see their queen destroyed and humanity freed of their plague! They destroyed my home, and I am considering to submit to them?</span></div></div>",

As you finish explaining to Rebecca, you drop to your knees \"Please Mistress, let me serve you the same way I will come to serve the other monster girls!\". Rebecca pulled out a map from behind her, you have no idea where it came from but decided not to question it \"This is a map of all our bases, hideouts and ambush routes.

P-please don't hurt m-me\" You plead in the most innocent and scared voice you could make<br>\r\n\"Even if you were lost human, your house shouldn't be in the woods, that's our territory you lesser!\"<br>\r\nYou really become scared now. To make sure that they don't hurt you, you drop to your knees in front of the leader and start begging<br>\r\n\"I-I'll do anything f-for you mistress! P-please don't harm me! I'll even l-lick your fe-feet!\"<br>\r\nThe bunny girls all give a collective \"Oohs\" They began making the circle even smaller around you. After a small while their leader spoke again \"Well I didn't expect you to be so eager to worship your superiors human!\" She extended her one foot to you and you began doing what you sought out to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your usual method of starting by kissing their feet, then sucking their toes and then licking up and down all over their feet. Once you got through the last girl's feet you were exhausted, and the only thing you could taste were their feet, dirt and their sweat. Their leader, who said her name was Captain Gabriel called her patrol to follow her back to the base. You asked if you could join them and go into the base, but the Captain seemed hesitant.<br>\r\nShe did agree though, and you let out a sigh of relief to which the Captain looked very confused at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short trip back to the base was uneventful, except for the fact that the patrol handcuffed you. When you reached the front gate the guard, who was an imp girl, let you through after a small discussion with the Captain. You and the Captain parted ways with the rest of the patrol. They each told you that they would be happy to let you be their slave. The Captain was taking you to what looked like a big tower.<br>\r\n\"Since you did such a good job, I'm giving you to the base's commander. She hasn't had a slave in years and has been looking for one good enough ever since she was put in command here. You'll love her!\"<br>\r\nWhen you reached the top of the tower, you both entered a large room which occupied the entire top floor. There was a desk against one of the walls with a dragon girl sitting there. \"Commander Kytia, I think I found one good enough for you.\" Kytia turned towards you both, giving off a smile that sent shivers down your spine<br>\r\n\"Thank you Captain, that'll be all\" The bunny girl left, leaving you with a dragon girl. This dragon girl didn't have scaly feet or horned toes though. In fact she had human feet and ankles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n** Yes, Commander Kytia is related to the dragon girl of Hayato village, she's her sister. The only conflict between the two sisters are their allegiances, so should someone do a chapter where they meet feel free for them to be somewhat friendly and sisterly to each other ** </span></div></div>",

You check the map and see that this is her ambush point.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello foot slut! Come back for more?\" You whimper, shakily approaching her and kneel before her. \"Please let me serve you again mistress, let me lick your godly feet again!\" The bunny girl is surprised at your change of heart, she cocks her head looking confused, thinking that perhaps you were under a spell. You roll up your sleeve and show her your arm with the writing on it. She mumbles, reading to herself \"'I have accepted my rightful place as a slave to all monster girls' needs' Wow! Not even a day, and you already want to lick our feet? Hah!\" She extended her one foot, allowing you to worship it. You kissed the tops of her feet repeatedly, thanking her after each kiss. After you finished covering each of her feet in your spit with your tongue, you explain that you want to serve the monster queen yourself. The bunny girl, who said her name was Jessica pointed you in the right direction. \"Oh, and if you ever come round this part of the empire again, remember that my feet would love a visit from you\" She leaves, with a playful wink. You look at your map again, noticing that the map actually changes! You spot the queen herself at what must be her throne not too far from here. You also noticed that your path does a little circle around a pond nearby, which has frog girls and slime girls! You also see a fox girl camp nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide whether to serve the needs of these girls, or head straight for the queen.</span></div></div>",

Although, for MP I'd like to make it how submissive Mary is feeling, rather than how attracted simply because this Mary is already indefinitely attracted to pretty much any feet she sees here. MP will go down each time Mary surrenders, and it will go up if Mary defeats her enemies. At the start and end of each chapter I'd like for the MP and inventory to be updated as well. **<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 90/100 (-15 for submitting to bunny girl ; -20 for kissing succubus's feet, + 10 for defeating succubus ; + 15 for enslaving succubus)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInventory : Copper sword (+2 attack, base damage is 1), Wooden shield (+2 defense, base defense is 0), 15 gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it would be best to stick to where the sun shines, you head towards the lake on during your journey you were actually eager to face more monster girls, mostly due to the fact that you actually had a good chance at defeating them, or at least one at a time. The journey to the lake was quiet, uneventful and long. You reached a small hill which overlooked the lake. You decided this was the best place to sleep for the night. You ordered Rebecca to fetch food while you set up a small tent for yourself. Rebecca returned quickly with a surprising amount of food, she had fish, berries, mushrooms, fruit and 3 dead regular rabbits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job slave, if you keep this effort up I might eventually even let you speak! Now, prepare a small fire and make sure that it won't be seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relaxed by the edge of the hill, admiring the silent lake while Rebecca made the fire and food. You were concerned about how peaceful everything was around you. You could hear some birds and animals doing their thing around the forest and lake, but you felt as though this was too peaceful. After awhile Rebecca finished her work and gave you your food. You made sure Rebecca ate first, just to be sure. When Rebecca finished eating, you started. You also ordered Rebecca to give you a foot massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started asking Rebecca questions about herself, the Monster Girl Empire and anything else you could think would be useful to know. To your surprise it turned out that Rebecca was in possession of a map! This map wasn't just a map of your small continent, but a live one! It showed most of the empire's bases, outposts, patrols and more! You found yourself on the map and checked where you were and your surrounding area. There was one tiny outpost near you. You were surprised at the lack of monster girl presence here. You placed the map into your inventory, and went to sleep. Rebecca with her face in your feet.

All you knew is that your feet had stopped and so you had completed the wishes of your mistress. \"Slave, I want your house, do you live alone?\" your mistress whispered to you as the final torches around the village were put out and the hovels were locked up, supposedly safe from monster girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no mistress... I have a twin sister.\" You stated, you couldn't remember until your mistress had asked and promptly forgot after you answered. Your twin sister was exactly like you, she was relatively short, had curly ginger hair, perky breasts and dainty feet. The two of you had lived there with just your mother since all the men of the village got lured away into the forest. And after your mother had perished in the collapse of the temple and you had gone adventuring, you assumed that your sister now resided in the small hovel by herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will need this slave, it is a jar of my slime, use it on your sister and then I will enter.\" She handed you a jar of the delicious liquid, and you cradled it knowing how valuable it was. You glanced down at the smooth green feet of your mistress thinking if you acted well you could worship them again, and after a long day of walking it they would be very sweaty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mistress\" you said and then headed off to the village as your legs carried you towards one of the hovels, you assumed used to be your home.

Without a seconds more hesitation you brought forward the slime and uncapped the jar, letting the salty smell of your mistress's feet make its way to your nose. You reach forward and gently pinch the nose of your sister, and in response the smile on her mouth opened to allow her to breath. You released her nose and began to slowly pour the liquid into the awaiting mouth. You watched with envy as the slime trickled into the agape mouth and it slid down her throat without even causing a gag reflex. You poured in even more, jealously knowing that she was falling more and more at ease. Even asleep her tongue rose up to greet the slime entering her mouth, beckoning more of the slime, asking it to enter into her thin body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou poured in the last drop and her mouth seemed to open wider, like a baby bird pleading its mother for more food. You moved to her ear and brushed away the curls of hair. \"You love froggy feet\" you whispered as per you mistress's instructions. Like a slightly dozy echo your sister repeated the words \"I... Love... Froggy... Feet...\" You watched as her toes wiggled as she moved uncomfortably in her sleep and her head rolled towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes opened and pierceing green pupils stared straight at you. \"I... Love... Feet\" was all she said while looking down at your feet. She tried to get up but the slime had weakened her so she toppled into a pile on the floor, her eyes still looked at you and she repeated \"I Love... Feet.\" She reached out with her arms towards your feet but she was too far away. \"I love feet\" she said with more certainty this time and through an enormous feat of strength was using her arms to pull herself towards you. You didn't know what to do so you backed away and sat against the wall. \"I love feet\" she kept repeating, pulling herself ever closer until she was within range of your feet. Using only her teeth she pulled off the soft cheap shoes you wore and began to lick your feet. Her passionate licks went up and down your soles. You did nothing and simply waited for your mistress to arrive while your sister began suckling your toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your mistress entered and saw your sister engrossed in your feet.

She then laughed, glanced at you and said \"She's even more suggestive than you, slave! Wait until she gets fresh froggy feet!\" Your mistress began walking towards your sister who was laying on her stomach on the floor. You could hear the smacking as her slime covered feet hit the floor. You also watched hungrily as some of the slime stuck to the floor to the areas where she had walked. You wanted that slime. Your mistress's feet, that you loved so much, created such a wonderful substance and you longed to lick it fresh from her sole once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly aware of a tingling on your soles that caused you to involuntary scrunch your toes, it was your sister's tongue. Satisfied that she had sucked your toes clean your sister was now ravenously licking your soles stopping only to say \"I...Love...Feet\" in between zealous licks. It was at this point that your mistress reached your sister and looked down at her with pity, \"Poor thing, you need some froggy feet.\" With that, she shuffled one of her goddess like feet under your sisters bosom and rolled her onto her back, her limp limbs splayed around her, her ginger hair in a semi-circle around her head and her emerald eyes blank. She stared up at the ceiling and after a few moments whimpered \"feet\" while a deep sadness came over her features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there slave, don't you worry, foggy will make it better.\" your mistress cooed as she lifted her foot off your sister's right nipple, leaving a light stain on the fabric. She then hovered her slim foot over her face just long enough for a delayed reaction to come from your sister; it was hope. Just as that gleam of hope shone in your sister's eyes your mistress gave her what she wanted, shoving her foot right into your sisters awaiting mouth. You could see the happiness in her eyes as the plum green toes continued to slide into and out of her mouth. Her body was racked with convolutions as she was hit with pure pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as your mistress was occupied you decided that it was time for you to make your move. You got on your hands and knees and scampered towards the small pools of slime left on the floor. You first rubbed the left side of your face through the substance, and then the right side so that it covered your entire face, making it go slightly numb. The salty slime had the wonderful aroma of the feet you craved and you kept your face to the floor to keep smelling it. At the same time you made sure keep sight of your mistress's feet, wishing you and not your sister was under them. When you couldn't stand it anymore you began to lick the floor, getting as much of the slime as you could into your mouth, while the rest of your face was still covered in it, with much of it matted in your red hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had cleaned the floor, panting on all fours like a dog, you made note of your sister. She was much more subdued now, the passion she had before was gone and she was currently lethargically sucking each of your mistresses green toes the rest of her body and face completely at ease. You could hear your mistress whisper, \"You love foggy feet, the way they feel, the way they smell, their slime. You will obey foggy feet.\" as she removed her big toes from its warm damp sanctuary and spread her webbed toes above her slave. Her new slave repeated the mantras softly. She then lifted her head in what must have been an enormous effort against the slime and used her dainty tongue to dart in between the webbing getting more delicious slime in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mistress then used the same foot to press her slave's head back down to the ground and looked at her other slave. She was ragged, slime in her hair and dripping across her petite face, panting with exertion after her licking the floor. Her cloths were tattered and her bosoms were barely kept in her shirt but more amusingly for the frog girl she could see lust in her eyes. She glanced down at her new slave and noticed they were very similar, but then all humans looked alike. She watched as the new slave was sniffing her spread toes with her eyes closed while her tongue extended to lick her sole. The frog girl smiled to herself, happy with her new slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Frog girl do next?</span></div></div>",

Who knew the war between monster girls and humans would be so fun? Normally Frog slime was used to lure in pray to be eaten, but this new plan of making an army of slaves obedient to feet meant an infinite amount of food and cute little mindless humans. Froggy was tired now after all the drama of making another new foot slave and so decided sit back on her new bed leaving one slave floundering on the floor gasping for slime, her eyes wide and wild while her other slave was more conscious waiting expectantly covered in slime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come slaves, froggy feet need to be cleaned\" She said laying back wiggling her green toes, flicking some of the slime onto the floor. Her very first slave was off like a shot, springing from the slime puddle on the floor to her mistress's feet. She rubbed her face against the light green sole with reckless abandon making sure her hair and face were covered in the slime. She then used her tongue to lap up the slime while the foot rotated in the air teasingly. Her second slave already subdued by her last dose of slime was more slow to sit up as her matted curly hair stuck to her face. While the first slave was already sucking the ball of Froggy's foot trying to milk the pore of her sole for more of the slime she craved, the second slave, her sister, was just starting to suck on Froggy's other toes making sure her tongue swirled around the toe taking in all of the taste. Both girls now had a dreamy look across their faces, both dedicated to Froggy feet, happy in the knowledge they never needed to worry about anything ever again. Froggy spread her toes and teased her slaves by pulling them out of reach so their heads bobbed forward their petite noses nestling in between the big toe and second toe in unison. What well trained slaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFroggy wondered briefly what her slaves were thinking, little did she know that they weren't thinking so much as fixating on nothing but the feet in front of them, the more slime they ingested the more fixated they were and the more willing they were to obey commands. Presently the smell and taste of slime was in their mind along with green webbed feet swirling around inside their otherwise empty heads. Slave one finished licking all the slime off one foot and before more started to ooze from the foot's pores she moved over to the foot her sister was working on and soon both their heads moved up and down in opposite motions as they licked the foot together with their small tongues. They licked the sole clean before tugging on the toes with their lips as they sucked on the object of their obsession. they worked inwards from the outside toes to the centre toe and soon their tongues competed for slime. The pink snakes rubbed against the toe as their mouths came together as both attempting to suck on the same toe. Soon the competition heated up as they realised they were both after the same slime and so started to try and use their tongues to scoop out slime out of each others mouths. To Froggy it looked like they were attempting some form of awkward kiss as their lips locked and their tongues darted between mouths trying to steal slime. Eyes closed they were focuses entirely on their task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFroggy was getting bored of watching ginger hair fling about as the two identical humans had a battle of tongues. They both looked a mess covered in their favourite clear substance. How was Froggy supposed to use these humans to infiltrate the village if they looked so out of place and smelt of feet? She then used her dexterous toes to grasp the ginger twins and pull them apart only to use her soles to caress their faces and push them both together as their eyes tried to glimpse the sexy feet. \"Slaves, clean yourselves up, tomorrow we enslave the rest of your village.\" With this they both started to lick each others faces as they cleaned the slime off the pale freckled skin. \"You love Froggy feet. You love Froggy feet. You... Love...Froggy... Feet....\" Froggy whispered as she fell asleep to the sounds of a smacking as her slaves cleaned themselves, deeply, deeply in love with Froggy feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only sounds that can be heard is the light breathing of your sister and the soft cooing of owls in the night. You settle down at the edge of the bed and gaze intently at your new obsession. You end up kneeling upon your sisters only pair of flimsy shoes still warm from holding such precious feet. The feet themselves are at eye level, slim feet with the dainty toes pointing at the ceiling. Every so often the toes twitch, perhaps due to the slight draft. The hours spent in those shoes mean that the already soft feet had been marinating in sweat making them both softer and more aromatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slightly tilt your head while the smell makes your mind race. I love froggy feet, you think over and over and over until the words blur into, Love Feet. This new command drew your face ever closer to the feet of your new mistress. You get closer and closer examining the new centres of your universe, while their smell filters into your nose. This smell drags your face  towards the toes and soon your petite nose is between the big toe and the second toe as you heavily inhale the stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the toes flinch, gently squeezing your nose, and you take it as a sign of the pleasure of your new feet. You keep smelling dragging your nose across the base of the toes taking in all you can. Then moving forward you press your face against the soles, feeling the reassuring pressure of your sisters feet. You smother yourself in them getting as close as you physically can, face pressed against them and ginger hair tangling between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull back for a moment and then glancing above the sheets see a faint smile on your mistresses sleeping face. Then daring to go farther your tongue darts out almost with a mind of its own and reaches for the feet. First it lands on the heel and makes circle motions, talking in the slightly salty taste. It then in one quick motion goes all the way up the sole prompting  movement from your sister as the toes scrunched. In this one simple sexy motion, you are now completely enslaved to the feet of your sister.</span></div></div>",

You paid no heed; if they were adventurers or monster girls here to liberate you from your mistress, she could protect you, you're sure. As the footsteps drew closer, two distinct voices arose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deeper, huskier voice barked \"What the hell, Karmina!? We're never gonna get these errands done if you keep darting off every five minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA high-pitched (almost painfully so) chimed in \"Yeah! My feet hurt and I wanna go h-oooooooooooooh, what is <i>THAT!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mistress (Karmina? It doesn't truly matter to you, she's just Mistress as far as you care) replied in her sing-song voice, \"You know very well what it is: a real live human! And my slime did quite the number on her, she's fully submissive and bends to my whims now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you lapped away at your mistress's soles, a lizard woman ran up next to you and leaned over your face. She was slim and short, but not as short as your mistress. Sun glistened off her jet-black skin as her bright yellow eyes gazed into yours. \"She's sooooooo cute! Do we get to keep her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your right, a crocodile woman approached. She was definitely bigger than both of her companions. The craggy green scales across her arms were rippled with muscles, and rows of razor-sharp teeth were concealed within her powerful jaw. \"Don't be ridiculous, Eliza. We're auctioning her off immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard girl pouted at the crocodile. \"Buuuuuuut Raaaaaaania, she's so cute, and look at how much she loves Karmina's feets! You can just take her away like that!\" Eliza smirks at her comrades. \"At least, not without sampling the goods~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mistress stated that she's more than happy to share you. And you were more than happy to be shared. Any of Mistress's friends are to be worshiped just like Mistress, of course. But, as Mistress's feet fell to the sides of your face and away from your view, you felt a very brief moment of clarity! If you throw your mistress- er, this frog girl off of you right now, you may be able to escape! But, the lizard and the croc have both already lifted a foot, and the lizard's foot looks quite enticing, with her petite sole and long, slender toes wiggling above you. Even the crocodile's foot, despite having shorter toes, has its own allure due to its massive size. One foot alone can easily cover your head, you think. Just thinking about it is enough to make you wet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is definitely your last chance. If you don't act immediately, you will most certainly be at the mercy of the frog girl and her companions for the foreseeable future...</span></div></div>",

Every moment seemed to slow down as the feet hit thier mark on the wood, sinking into the shield and coming out on the other side. Without even thinking, you used your sword to bang the claws downward like a poorly aimed hammer strike. Instead of bouncing of the shield for another strike, the poor cat girl hung from it just like you hoped. The feline furiously scratched  at the shield with the hope of of pulling herself away, but you wouldn't have any of that. Raising your sword, you threw down the trapped cat and sliced at her claws. Thankfully your sword was strong enough to slice through the claws of the black cat with all 10 front claws falling to the ground. With half of her arsenal gone, the Monster girl squirmed about with less furiosity and more fright. \"Just like a real cat.\" You say as you do the same to the claws stuck in your shield. \"You take away the claws and they fall to pieces.\" The stunned cat girl looked to you, trying to say something but no sound came from her mouth for a few seconds. \"When...they grow back....I will SO hunt you down you....you....you twerp! And when I catch you...I won't give you a choice. You will fall before me and worship my feet or my name isn't Selina!\" The  monster girl ran off into the brush with her tail between her legs, leaving you with a feeling of pride. Your first monster girl defeated, if this was the worst of the girls out here than you had no reason to fear. However a nagging voice told you that was certainly not the last time you two would meet.

Sure the occasional bush rustle and 'being-watched' feeling would come up but no monster girl seemed to come after you. The sounds of people doing thier everyday life became clear as you came to a large wooden gate. Two burly guards stood before the gate eyeing you as you came forward. \"Halt right there missy, let's take a look at you. Don't want to have any disguised monster girls get into town on our watch. As the the two men examined you, you took time to notice the steel swords slightly out of thier scabbards. Seemed like you might have the chance to get an upgrade to some better weapons in town as well as support. After a minute or two, the guard on the right tapped at the gate. \"She's clear, let her in.\" The door opened quickly and you rushed inside, not wanting to risk a monster girl taking advantage of this. \"Have a good time!\" You hear the guards say as the doors slam shut. You look around, amazed at the sight before you. You had always heard of Galdran but the size that stood before you made your village look like a homestead. People walking around well constructed buildings and stalls buying, selling, eating and drinking. \"Alright.\" You think to yourself, \"Time to find aid for my quest to defeat the Monster Queen.\" There had to be some sort of blacksmiths' shop around town, most hero to be often took pride in thier weapons being as sharp as possible if needed. A rumbling in your stomach pulled you from your thoughts and reminded you of just what time it was. It would be pretty hard to defeat a monster without first defeating your hunger first. Thankfully you still had enough money to buy some nourishment and wonderful smells were all around you.</span></div></div>",

Walking through the crowds of people, you took notice of a particular smell overpowering most of the others in the market place. Deciding to follow your senses, you look around as you try to decipher exactly what the smell was. Stepping away from the main stalls, your journey took you to a row of buildings all built into an exact fashion. In fact, a little examination showed these buildings all seemed to be connected to one another. The biggest house in the middle of this row had a small sign in front of the door saying 'Little Muffin Bakery.' A quick whiff let you know that this building was the source of the wonderful scent catching your interest. You open the door and walk in, greeted with the sight of a cozy space with a few tables sprawled about. A counter stood on the far side of the room with the backside of a stone fireplace sticking out. \"Hello there mam.\" You turned to the bubbly voice and found yourself stand in in front of a girl about your age if not slightly younger. Her brown hair hung at her sides as she motioned to a table. \"Would you like to sit down?\" You nod and follow the girl as she walks you to the closest table. As you sit down, you notice something a little odd about the girl: her sides seemed to be as brown as her hair, showing a contrast to the rest of her white skin. You are curious but decide not to ask for fear of being rude. \"We are a fairley new bakery and our choices are slightly limited at the moment, but our speciality bread are sure to stamp out your hunger.\" You roll your eyes at the foot reference, taking it as a slight joke to the worldly situation. All of your time in the monastery had trained you to keep your needs low and with your funds even lower,  you decide on plain bread over the rye and baguettes. \"Right away mam,  I'll see if my sister's have any out of the oven yet.\" The girl walks away, with you realizing she wasn't wearing anything over her feet. Of course you didn't mind too much, she was a simple human after all....albeit one with an unusual complection with her brown around the sides. \"Your in luck mam, we had a loaf fresh out of the oven, I'll come back to discuss price.\" Of course you were expecting a simple load but this was quite a big mound of bread. It fact, it almost seemed to be shaped like a.....you shake your head and eat, obviously your quest was getting to you more than you realized.</span></div></div>",

It was no doubt just another, rather odd joke about the Monster girl epidemic and even if it was or not it didn't matter. It tasted like no white bread you had eaten before, flavorful as if there was spread on it despite knowing well you hadn't put any on it. Taking a look around the bakery, you saw you weren't the only one enjoying it's wares. Your mouth watered as you saw one man munching on a soft sole of rye while a woman across from him pulled out a long speacialty baguette. It did seem quite a shame that there were only three flavors of bread at the moment, but what they had seemed delicious all on it's own. A good amount of minutes passed by as you savored every bite of your meal, watching people come in and out with the cheery waitress guiding them to thier tables. As you picked up the last toe of bread, the waitress (looking somehow more beautiful than before) came up to your table. \"Are you enjoying your meal mam?\" With the bread already in your mouth, you merely nod though it seems she understands how much you nod. \"Wonderful! My sister's are going to love hearing this...actually how would you like to meet them? See we are needing some outside opinions on some new menu items we're planning on selling and I get you'd love some more free goods. I'll even make this meal free just for being such a good customer.\" You licked your lips at the thought of having more of these bread feet and the fact your entire meal will be cost less only sweetened the deal. \"Great! Follow me.\" Standing up from your chair, you follow the brown/white girl through the bakery floor to a door close to the counter. \"Sisters! I have a 'test subject' for you!\" As you walk through the door, your eyes are drawn to the two girls standing beside what you assumed was the oven the bread was cooking in. The first one, a darker shade of brown on both colors, looked to you with a smile. \"Great sis, and oooh I know I haven't seen her around at all! She must be new in town!\" The girl's black hair flew about as she rushed to you and hugged you, her scent telling you she seemed to work with the rye bread the most. \"Well, zees are done. I think zat is all the people will desire for the day.\" The third and tallest girl said as she pulled six assorted foot loaves out of the oven. \"Shall I get out little sister to test zhier creations?\" You couldn't help but giggle, both at the foreign accent of this girl but the fact they all kept calling each other sister. After disappearing for a momet, the tall girl came back with two smaller girls about child age. The child on the right had a brownish complection with white hair messing strewn about her head. The one on the left had a similar hair color, though hers was in a bun and her skin seemed more....you want to say golden. Both girls held plates in thier hands with foot loaves of similar colors to themselves. Seeing nothing wrong and feel in strangely compelled to, you taste both. The right one tastes like a sweet cinnamon roll complete with icing while the left is spongey and seems to have some form of filling. All the girls around you smile to one another, not that you noticed.</span></div></div>",

Wandering out into the hallway, you hear another noise coming from the same direction as the previous. Fainter still than before, but all that did was feed your curiosity. Creeping along the hallway, you become aware of a scent that had become quite known to you over the past hours:foot loaves. Sure enough, you turn to the door beside you and see....wait....you take a second to realize the only things in this room were your hosts sleeping in separate beds. Still...the scent was unmistakable. It was then how odd the girls were sleeping. Sure the eldest was sleeping rolled in sheets but her sisters were all odd, backs hunched and shoulders tensed far up. It almost seemed like they were....loaves of bread. The dots began to click with sickening efficiency, your instant love, thier all-too-sweet nature, the foot references! These were monster girls! Monster bread girls! Which ment that you had been eating...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nYour head began to spin, all this time you had fallen under the spell of monster girl feet and you didn't notice!

Turning away from the edible evil, your eyes fell upon a rather dark door you didn't remember seeing yesterday. Curious, you creep your way across the floor with the hope the small squeaks and creeks weren't audible to the monsters above you. The door opened without a sound and you kept right on by, entering a stone staircase leading right down. Thankfully there were torches lining the walls so light wasn't an issue. You continued down the stairs, a voice becoming more and more noticeable as you did so.<br>\r\n\"There you go now...doesn't it feel better to just obey me? Certainly must be compared to having your free will. Just get back to strengthing my daughters.\" You reached another door at the bottom of the stairs, this time wide open for you to see. You step through the archway to be greeted with a large sanctum, making you wonder just how far underground you were at that moment. What caught your eye though was the commotion that was going on around the center of this odd place. A large walkway crowded with so many bread girls identical to the ones above circled a cauldron as big as an average house. Out of that cauldron however was the real eye catcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was twice as tall as the cauldron and about as wide. It's entire body was a creaming color, dripping as if it was melting. If this being called itled the bread girls' mother than that meant that this super sized beast was a dough girl....or woman based on her body and face. You couldn't see who she was talking to, but you didn't have time to think about it as the large dough monster turned right towards you. \"Ahh, I thought I felt my daughters' influence somewhere. What are you doing out of bead dearie? Oh! Could it be that you've come here to slay me, the dough mother ?  To destroy such a beautiful creation of my queen? Or could it be that you're a little hungry?

You knew this would be a tough fight, and that the Bread Girls were surrounding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't creep in the shadows girl!

That's how our spell works...the more delicious bread you eat, the more our spirit is infused with yours...until you become a bread thrall!

Speaking of, the delicious scent of freshly baked goods becomes apparent as you hear someone approaching. Curious (and becoming hungry again) you sit up in bed as the door opens and two girls come through carrying plates. The first girl had many of the characteristics of one of the younger girls from yesterday, while the second girl was a different figure. \"We figured you would wake up.\" The second girl said as she brushed away some pink hair. \"We wanted to give you some breakfast.\" \"Yeah!\" The first girl exclaimed as she sat a tray in front of you. \"In bed too!\" You looked to the morning meal before you and already felt better. A glass if milk....at least it seemed like milk, and a new type of footbread. You grabbed at the baked good and examined it. It's circular path almost caused it to connect with itself and there was green frosting coating it's toes. As you chowed down, the girls got on either side of you with devilish grins. \"Tastes good doesn't it? I bet you could eat nothing but that and feel happy for the rest of your life.\" You nod without really thinking it over, although why would you need to? These foot loaves really were that good. The girl to the right of you stretched her leg, showing off her green-tipped foot. \"You know, our sisters had been talking and we were wondering if you would like to stay a little while? Maybe work for us?\" \"Just think of it cutie...\" the girl to your left said as she did likewise with her icing caked foot. \"....helping bake, test and eating as much of these little babies as you wish. Helping to spread our recipe through the town and maybe even beyond. Plus, we might just let you have our bread 'from the source' in case your little enthralled mind didn't clue you in to what we are. Doesn't that sound just wonderful?\" As the two feet inched closer and closer, the prospect of working for these nice women seemed so pleasing. Plus, eating as much footbread as you wanted sounded like a nice bonus. Still, a nagging voice in your head kept trying to say against it. Reminding you of your warrior path and your quest to defeat the Monster Queen. </span></div></div>",

You gaze to the sunset on her deck, remembering your past life and quest. You remember how determined you were to defeat these 'evil' beings, and how devout you were to a goddess that wanted to destroy such superior and beautiful beings! You've come to a realization that humans really are meant to be under the feet of these beautiful girls! Humans were never ever meant to exist as equals, let alone conquerors of monster girls! Humans were always meant to be slaves! Just as you finish this thought, your mistress arrives home</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave, I'm home! I have some wonderful news too!\"<br>\r\nYou rush to the door, kneeling and kissing her feet when you reached her just as you were taught. Your mistress was carrying a letter which she handed to you with excitement on her face! The letter read:<br>\r\n<i>To all beings of the Empire and the world.<br>\r\nThe last of the human cities have surrendered to the Empire and have accepted a treaty proposed by the Queen last week. We invite all to join us in the former human capital for a grand ceremony, which celebrates the day that humanity has accepted their rightful place under the Empire's, and all monster girl's feet!<br>\r\nSigned, <br>\r\nThe Queen</i><br>\r\nYou almost jumped out of joy! For the first time ever, you stood up and hugged your mistress, only moments later letting her go realizing your mistake.<br>\r\n\"Oh-oh no I'm so sorry mistress! I didn't..\"<br>\r\n\"It's alright! I'll forgive you this time, since it is a great day and I'm in a good mood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\"><i>You and your mistress began your journey to the human capital at once, both of you equally excited at the event! You took a route through some villages to get to the capital. As you passed through each, you could see humans everywhere kneeling before monster girl soldiers, licking their feet and pleasing them! You reached the capital one day early and stayed in one of the inns. Your mistress told you that she would treat you like an equal and a friend since you did such a good job pleasing her the past year. That didn't stop you from begging to clean her feet when she began resting though. Katrina let you worship her feet as she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you woke up early with your mistress. The both of you then strolled around the town, admiring the various sites. Statues of human heroes and generals were being pulled down and replaced with statues of the the queen, or other monster girls. Some were even replaced with statues of a human worshiping a monster girl's feet! As you were walking along you noticed how full of energy and bouncy your mistress was! This really means something to her! You were happy too, but she was overcome with joy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceremony itself was not very entertaining, it was full of certain displays, stories and humiliation. The Queen did a speech at the end, proclaiming a new era of peace and happiness. Listening to her it seemed as though she wanted to go easy on the humans for giving up so willingly. Some the monster girls in the crowd however did not share her mercy.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>And that is the story of how the hero that was meant to save humanity and restore peace to the world was easily defeated and enslaved. She would spend the rest of her life serving her mistress without even a thought of trying to break free.</b></span></div></div>",

The only things that got on their side is their magic(which is pretty ehh),their singing,and their big feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut their fully grown forms:Fairfolk ironically are one of the strongest and cruelest of the monster girls.

But I already know about your name Oplan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My name's S-Selre\" the craven blue fairy stuttered. She has short blue hair,and she was wearing a blue iris dress and sandals.  Her wings were buttfly's wings made of clouds and water,and had violet runes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my name's Muriga! Nice to meet ya Mary\" The jolly red fairy happy and loudly said. She has spiky red hair that was medium length. She has a rose dress and sandals. And her wings were moth wings made of fiery earth,and she has bright yellow runes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally,my name's Cynedwe..\"the brooding black fairy drawl on. Like Oplan,she has long and messy hair. She is wearing a dress and sandals made of the petals of black dahlias flowers. Her wispy wings were of those a dragonfly,and she has silver runes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's out of the way. What should we do now\" Mary quizzicaly said to her self. Plus she need to make the fairies her official servants,and the ritual to do so will take a while.

About 10 minutes later, just as you were about to drift to sleep, a pair of feet reached round from behind you and trapped your face in between them and at the same time someone jumped on your back and used their hands to trap your arms!

One of the catgirls wearing some kind of skull on top of her head, with strings of red hair coming from underneath as well as a ponytail in the back crosses her arms and smirks at the moment she notices you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, Kimi was right! A human really was stupid enough to camp near our tribe!\" She says while looking towards you<br>\r\nYou wonder what did she mean by a tribe, considering you were just in a small camp with 4 tents around a fire... could there be more of them? Or those four actually think they are enough to set up tribal system on their own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid human! Trespassing on our territory is usually punishable by death! But since you are pretty cute looking... I will offer you position of my personal slave!\" Said the red haired catgirl keeping her smug smirk as she looked towards you<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's not fair chief! I found her first!\" A voice sounded behind you, belonging to the catgirl who ambushed you before<br>\r\n\"Well, she escaped you, Kimi... so she is mine now! Seems fair to me!\" The red haired catgirl ignored the objection<br>\r\n\"Uuuu...\" Whined the catgirl from before, but she didn't complain any further<br>\r\nOther two catgirls had black and blue colored hair respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, hurry up, kneel and pledge your loyalty to me human! Or suffer the consequences!\" The red haired chief catgirl raised her bare foot, it didn't have fur on it like the blonde one, but her nails were definitely similar to cat's, sharp and definitely able to scratch your skin if she wouldn't be satsfied with your pampering of her feet.. it looked really pretty and cute however, and just a little dirty, being a chief, she probably didn't have to walk too much compared to other three. Her adorable clawed toes wiggled a bit while waiting for you to kneel and start worshipping...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like you have no choice, considering that you are surrounded and outnumbered 4 on 1. But perhaps if you really tried you would be able to fend off the catgirls? They don't seem armed especially well... at worst you would however presumably end up as whole tribe's \"foot rug\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps there's some way to distract them and then run away?</span></div></div>",

Hold on please!\" You pleaded to the black Wolfgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Catgirl snatched most of your supplies, you weren't going to let your ego ruin this opportunity in front of you. Who knows what could happen in this forest without this strong Wolfgirl's guidance? You were already jumped once today... and yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Big Bad Wolf turned around with an annoyed look on her face \"...I said I have lost interest, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I'm gonna die out here! I was in over my head ...Don't leave me to die, I'll do anything.\" You continued your plea. You felt so low that you didn't even dare look into the Wolfgirl's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Big Bad Wolf smugly snickered \"Anything? Like get on the ground and slobber on my toes like you did for that tiny Catgirl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I m-mean if it'll save my life, I'll do it. I need to survive so...\" You again looked down at her clawed feet. They were dangerous, rough, and... sexy as well as cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta admit, it's not every day you can get a pathetic weak human licking at your feet and all that walking and fighting have made my feet a bit tired. I guess I've earned myself a little break. Today's your lucky day.\" The Wolfgirl indicated with her finger to follow her over to a nearby tree trunk and you did as instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not only going to clean these feet but also make them feel as good as new. If you do good enough then maybe I'll toss your skinny ass out of this forest. You better hope you're a better licker than you are an adventurer.\" The Wolfgirl then raised her right foot revealing her delicate, slightly sweaty and dirty sole, a view you have been waiting for since you very first laid your eyes on this Wolfgirl. It was difficult to hide the joy on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got on your knee's before the Wolfgirl and began the message. This woman looked very strong so you weren't scared to knead her foot with some extra pressure. You looked up to see the reaction on the Wolfgirl's face to hope to see how she was doing. The Wolfgirl stared blankly down at you as she continued her massage. She didn't look impressed to say the least... you then looked at her toes. You opened your mouth and carefully sucked her big toe, attempting not to cut yourself with her claws(Those things could kill someone) as you continued to rub her feet. Looking up again, the Big Bad Wolf had a slight smile on her face. You continued to softly suck each toe as you kneaded her soft sole, you did the same with her left foot making sure to take your time. I mean your life is on the line after all, it only makes sense to take this very seriously...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the massage was finished you continued and picked up both of her feet to lick her soles. Her soles surprisingly not as dirty as you thought they would be. They had I slight musky smell but honestly... it didn't exactly smell bad. After lapping at the bottoms of her feet for about 10 minutes you stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Did I do all right?\" You nervelessly ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah. You did good enough. Seemed like you enjoyed it more than I did. You're real damn lucky you bumped into me in this forest. You're a human just begging to be a slave.\" You blushed, you tried to hide your feelings but it was no good. While you were at her feet she kept her eyes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me human... Why is someone as weak as you out all the way out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Monsters took everything away from me... I-I was angry. I was headed to Galdran to...\" You couldn't tell her the truth for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have guts trying to keep secrets from someone like me... but I am a Wolf of my word. Get your ass up and follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed the Wolfgirl for about 20 minutes. You're feet were in pain from the amount of walking but the walk was safe so no complaining. You looked at the Wolfgirl's barefeet getting slightly more and more dirty as she walked to pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are human.\" You could see the Sun appearing through the end of this massive forest coming up. You are out of that forest of death...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolfgirl walked over to you, towering over you. <b>Big</b> Bad Wolf indeed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you gonna run on home where you belong?\" This idea didn't sound all that bad to you after what you just went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or do you wanna carry all my stuff to Galdran?\" The Wolfgirl offered with a grin. Was it really a good idea to continue on forward?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolfgirl held up her left foot to her face, showing off her impressive flexibility \"and damn, my feet have gotten dirty already... but you  knew that didn't you Human?\" The Wolfgirl wiggled her toes teasing you as her grin grew larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that she was one of the monsters you left the village to fight didn't really matter to you... I mean not all Monsters are bad right? All that time training for this... would be wasted. The Big Bad Wolf proved somewhat trustworthy so far and she's seems very strong. Not to mention I should maybe help her more if I can with her stuff and giving her a couple more... <i>foot massages</i>, I mean she did save my life...</span></div></div>",

She was right, and maybe it was better to be enslaved by a monster girl who would actually care for you in some way, rather than living as little more than a foot rug to a crueler and nastier monster girl. Because you both knew you have no hope fighting monster girls if you are so weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down behind your mistress and admired her. She had a rather attractive figure that was surprisingly human-like. She had skin the colour of dark grey. Her legs looked particularly smooth and well cared for. Her feet however seemed to have regained all the dirt you put so much effort into removing. They also filled the air with a stale cheese smell. This time however, you didn\u2019t mind the smell, and even liked it a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on your back, just in front of your mistress\u2019s feet and gaze into the stars. It wasn\u2019t far from morning time. As it grew lighter and lighter, you decided you were going to make some food. It didn\u2019t take long at all to find food, the area you were in had an abundance of wildlife and plants. You managed to catch 3 rabbits with a small spell you studied when you were younger. When you returned to the camp the sun was just starting to rise. The imp girl was still fast asleep, so you wasted no time in preparing the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were dishing the food up, you saw your mistress starting to wake up. <br>\r\n\u201cGood morning mistress! I made some food for us! I hope you like it\u201d You said in a chirpy voice. The imp girl replied in a Smokey and tired voice \u201cOh, morning Mary. Oh, you made food? Thank you, how nice of you!\u201d You were taken aback by her kindness, you expected to be addressed as \u2018slave\u2019! On that note, how did she know your name was Mary?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you had breakfast, you could\u2019ve sworn the imp girl completely forgot she enslaved you, she was treating you like a child, but in a nice way. When you both finished breakfast she said<br>\r\n\u201cSo Mary, Let\u2019s talk about your new life. I\u2019m very pleased that you didn\u2019t try to escape, but you\u2019re still my slave. Firstly, at the end of each day you will make sure my feet are spotless. If I\u2019m in a good mood I might even reward you!\u201d She then points to her pussy. \u201cSecondly, if I bring back a male, then you will both be slaves to me. One day I might make one of you a slave to the other however.\u201d The rest of the points she made were your duties while she was away<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes the imp girl remain to be kind to you and almost treat you like a person for the rest of your life, or does she return to her sadistic demeanor and abuse you as any monster girl should?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One evening as you were lapping up the toejam that had gathered on your imp mistress' perfect foot the sound of metal clanking startled you. You looked up at your mistress and saw no signs of distress on her face. Had she not heard? She may have easily crushed a weakling like you but if a real adventurer came by an imp generally stood no chance. Should you tell her? Before you could decide the adventurer arrived in the clearing you were in, sword drawn and ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are! I knew those were imp tracks on the road. You must be the one attacking travellers around here! Oh and I see you have one at your feet already. That makes it easier for me to decide to kill you!\" said the female adventurer. She was wearing basic leather armour and wielded an old-looking sword. Her face was plain with a few freckles dotted around. She had long, auburn hair tied up into twintails. When you said a real adventurer could beat an imp, this wasn't the image of a real adventurer you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. Another girl? I don't need another whore at my feet, so I suppose I'll get rid of you in a different way.\" muttered your imp queen. <br>\r\nShe retracted her foot from your mouth and stood up, coating the now clean sole and toes in dust and muck again. You'd be slurping that all off again later. You didn't mind - your mistress was the only one who truly cared for you any more. <br>\r\nThe other girl charged forward, swinging her sword wildly like an amateur. Your mistress flapped her little wings and hopped back, dodging easily. Another attack came but this time the imp ducked beneath the far-too-high swing and tripped the adventurer, who fell face first into the dirt. Your mistress then stood on her back and planted a foot on the back of the adventurers head, crushing it into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic weakling. I think even my dear toe slave here put up more of a fight!\" declared your mistress. <br>\r\n\"Nngh! Get your disgusting foot off of me! I am Laura, the proud daughter of the noble house Lareal! I won't allow myself to lose to an imp.\" shouted Laura, the adventurer.<br>\r\n\"And I am Shaelar, a random imp girl, so what? Hahaha! Darling you've already lost. Once I get a bitch like you beneath my foot it's all over.\" retorted your mistress. \"Just because you're such an uptight little whore, I think I'll use the forbidden imp magic. Just for you~\"<br>\r\n\"Forbidden imp magic? What's that? Please! Don't do anything to me, I'm sorry!\" cried Laura. <br>\r\n\"It's too late for apologies princess. You should've realised something like this might happen when you tried to attack someone in the monster girl empire! We've all got some hidden magic we're not 'supposed' to use.\" replied the imp girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched with awe at the power of your mistress. She had instantly crushed this girl beneath her foot and was now further humiliating her. Was this what had happened to you? You thought you had resisted better than this and yet not two minutes ago you were eating toejam so probably not. Suddenly, a dark energy began to wrap around your mistress' feet. First the left one stood on Laura's back, then the right one planted on the back of her head. After forming up it began leaking off in great amounts, covering the surrounding area with some evil miasma. <br>\r\n\"We call it the Shrinking Stink. I think you can guess what it does. Oh, slave?\" she addressed you. \"If you want to remain my foot slut and not become a bug to be crushed I'd suggest you don't breathe in for the next 20 seconds.\"<br>\r\nYou held your breathe immediately. Laura was not so lucky. You could see her lungs deflating from your mistress bouncing on her back with one foot and she was forced to inhale the sickly air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please! I'll do anything! I'll clean your feet, I'll lick your shoes, anything!\" begged the adventurer as her body started shrinking.<br>\r\n\"Sorry babe, I've already got a little whore to do that for me, hehe! You're just fuel for my feet now!\" laughed the imp girl.<br>\r\nThe adventurer shrunk at a rapid pace. She was around five foot at the start but within seconds she lay at only a foot tall. After only 15 seconds she was an inch high, barely visible from your range. The four foot imp girl now towered over her. <br>\r\n\"Say goodbye little girl. Whenever I use that spell anything I crush with it increased the stench of my feet by a factor of ten! So my dear slave here will have even more fun!\" taunted your mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imp girl's now colossal foot raised up above the tiny adventurer girl. To her it must've looked like a God was about to stomp her but in reality it was just a lowly imp. The foot descended quickly, and a soft thud signified the death of your only salvation. And yet for some reason, you weren't sad about it. Maybe you had come to love your imp queen's feet? She twisted her sole into the ground, making sure she had thoroughly ended the life of that loser adventurer before turning to you with a grin. What was about to happen?</span></div></div>",

You had thought her to be a harsh but fair mistress before this but something about her now terrified you. Perhaps it was seeing her crush another human beneath her feet or maybe you were finally snapping out of your slavery. You turned to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSprinting away as fast as you could you looked over your shoulder to see your progress. What?! Shaelar was even closer than before and seemed to be a bit bigger as well. That had to be a trick of your mind, right? She had just displayed overwhelming dominance so you saw her as bigger, you reasoned. The sprint continued and you peered back after ten or so seconds of running, only to see a gigantic foot slamming into the ground just behind you. The force of the impact sent you flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! I warned you of the power of my foot miasma, didn't I slave? Yet still you breathed it in. You must be eager to serve my feet in both this life and the next one, hm?\" laughed the imp girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mistress was now fifty times your size, looking down on you like a human would to an ant. Her succulent, pungent feet were placed a short distance in front of you - the same feet that were most likely going to end your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How shall I crush this one then? It would be boring to just smother you beneath my dirty sole like I did with that other loser. Since I'm a kind mistress and you did do a good job licking up all that caked on dirt and grime I'll allow you to choose how you die. There's two choices: I put you between my toes and clench them repeatedly, crushing you between them, or I place you in my ankle boots and stomp you into their leathery insole. Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished her explanation before lifting her massive foot up, letting it block your vision and assail your mind with it's now even more putrid stench. Toes or boot. What would you choose?</span></div></div>",

At least you would die in the most attractive part of her foot. That was something at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice slave. My toes are simply to die for, aren't they? Hahahaha!\" giggled the imp girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer enormous foot descended upon you, bathing you in more of it's grimy stink before pinching your body between her big and second toe and lifting you up. The pressure you felt from these giant appendages instantly knocked the air out of your lungs and all breathes you took after were just lungfuls of the stale air seeping from the seemingly endless amount of toejam this imp girl had. Bits of lint, dead skin, dust and muck were gathered in the toes you had just been cleaning a few minutes prior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you finding my toes? I know that they can get a little ripe, especially because I never bother cleaning them. I wouldn't worry about it - your stay is going to be a short one!\" declared your mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished, you felt your body contort in unnatural ways as Shaelar flexed her lengthy toes, dragging you along with them. Horrendous pain wracked your side as several ribs cracked and one of your arms was dislocated by the strange movement. The pain lessened as the flex ended before the foot stomped down to the ground, shattering your legs beneath the imp girl's proportionally huge weight. Maybe an instant death in the sole of her boot would've been better than this agony? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you survived that?! You might be the most resilient tiny I've ever made! Sadly my feet still need their stink fuel so this is the end for you darling. Bye bye!\" said Shaelar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the imp girl dropped your mangled, barely alive body to the ground. There, she lined up her big toenail with your body and the ground before ramming her foot forward with great speed. After the excruciating impact all your could feel was pressure from above and below. She had wedged your body between her toe and nail. This was where your life was going to end. You were supposed to be a hero! You were going to take down the monster girl empire! But this is as far as you could go - becoming a lowly piece of toejam to a lowly imp girl. You could hear laughter as your body gave way to the indomitable pressure of your mistress' dirty toenail. The last thing you smelled in your short life were the filthy toes of your tormentor and killer. </span></div></div>",

You pointed at the shoes lying nearby and the imp girl laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! So you want to die surrounded by my pungent foot stink that's festered in those boots for hundreds of years? Fine by me!\" said your mistress. Maybe this wasn't such a good choice after all. Did she say hundreds of years?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo dainty fingers topped by long, feminine nails reached down and pinched you between them, lifting you what felt like dozens of metres into the air. Shaelar carried you over to your coffin - her pair of black ankle boots. As you approached you got a better look at the shoes of a foot-worship obsessed imp girl and nearly retched from the scent they were leaking. It smelled like someone had poured concentrated vinegar onto old leather for a hundred years! You tried to squirm free, to escape that hell, but your mistress had an vice-like grip on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry honey, you chose the boots! You could've let these gorgeous toes end your life but I guess you'd rather drown in my stench.\" explained Shaelar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imp girl started lowering you into her right boot. You could see the tattered remains of the insole within, melted from years of acrid foot sweat pouring onto it and withering it away. The 'floor' of the boot was covered in dirt, grime, muck and lots of toejam - clearly the imp girl didn't wash her feet unless she had a slave like you to do it with their tongue. She hovered you a few body lengths from the sole of the boot and dropped you, causing you to thump down and sink a little into the squishy, dirty insole. Your back was now covered in specks of lint and toejam. What a pathetic end for a supposed hero. Your nose burnt even more with the wretched smell of sweat-seared leather - you could somehow taste it when breathing through your mouth so even that didn't help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice and settled down there, slave?\" asked the imp girl. \"Good. Because my foot is about to end your meaningless life, hehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you saw only a massive purplish-grey foot descending towards you. Her long, tasty toes wiggled in anticipation as the foot approached. The toes arrived first, soaring over your head and down toward the other end of the boot, bringing with them their characteristic stench. The rest of the foot followed before your true killer arrived: the heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaelar's feet were naturally petite given her impish nature, while her toes were long and her arch high. Her heel however, was rounded and meaty, perfect for stomping on the faces or entire bodies of weakling humans like you. It moved down slowly, as if she was teasing you moments before your death. Eventually the large, powerful heel made contact, slathering sweat and grime all over your worthless face. You crumpled nearly instantly beneath the immense pressure put on you by the imp girl, being squashed down into the filthy, melted insole of her boot. The force of the heel knocked the air out of you and when you tried to breathe again, you found no air could enter. Shaelar was going to suffocate you in her boot beneath her meaty heel. What a sad ending to your sad tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive seconds passed without air. Ten. You licked meekly at the dominant foot choking you of your life force. That did nothing. The imp girl had already passed judgement - you were to die beneath this foot. Fifteen seconds under her heel went by. The same amount of time the miasma had taken to shrink you to this size. You gave one final kiss to this divine foot before the darkness took you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero of the human world had died, suffocated beneath the stinky foot of a 'weakling imp girl' only to become another speck of dirt in her filthy boot. </span></div></div>",

I was really hoping it'd be a man, they're so yummy... but I'm so thirsty! I guess beggars can't be choosers, heehee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your sword and shout towards her. \"Halt!

I guess girls are just as wet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime girl is surprisingly nimble! You notice the slimy footprints left in her wake as she quickly closes the gap between the two of you.

You shove your hands into her breasts in an effort to push her off, but rather than making contact with the jiggling bags, your arms go straight through them! Not only that, you can no longer pull them out, leaving you trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for a little pick-me-up! Show me what's behind those plump, juicy lips...\" With little more than a wink, the slime girl lowers her head onto yours. A thick, slimy tongue-like appendage protrudes from her mouth and, despite your best efforts, easily pokes through your lips. You gasp as you feel the appendage run across your tongue. It's soft, moist, and surprisingly warm. The slime girl moans and her eyes flutter shut as she continues her wicked kiss. Meanwhile, you struggle to breathe. The appendage explores every crevice of your mouth, desperately searching for any saliva. You gag when the appendage strays a tad too close to your throat, but thankfully, it halts its advances there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, the appendage finally retracts into the slime girl's mouth, leaving you gasping for breath. \"Mmmmm, delicious! You sure do give some yummy kisses, miss! That was a good start, but I'm interested in something <i>way</i> wetter and <i>way</i> tastier...\" The slime girl's arm stretches along your side, out of sight. Suddenly, you feel a wet digit caress the outer folds of your vagina! You involuntarily release a high-pitched squeal, causing the slime girl to giggle. \"Yep, this is <i>just</i> what I'm looking for! This one's gonna feed me real good!\" Without warning, the slime girl slams her entire hand in your vagina, filling up the entire orifice! You scream out in pain as your labia is quickly stretched to capacity. The slime girl's tentacle-like arm throbs within, sending waves of pain and pleasure throughout your entire body. The arm takes a steady pumping motion, pushing your labido to its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin moaning, and your mouth hangs wide open. The slime girl takes notice of this behavior. \"See, isn't this nice? I get my moisture, you get a good fucking, everybody wins!\" The slime girl sticks her toes in your mouth, which you slobber on greedily. \"There you go, give some more of that moisture to my feet, they need it too, you know?\" The slime girl's toes were dirty, sticky, and quite obviously slimy, but you didn't care at this point. The assault on your vagina has left you unable to think straight. You slide your tongue between her sweaty toes, and take her sweaty heel into your mouth, stretching out your upper lips just as your lower ones were. You achieve orgasm multiple times, each one feeling as pleasurable as the last. The slime girl has no intention of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the slime girl drains copious amounts of fluid from your body, your consciousness begins to fade. After all, it's only natural to pass out due to losing an unnatural amount of fluids. As your eyes flutter shut, the slime girl picks you up, cradles you in her arms, and saunters off to an unknown location. You can't tell if it was due to a hallucination, but you could swear that...</span></div></div>",

The slime girl had drained you of your fluids as well as your mass!  You weren't a shrunken tiny bug by any means, in fact you would be recognizable to other people as a regular human, only one very very short.  Prior to your encounter with the slime you were a good 5 1/2 feet tall.  Now you barely topped four feet!  You whimper and the slime girl giggles and then the last of your energy faded and you slipped into unconsciousness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon awakening you find yourself in a cave.  Your slumped against the wall and in the room you see bubbling water, some sort of natural hot spring based on the steam.  You also see bones, quite a few bones.  What disturbed you was that either this slim girl preyed on children or the people she abducted and brought here would be shrunk to very small sized people.  You weren't bond but you felt incredibly weak and your lips were quite parched.  You felt dry as a bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime girl noticed you and slid on over.  \"Ahh is my little pet awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dry swallow and cough a bit.  She giggles at you.  \"Ooh I bet you are a bit thirsty.  Well I have a cup and the water will feel nice, its a bit warm though.  But only if you cooperate my dear.  It is fun to play rough every now and then but right now I want to relax and prop my feet up on your face while you lovingly lick every inch of them.

She proved herself stronger than you when you were at your full height, how could you possibly hope to take her when your head only comes up to her breasts. You begrudgingly get down on your hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime girl giggles and slides you the cup of water. \"Here you go, sweetie! I want to make sure your mouth is nice and moist before it tends to my pretty little feet.\" You greedily slurp up the water, draining the cup in just under five seconds. When you put the cup down, you're immediately greeted by the sight of two slimy feet, mere inches from your face. \"Ready or not, pet, here come my feetsies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan in discomfort as the slime girl's feet press into your face. The feet were big enough to cover your face at your previous size, but at this one, a single sole is more than enough to cover you. Additionally, they were a bit dirtier than before, due to the slime girl carrying you. You hesitantly part your lips, allowing her slimy, filthy toes to enter your mouth. Only 2 or 3 toes can fit in your mouth at once due to your decreased size. You suck on the toes, gagging as the warm slime slithers across your tongue. The slime girl leans back, her arms behind her head. \"Ahhhhh, good girl. You like those toes, huh? Ooooooh, I can't wait to break you properly until you're begging for my feet! This is gonna be so much <i>fun!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disagree, but it's not like you could tell her that with your mouth being occupied by toes. It's not like she cares, anyways. She slowly pulls her toes out of her mouth, making a tiny \"pop\" sound as her big toe withdraws. The slime girl then presents her soles to you, dripping with both saliva and her own natural slime. You stick at your tongue and poke at her left heel. The squishy texture and foul taste make you want to recoil, but you don't. Instead, you drag your tongue across the remainder of her foot, up her arch, ball, and finally, her wiggling toes. The slime girl moans in delight as your wet tongue cleans some of the dirt from her nasty foot. \"Mmmmm, GOOD girl! I looooooove getting a good tongue bath like that...\" You shudder. You HATE licking the foot of your mortal enemy, but something about being praised for it makes you feel funny on the inside. You try not to dwell on it too long and continue lapping at the dripping blue feet before you.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't long before you could also feel the smell of alcohol coming from her... there was no doubt, it was a red oni.

Still, better try that than nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! Can't we solve it in a different way?

Now you are speaking my language!\" The oni said in her growly voice, while suddenly starting to grin, showing rather impressive sharp fangs she had... oni sure liked their booze it seems, though after a moment the red woman continued \"You seem like a lightweight, should be easy win to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I win, you will let me go?\" You ask, just to make sure<br>\r\n\"Sure, you also get to take all the treasure I gathered in this cave. I wouldn't be so eager if I were you girlie, I never lost a drinking contest to a human yet! So you better get ready for the upcoming year!\" The oni said standing before you, and taking a swig out of a small bottle she had attached to her belt<br>\r\n\"Get ready for the year?\" You ask confused, not sure what the oni meant<br>\r\n\"You challenged me without knowing the rules? You really are a dumb one, aren't ya? When human and oni get into drinking contest, oni bets the ownership of her stuff, while human bets his or her freedom for the next year. To put it simply for ya, you are gonna be my slave.\" The oni said, looking at you and still grinning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it wasn't such a good idea after all... it's too late to go back on your words now though. You can try to just flee of course, but if the oni catches you then, you can be sure it's gonna end up even worse for you than if you just stayed quiet earlier.</span></div></div>",

Glancing at the various glass bottles strapped around the meagre belt that befitted her groin area, you gulped and felt your heart beat faster than a drum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though sensing your anxiety, the humanoid monster girl cocked her head to one side, a grin plastered over her lips. \"Human wanna give up now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" You yelped, trying your best to stay calm as she poured an amber-tinted liquid into two vessels which were joined onto the bottle she pulled out. Whatever the drink was, it looked - and smelled - strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. We take turns. I go first - I drain this cup. Then you do the same,\" the monster girl stated matter-of-factly, before promptly downing her drink in several seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring agape at her, you took a few moments to compose yourself. \"Sure...\" You muttered before taking the proffered cup and pulling it towards your mouth. Before you even drank it, you could smell how strong and powerful the alcoholic drink was. The moment it passed through your lips, it took a considerable effort not to choke and splutter. Gazing your rival in the eye, you tried to ignore the smug and knowing look about her. After a good five seconds or so, you finished the drink, putting the empty cup on the top of your head to prove that it was completed. Trying your best not to wretch, you kept the drink down. It tasted like whiskey, only more potent and with some other flavour like cloves mixed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One drink each,\" the red oni said, flicking her long white hair back, as if you needed to know the scores! She did not look in the slightest bit concerned; in fact, while you were catching your breath, she promptly filled and drained her second cup of the amber liquid. \"Ahhh...that hit the spot....\" She quickly re-filled the cup she had just drank from, flexing her powerful muscles, even though you still had an empty one in your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK...give me a moment...\" You gulped before swapping cups and gingerly raising the glass towards your mouth.<i> Nothing else for it...</i> \"Done!\" you cried out, proud that you were able to complete the drink quicker than the first time, despite the fact that the strong alcoholic beverage was burning the back of your throat. \"Next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red oni chuckled. \"Oh, little one. What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary,\" you replied, feeling the effects of the drink and hiccuping a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mary, cheers!\" The monster girl grinned before filling up another cup and draining it in an instant. Passing you another full drink, she gave you a knowing look. It was clear that defeat was never even an option for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the third drink, you found yourself gasping for air and feeling dizzy. After the fourth and fifth, you knew that you were struggling badly. The red oni chuckled as she completed her sixth drink, letting out a satisfied smack of the lips. \"Humans - weak. Onis - we strong and always win drinking contest. Or any contest! You give up, weakling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head weakly and hiccuping even louder, you accepted the freshly poured drink and tossed it down your throat, even though it took two attempts. The red oni scoffed at this and sighed with a mixture of pity and triumph as you finally dropped to your knees, defeat and capitulation washing over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" You whimpered. \"P-please....no more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I win?\" The oni chuckled, staring down at you, hands on her hips and a sneer plastered over her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use. The idea of outdrinking this monster girl was a terrible, terrible mistake. She wasn't even remotely drunk, while you felt as though you could vomit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...you...w-win...\" you murmured weakly, still on your knees and swaying a little from side to side such was your inebriation. The red oni laughed even louder after you let out a loud belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So pathetic. You had chance of winning my stuff...\" She gestured at her treasure. \"But you lost. Now you will be my slave. For a year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole year...the idea of it made you nauseous, or perhaps that was the alcohol! Either way, you promptly vomited all over the floor of the cave while the red oni shook her head in disdain. \"Come, slave. What shall we start with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did the red oni decide to break you in as her slave?</span></div></div>",

As a former priestess, you felt more inclined to take the intellectual, as opposed to the military, route. Unfortunately, any books and writings that could have assisted you in your journey had burned down with the temple. If you truly wanted to learn more about the monster girl empire, there was only one place left to go: the Oracle of Moorwynne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had visited the Oracle once before. But that had been many years ago, long before the monster girls started roaming the eastern paths. You left for the shore at early hours of sunrise, hoping to arrive at the nearest town to your destination before nightfall. Throughout the day, the roads remain completely deserted, the constant chirping of the birds the only thing keeping you company. However, as you drew closer and closer to the sea, you couldn't help but feel slightly nervous. You had a sense that your quest wouldn't be all sunshine and rainbows for much longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fears were soon confirmed, as you reached the top of a tall hill and the grey waters of the Trovahl River suddenly emerged over the horizon, no more than a two or three hundred yards away. Connecting the two banks, there was a long stone bridge. And sitting on your end of the path was a giant female troll, sound asleep and making the earth shake with her loud snores. But worst of everything, even all the way up the hill, you could smell her horrible foot stench, carried away in the wind! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was unmistakably disgusting, and quickly had you looking every which way for an alternative, less gut-wrenching, path. Unfortunately, you knew quite well the Trovahl went on for miles in either direction, and crossing it there was the only way to reach Moorwynne before sunset. The only real option to going over the bridge was to swim across. And granted, the waters were fairly calm and safe in that stretch of the river. You could probably reach the other bank in a few minutes, in fact. But that part of Trovahl was also known for... sinister, reasons. It was long rumoured to be home of twisted mermaids, hiding in the undercurrent, ready to prey on hapless swimmers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't really looking forward to testing the validity of those rumours, and more than a bit hesitant to take to the dark green waters. On the other hand, just a couple more whiffs of the she-troll's distant foot fumes almost made you feel like you would be better off swimming with the mermaids. Whatever the case, you had to make your mind up fast. The sun wouldn't stop for you and, if anything, you were pretty damn sure you didn't want to spend the night in the wilds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what do you do?</span></div></div>",

You didn't really expect to face a troll in the first day of your mission... in the best case scenario, you would manage to sneak past the she-beast. And if that failed, at least you would have the chance to defend yourself. You tried to hold that in your mind, as you cautiously walked toward the sleeping monster girl, one hand grasping your sword, and the other holding your nose tightly shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature was clearly in deep slumber, unleashing loud snores every few seconds, and this gave you the opportunity to look at her more closely. In many ways, she matched the mythological stereotype of a troll: big, muscular, dumb-looking and obviously, very, very stinky... Her entire body was covered in sweat and filth, the kind that made your stomach churn every time you stopped a small insect crawl across her greyish skin. Her tusks very nearly avoided growing moss and her hair was twisted into a black, oily mess. Her body hair was probably a paradise for lice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none of those things could match the horror, the disgust, the hatred you felt staring at her feet. 'Feet'! You even hesitate to call those pinkish pads on the end of her massive legs 'feet'. Her soles were covered in dust and sweat, more so than any other part of her body, but that wasn't the worst thing about them... as the troll girl gently wiggled her toes in her sleep, you could see a stream of jam oozing from the filthy crevices, and literally feel the vinegary stench coming off of them and hitting your skin. The toxic foot fumes made your eyes water, and it was enough for a bit of toe-polluted air to slip into your nostrils, to make your lungs ache and spasm under the effort of silently coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple more seconds in the presence of the disgusting troll, and you felt like throwing up. In an effort to prevent an involuntary personal protein spill, you tried to tiptoe past the monster girl as fast as you possibly could. But in your haste, you had neglected to see the pool of sweat accumulated at the creature's feet, and as soon as your boots touched the ground beside her, you lost your balance, falling to the ground with a loud thud from your shield and clang from your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you gained consciousness of what had just happened, a loud, guttural voice suddenly echoed behind you: \"HU-MAN!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart pounded furiously when you turned around to see the troll girl standing over you, her eyes burning with anger as she furiously shouted in your face: \"BAD HU-MAN! HUMAN TRY CROSS BRIDGE AND NO PAY BRIDGE TAX! HU-MAN! YOU PAY BRIDGE TAX!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a sudden impetus of courage, you managed to regain control of your muscles and jump back on your feet. You stand before the angry monster, one hand reaching for your sword and, halfway between an escaping and a fighting stance, you quickly decide your course of action.</span></div></div>",

On your way, you meet some people whom you ask for directions, to make sure you are going the right way, and by the end of the day, as the sun is already starting to set, you find yourself in front of the gates to Hayato village. The whole place is surrounded by a wooden palisade, and looks slightly more like a small fortress than a typical village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's only one guard standing in front of it. From her red scaly tail, wings, as well as some other scale-looking fragments of her skin, you can easily guess that she is a dragon girl. You also notice that her feet, clad in open-toed leather boots are actually looking quite a lot like normal human's, with the exception being long red claw-like nails, from what you could read in a book about dragon girls once, they are among the monsters with most varied balance between human-like and monster-like parts, some just have dragon tail and horns, while others can look almost completely like a dragon and even be quadrupedal. The dragon girl guard also has long red hair, complimenting the color of the scales, and is wielding a rather dangerous looking giant sword. Her armor is made of leather similar to her boots, and rather skimpy, seeming to be there more to just cover her nudity, rather than offer any actual protection.<br>\r\nShe seems to have noticed your staring, as you soon realize she is looking straight at you with her yellow colored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? State your business now!\" She says in a rather threatening way<br>\r\n\"Um... My name is Mary, and I would like to speak to your leader.\" You reply<br>\r\n\"Is Lady Shinra expecting you?\" Asked the dragon<br>\r\nShinra must be the name of that kitsune who was former general of Monster Queen.<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so...\" You reply honestly, lying to someone holding a giant sword like hers is definitely a bad idea<br>\r\n\"And you expect me to just let you in like that?\" Says the dragon girl slightly mockingly<br>\r\n\"Isn't this village supposed to be coexisting with humans?\" You ask<br>\r\n\"Yes it is, however there recently have been some instances of humans wanting to play some kind of monster hunters. They were getting into the village and causing a mess, which is why Lady Shinra temporarily forbidden entrance to everyone aside from merchants. And you don't look like a merchant to me.\" Explained the dragon girl<br>\r\n\"But I need to talk to her! I need her help to defeat the Monster Queen!\" You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The dragon girl looked completely baffled by your statement just now<br>\r\n\"I need her help to defeat the Monster Queen!\" You say again<br>\r\n\"You... defeat the Monster Queen?\" The dragon girl repeats after you, as if still processing what you just said, and right after that her expression becomes that of barely held back laughter<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! That's the best thing I heard today! You, with this little toothpick you call a sword, and piece of wood you call a shield... defeating Monster Queen? Buahahahaaha!\" The dragon laughs mockingly at you<br>\r\nYou can't help but look at her with mix of embarassment and annoyance, while she is clearly having good time making fun of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, I can't wait to tell the others...\" The dragon finally says once she stops laughing<br>\r\n\"So, can I get inside?\" You ask slightly annoyed<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, you made my day just now, so how about we strike a deal.\" Said the dragon girl<br>\r\n\"What deal?\" You ask<br>\r\n\"Standing here all day made my feet hurt a bit, I could use someone to give me a nice foot rub, and perhaps a little cleaning from all the sweat I got on them. If you do that for me, I am gonna let you in.\" Says the dragon girl<br>\r\nYou have a bad feeling about what she might mean about cleaning the sweat from them... and you never gave a foot rub before in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there any other way?\" You ask<br>\r\n\"Well, if you think that you are strong enough to take on Monster Queen, why don't you show me your skills? If you manage to beat me, I will let you in! I wouldn't suggest that though, I never met a human who could beat me yet. If you don't like any of those options though, then you have to turn back and leave.\" Says the dragon girl, seeming to be bragging a bit, and clearly not believing in your skills in the slightest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to think, and ultimately decide to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite the outside looking like a fortress, the inside looked pretty much like a regular village, with houses, and some public buildings like an inn, general store and blacksmith. Only one of the buildings clearly stood out compared to the rest, it was a slightly tower-like structure with strangely curved roofs on each floor.<br>\r\n\"Lady Shinra's little palace sure stands out in there, huh? She had it built according to some traditions from her homeland in the east, most kitsunes apparently come from there.\" Said the dragon girl noticing your staring at the palace<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards the dragon girl motioned to a nearby standing girl with a bow to come closer.<br>\r\n\"Yes, captain Aria?\" She said, upon closer inspection you concluded that she probably was a wood elf, judging from her blonde hair and sharp-ended large ears.<br>\r\n\"I will be going to my office to check this merchant's papers. Stand guard before the gate while I am gone, and don't let anyone in, understood?\" Said the dragon girl, now revealed to be named Aria<br>\r\n\"As you wish captain! All tresspassers will get an arrow in the face!\" Said the wood elf girl<br>\r\n\"No arrows in the face, just tell them to come later or wait.\" Said the dragon girl, clearly wanting to cool down elf's enthusiasm a bit<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Said the wood elf, saluting to Aria and leaving to stand guard in front of the gate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should you really leave someone like that to guard the gate?\" You decide to ask, seeing how enthusiastic the elf was about shooting trespassers<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, she wouldn't kill anyone... not intentionally at least, she tends to be a bit overly enthusiastic about her guard duty though. No need to waste time talking about that however! I already can't wait for that massage you owe me!\" The dragon girl explained and you two sped up a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she led you to an average sized building that must have been the quarters of the guards in the village, and then into a room that was most probably her office as the guard captain. It was surprisingly modest, composed of just a desk with chairs on both sides, a bed, and a few chests, probably with various belongings.<br>\r\n\"Well then! Foot fetish or not, you promised me that foot rub.\" Said Aria, sitting down on the chair at her desk and propping her feet, still covered in her open-toes leather boots, onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have much choice now, being in middle of monster girl village, with a dragon guard captain in the room on top of that.<br>\r\nYou sit on the chair on opposite site of the desk, and start taking off Aria's boots. Even before finishing that, you can already smell a rather sweaty aroma coming from them...<br>\r\nAria herself in the meantime seems to be looking at you with a mild amusement, waiting for her massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you take off both of dragon girl's boots, and have her bare feet right in front of you. As you seen before, they look remarkably similar to normal human ones, with the exception of red claws instead of normal nails. They are rather clean luckily for you, but are clearly glistening with sweat, probably caused by her having to stand in hot sun for entire day while in leather boots.<br>\r\n\"Ha... Nice to have those off at last.\" Aria says, and wiggles her clawed toes in front of you<br>\r\nYou take another look at her feet and gulp nervously... you never given a foot rub before, what if you did bad at it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less staring, more rubbing!\" Says Aria in slightly commanding tone<br>\r\nAfter that snaps you back in reality, you finally put your hands on dragon girl's foot... and are a bit surprised. It is slightly wet from sweat as you suspected, but also surprisingly soft... you expected a warrior like her to have rather hardened skin, especially on her feet considering she is probably training a lot. After that initial surprise you start pressing your thumbs into Aria's sole, trying your best to not disappoint her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... not too bad.\" Comments the dragon girl while relaxing on her chair<br>\r\nIt surprises you that it was all it took for her start enjoying it... could it be dragon feet are more sensitive than human?<br>\r\nEither way you kept rubbing the soft sole, with Aria sometimes moaning slightly, as well as wiggling and spreading her clawed toes...<br>\r\nThe sweaty smell also reaches your nose from time to time... while not as bad as you thought it would be, it definitely isn't super pleasant either.<br>\r\nAfter a while you decide to switch to Aria's other foot<br>\r\n\"You know, maybe instead of trying to defeat Monster Queen, you should become a masseur? You are doing pretty well so far.\"The dragon girl says, you aren't sure whether she is serious or just wants to mock your plan some more, but you just keep up the massage on her other foot while trying to ignore the comment<br>\r\nAs you are in the middle of massaging the other foot however you suddenly feel a light tap from one of Aria's toes on your cheek.<br>\r\n\"Just the rubbing isn't too bad, but aren't you forgetting something? I wanted you to do something about my sweat as well...\" Aria says suddenly, her face is blushing slightly as if the massage actually aroused her a bit<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean? Should I bring a towel maybe?\" You reply nervously<br>\r\n\"Geez, are you dense or something? I was talking about foot worship. Now put that tongue of yours to good use.\" Aria says once again in slightly commanding one(She must be used to commandeering others... being captain of guards after all), deciding to be direct with you, as her free foot is touching the side of your face now, without a doubt leaving some of the sweat on it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The taste is salty from sweat... but somehow you don't dislike it.<br>\r\n\"Haa... that sure is nice... haven't had anyone lick my feet ever since I followed Lady Shinra after she decided to betray Monster Queen.\" Aria says seeming to have enjoyed the feeling of your tongue on her foot<br>\r\nYou would like to reply, but the strange mix of embarrassment and arousal you feel makes you decide to instead just keep licking the soft foot before you, while still using your hands to massage the other<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got into it rather quickly. Could it be you really have a foot fetish?\" Aria asked suddenly<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think so! It's just that...\" You say, but stop yourself, realizing you are too aroused to think of any legit excuse<br>\r\n\"Just what?\" Aria asks, her tone shifting to more commanding one again<br>\r\n\"They are just really soft and pretty!\" You almost yell out in response<br>\r\nAria didn't seem to expect your reply to be like that, as you notice a quite visible blush on her cheeks, almost same color as her scales.<br>\r\n\"Okay... continue...\" Said the dragon girl after a while, still blushing for some reason<br>\r\nShe actually looked kinda cute when like this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceeded to cover almost entire sole of Aria's foot in your saliva before moving on to licking her clawed toes. You had to be rather careful there, since her claws seemed rather sharp, but Aria seemed to be enjoying it the most with your tongue her her toes as her moans visibly intensified. She still haven't said anything though, which started to worry you a bit.<br>\r\n\"Um... I probably shouldn't have yelled like that before...\" You say in a break from licking between dragon girl's toes<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh no, it's not that... it's just... you see, I am a warrior ever since I was old enough to stand up. I never had anyone call any part of my body pretty, let alone soft. Slaves I had pampering my feet back in service of Monster Queen all hated me, they were subservient, but I could see it in their eyes. But you said it with complete honesty... so I was just surprised I guess.\" Admits Aria<br>\r\nYou smile, seeing how this tough dragon girl actually seems to have a bit of a cute side.<br>\r\n\"Anyway! Back to licking!\" Aria says returning to her commanding tone again, visibly embarrassed by what she just admitted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you about ten minutes, but finally you finish the massage and worship... first foot worship in your life, and surprisingly enjoyable one at that. Aria also seems to have enjoyed herself, judging from her moans during it as well as satisfied expression now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time flew as you were lapping at the dragon girl's soles and before you know it, you heard a loud yawn. Lifting your gead from behind her feet, you noticed that it was already nighttime. How long were you worshipping her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, 'warrior', it's getting late.\" she speaks up as she puts her feet back down. \"Time for bed\" <br>\r\n\"And where should I sleep?\" you ask, unsure if something like a motel or a tavern exists in the village. <br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll be staying with me.\" Aria smiles. \"I might require your services again some time, so it's best to keep you close...\" she chuckles as she puts her sandals back on. \"Come on, by foot!\" she smirks at her own joke as she leads the way out of the office, locking the door adter you exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village looks so peaceful at night, with torches illuminating the streets and walls where several guards patrolled on the lookout for enemies. \"Here we are.\" she exclaimed as you reached a small bungallow, which she proceeded to unlock and enter, with you following her. You noticed that the interior seemed way larger than from the outside. <br>\r\n\"Normally I'd make dinner at this point, but I'm too tired. Feel free to get something yourself if you're hungry\" the dragongirl explained while removing her boots. \"Or have you feasted enough for today?\" she laughed, baring her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed with a weak chuckle \"S-so, where should I sleep?\" The dragongirl raised an eyebrow as she once again leads the way to her bedroom carrying her boots. \"Here's my bed. There's some free space at my feet if you want to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" You nod in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Heh, I think it sounds more than just 'good' to you...\" she teased as she started to undress. Well, truth be told- she wasn't wrong. <br>\r\nYou took off your coat and boots, as well as the several pieces of armor you were wearing underneath, leaving you in your undergarments. As you turned around, you were stunned to find Aria in her birthday suit as she was taking off the last piece of armor she had. A red blush was quickly forming across your cheeks as you stood there staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing, it's nothing, I-I just didn't expect you to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I sleep naked, so what? I'm sorry that I don't have my precious elf-made silk pajamas on me, your majesty...- sue me.\" She replied in an annoyed tone crossing her arms over her bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nono it's just that... uhh... erm...\" you stood dumbfounded, trying to think of an excuse to fit the situation, but the words simply wouldn't come out... \"...y-you're pretty\" you squeezed out.<br>\r\nThinking back about it, you wanted to facepalm- how old are you? Six? <br>\r\nDespite that, it seemed to affect the dragon-girl, sending a light red blush across her cheeks as she furrowed her brows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"....Just shut up and get on the bed, will ya?\" She rolled her eyes as she lifted the sheets and took a seat on top of it, extending her legs as she puts her arms behind her head, slowly flexing her clawed toes as she displays her fit body. Seeing that, you follow up sitting down at her feet. The bed was larger than the the one you had at home, but Aria decided to lay in the middle of it, taking up most of the space- clearly her intention wasn't for you to be lying next to her. You didn't plan to spoon with her anyway...<br>\r\n You got on all fours near the foot of the bed, having just enough space lengthwise. Here you were again, looking down at the dragon's mouthwatering feet lying inches in front of you. You bow down to take a lick of her heel, making it look like you were worshipping a goddess, which made Aria smile and lightly blush, giving her a feeling of power. It's a good thing that she didn't seem to be one of those sadistic, power-hungry lunatics, or this would get to her head real quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon girl watched you with satisfaction as you lapped at her right sole, exploring her soft, silky skin. There was something about her dual-coloured soles that you found irresistible. Just as you were getting into it, you hear her speak up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, this has been fun and all, but I've got to get my sleep, I've got a job, you know...\" she smirks as she tugs at the sheets, throwing it in the air and covering you, along with her lower body and abdomen, leaving her chest, head and arms uncovered. \"....You can continue- not gonna stop you, I just hope you won't get a stomach-ache from all those midnight snacks\" she laughs, tapping your forehead with her clawed toes.<br>\r\n Meanwhile, you were too busy snuggling your face into her warm sole to really pay attention to it, but after 15 minutes, you could feel her breathing and movements calming down, as you were still toying with her tootsies, indicating that the dragon girl has fallen asleep. You decide to lie down as well, with your legs pointing towards the head of the bed as you were nuzzling into her pale arches like a pillow, occasionally taking a sweet lick or nibble on her toe. As you became sleepier, you could feel her position her heel in your salivating mouth, an invitation you whole-heartedly welcomed, suckling on it and swirling your tongue around it as you slowly dozed off to cloud nine, dreaming of the scaly feet in front of you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you slowly drifted off to sleep kissing the bottom of her foot, you could feel Aria's soles gently tap and press into your face. You can't recall ever being cozier in your bed- lying on a decent matress, kept warm by both a woolen blanket and the dragon girl's silky smooth soles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the peaceful atmosphere was broken as a beam of light hit your eyes through a fold in the sheet. Someone must've turned on a candle or lantern. You didn't want to panic- maybe it was Aria who turned on the light to... to read a book, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your train of thought was cut off when you suddenly heard an eerie, deep and long inhale- and it wasn't Aria's.... Unsettled, and not knowing what was going on or what to do, you start scribbling your nails across the sleeping dragon's sole, hoping that would wake her up. What you got as a result was a surprisingly sweet giggle and a kick to the face, making you hold back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe... Someone seems to be dreaming, happy to see me captain?\" You could hear a light feminine voice speaking up- it sounded familiar, for some reason. You could feel the intruder grasping the blanket on your side as she starts to roll it up \"Mmmhmm, the two of us will have some fun tonight, won't weeee-heee?!\" <br>\r\nThe masked figure yelps, stumbling back and falling on her buttocks as you lift the covers and jump off the bed, none of which Aria seems to bother Aria as she's lightly snoring in a seemingly deep sleep. The burglar rolled backwards, jumping to her feet as she extends her left fist towards you while retracting the right to her cheek. <br>\r\n\"B-back off! Or g-get an arrow to the face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice, you knew you heard it before. You take the lantern that was lit on the nightdesk illuminating her face beneath the hood. \"I know you... You're that one hyperactive elf guard!\" you say in a silent voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyperact-?! I'm warning you! Ah, I'll shoot on the count of three! One! T-two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt your head \"....Your hands are empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no  they're not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might not be an owl, but I'm not blind- you're holding onto thin air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... Elf magic! The bow's invisible! Ha!\" she says in a confident tone, as if you would believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here anyway? It can't be stealing, nor an assassination, not from what I have heard underneath the sheets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I was just uh, joking, I- I wanted to see if-\" she stuttered, obviously trying to co.e up with an excuse. At that moment, you could see a familiar leathery object hanging from her belt, near her pouch. Using the elf's temporary distraction and with reflexes of a cobra, you manage to snatch the item from her belt before she could react. Looking at it, you immediately recognise it as Aria's open-toed boot that she took off earlier that night. Suddenly, the heavy breathing, or more specifficaly- inhaling made all the more sense...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable, don't tell me that you actually broke in here to smell her-...\" you were cut off by the wood elf as she swiftly grabbed you, turned you 180\u00b0 around and placed a dagger at your throat. You were being held and groped from behind in your underwear by another girl, while a third, completely naked one is sleeping 4 ft next to you... If it weren't for the dagger and death threats, this would look like one of those weird reoccuring wet dreams you had that made you question your sexuality during your teens...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-listen up! I don't want to unneccessarily shed blood, bu-but I will, if I have to!\" she threatened in a nervous, trembling voice. You believe Aria was right about her- a dog that barks doesn't bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you should keep your voice down, Aria IS still asleep, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? N-no, she's a heavy sleeper. When she's snoring, she could sleep through gunfire...\" she exclaims, assuring to keep you in that position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How do you know that?\" you asked, trying to turn your head towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well I...\" she stopped mid-sentence, her cheeks repeatedly turning red<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless... Unless this isn't the first time you snuck into her home to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the dagger fall to the floor as she turns you around, grabbing you by the collar, pulling you in closer, staring at you with her piercing, ocean blue eyes.<br>\r\n \"Listen amartass! You might think it's funny, but my reputation, rank and job are on the line here! H-how about you forget that you ever saw me, and I-I...\" she tries to think of something as a counter proposal, but couldn't think of anything you could want from her. \"... I-I'll do whatever you want! Yes! I can wash your clothes, my monthly pay, I'll give you my bow- anything, just please, please keep your big, human mouth shut. Y-you can't do this to me! I can't afford to lose it all, again...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begged, loosening her grip and descending from the tips of her toes, showing that she was actually a bit shorter tham you. She's looking at you with pleading eyes as they began to tear up. At this point you actually felt bad for the elf, seeing how desperate she got, you didn't mean to cause her any harm in the first place, but this  was an offer you just couldn't refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Anything, you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Y-yes, anything. Just say it and I'll get to it immediately.\" She answered with a light smile, brushing her tear away, seeing how there is hope to come to a compromise with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there in your un, rubbing your chin as you pondered. What could you possibly ask from the pale-skinned elf, you wonder... Looking at her dirty blonde hair glistening in the candle light, your gaze shifts downwards as you inspect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off- what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Erina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, lifting an eyebrow \"Well then, Erina, how about you...\"</span></div></div>",

Besides it's going to be more fun to worship feet of someone that can react to it.<br>\r\n\"You let me pamper your feet, and I swear I'm not gonna tell anyone.\" You tell the elf girl<br>\r\n\"O-oka... wait what?!\" The elf girl exclaimed accidentally, visibly surprised with your demand<br>\r\n\"You might have noticed I was sleeping at Aria's feet... let's just say I wasn't bothered by the smell, and that you aren't the only one who likes the softness of those dragon soles.\" You say to Erina who still seems surprised by your words, feeling strangely brave to admit that when you had upper hand in the situation<br>\r\n\"S-so... you like feet too?!\" The elf girl clearly wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed if it took her that long to figure that one out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's kinda embarrassing when you say it out loud like that though, even if Aria can't hear us.\" You tell the elf girl<br>\r\n\"W-well then...\" Erina backed down a bit, and sat down on a chair that was in the corner of Aria's bedroom, she then extended one of her feet, although still covered in her boots, towards you<br>\r\n\"T-there... but if you tickle me, I will shoot you in the head!\"Says Erina seeming strangely uneasy... given monster girls' tendency to force people at their feet, you would expect her to be much more confident after you stated the wish to pamper her feet<br>\r\n\"With that magical invisible bow of yours?\" You couldn't help but be slightly snarky as you sat on the floor in front of the elf girl, it's kind of funny how despite being the one sitting lower and being about to worship that girl's feet, it was obvious that you were the one in complete control of the situation.<br>\r\n\"H-hey! I have an actual one too... n-now, could you start already?\" The elf girl says, despite the darkness aside from the soft light of the candle, you are pretty sure she is blushing almost completely red, she definitely isn't used to being in that kind of situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say... is it your first time having someone worship your feet?\" You ask slightly teasingly, as you start undoing first one of the elf girl's boots, they are pretty much like Aria's, only without the opened toe area, probably because elves don't have claw-like nails, so she didn't really need it.<br>\r\n\"Huh?! Of course not! I had hundreds of humans worship my feet already! Thousands even! I think I made about fifty who tried trespassing yesterday lick them clean!\" Says Erina, quite obviously lying<br>\r\n\"Quite impressive, considering that you don't seem to get guard duty outside of the gate like Aria does, and it sure doesn't seem like you are getting 50 people per day around here...\" You say slowly slipping off the first of elf girl's boots, revealing her shapely leg at first, and soon also her beautiful pale bare foot, glistening with sweat even in the pretty dark room, possibly even sweatier than Aria's due to the closed nature of Erina's boots. It's a bit smaller than the dragon girl's feet, but Erina's toes are really long and sexy... just begging to be sucked on and licked inbetween.<br>\r\n\"F-fine! I never had my feet pampered, I'm only 40 years old you know?! I'm barely more than a kid for elf standards! I-In fact I only joined the town guards last week...\" Erina starts making excuses, her toes wiggling slightly in front of you, which unknowningly to the elf girl, looks quite mesmerizing to you<br>\r\nYou knew nothing about how long was lifespan of elves, but in human years Erina looked to be in her early twenties at most<br>\r\n\"Well, I wish I will look half as good as you when I will be your age then.\" You say jokingly, as you stop yourself from staring at the first of elf girl's beautiful feet, and turn your attention to remove the other one of her boots<br>\r\n\"D-don't think compliments will get you anywhere... I can still shoot you in the head later...\" The elf girl mumbles, once again visibly blushing at your implication that she looked good<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you got rid of the second of Erina's boots, both of her beautiful pale elf feet were now in your lap, her toes wiggling nervously from time to time, waiting for you to begin.<br>\r\nIt's kind of cute how she tries to act proud, but doesn't exactly seem to be able to keep it up at all. Without waiting any longer you lift one of Erina's feet, taking a close look to her pale smooth sole, before taking a deep sniff and giving a kiss onto her heel. There's something oddly nice to their taste... it's as if her skin had slight taste of mint to it. You briefly wonder if it's a trait that all forest elves have... at the same time, even your kisses as you go up her sole are enough to feel plenty of saltiness aside from the mintyness, she clearly sweats quite a bit in those boots, not that it bothers you much.<br>\r\n\"To think that elf girl's feet would be more sweaty than dragon's...\" You say, as your kisses reach the ball of Erina's soft foot<br>\r\n\"S-shut up, human... ahya...\" The elf girl says in annoyance, and lets out a sudden cute moan as your kisses reach undersides of her toes<br>\r\n\"Could it be those pretty long toes of yours are your sweet spot?\" You ask with a grin, feeling yourself blushing as well from the arousal caused be the smell, taste and view of elf girl's beautiful feet, and without waiting for an answer turn your kisses into licks and your tongue goes inbetween the wiggling toes of the elf girl<br>\r\n\"Kyah! H-hey don't surprise me like that! I will... I will... kick you with my other foot!\" Elf girl lets out another cute moan when your tongue makes contact with her toes, and gets adorably embarrassed and annoyed by it.<br>\r\n\"I-it feels good though...\" The elf girl adds mumbling quietly while looking away with a blush<br>\r\nHer cute reactions only arouse you further as you lick inbetween the sexy toes, savoring their taste, and enjoying the feeling of other ones tapping on your face when the elf girl wiggles and scrunches them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long before your toe-licking, turns into full on toe-sucking, as you envelop two of Erina's toes in your mouth, lovingly wrapping your tongue around them enjoying the minty sweaty taste of elf girl's skin, making the her let out some more moans of pleasure, she clearly tries her best to keep her composture, but the sensivity of her feet, and probably the fact she smelled Aria's boots before, keeps the elf girl keep getting increasingly aroused as well...</span></div></div>",

As you turn your head, you see a small kitsune standing in them. She has long blonde hair, and her outfit seems like one of nobility of foreign country that you once seen when some foreign diplomats visited the temple back during your practice to become a priestess, her feet had snow white socks on them as well as foreign looking sandals. The kitsune also looks like a young teenager at most, definitely not older than 14 by human standard.<br>\r\n\"L-lady Shinra!\" Exclaims Aria and quickly gets up to salute the kitsune forgetting to even put her boots back on, seeing that you decided to get up as well<br>\r\nYour eyes open wide. You definitely never expected Monster Queen's former general to look like this. You imagined something more along the lines of old grizzled veteran warrior, or a fancy dressed middle aged woman with big breasts... well at least the fancy dressed part you got right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you couldn't hold back anymore from having some human worship your feet?\" The kitsune replies, her voice is rather childish, but her tone definitely has something of dignity to itself<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry! It won't happen again!\" Said the dragon girl<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm not mad, especially since the human seemed to enjoy herself as well.\" Said the kitsune<br>\r\nYou blush at that mention, realizing she must have seen what happened.<br>\r\n\"You've seen everything?!\" Aria says surprised, blushing as well<br>\r\n\"Well it's hard to not see from my quarters that you were leading some human girl to your office. She didn't look like a merchant, but I trust you and know you wouldn't let in some bandit or monster-hating bigot. I was curious nonetheless, so I decided to see what's happening myself.\" Said Lady Shinra<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria, still seemed embarrassed to be caught like that, but also relieved that the kitsune wasn't mad at her. Just then Lady Shinra finally turned directly towards you.<br>\r\n\"But it's rude of me as a host to just ignore you like that. I am Shinra, former general in monster queen army and the one in charge of this village. What do you seek in my village if it was worth agreeing to lick feet of captain of my guard whom you barely met?\" Said the kitsune, despite her young looks, she really gave away an aura of being a wise person<br>\r\n\"Well... I am on a quest to defeat the monster queen. I heard that you were her general, so I hoped you would be able to help me.\" You explained, deciding to not ask about her rather unusually young looks... you had a hunch it was a bad idea<br>\r\n\"Interesting... what made you think that I would help you though? It's true I don't serve Monster Queen anymore, but why would I help you in your quest to do that?\" Said Shinra<br>\r\n\"Because her rule is dangerous to safety of the world! My temple was burned to the ground, and village ransacked by her minions!\" You almost yell out remembering events of your past<br>\r\n\"I understand you anger, but what makes you think that I would endanger myself and everyone in this village to help you in your quest?\" The kitsune asked another question<br>\r\n\"Because... if monster queen isn't stopped, humans and monsters will never be able to live together! I used to be like most humans, thinking monster girls are scary and should be eradicated... but after hearing about your village, and seeing it with my own eyes, I believe there is a chance to live in peace, if you help me then more people would be able to see!\" You explained with determination<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinra suddenly smiles and nods at your words.<br>\r\n\"Your words remind me of someone I used to know...\" She says, with sudden somewhat sad and nostalgic look in her eyes<br>\r\n\"However... with your current equipment and training you would stand no chance. Even weakest soldiers of monster queen would be able to stomp you into the ground, or enslave you.\" Said the kitsune, her expression suddenly becoming serious<br>\r\n\"Then could I train in this village? I am a very fast learner!\" You say with determination<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Shinra seems to be pondering something for a moment...</span></div></div>",

You were surprised that she didn't ask for anything in return, but decided not to pry. With that your training in combat, magic and other disciplines had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">Few months later...</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last few months flew by on hard work preparing yourself to be able to match monster girls from the empire. Aria became your swordfighting teacher as well as sparring partner, Lady Shinra herself started teaching you magic, while the elf you met at the entrance, whose name turned out to be Erina, was training you in sneaking and using a bow. You lived in Aria's house, so that you didn't have to pay for the inn during your stay. From time to time the dragon girl was asking you for foot rubs and foot worships, which you didn't mind too much. Lady Shinra had you give her foot rubs as well, during which she was explaining to you various kinds of magic. Erina was the only one whose feet you haven't seen or touched during that time... not that it was that important to you, just that you heard that all monster girls enjoy having their feet pampered, but Erina didn't seem interested or even try to come up with any excuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up in your bed in the guest room of Aria's house. The dragon girl was probably already gone, she always woke up early to guard the gate and check up on rest of the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow... what were you supposed to do today?</span></div></div>",

I need your training!\" Lady Shinra signaled Aria to leave, and when passing you Aria winked at you and brushed her foot against your leg. You begin to feel very aroused. Lady Shinra hopped onto the desk and crossed her legs, saying nothing but smiling. You drop to your knees, thinking that maybe she will change her mind if you show her how good you can be. \"I'll rub your feet whenever you want, I'll worship them whenever you want! Please Lady Shinra!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Shinra gave a deep giggle, which sent shock waves down your spine when you mentioned worshiping her feet. \"My feet could use a nice rub, I haven't had a good one in a long time\" she told you \"And judging by the way Aria reacted, you seemed to give amazing massages\". You smile, and remove her shoes, revealing surprisingly human feet, though still recognizably belonging to a fox. You start rubbing her feet the same way you did Aria's, while admiring the her feet. Like Aria's, they were also surprisingly soft and smooth. Shinra moaned and leaned back, admiring this girl that was offering to lick her feet for training! \"Hmm, I still am not sure I should let you train here.\" Shinra said, trying to sound serious. You were convinced that she was, and you thought there was only one way to gain access to her training now. You stuck out your tongue as much as you could, and slowly licked her sexy sole from heel to toe. Shinra laughs at you, while you continue to clean her glistening foot from all the sweat. \"Wow, I enjoyed having my feet worshiped before, but this is just amazing\" You say nothing, continuing to lick her foot and suck her toes. You were determined to not stop until she said you could train. You are also uncontrollably aroused, and ready to obey any command Lady Shinra gave you. \"Please Lady Shinra, I will do this everyday for you. I promise to obey EVERY order you give me, and to submit to you completely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You felt honored to have licked her feet, even though you knew how humiliating that was. After her lesson you spent much of the day in your room, studying some basic spell books Shinra gave to you. When it started getting dark you heard Shinra doing something downstairs, so you assumed she was cooking. You put down the books and joined her. You weren't a very good cook yourself, but you thought you could give her some company. After all she was allowing you to stay in her house! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked downstairs and said hello to Shinra, thanking her again for the books. She said it wasn't a problem at all. She looked back at the food she was preparing. You stopped and stared for a bit, admiring her. She was absolutely gorgeous! She had amazingly smooth legs, yet they were so muscular and possessed the most amazing ass you've ever seen. It was normal sized, but firm. Shinra started playing with her own feet, doing a mini dance with her bare foot, treating it like a ballerina doing mini spins. You knew you shouldn't be obsessed with feet so much, but you couldn't help it! You had to appreciate them! You decided the best way to thank Shinra properly for allowing you to stay in her house was to worship her feet each night while she made the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight however, you just knelt down without a word and left a small loving peck on her sole, smiling to Shinra while going back to the table to sit down. Once the food was ready you looked at the meal. You didn't recognize it but it still smelled very delicious. The table you and Shinra sat at was a little higher than you were use to, coming up to the top of your breasts. You could quite clearly see Shinra's feet, and Shinra knew this. During your meal Shinra constantly teased you with her feet. Giving you all sorts of views and giggling when you tried to break away from staring. The meal was delicious. You thanked Shinra and took your plate to the kitchen. When you turned around Shinra wasn't anywhere to be seen! You figured this was another test, so you cautiously approached the table, then the stairs making sure to look everywhere. You also tried to make as little noise as possible. When you approached your room you opened the door slightly then heard a small swishing sound behind you, you quickly turned around and did a scan. You began to slowly walk backwards into your room, however as soon as your head reached the end of the door frame to your room, Shinra jumped down from above, landing on your shoulders with her legs squeezing your throat. You struggled for a bit before falling down and surrendering to your powerful hostess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be constantly on your guard! At any moment a monster girl could sneak up on you, especially in the dark and especially when you're traveling! The moment you allowed me to land on your shoulders was the moment you lost. Were I a real monster girl I would've enslaved you right there!\" You struggled back to your feet, out of breath and promised to try harder. \"I just.. You're too strong! Even if you were to attack me while I'm watching you, you would've beaten me!\" You say with a whiny and defeated voice. \"Then you must engage the enemy using different tactics! Remember, even monster girls are not free from desire! You could lure them into a trap!\" You place your face into your hands, which are resting on your legs and sob a bit. \"Hey, it's alright! You'll get better Mary! Now, you still have unfinished business\". Shinra places her one foot next to you, and you give it a few slow kisses, too weak to give in to proper worship. You say good night to Shinra and tuck yourself in. </span></div></div>",

You ready yourself, feeling confident. The Queen is a lot bigger than you expected, reaching about 3 metres(9.84 feet) high! She also had 4 arms, each wielding their own normal sized swords which looked like daggers in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of staring at each other the Queen charges at you with a speed that doesn't seem possible! You roll out of the way and quickly try to get behind the Queen, but by the time you are on your feet the Queen is already charging at you again! This time she hits you full on and you fly about 5 metres (16.4 feet) backwards. This blow crippled you, and during your flight you let go of your sword sending it flying in the opposite direction. The Queen hastily approaches you, placing one foot on your belly, which covers your entire middle body and starts pushing down. Just as you were starting to pass out the Queen decided to let go, and start laughing. \"You really thought you could just barge in here and defeat me? You didn't even bring friends with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything became fuzzy, you saw images of Shinra slain, and Aria impaled. Lastly you saw yourself enslaved by the Queen!

Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Shinra answered in a totally awake voice, \"Of course Mary! What's wrong?\" You enter, finding Shinra standing by her window looking out. In front of the window were what looked like battle plans, certain strategies and formations. \"I-i just had a strange dream and couldn't get back to sleep. Why are you awake?\" You stutter. You couldn't get the picture of you serving Shinra out of your head and it made you nervous. \"Sometimes I just wake up early. I like this time of the morning, it's so quiet and peaceful. Perfect for thinking about stuff. Although, tonight I'm also awake because of an interesting dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell Shinra about your dream/vision, leaving out the part of you serving her, for now. Shinra seems surprised by your story, stating that she had a similar dream, but not quite the same. Shinra's dream was about defending the village against an attack. In her dream she successfully repelled the attack with minimal casualties. In her dream/vision, this attack fractured the empire causing just under half of the Queen's army to rebel against her. They saw this attack as a betrayal to their own kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Shinra finished explaining her dream/vision you felt something was off. Not with Shinra's dream/vision or yours, but with the whole situation. Firstly, why were you having this visions? Aren't visions suppose to warn you about something? Perhaps the Goddess is warning you that Shinra could become as evil as the Queen now? Or perhaps this vision is warning you of an attack that is coming and that you serving Shinra is just how things will turn out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinra seems confused by your troubled expression and asks you again what's wrong. You decide it's best not to tell her about you serving her in your vision. \"Oh, sorry it's nothing. I was just thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Shinra talk some more about the vision, your training and all sorts of things. All of a sudden your eyes got invaded by a beam of light that almost blinded you. You thought an angel appeared outside the window but just saw the sun rising. Shinra heads downstairs and makes breakfast. You begin your training today, properly.</span></div></div>",

You read quite a bit about them, they are among the best melee fighters in monster queen's army, but at the same time are also known to act independently from the Monster Girl Empire, relationship between their tribes and monster queen being more of a loose alliance of convenience rather than some special loyalty.

You could guess it was plausible given it was getting dark and you were covered in your cloak and dirt... nonetheless most people would probably do more to make sure before making proclamations like that.<br>\r\n\"Yes human, it is my tribe's tradition as a coming of age ritual to go out, find a suitable human male, beat him in one-on-one combat, and then take him as a husband. You should feel honored, you will be my first husband.\" She said, still pointing her sword at you, she didn't seem bothered at the very least about the idea of forcibly taking someone she barely knows and quite possibly having sex with them right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait I...\" You try to explain that you aren't even a male so she can't take you as a husband, however the amazoness interrupts you<br>\r\n\"But enough talk. Have at you!\" The amazoness said as she entered battle stance and started approaching you<br>\r\nThere was obviously no time to explain yourself at the moment, so you quickly drawn your short sword and tried to block and dodge the incoming strike<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only go pale in fear as you saw Amazoness' blade go right through your own sword as if it was butter. In desperation you tried to kick the Amazon away before your little sword broke in two, but your strength in the legs wasn't exactly impressive to the amazoness, who just kicked you herself, causing you to fly backwards and hit a nearby tree! Your sword completely breaks in two upon the impact, as it was barely holding together anyway... your head hurts as well and you aren't sure if you will be able to stay conscious there.</span></div></div>",

The bronze-skinned beauty was slowly putting away her sword while a devious grin appeared on her face. She began to saunter towards you, each muscle in her body flexing as if preparing for a workout. \"As you can see human, your toys are no match for the power of an Amazon! And since I have won, I can now claim my prize....\" With each step Vestra took, you could see a little more of her uncovered feet and just how big she actually was compared to you. Taking your chance with her silence, you attempt to stand up and say. \"I can't be your husband lady....because I'm a female!\" \"And what makes you think I haven't heard that trick before?\" Finding no other choice, you pull off your garments to show her your less than mentionables. The Amazon stops for a moment, glancing at you closely with a cocked eyebrow. Already you regret your decision as you shiver in the wet weather. \"It would seem you are correct. I guess that is what you were attempting to tell me before hand....\" You nod as you covered yourself back up. \"However, you still lost and my culture states you owe me....\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>.....you slowly begin to regain your consciousness, hearing muffled sounds in the background. How long have you been passed out already? You can feel your body being carried over someone's shoulder. Groaning in pain, you slowly open your eyes, your vision still blurry and multiplied. However, you are able to make out what seemed to be a firm, barely covered, human-like behind with a black, barbed wagging tail over it. You then feel two taps on your buttocks \"Rise and shine, sleepyhead! The ceremony is about to begin!\" You can hear a female voice, as you now realise that it was the Amazoness from last night. You shake your head, trying to regain your senses as you see two more female warriors standing right behind your captor. Like your captor, they both had a tail as well as one horn on opposite sides and a wing. One had long crimson red hair, emerald green eyes and a bang partially covering her eye, while the other had jet black hair that was tied in a tail, falling over her shoulder, brown eyes and a dark-blue piece of cloth, wearing it as a mask to cover her mouth. They both had a spiked shoulder pad on opposite shoulders as well as chain mail on said arm, while the opposite one had a strange set of black runes. Their stomachs were unprotected, displaying firm abs. Another piece of bronze armour concealed their hips, while their long, muscular legs remained bare, certain to make even some girls gasp in awe. Finally, their proportionally large feet were clad in a set of sandals, probably due to the rain that was falling the previous night. Finally, you could make out that both of them wielded a sort of heavy two-handed weapon, resembling a pole axe with a larger blade. This was bad... As beautiful as they might seem to the eye, those were dreadful warriors, taught in the arts of combat, and wouldn't show any kind of mercy if- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey, wakey~ Oh this one is sooo cute!\" ......or maybe not. \" Nice catch Vestra!\" The redhead continued, pinching your cheek, before scrubbing it with her thumb \"...A bit dirty, but I'm sure you'll teach him our ways soon enough.\" she chuckled, stepping back. The black haired guard only looked at her before rolling her eyes in silence, earning a surprised look from her comrade \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, thanks! He's not much of a fighter, but a brave one- he stood to fight against all odds. The last two ran away before I was even able to challenge them properly...\" she said, spinning you around her head like a log and catching you in her arms again, craddling you like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realised that you still had to tell her about your identity, before it was too late. \"Uhh... V-Vestra? There is something I really need to tell you. This is all a HUGE misubderstanding. I'm ac-\" Just as you were about to explain your situation, you hear the gates in front of you opening, the bright light of dawn blinding you. As Vestra entered through the gate, you could see you were in, what appeared to be, the city square of the Amazon tribe, with war cries echoing inside the huge walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are genuinely intimidated by the ammount of cheering amazons, covered in warrior paint and runes, putting your 5ft-something height to shame. You try to call out to Vestra, but she doesn't seem to hear you as she is basking in the glory and cheering, followed by her two comrades, carrying you up the stairs of a construction that resembled a small Aztec temple, made out of white marble. As she reaches the center of the square-shaped stage, she turns around to face the guards, slowly lowering you down to the ground next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards lower their pole-axes and step forward, the redhead approaching Vestra with a happy grin, her long hair flailing in the breeze, while the black-haired one followed behind, seemingly only spectating. She measures her fellow Amazoness from head to toe, before kneeling down, helping her lift her tanned leg and grabbing her leather sandal, slowly taking it off as she held her muscular calf and soon enough, revealed her huge size 14 foot, which for some odd reason, made your cheeks blush. You open your mouth to say something, but were quickly muzzled by the hand of the black-haired guard standing next to you. Your \"soon-to-be wife\" rested her hand on herfriend's shoulder as she helped her remove her other piece of footwear as well, wiggling her toes in the fresh air as her comrade chuckled. Reaching for her hips, the guard traced her fingers along a golden string that was holding two purple banners on each side, covering Vestra's bare arse and private, sliding it down to the ground. This was a weird and strangely arousing ritual, indeed... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead stood up again, pulling two small hooks apart on the silver-haired beauty's shoulders as the chest plate fell to the ground with a \"CLANG\". Out of the blue, she then proceeded to place her hands on Vestra's bare chest, cupping her breasts before pulling her in for a hug, embracing her tightly. \"You're now a true Amazoness... Go get him, Ves- make us proud\" To your surprise, even her grumpy dark-haired friend seemed to smile behind her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the two amazon guards walked to the bottom of the small pyramid, as you stood there, looking around and seeing all these eyes glaring at the two of you. Suddenly, Vestra herself approached you with a smile, taking your hood off, and revealing your blonde hair, tied in a tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, my lover. Time to releave you off your garments... she said in a slightly flirty tone, removing your belt with the blade-less swordhandle that she put back, for some reason.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-Vestra, you have to listen to me, you've gpt this all wrong! I can't be your husband! I'm a-\" you were silenced, for the fourth time now, with an index finger placed on your lips, teasingly tracing along them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush there... I know what you have to say. That you think you're not worthy of an Amazoness. But I think otherwise... Now, let me gaze upon your slim, masculine body.\" she says, tugging at your shirt as she slowly raises it. \"Oh... That flat stomach is just adorable...  And that muscular chest of yo-\" she stops in the middle of the sentence, immediately tugging the shirt back down in shock. She soeaks up, half-whispering \"Since when do human males have those?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a deep sigh, now that she finally mentions what you've been trying to say all along \"Oh you didn't know that? Wait till you get my pants off and see the real surprise....\" you sarcastically reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra looks at you in disbelief without a word, before suddenly reaching between your legs, sliding her hand into your pants, causing you to blush heavily and slap her hand away \"I'M A GIR-!\" you didn't manage to finish as Vestra swiftly pressed her lips against yours, leaving you flustered in a french kiss. You barely managed to pull away in shock only to see her looking at you with a concerned expression. \"Listen, it's too late to quit now, we have to go through with this... somehow.\" She explained, not breaking eye-contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into her yellow eyes, seeing that she was serious about this. \"B-But you know I can't be your husband, let alone make love to you! ...not in the traditional way, I mean.\" You say, blushing at the thought of what it would look like if you were to... ahem... \"Can't you just tell them that it was just a silly mix-up? I mean, what's the worst thing that can happen if they find out I'm a girl?\" You ask, looking at the awaiting crowd around you, some of them holding spears with banner flailing in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a second \" Well, I would be labelled a fraud, bringing shame upon myself and family and banished from the tribe. And you'll be put through a  5-year everyday training ritual and injected with demon genes that will most likely break your fragile human body and soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood motionless for a few seconds. \"......M-maybe they don't need to find out after all, don't you agree?...\" you suggest, thinking of alternative options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for Ares's sake... Why couldn't you have just told me about this earlier? We wouldn't be in this much trouble...\" You open your mouth to protest, but decide to stay quiet in your frustration. \"Well, now that we're up here, we can't back down, we have to perform the mating ritual - it is the most sacred one of them all. Think fast and think quick, they are growing impatient...\" Vestra warned, kneeling down to take your boots off, similar like the guard did to her. This seemed like a desperate situation. There are at least a hundred people watching in the city square alone- two hundred eyes- it won't be easy to deceive them all... <br>\r\nStill, if you wanted to have the slighest chance to beat the Monster Queen, you'll have to pass this challenge- a formidable army such as the Amazons was crucial. You'll have to find a way out, even if it meant to sacrifice dignity for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vestra was just done removing your boots, standing up as you toss your gauntlets to the side- you can't remove any more clothing without revealing your female attributes. You take a deep breath \"Alright, but I can't pro- MMPH!\" Once again, you find yourself lifted by the beautiful Amazoness as she kisses you on the lips, leaning in and forcing you to ibterlock your legs behind her back in order to not fall down. This was followed by a huge cheer from the mass in the square. She teasingly plays with your lips and tongue, causing you to blush- you were aware that this was just a camouflage, but you had to admit embarassed that it was a turn-on nonetheless.<br>\r\n...Perhaps your dignity wasn't the only thing on the line here.</span></div></div>",

So disoriented by her (admittedly arousing) kiss that you didn't notice her setting you down until you felt the grass against your back. Vestra sat on your legs and started grinding against you while moaning like you were, well... The crowd let out a cheer and applauded, so far not suspecting anything. You stared at your Amazoness captor turned wife with red cheeks. The Goddess either had a sick sense of humor or had abandoned you completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra looked at you with a frustrated expression before shoving her foot in her face, much to your (and the crowd's) confusion. \"Worship the feet of your new bride! And swear your obedience to me and Artemis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew Artemis was their patron goddess, but you couldn't just abandon <i>your</i> Goddess like that! Could you? It was hard to think straight with her soft foot pressed against your face. It reeked of dirt and sweat yet somehow it smelled enticing to you. Maybe it wouldn't hurt just to play along... The crowd let out another cheer, it took you a second to realize you'd started licking Vestra's foot. Your blush would've deepened if that were still possible at this point. What was happening to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra looked relieved as she continued her grinding and whispered. \"You're a natural.\" By now her redheaded friend was cheering while her dark haired friend looked confused by the turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words barely registered as you licked her sole again. Her feet were as long as your face and half as wide, covered in sweat (or was it your drool?) and dirt. You expected to be repulsed, but you weren't. Maybe more investigation was warranted... You pressed your face against her foot and lapped away like an eager dog. Growing more and more aroused with each lick. You barely noticed the crowd anymore, only Vestra's feet and her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra pulled back her foot, causing you to whine and the crowd to laugh. \"Do you accept that the female species is stronger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr, yes?\" You were fine admitting to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you swear your loyalty to me, as your bride?\" Vestra pinned your torso down with one foot and held the other just out of reach. Almost like she knew what was going on in your head. She swayed her foot back and forth before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was one a little harder to accept. Your eyes followed her foot, mesmerized. \"... Y-yes.\" There were more cheers, along with shouts of encouragement to Vestra. You two had the full attention of the tribe now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra smiled and lowered her foot. \"Kiss it! Kiss it and swear it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou showered kisses on Vestra's outstretched foot. \"Mm, oh! Yes Vestra! I swear I'll obey you!\" A small part of your mind screamed at you to stop but you were too far gone to listen. \"I swear my bride!\" By now the crowd was transfixed, they'd never seen a mating ritual like this before. They were too busy watching you worship Vestra's feet to see that she was faking the mating part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra lifted her foot away from you again. She looked pretty into it now, almost aroused at the sight of you slaving over her feet. \"Do you accept Artemis as your one and only goddess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hesitance faded as you watched her foot swinging above you. Surely, the Goddess wouldn't mind if you played along. Yes, playing along, that's what you were doing right now. You weren't actually enthralled by Vestra's feet! \"Mmm! Yes, I accept her-\" Vestra smothered you, this time with both feet, before you could even finish. You eagerly licked, kissed and sucked the beautiful soles presented to you. Lost to the world and everything but your new bride's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what happened during the minutes that followed that. But Vestra eventually pulled back her feet and carefully redressed you without exposing you both to the cheering crowd. She picked you up bridal style and carried you through the hollering crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis finally let you regain a piece of your mind. Deep shame and embarrassment flooded over you as you realized what you'd been doing. You worshiped Vestra's feet, swore to obey her and renounced the Goddess, and you liked it! <i>\"No, it was just an act, that's all.\"</i> You were only looking for an opportunity to escape, that's it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe it'd be better not to escape. If you stayed, with Vestra, maybe you could convince the Amazon's to turn on the Monster Queen! That'd be a big help in your quest. Plus you were already so good at, acting, yes, acting. Whatever your choice it'd be best to make it now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vestra carried you to her hut and shut the door behind her. She set you on your feet and smirked. \"I didn't know you had a foot fetish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks went scarlet and you shook your head. \"I don't! I was just acting!\" You were, definitely. That's what you'd resolved to keep telling yourself at least. \"Was, that an Amazoness mating tradition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh no, I made that up.\" Vestra cut you off before you could protest. \"I had to! You were laying there unresponsive while I was pretending to mate with you. I decided covering your face with my foot would keep everyone from noticing. And when I saw you were enjoying yourself I decided to continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't enjoy myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Despite her answer, the amused smirk on Vestra's face gave you the nagging feeling that she didn't buy it. Which could only mean bad things for you, that's right, bad things, because you <i>didn't</i> like feet, not at all! You were only pretending to make an alliance with the Amazon's. That reminded you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Vestra, what would I have to do to get an audience with your Chief?\" you asked. A part of you dreaded what the answer might be, while another part desperately hoped it was as humiliating as the mating ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra stared at you before bursting into hysteric laughter. \"You!? Get an audience with the chief!?\" She laughed for a solid minute before she got a hold of herself long enough to joke at your expense. \"Not even I've earned a meeting with the Chief. She'll only see the best, none of which have been <i>men</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vestra!\" you protested. \"I'm not a-\" Your new wife clapped a hand over your mouth to keep you from speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra removed her hand. \"Fine. If you really want to know, one way of meeting the Chief would be to win a tournament. If you somehow managed that, she might even forgive our deception and make you an Amazoness. But I doubt you could accomplish that.\" Considering your performance against Vestra, you were inclined to agree. \"The other way would be for you to prove your talent in something, the Chief might want you to demonstrate it to her. But why do you want to meet the Chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled with as much confidence as you could muster after your humiliating affair. \"Because I want to ask her to turn against the Monster Queen!\" Your proclamation was met with a second round of laughter from your new wife, somehow more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra ruffled your hair like you were a dog. \"Even if you somehow impress the Chief, to get the Amazon's on your side, you'd need to impress <i>our</i> Queen. But she's one of the Monster Queen's most trusted allies.\" You were more than a little disturbed to hear that. \"Ah, but that's in the future. For now we need to get through the rest of our wedding ceremony. You can tell me what you want to do tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered, with dread! Not excitement, at least that's what you told yourself. \"The rest of the ceremony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVesta nodded. \"Yes, first there's the banquet! Where they'll hold a tournament, the winner makes a request of me. After that we'll have to brand you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brand me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra looked even more amused than before. \"The wife marks their husband with fast drying ink. It's usually just a hand print on their face or back. But maybe a foot print would be appropriate for you...\" This disturbed and excited you at the same time. Vestra and you got dressed in finer clothes (yours being intended for a man) before stepping outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra's redheaded friend ran over and started gushing. \"Oh! That was so amazing! I've never seen a mating ritual like that before. I'm <i>so</i> doing that with my husband! W-when I get one, that is.\" She looked at Vestra's dark haired friend. \"Diana couldn't believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired Amazon only blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra draped an arm around you. \"This is Kali...\" The redhead waved. \"And Diana...\" The dark haired girl nodded. \"My two closest friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved shyly. Not knowing what to say to two Amazon's who were convinced that you were a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali kept gushing like she hadn't been interrupted. \"By Artemis! What did you call that? Foot worship? I have to try that with someone.\" The devious glimmer in her eyes made you nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kali asked before sighing. \"Oh fine, banquet first.\" She regained her enthusiasm and pointed at Diana. \"Where I'm going to beat you in the tournament!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I will, just watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVestra calmed Kali down and led you and them to the banquet area. There weren't any tables, just blankets they spread on the ground and sat on. The only exception being Vestra, who got to sit on a throne-like chair while you sat on a blanket next to her, you tried not to think about how close this put you to her feet. Near the blankets they were holding a tournament. Which at least meant they weren't focused on you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot until Kali opened her big mouth that is. \"Vestra! Tell us about this foot worship.\" Her tail swayed behind her. \"What's it like? Where'd you learn about it?\" This got the attention of at least a dozen Amazon's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew right away this wouldn't end well for you. Made evident when Vestra patted you on the head again. \"A cat girl told me about it when I was looking for my husband. It's popular with other monsters and humans.\" You weren't so sure about that second part...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali looked disturbingly interested. \"Show us!\" The Amazon's all nodded, like children eager to learn something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly.\" Vestra stretched out her leg, flexing her toes. \"Husband! I command you to sniff my toes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated being right. But, obediently, you crawled forward and leaned toward her sandal clad feet, taking a deep breath of the intoxicatingly strong scent. You felt yourself growing hot again as you took a second, longer breath. <i>\"I'm just acting, I don't like feet.\"</i> You chanted to yourself as you sniffed your bride's smelly toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali watched you, transfixed, until the moment the tournament match ended. She hopped to her feet. \"Alright! Let's go Diana, you and me!\" She ran onto the tournament field. A confused Diana trailing after her. This drew some of the Amazon's attention away from you again. You almost felt disappointed, until you reminded yourself that this was totally just an act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali and Diana faced each other on the field. The former declaring. \"If I win, you have to worship my feet!\" This instantly drew the rest of the crowd's attention. You realized, with both excitement and dread, that Vestra may have started a cultural movement for the Amazon's.</span></div></div>",

A moment later, two more men seemingly fell down from trees above, also on the road.<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell is goin' on?!\" Said the bandit leader<br>\r\n\"Nothing personal, I just got paid to capture you scum.\" You heard a voice and just as you turned back towards the leader, you've seen him struck with a blunt part of a giant axe. The surprising part however was that the enormous weapon was held by a <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://image.ibb.co/nO8cd6/mgfchap.jpg\">kitsune!</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://image.ibb.co/nO8cd6/mgfchap.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> Not only a monster girl, but also of the type more known from their magic prowess rather than melee combat skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the unconscious leader fell onto the floor, the kitsune all of a sudden started approaching you herself. You were afraid for a moment she mistook you for one of the bandits, or just wanted to attack you to for being human, but the kitsune... who turned out to be surprisingly a bit taller than you, just took a closer look at you before sheathing her giant axe on her back.<br>\r\n\"You don't seem like one of them... treat that rescue as a freebie then I guess. I already got paid from nearby village's chief for capturing this bunch anyway.\" She said<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot for the help!\" You finally say, relieved that she didn't decide<br>\r\n\"Help? I didn't plan to do that, so just forget about it. I don't want people around here to think I'm doing mercenary work for free.\" Said the kitsune, revealing herself to be a mercenary of some sort, as she started gathering all the bandits in one place, and tying them up with some rope<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me where can I find Hayato village?\" You decided to ask, just to make sure you were going right way to your destination<br>\r\n\"Oh, those guys? You go that way and by the evening you should reach it. We have a bit of a bandit problem here recently, so hope you will be prepared for more guys like those, because I'm not gonna save you again without a payment.\" Said the kitsune, she seemed completely unbothered about any kind of monsters vs humans issues.<br>\r\n\"Oh... why are there so many?\" You asked<br>\r\n\"Hell if I know, but the bussiness is good thanks to that, so I can't complain.\" Said the kitsune, despite her kinda cold exterior and money-focused mind, she didn't seem like a bad person to you... surprising given her race<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how much would protecting me until the Hayato village cost?\" You ask reluctantly, knowing you are nowhere near ready to find multiple enemies in ambushes like that<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well, it's pretty far, for entire day, and you would have to cover expenses of me getting a room at Hayato inn... 300 coins.\" Said the mercenary kitsune<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have the necessary amount of money with you... but was travel alone really a good idea?<br>\r\n\"Name's Kuroga by the way.\" Said the mercenary, still waiting for you answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After prodding yourself for more time than you had any right too, you looked up to the sky to see if there was any intuition to be found. Night had long fallen over the land, shown by the bright stars that hung overhead. You sighed in relaxation as your mind slowly began to wander to years ago when you would look at the exact same night sky. Even when you were a priestess in training, a glance into the night sky always gave off some kind of relaxing  aura. Your eyes scanned the stars until you noticed one star that seemed brighter than the others in view. Turning your gaze to the road in front of you, it seemed the bright star was pointing more towards the forest. Taking it as some kind of sign, you began walking to the entrance of the wood. Wishing for another moment of calm peace, you decided to take another look at the stars above. There you saw your deciding star, even brighter than it was before.....and in a completely different spot. You tilted your head, curious over to how the star could have moved so quickly....and could still be moving. After a few seconds of glancing, you began to realize the star wasn't getting brighter but closer! Within seconds, you hit the dirt as the sounds of burning became prevalent. An ear piercing screech echoed about you, giving you the idea the object was far closer than you would have been comfortable with. As soon as it began, it ended in a muffled slam and an earth shaking movement. With curiosity overtaking you, you rushed over to where you heard the object crash. Rushing through the brush and trees, you already began to notice the large chunks of dirt and rock strewn about. You pushed one last bush aside and your eyes fell upon the strangest.....thing...you had ever seen in your life. A construct made entirely of metal, still glowing and smoking from the fire that had disguised it as a star. Looking to the dirt path the object had carved, there was clearly more to this odd object than what was on the surface. Stepping forward, you could see a hatch in the top of the object.</span></div></div>",

You would clearly be able to open that thing with a little brute force, plus there were the positives to consider. It was after all unlikely anything inside would have survived that crash so there wouldn't be any harm in taking whatever this vessel had to offer. With your mind made up, you approached the batch and stuck your rod into the hatch cover. Within seconds, the panel opened up and you jumped down without hesitation. Your shoes made little noise as you landed on the cold metal floor, though again you weren't too concerned about stealth. Still...a few rotating red lights were still operational so maybe it was best to keep a careful eye around. Whirrs and gears and sounds the likes of which you had never heard before sounded all around as you crept down the sterile hallway. You sniffed the air around you, catching an odd whiff along the cold breeze. You couldn't tell what it was but somehow it seemed to be leading you through the ship. Soon, the smell led you to the end of the hallway and three different doors. Taking another sniff, the smell seemed to be coming from either the left or center doors. As for the right door, it had a different tint when compared to the other doors and sparked your curiosity.</span></div></div>",

Sue me.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is an interactive story based on a storyline in The Ultimate Foot Fetish, which you can find here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1691262-The-Ultimate-Foot-Fetish/map/15533222222222222222222222212222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222221\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1691262-The-Ultimate-Foot-Fetish/ma...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor centuries, humans and monster girls have been at war.  Humanity has attempted to negotiate with the monster girls in hope of peace, and while some few monster girls are content to live alongside humans, monster girls who live under the banner of the Monster Queen are set in the notion that they are superior and humanity belongs under their feet, and will not stop their conquest until the human race is trampled underfoot, both figuratively and literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a young peasant hailing from a small village. You have aspirations of defeating the Monster Queen, as they have constantly plagued your home town. You\u2019ve saved up enough money for a copper sword and a wooden shield. You know it\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s all you can afford for now. The only thing left is to say goodbye and embark on your quest\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n-No male feet. I have nothing against male feet personally, but the story is Monster GIRL feet. There\u2019s a time and place for everything, ya know? <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">I suppose if there were enough interest, I could make a \"Monster Boy Feet\" story...</span> UPDATE: you can now find such a story here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2105407-Monster-Boy-Feet\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2105407-Monster-Boy-Feet</a><br>\r\n-It\u2019s up to you whether the main character has a foot fetish or not.<br>\r\n-Shrinking, hypnosis, transformation, and dirt/sweat are allowed and encouraged.<br>\r\n-Watersports and scat are NOT allowed<br>\r\n-Anything you want to write about that aren\u2019t on those lists? Shoot me a PM first just to be sure.<br>\r\n-Not really a rule per se, but I\u2019m very lenient on the definition of what qualifies as a \u201cmonster girl\u201d. Anything from fantasy races (elves, goblins, etc.) to full-on furry is okay in my book.<br>\r\n-You have to use proper grammar and spelling. I\u2019m not asking for a lexicon matching Shakespeare, but chapters like \u201cok adn then the cat grill makes u lick her feet what next\u201d will be deleted.<br>\r\n-All non-choice chapters need to be at least a paragraph long.<br>\r\n-Speaking of which, try not to go overboard with choice chapters. I know I can\u2019t really enforce this, but just pick something and then go with it. Don\u2019t make a million choice chapters and expect someone else to write what you want to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s it. Have fun and enjoy!<br>\r\n</td>",
