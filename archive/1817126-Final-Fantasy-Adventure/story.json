The Lufenians, a race of Elven people, were highly intelligent and used the power of the crystals to energize their technologies such as airships and even cities that floated among the heavens. This would prove to be foolish, however, as the crystals began to fade and lose their shining glow. The airships crashed and the aerial cities fell into ruin as the power ran low. The tragedy was just beginning for the Lufenians though as the crystals could no longer hold back the power from the God of Chaos. The crystals have held this back since ancient times only letting a slither of power from Chaos escape into the world but with the crystals all but drained the full havoc wreaked on the land. The Earth shook with intense ferocity, the waters were always treacherous and consumed any ship that dared cross them, fire was harder to create but when it was created it became uncontrollable and burned anything down as if it was alive, and the winds rarely blew and when they did it was like that of a typhoon or hurricane! The Lufenians devolved, losing the ability to cast magic naturally and began losing their Elven traits, many of them becoming humans or retaining some magic and Elven traits but becoming small and weak. The people of Lufenia lived in sorrow and needed hope. Some even turned to worshipping Chaos in a temple built before even the crystals themselves but most looked to a great Sage who maintained his power, Lukahn, who tells the story of four warriors of light who shall banish the darkness and save the land from peril. This gave the people hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n200 Years Later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is Lufenia\", says a young knight dressed in a dazzling suit of armor with a helmet that had short horns facing forward. He looked around at the nature amongst him. The lush greenery and blue waters of the sea surrounding the peninsula he stood on seemed beautiful but a darkness filled the air around him like a cloak. <br>\r\n\"Seems like you aren't from here either... that must make you one of the so-called Warriors of Light I'm paired with, huh?\", says another young man, but instead of a heavy suit of armor, he wears street clothing with small bits of leather armor around his vital areas and a tattered bandanna around his head. His face had many stubbles of unshaven hair and he wreaked of thievery and outlaw but at the same time no evil was detected in him.<br>\r\n\"Paired with?\", asks the young knight, \"Surely you aren't.... One of the warriors of light?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's what I said isn't it? Maybe you should take off that ridiculous helmet so you can hear better!\", replies the thief.<br>\r\n\"Guys, save your quarrel, we have more urgent matters to attend\", says an older voice. The knight and their look as a shorter figure enters from behind a tree. He wears a blue cloak that covers his body and a mage hat which also covers his face in darkness, only showing a bright pair of glowing, yellow eyes. He smelt of darkness but no evil seemed to be in this man, in fact quite the opposite despite his appearance. <br>\r\n\"Great... More company\", says the thief.<br>\r\n\"The more the merrier\", replies the knight, \"In fact Cosmos told me their would be one more...\"<br>\r\n\"That would be me!\", says a young female voice. Out from the tall grass beyond comes a young woman, dressed in a red cloak that had been coat and tailored to be more... provocative than usual mage clothing. A strict balance of dark and light emanated from her body but her intentions seemed to be light-dominate. <br>\r\n\"Hell yeah\", said the theif said as he walked over to the red mage,\"Did it hurt when Cosmos cut your wings because surely you were one of her angels....\"<br>\r\nBOOM!!!<br>\r\nThe red mage let a spark of fire magic erupt from her hands as the thief was blasted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, we have no time for foolishness, destiny is at hand\", said the young knight as he pointed to a city beyond the forests. \"Let us go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the warriors began to walk the thief looked back at the red mage, \"That was hot... just like you babe!\"<br>\r\nThe red mage looked back at the thief, \"Would you like to see how hot I can get\", she said with her hands glowing with a bright red flame.<br>\r\n\"No.... I'm good\", said the thief as he picked up his pace...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The warriors of light traveled through the green forests on the way to the kingdom ahead. The trees were thick and tall, blocking much light causing it to be really dark despite it being the prime of daylight, there was no stealth in their travel as the many leaves that covered the forest ground like a carpet had crumbled and cracked loudly as they stepped on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my name is Karith\", said the thief reluctantly, feeling uneased by the silence of travel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small moment of silence once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auburn\", the red mage blurted out, \"My name is Auburn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're getting somewhere!\", Karith exclaimed before looking to the black mage \"What about you Mr. Moody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is of no importance.... but if you must know, call me Pain, the very name of the staff which deals such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!\", a loud menacing laugh is heard in the background before the young warrior has a chance to introduce himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is that?\", says Karith, he is immediately answered as four beasts rush from behind a tree at the heroes. They were short and ugly with green skin, long ears, sharp teeth and menacing red eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goblins\", muttered Pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning the beasts attacked with light warriors with their sharp claws. Karith leaped back, dodging his goblin foe's claws. After he landed on the ground, he pulled his dagger out and made a swift counter attack upon the beast, piecing the weak flesh thus making short work of the foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuburn used her magic to form a barrier in front of herself which the goblin foolishly collided into, she then transformed the barrier into a flaming explosion which finished the goblin off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain wasn't so lucky as he dodged the goblin was able to land a claw onto his robe, making a tear. This pissed Pain off with a red fury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish beast! Be gone!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain casted his strongest fire spell and blasted the beast into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the goblin that was charging to the young knight. He stood there without moving as the goblin lunged in the air and was going to pounce on him, one the goblin got close, the knight unsheathed his shining sword. <br>\r\n\"My name is Light and you shall be released from the realm of the living!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWshhhhhh!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin in two separate halves and flew by the warrior, he striking so fast that nobody even saw his arm or sword move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... Well, that was one hell of an introduction!\", said Karith as the party once again began its journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I'm a student at Trabia Garden. My story began when i first came to Trabia. Upon my arrival, i was instructed a guide for my first few days here, until i could remember the layout of the Garden on my own. Her name was Selphie Tilmitt, and she was one of the most hyper-carefree people I've ever seen in my life. Always so happy and positive. It would make some people feel sick, but i kinda enjoyed seeing her like that. It was nice to see someone always filled to the brim with...well, whatever the Hell she was on i guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, my first few days were filled with Selphie mostly showing me around the place. It was very cold on the outside, mostly due to the fact that we were so close to the mountains, but on the inside, it was warm and snug. Even in the classrooms and other facility's. The heating in Trabia Garden was top notch. It had to be, otherwise we'd all freeze to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter my first few days however, i was instructed to go about on my own. I was doing quite well for a while, until i came across Selphie one day in one of the empty classrooms. She seemed to have her eyes closed and was chanting something while holding a small stone. At first i thought she was saying a pryer of some kind and quietly sat down in one of the empty chairs in front of her, but then i saw her body beginning to glow a golden yellow color, and that's when she shouted the word--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrink!\" At that moment, she pointed her finger at the chair i was sitting in, and without any sort of warning, i started feeling like i was going to faint, and then, i blacked out.</span></div></div>",

But i told the headmaster that i didn't want him to give her the boot, and instead, convinced him to let her stay in Garden in exchange for taking care of me until a cure could be found for the spell. After a moment or two, the headmaster agreed, and Selphie became my personal caregiver, tutor, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since then, Selphie has been doing everything she could caring for me, from buying my clothes, to teaching me how to fend for myself in the event we were ever separated, etc. But enough about the past, lets get back to the present, shall we?</span></div></div>",

There are lots of types of magic, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's white, which focuses on healing, or black for offensive spells. Blue is for learning the moves of monsters for your own, and there's red magic, which is kinda like a mixture of some white and black spells. And there's green magic, which is status-changing spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if you don't like rainbow colored magic, then there's also summoning magic, where you can call on the powers of Ethereals, powerful creatures born from the very essence of the six crystals. They only lend their powers to those who they consider as worthy. Each one has a huge statue in certain locations around the world of Coranlee. Ethereals are attributed to certain elements, some are non-elemental, others are instead debuff attributed (e.g. they cause status debuffs upon attacking like poison or silence.) Only six Ethereal statues are well known (right next to where the crystals are), while others are near impossible to find. Each one has two forms; A humanoid form and an animal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, do you use magic or not?</span></div></div>",
