Meanwhile Julia, a tall redhead, practices the use of a sword, knows what to do when, and generally does not need her companion's advice. Alex rises before Julia to haul the firewood and generally the manual labor for the trip. After  four days Julia informs Alex that they will cross a river to leave the canyon. Alex is anxious for he has heard of a black-armored knight that kills travelers...nonetheless he dutifully scouts ahead for Julia, who promises to catch with him soon to pay if there's a toll bridge.  After a half hour, Alex meets the black-armored knight who mocks him saying that of the two (the palace provided him with nobleman's clothes for escort duties) the wife wore the pants! Alex snarls that the knight is an idiotic bigmouth. Then the knight challenges him to a duel and slaps him with a glove as was traditional for such a challenge. Julia </span></div></div>",

She rides off to meet him on her white horse. She meets Alex and finds him in battle with a black-armored knight! \"Ah,\" sneers the knight, \"there's a woman and an attractive one, too.

The King approaches!\" Julia rode off to meet the King but Alex lost her in a crowd; the King approached; and to their surprise his carriage was guarded at the front by none other than the Black Knight! \"Who is the Black Knight?\" asked Alex. \"The King's son, the Prince of Tubertov,\" said an old woman. \"@#$!\" cursed Alex. \"That jerk won't let me join up with Julia!
