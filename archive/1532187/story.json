You might also know that you will be there forever, but I can tell the world of the living that this and many other things are quite possible.  I never thought the the earth could shift in many light and tunnels, all buried physically, and mentally. Only mentally can we sustain the understanding of it all, for I Nicoline Beheem Montrague, came quite inspired by the beauty of distances.  All the far of spectrograms and global galaxy that floated noted or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine how it would feel to embrace time that way and that well.  Many of those times fell under pressure.  I only had so much time when i would arrive some place else; Whether being on a dimension somewhere, or run wild among the past and futures of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 1925, and to us modern men and women could not comprehend much technology as i saw elsewhere.  I was one of the very few who somehow captured every way in what could be created. Things of electronics inspired me. I almost craved it so much that I had health problems.  Most of all it was not easy to pass back and forth, and my family worried about me the most.  They all wanted what they thought was best for me, which then was to marry like every other women did.  I was more of a tom boy then anything, and i guess that too stopped any man from coming round to my side for that long.  I was four-five, Brown eyes, tanned skin, and averagely plump.  I dare not say how much, but i am happy with myself most time.  I have thick glasses that look like airplane goggles, and ware overalls way too long for my legs so that  I have to roll the pants up above my shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately my family has enough money, which helped me plenty when I turned 16 and moved out of my parents home. For a while everything came together with ease.   I began my own studies in New York City.  I learned more about aerodynamics, Astrology, Marine Biology, Science, and spirituality of all sorts.   It wasn't till one day I was sitting alone as usual, pondering on what more there could be.  I was one moment in the park down town, and then, I woke up standing in the living room of my small blue apartment.  I didn't remember standing up, walking, or entering my house.  I also do not remember what happened during that half hour I blanked out.  Then it came to me in a dream 3 nights later.  I thus had an opinion that there could be more places then just Earth and the planets around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI traveled to some ware in my sleep. It had been a desert and I realized it was like being on mars. As I roamed to a city that looked just like Manhattan, but as the entities came out in the early morn, I could not believe my eyes and what was before me.  There were no people.  They were scaly, reptilian like beings, and they noted I was there too because all oval eyes turned in my direction when I appeared. As one took a step before me, I woke up in my bed sweating.  I new though it was not a dream, it was realer then being awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day I went to the library and looked up record on several different scenarios.  One was: Time Travel, Two: Mind Travel, and three: life on other planets.  In my study many text spoke of inner time travel the most.  Inter dimensional travel to be more specific. At least that was what inspired my thoughts more, and so I began to put my studies to action.  At home alone I tried to focus and pay attention to thought loss. I found some mushrooms that helped out this process. And so for the first time I was surprised to find myself indifferent from where ever I went.  The next night I put my next Plan to motion and built a time machine.  No one knew these studies of mine, had no idea I was even doing so, and this was done on purpose.  I needed no distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Time machine was beautiful.  A giant blue and purple spiral ball made of pure steal, coper wiring that connected power to the machine, and allowed the buttons do the work they were supposed to do. Money wasn't a factor, I actually took advantage of the black market, finding all I needed to have.  Even though that I had my work in order and was very excited to see the finish, I was scared too, but I had no problem of ignoring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen on April 2nd 1925 I sat in the seat and buckled myself in.  I set punched some numbers into the screen before me not knowing what they would take me, and the sound lit up the air and the light became like the sun, and poof where did I go ...  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I watched as automobiles became more and more common, replacing the horse entirely, much to my disappointment I will admit, the horse is a fine animal.  But I digress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched the city suffer through storms and catastrophe, economic failure and success, and all the while it seemed as though I could not get enough of watching the world change around me, and the longer I watched, I was simultaneously upset.  Men and women wore less formal and professional clothing as time wore on, and even more skin exposed altogether!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than once I saw a woman only wearing what looked like a bra on her torso, and what appeared to be torn men's pants!  The shame of it all!  But I must progress further!  I must find out if the future will recover the morals and values it has lost, or are we doomed to watch our values degrade like the mighty stone against the ocean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI increased the speed, absorbing countless hundreds and thousands of years in moments, but I fear that the temporal distortion was too much for my 3rd dimensional brain, unaccustomed to traveling through the 4th dimension we recognize as time.  For you see, I ended up becoming quite faint, and I knew not how far forward I had was being projected until I awoke and looked at the dial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"871,925 AD!\"  I exclaimed once I brought the machine to a temporal halt.  Looking outside, I did not see anything beyond a smooth stone slab, carved with various symbols indecipherable to myself, having missed exactly 870,000 years of human advancement and development.  It was even quite possible that English as I knew it no longer existed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the machine and stepped out to see what lay before me, to explore beyond a time even thought of.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I stepped out and alongside the stone slab, I looked out and saw spires far beyond what I saw being built before I fell asleep!  They reached up to and through the cloud layer itself, various flying machines without sound or wings buzzed in neat lines between the spires and over the horizon.  Surrounding the city I saw sprawling fields of crops, some I recognized from a distance, like the golden hue of wheat or the green stalks of corn.  And there, amongst the fields, I saw men! And women!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were doing everything by hand, how odd.  Perhaps the values of society caused a regression to older methods to reinforce the ideals of the past?  I creeped closer, staying behind the rocks that dotted the hillside my time machine now rested upon, perhaps my city was the very mound I was walking on?  Too morbid a thought for myself to dwell on, I decided, and pressed on, trying get a glimpse of the individuals in the fields, trying to discern what manner of outfit she they wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a distance, they seemed to be dull in color, and not have any decoration upon them.  Maybe just a work uniform?  It made sense, they were going to get dirty, might as well make it utilitarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I approached, what I saw astonished me.</span></div></div>",

I couldn scarcely believe my own eyes, and rubbed them to make sure they were awake and functioning, and they saw correct!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I noticed the foremen, naked as well, standing upon a hovering platform no wider than the span of a man's arms and perfectly round and perhaps not more than an inch thick.  There was no visible means of propulsion that I could discern, though the foreman was weielding a whip with great effect upon the laborers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlavery then, though the lack of clothes was an oddity that I just had no idea the origin of, nor the faintest on how to approach them.  From a distance it also would appear as though a was a good foot taller than the foremen, who appeared to be most well nourished and fed, and the closest to a physical prime amongst the locals.  I could not blend in easily, my height and pale skin from not spending every day under the sun a naked as a beast would not make a convincing facade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would go down and attempt diplomacy, perhaps they will parlay and allow me to make a study of their society for the distant past, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I approached them, I called out to them, waving my arms to get their attention.  I surely succeeded as the foreman brought his left arm to his face, a system of lights illuminating within his forearm below his wrist!  Most marvelous, an inbuilt radio!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments I saw in the distance three other foremen on disks rapidly approaching my position, and I made sure to quickly undo any wrinkles in my clothes, though they most likely did not comprehend the importance of smooth, ironed clothes.  As the men landed I saw I was correct in my assumption of height, I was indeed a good foot above them, and they were physically fit, not overly muscled, but not so average as to be overlooked.  These were men who were used to physical labor and as they approached, I held out my hand in greeting, telling them who I was.</span></div></div>",
