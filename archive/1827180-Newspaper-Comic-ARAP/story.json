And yet, he didn't realize, or did, but thought nothing of it, that his parents were driven crazy by his own behavior. In fact, he was currently in bed early due to a stunt he pulled earlier which could easily be dubbed \"the Next Noodle Incident\". When Hobbes, his tiger friend, was in bed with him, he angrily stated that he wanted nothing to do with it. He was angry enough that he was being sent to bed early, during summer, of all times!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents are probably some of the biggest jerks I have ever had to deal with,\" Calvin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they did give birth to you. Imagine just how cranky they would be if they had to deal a messy, noisy little creature for the first few years and then you get older and nothing changed,\" responded Hobbes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess tha- HEY!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just had to state what was on my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I'm convinced they were never kids. Just some aliens impersonating as humans. That'd be more interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you know that for sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you shouldn't say things like that without thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they said goodnight to each other and went to sleep, while Calvin was thinking, \"My parents need a good dose of what it's like being little. Maybe then, they'll learn something.\" Unbeknownst to him, though, that night, some incredible changes were taking place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Calvin had gotten up relatively early. Summer and Saturdays were when he usually got up on his own. On school days, he had to be waken up by his mom or even dragged out of bed by her. Something about the house seemed... odd. He got off the bed and walked towards his parents' room. When he opened the door, he was shocked to find that...</span></div></div>",

Calvin never remembered hearing ANYTHING about his mom expecting a baby, that was weird. Add to that the fact that this was now in his parents' room, and it became bizarre. Had this all occurred overnight? He remembered being in this room yesterday with no changes in it, but all that was past now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around, he saw a changing table, a few step ladders, a chest of drawers, a small bookshelf filled with board books, and a toybox. And there, at the back of the room, stood a crib. A plain white crib with a mobile hanging over the top and a nightstand with a lamp by it. Calvin snuck up closer for a look, and saw, sleeping in the crib, two babies, one boy and one girl. They were both sleeping where Calvin could get a good look at both of them. He looked at the girl, who was sucking her thumb in her sleep, and then at the boy, who was just lying on his back, kicking the air once in a while. Both had a shirt, a diaper, and booties on. Calvin looked over by the crib at the nightstand and saw something he would not expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad's glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin had noticed that the babies did look like his parents, but that could have just been a staggering coincidence, however. But as he looked at the glasses, then over at the boy baby, who was now sleeping on his side, he decided to try something out. He climbed up a stepladder that was near the crib, and carefully slipped the glasses over the boy's eyes, and he could clearly see the resemblance the boy had to his dad now. He took off the glasses and went over to the girl baby. As he looked her over a little more, he could see a resemblance to his mom. Now this is getting weird, Calvin thought, could it be that my parents have become babies overnight? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as he was thinking all this over...</span></div></div>",

She got out of bed and head down the hall, passed her parents room which was empty as they were away this weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe open the door. Linus was still sleeping it seems. Lucy thought about what a lazy blcokhead he was. She walked over to the bed, Linus was deep over the cover as she could see the lump. She pushed him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up\" she shouted. She was still asleep. She shock him again \"I said get up!\" still nothing. \"I SAID GET UP BOCKHEAD!\" She ripped the blanket off the bed. Lying in the bed was a small baby wrapped up in Linus's Security blanket. Then it hit who this baby is.</span></div></div>",

I made this for those who read the comics and like age transformation as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stories can involve a large variety of comics that could be used, like Garfield, Calvin &amp; Hobbes, Peanuts, and many more series and they can go however you want, but they must have characters getting older or younger as a focus. I'm looking for anyone who knows about some of these characters so that they can contribute as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDA RULES:<br>\r\nOther transformations can be included, but age regression/progression is the main focus.<br>\r\nNo killing off characters. <br>\r\nNo sex or vore (Regressing to unbirth, though, is acceptable.)<br>\r\nPut effort in description, unless you're giving more options. Try to build a story around the effects.<br>\r\nUse your imagination! Some comics tend to be more based around real life than others, so let's ignore that aspect and go wild with what could cause the effects!<br>\r\nKeep to the rating, people!<br>\r\nIf you want to poke fun at certain series, do so, but DON'T BE TOO HARSH.</td>",
