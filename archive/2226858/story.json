From what you had been told, this town was going to be your new home, even though you had never heard of it. Your sister, Shelly,who was five years younger than you, is in the adjacent seat playing her Switch. For as long as you could remember, the two of you stuck together like glue, especially when your former parents would leave the two of you alone for days at a time, having gone nobody knows where. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\" Your social worker says as she parks in front of a rather large and lavish house. As you and your sister exit the vehicle, the social worker pops open the trunk to get your bags. But before she can accompany the two of you to the door, her phone rings. After she answers, she is silent for about half a minute before hanging up. \"I'm sorry kids, but something just came up, urgent matter. You two just go ring the doorbell and meet your new folks, and I'll see you in about two weeks when I come back to check on you. Have fun with your new family!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drives off, you and your sister approach the front door and ring the bell. So just who will be your new family?</span></div></div>",
