            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another normal day in the suburbs. Bob had gotten up fairly early for once (here meaning \u2018before 11\u2019) and had decided that today was the day he would finally get around to doing some yard work. His first choice had been mowing the lawn, since Bob had a riding mower and that seemed to him like the least amount of work, but the damn thing wouldn\u2019t start. He might\u2019ve taken that as an excuse to just give up on the idea of yard work at all, but he honestly felt kind of bad and figured he should do something. The leaf blower, as it turned out, started just fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, it was past time that Bob got all the dead leaves from last fall out of his yard. Specifically, it was May. <i>I\u2019ll feel so much better once this is done</i>, Bob thought. <i>Now my yard won\u2019t be the crummiest one on the block.</i> Bob carefully guided the swirling leaves across his front lawn and onto his neighbor\u2019s. When he was done, the yard next door, formerly clean, was a leaf-strewn mess, but his own yard was spotless (or, well, leafless). Bob surveyed his work with pride. Of course, it kind of screwed the neighbor over, but Bob figured he probably wouldn\u2019t mind. Hell, maybe he wouldn\u2019t even notice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what Bob was thinking about when something caught his eye. Looking up at the house next door, he saw that the curtains in the front window were parted ever-so-slightly \u2013 just wide enough for an eye to see out of. Not more than a second after he looked, the curtains quickly closed. He\u2019d been seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob felt the slightest twinge of worry. That house was the home of one Mr. Andras, who was so much of a recluse that Bob didn\u2019t even know what he really looked like. He was always shut in that house, doing\u2026things. Bob didn\u2019t really know what he did all day. <i>I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll let it slide, though. It\u2019s not really THAT big a deal. I mean, it\u2019s not as bad as that time I knocked over his mailbox, or broke his window that time when I was drunk, and he didn\u2019t say anything all those times I had loud parties until 4 AM\u2026</i> Bob assured himself that there was nothing to fear. So what if everyone else was afraid of the guy? How could he do anything if he never left his house? Though he had to admit, there was something creepy about the weird recluse\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Bob slept soundly, unaware of strange lights coming from the house next door. He had finally crossed the line, and he was going to pay. The mysterious man next door would make sure of that. When Bob woke up the next morning, he was in for quite the shock indeed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Bob Roberts is a normal guy whose next-door neighbor happens to be a wizard. Bob makes the mistake of angering said wizard, and hilarity ensues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Character</b>: Bob Roberts, 25. Pretty much an all-around normal guy, if a bit of a clod. Other details about his life (occupation, relationship status, how he got that mysterious scar, etc.) can be added as necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Author's Note</b>: I don't really have any expectations for this story with regards to how it will go - I kind of just wanted to set something up and see whether anyone would take it somewhere. Transformations, tg, body swap - it's all good. Or you could do something completely different, too: maybe the wizard summons a demon to attack Bob, or maybe he just tries to burn his house down with fireballs or something. Go nuts. Maybe Bob wakes up inside a video game. Who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy one condition is that magical changes and whatnot should be on a personal level, basically affecting one person (probably Bob) or thing at a time. In other words, while the wizard can do anything he wants to Bob, he doesn't have the power to create world-affecting changes (though he could certainly send somebody to another world instead). He can turn a person into a duck, but he can't change reality so that everyone's a duck (but again, he could send someone into an alternate duck-world if you were set on everyone being ducks for some reason).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made this story 18+ just in case anyone wants to get dirty, but if you want to keep things clean, that's fine too.</td>",
