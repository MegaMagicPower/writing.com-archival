You don\u2019t see your old friends anymore any sometimes do things with co-workers but you don\u2019t like your job and feel you have settled. You wish you could just try something new... be someone else for even just a brief bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel something break inside of you. Today is the day... you put down your pencil, clock out early and shove the glass doors of your workplace with gusto. You are going to break this rut... you are going to do something different... something you have always wanted to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at yourself in the reflection... you are wearing a bland outfit... have a neat parted haircut of an office worker... and a body that has lost its youthful bounce. What should you change first?</span></div></div>",

His giant arms look like they might tear out hair instead of cut it. Susan however is bubbly and smiley and running around like a chicken without her head screwed on straight. She has two customers and seems to be multi tasking well enough. You also see a quiet stylist reading further in the back of the shop and a twenty-something high fade barber finishing giving a teen a stylish cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you choose to change your hair?</span></div></div>",

He turns the chair from the mirror and begins clipping the top of your hair. He sprays a water bottle and uses a comb to line up and separate unwanted hair from where your tall Mohawk will soon stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo turning back... are you sure kid?\u201d Al asks as he turns on the clippers in front of you. You answer by simply nodding and then he gets to work. You imagine with each sweep of his clippers your hair being molded into shape. You see a mental picture of yourself with a colored mohawk and going to punk shows and just being absorbed into something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushes away at the clippers as they are clogged from your longer side hair. You sneak a peek to the right to see... your hair just shorter and not shaved... you were expecting more. Gently turning your eyes forward again, Al keeps working the sides little by little shortening it before getting ready to shave the sides clean of any hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to take a long time and you sigh. He reaches back to grab some tools and you sneak another peek. You are stunned. You only have a streak of hair down the middle except for very short hair on the sides. You reach up from under the black drape covering you and notice the forest of hair on the ground around you. You feel your head almost not believing that this is yours. You don\u2019t even look like yourself anymore. The mild mannered, clean look is gone and you can\u2019t help but beam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl grunts and you turn forward again. He finishes off shaving the sides and asks if you want it colored after he is done. His wife Susan can blend any color if you want.</span></div></div>",

Plenty of great things to get it to stay up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in the mirror as he brings his hands together and tugs your your upward. He first makes triangle points and sprays them into place with jar spray before fanning them out and spraying again. You watch and learn how to get your hair up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe back is the tricky part. A good place to start if you are doing it alone.\u201d Al advises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finishes styling your hair and he removes the black cape. You reach up to your foreign head and smile. You look out of place with your office clothes, collared shirt that is still tucked in... the mismatch looks funny.

Follow me to the back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of this... you follow Al and go to an area that has supplies and he leads to a small back office with a closet. You notice the air conditioning makes your head feel cold and become aware of the strange pulling of your hair as it towers almost six inches straight up and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into a closet he pulls out a vintage leather jacket with bobby pins, a mix of leather and jean material with pink logos and spikes worked into the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were generous with me and this thing hasn\u2019t fit me in years. One punk to another, I think you should have it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank him and look at the retro jacket. It is perfect... better than anything you could have bought... it is authentic... you decide as you feel your personality shift a bit: it is you. You tear off your button-up shirt and buttons are sent flying. Youn let your office shirt fall to the ground leaving you with your white under shirt. You slip on the jacket. It fits as if it was made for you. Al grunts with approval and tells you if you want to maintain the Mohawk and have the sides cleaned it will be discounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of the salon looking very different from the person who went in.

You notice a large area devoted for free weights with dumbbells that you can\u2019t imagine towing. You look at the clients and almost all look like they stepped out of muscle magazines or as if they aren\u2019t too far from being featured there. You immediately gulp and few out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think about walking out another near penguin walking hulk walks into the door and makes eye contact with you. You aren\u2019t\u2019t dressed for this place in either body or wardrobe. You are about to move to let the tanned Hercules pass when he stops and smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThinking about cutting and running? Listen, for what it\u2019s worth, I hope you stay. We all entered this place at one point and didn\u2019t feel like we belonged, but you can here because you want something. You should stay and give yourself a chance to find what we all found.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppreciative of his kindness you decide against leaving. A muscular woman enters and smiles at the man you are standing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you making friends with my hubby Gary?\u201d She beams brightly. \u201cI\u2019m Emma. If you are new here, we could use a new gym rat to remind us what it was like to get started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fill out the registration paperwork aptly names paperwerk... and watch as Emma and Gary get started. More gym goers enter and a few greet you or nod your way. Somehow you expected a more elitist atmosphere, but so far it seems like maybe this was a good choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley, the girl helping you sign up for the gym sets up a trainer to work with you and says she will start with you today, but will start off with Michael next time you come in. She documents your goal, prescribes a meal plan and you don\u2019t think you have seen that much protein at a buffet before. You borrows a set of workout gear from one of the gym goers and you equip the extremely loose clothing. You pull the draw string as tight as possible and few as the holes in the muscle shirt sag past your shorts. Riley deposits your clothes behind the counter and you enter the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shows you where the machines are and what you can use for each workout day. She starts you on chest and biceps. You quiver at the weight of the bar but keep pushing though it. You felt embarrassed as she adds a five pound weight to each side and tell you to repeat the set. You comply and feel like all eyes are on you. When you sit up you see approving nods from other gym goers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workout continues and you are told to just bring back the clothes on your next visit.  You feel tired from the workouts but glad and even... energized? More than anything you are feeling hungry. You check your wallet to find that you have just enough cash to do groceries for the week to keep up with the meal plan and get the whey, creatine and piles of meat needed or you could eat cheap and fast food and than get some better clothes for the rest of the week.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You like the idea of classes, a pool, maybe a game if raquetbalk and especially different weight rooms by skill. You will be in the basic room to get started. You don\u2019t even know your max weights and hope you can find someone to spot you as you get started... you may actually need a trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym is polished and has a black rubber type floor. You see a smoothie station as you walk offering an array of after or pre workout drinks. You see two attached raquetball courts to the left past the smoothie station with benches for viewing games also attached to the main entry area and a path to the pool swinging to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smiling teenage girl and a twenty-something guy stuffing towels in a hamper are at the counter. There are numerous people coming and going and you note  that the protein drinks must be tasty as many people stop to get one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl greets you and asks you to fill out paperwork. The fee is higher than you would like, but she also gives you a t-shirt with the gym logo on it and you also see other gear like workout shorts, sneakers, swim trunks and racquets on the walk behind. You also purchase a pair of gray workout shorts and head to the locker room to change. She says that Paul will give a tour once you are changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the cool metal benches of the locker room and look around. You try not to stare as numerous people come in and change. You are trying to get an idea of how things work: where to get towels, what doors lead where so you don\u2019t appear lost. You put your stuff into a little locker with the number 26 and hope no one takes your stuff. You will need to buy a lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit to the main area dressed in new tennis shoes, socks, your gray shorts and your black cotton shirt. Paul greets you and starts the tour. Where do you wish to explore more?</span></div></div>",

Cardio machines line the wall to your left and guided workout machines form three lines in the middle that have pictures and tracks to guide bars and weights. Any worry about form is quickly dispelled as you see a walkthrough for each machine clearly labeled. Along the right wall is a mirror are free weights that don\u2019t go higher than 50 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a mix of overweight and underweight people either sweating on a stair stepper, elliptical or treadmill. You aren\u2019t  very inspired by who is in the room and almost wish you could skip this initial starter room and start hitting heavy weights with the big boys. As if reading your mind, Paul speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are supplements and we could give you special training if you wanted to bulk up faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? That sounds great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to be a gym rat we can get you there in no time. I can start training you today if you want.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It doesn\u2019t hurt, but just punches and suddenly he beams at you. Finish up that shake and go to the bench in the beginner\u2019s floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish up the shake and walk up confidently to the bench. You are ready to do this as you see Paul ready to spot you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to go heavy right away. It will be too much for you, but you are going to do four sets and I want you to push with everything you\u2019ve got. When you think you are done... you still have two more. No exceptions, no excuses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t know how much weight is on the guided bar machine thing, but it is too much for you to even lift off. Paul works the bar into your hands and you immediately lose all confidence you just had. The bar fees like it is going to crush through your chest and keep going through the floor. Your cheeks fill up with air as you strain under an impossible weight. Paul let\u2019s the bar linger and linger as you push and push... he encourages you to keep pushing. After three guided attempts with Paul doing most of the lifting you blurt out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t keep going, I\u2019m done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can talk, you are not done. Two more. PUSH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you push just enough to get Paul\u2019s approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, first set done, now let\u2019s pick up the dumbbell and work out your biceps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to give him a look, but his look is even more fierce and slightly reprimanding. Your wobbly arms grab the dumbbell and he shows you how to do the set. He assists you as you don\u2019t feel you can even get through the first set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the workout feels just as miserable but somehow you start to feel energy and are able to give just a little more and more as the workout continues. Paul pats you on the back and you both head to the locker room after you finish six exercises for your chest and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tosses you another shake and guzzle it down greedily. He arranges to deduct an extra amount for training and a meal plan. He instructs you On what to eat and you take the meal list for the next week. He also gives you baggies of shake powder to mix for your pre and post workout shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the gym and feel pumped, excited and better then you have in a long time. When you get home and start to relax you start feeling the aches and somehow... it is enjoyable... almost addictive. You like the burn your muscles feel. You go grocery shopping and buy more chicken then you thought possiblen to consume in a month and start the eating regimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the gym and Paul greets you the next day. </span></div></div>",

You feel a swell of pride as you see your new gym mates are more along the lines of Hercules versus the pudgy Patrick the Starfish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight is getting easier and easier and you are getting big really fast.
