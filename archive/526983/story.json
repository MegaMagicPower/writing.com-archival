This man, no, this...thing, was messing with her mind. It was wrong to kill people! She had felt positively sick when Gustov had murdered that poor boy. To the human eye it looked as if he had just been given a rather violent hickey and then tossed aside, but Mina was certain that Tommy had been killed; and it had been at the hands of this creature before her! Firmly resolved, she glared up at the shadowy figure.<br>\r\n\"I don't need to give you a chance!\" She screamed. <br>\r\nHis eyes turned sad, and he released his hold on her face. \"You are right, of course.\" he said softly, making no further move to back away from her close proximity. \"I can find no excuse for you to take pity on a creature like me, other than my plea of loneliness that I know you feel as well. Mina, I've watched  you lose all that you hold dear, and I know better than anyone else that you have little to live for now. No family, no career, and no love prospects.\"<br>\r\nHere Mina attempted a feeble protest, which Gustuv ignored. It was all true, the half-life she had been living since her sister's death had hardly seemed worth the effort of waking up each morning. There was next to nothing keeping her from taking her own life, just to end her miserable existance.\"I merely thought\" Gustuv continued, \"that you'd be interested in knowing that there's more out there, that this mortal shell you cling to is the mere tip of the ice burg.\" <br>\r\nHer resolve was failing, and worse, he seemed to know it. He took a step closer to her, now merely inches from her face. \"My dear girl, don't waste your potential on life, come instead with me, where I will show you the world through eyes you couldn't imagine!\"<br>\r\nHe was becoming quite impassioned now, she could see it in his eyes. Damn those two spheres, they looked so trustworthy! The sensible half of Mina was faintly aware that this whole night was impossible, that the man before her shouldn't exist. Or at the very least he was some sort of lunatic. But the other half of Mina, the less sensible one, was becoming stronger and stronger in this war of her mind. Crazy though it seemed, there was an irresistible appeal to this offer; though she didn't know yet exactly what this offer was. But surely it could beat the life she was living here?<br>\r\n\"Please\"Gustuv mummerd, his passion dulled down from his fiery torrent to a smoldering gaze. \"Please come, Mina. End my loneliness. If I don't have you by my side, what little joy that have in life will fade away.\" <br>\r\nMina swallowed. \"That's-uh-, pretty forward to hear from someone I just met 15 minutes ago...\" <br>\r\nGustuv waved the objection off with his hand. \"I've been watching you for some time, please do not think that I have made my decision lightly. You, and only you, are the one that I want.\"<br>\r\nIf these pretty speeches weren't completely melting Mina, then his looks certainly were. She gave a faint nod to him, barely an assent before he grinned in such a way that could only be described as a smirk. Not wasting any time, he swooped in and captured her mouth with his own possessively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We started walking, hand in hand, and eventually I developed what my sister had always called \"tunnel vision.\" I could only see this strange man in front of me, sometimes turning down a street or cutting across a lawn. But I never realized I was at his house until he stopped and faced me full on. <br>\r\n\"I suppose you're wondering why I brought you here?\" he asked silkily. <br>\r\nI could barely nod, I was following his lips as he spoke. I wished he would kiss me again. Almost unconsciously, I took a step forward, and then another, until I was right in front of him. And there I stayed.<br>\r\nI've been watching your family for a long time. You see, back before your father was born, his great, great grandfather had an interesting profession. He was a vampire hunter.\"<br>\r\nHe paused to see how this news would affect me, but I let him continue. <br>\r\n\"My....father....was an acquaintance of his. I'm afraid that I can't tell you all of the details just yet, but what you need to know is that your great, great grandfather destroyed him. I have been following your family ever since, seeking revenge. Unfortunately, each generation of the Patterson family was angelically good, so I found myself unable to harm them without reasonable cause. Until your father started becoming aggressive towards your sister, that is. As soon as he landed the first blow, I knew that I had my chance. I am sorry that I didn't kill him before he did any real damage, I confess I never thought him capable of murdering his own child. But I was mistaken, and it has cost her her life. I would like to apologize.   <br>\r\nI blinked once. twice. Three times. A minute ago, all I had known about this guy was that he was hotter than hell and that I wanted him. I started to view him in many different ways, my brain processing all of the new information lightning fast. <br>\r\nHis father was old enough to know an ancestor that I'd never heard of. My brain jumped towards a word he had just used, \"vampire hunter\". So was he a vampire? The stranger in front of me morphed into a ruthless monster, just waiting to suck my blood. I shuddered. But then I thought of what he said next. He had killed my father in order to save my sister?  And myself? Another morphing took place, and suddenly he was a knight in shining Armour, saber drawn, and ready to protect me.<br>\r\n I felt numb, but his eyes were searching mine, waiting for an answer, so I forced myself to speak.<br>\r\n\"And now that you've had you're revenge, what are you planning on doing?\" I asked in a rather croaky voice, as if I had just woken up. <br>\r\nHere he grinned. \"Who says my revenge is completed?\" And with that he closed the gap between us, roughly grabbing my waist and crushing me towards him. <br>\r\nI was so surprised by this violent act that my mouth opened in a small \"Oh\" of shock. He immediately took advantage of this vulnerability. Before I quite knew that I was doing it, I was kissing him back. His hand went to the hem of my skirt and yanked it down along with my panties. I didn't feel exposed at all, only glad this barrier was removed. My leg hooked around his almost automatically, and I could feel a grin under the stranger's kiss.<br>\r\nSuddenly a small glimmer of reason jabbed at my sharply from inside my head. Was this his revenge? Sleeping with the daughter of his enemy, the last of the Pattersons? I felt so uncertain that I pulled back a little. <br>\r\nOh, come on, now isn't the time to get cold feet, baby. Isn't this what you wanted?\" <br>\r\nBefore I could respond, he started trailing kisses down my neck, nibbling playfully. What should I do? I wanted him, but this guy was a murderer. How did I know that he wasn't out to get me right after he took what he wanted?<br>\r\nHe started unbuttoning my blouse, and we made eye contact for a moment. <br>\r\n\"Upstairs?\" he asked, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
