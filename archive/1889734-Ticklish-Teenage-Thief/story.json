She has long silky black hair with short strands framing her face, and her hair is often tied into a bun with strands sticking upwards. She has a small, slender framed body with smooth light-tan skin, standing at five foot and two inches with lithe arms and legs. She has medium-sized breasts, curvy hips, and a flat stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attire is composed of a black strapless zip-front bra, a thin, flowy black vest that drapes down to her knees, a pair of shorts that covers only a few inches of her thighs, and a pair of black boots that zips up to her upper thighs at the front. She also wears a light-cyan scarf around her neck, matching the light-cyan outlines that borders the center of her vest, the upper rim of her shorts, and the outer edge of her boots. She wears black-plated armor on her forearms and the back of her hands for protection. Her vest is always seen unzipped, revealing her bare midriff in the open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Appearence: </b><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/71fe/f/2018/175/b/2/assassin_2_by_pyrobarrage-d92s5vq.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://orig00.deviantart.net/71fe/f/201...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoose a storyline below:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The Blackbeard Pirates have terrorized the seas, raiding onto merchant ships to steal their valuables, and kidnapping women.

Thick layers upon layers of trees, bushes, and vines blocked much of her vision of what lies ahead. Roots and tall grass covered the entirety of the earthy ground, forcing her to meander her way towards the center of the land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the intruding girl, there were traps laid out all over the jungle.

She had spend over the past hour meandering through the jungle, cautiously making sure she doesn't trip in the midst of the darkness. Her patience and stealth were rewarded as the intruder could see a large towering pyramidal silhouette in the middle of this giant patch of nature. Based on her investigation, this giant stone structure was likely the headquarter of The Order of the Claw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukina approached the entrance with caution, wielding her short sword in her right hand. From the looks of the thunderclouds casting its shadows over the terrain, it wouldn\u2019t be long until rain decided to fall upon her. She wasn\u2019t so nitpicky about getting wet, but her main target, Shi Chi, was likely within the large exotic pyramidal structure. Her first task in this mission would be to infiltrate their current hideout as stealthily as possible. Without knowledge on their numbers or individual strengths, it would be unwise to make a scene. Erasing the sound of her footsteps, the young assassin silently entered inside with the lights of the tiki torches lighting the passageway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the downpour of the rain pattering from outside the entrance, the assassin went deeper into the enemy's hideout; the looming tiki torches flickered shadows wildly onto the dusty brick walls of the place at set intervals. While the timing of the rain almost seemed too convenient, there wasn't anything she saw which could have led it to be suspicious. Finally reaching a forking path, Yukina scanned ahead. While the left path led to a long corridor with multiple holes in the floor and sidewalls, the right path led to a looming dark pit of unknown depths with handholds on the ceiling - akin to monkey bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two forked paths in front of her, she had a decision to make. Both appeared like some variant of traps to her. The left had suspicious looking holes on the floor and walls while the other had a pit with handholds on the ceilings. Given her speed and acrobatic skills, she was confident enough to go through either side, provided that there wasn\u2019t an unexpected ambush. Ideally, she would choose the one that leads her to San Chi the soonest, but without that lead, her next best option would be to pick the safest one. If anything started to fly or creep out of those holes, then she would be greatly outnumbered. On the other hand, if she chose to use the handlebars on the left path, then whatever was within the pit of unknown depths might not be able to reach her. Assuming no traps, the left side was without a doubt the easiest the bypass, but it may also carry the greater amount of risk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukina chose the ___ path.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She placed the handle of her sword within her mouth to hold, leaving her hands free to begin clinging onto the handlebars on the ceiling as she begins to cross to the other side of the pit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the rusted metal, Yukina slowly made her way across the chasm. While it was by no means impossibly far, she still had several feet more to cross before her feet could safely touch down on the lip of the other side. Bare abdomen muscles tensed, the assassin continued to place one arm after the other, making sure not to drop her only weapon into the deep dark pit. While it would have made for a good test of its depth, it definitely would leave her defenseless should she meet any foes on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow lucky will she be in making it across?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only five more handles to go, the youth felt incredibly vulnerable and defenseless throughout the entire time. Her stomach and armpits were fully exposed, and her mouth was busy clinging onto the handle of her bladed weapon by gritting her teeth. As luck would have it, the girl reached the other end of the giant gaping hole. She jumped down, landed softly onto her feet, and took a few quick steps away from the edge of the giant hole in the ground behind her. She didn\u2019t know what might be down there, but she\u2019d rather not find out. For the time being, the nubile assassin took the sword out of her mouth, gripping it in her right hand before furtively exploring what might be up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStalking the ancient Mayan corridors ahead of her, Yukina felt the hallway getting narrower and narrower. Eventually forced to crawl on her hands and knees, the dark tunnel converged towards a small square opening with faint, dim lights from the torches. She continued to clamber the small, cramped space; her slender figure just barely squeezing through the opening until her head was poking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention to the large room in front of her, various workers in black clothes could be seen milling about under bright spotlights, carrying various objects to and from. In the center of the buzz, a woman wearing an unbuttoned lab coat stood firm, her long black hair tied in a ponytail. \"Alright everyone, chop chop! We've got to get all these gems and artifacts to the landing zone by one hour, or you know what the big boss lady will do with all of us! So put your backs into it!\" Satisfied at the slight increase in drive around her, the woman quickly got back to her table filled with papers and scrolls, scribbling down another few mental calculations she made in the span of a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Yukina get noticed?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Little by little, her entire upper body was sticking out of the tight opening until suddenly the square opening caved in as a heavy block of stone weighed on top of her buttocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, the assassin twisted and turned, but she was stuck. Her entire torso was sticking out as her legs were outstretched in the confined space of the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, who do we have here?\" The woman in the lab coat made confident strides towards the uninvited guest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukina raised her short sword in a defensive position despite being, but her positioning made her body feel inclined to just dangle down towards the ground below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of the woman\u2019s fingers, two large men quickly approached the helpless girl from opposite sides, each securing both of her arms. One of them sharply twisted her arm, disarming her of her sword which was then handed over the woman who appeared to be the boss of this group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI supposed it would be rude to not give my name. It's Felicity,\u201d said the black-haired woman. \u201cAnd what might your name be?\u201d She asked while analyzing the girl\u2019s bladed weapon. Seconds later, there was no response. \u201cNot very talkative, huh? Let\u2019s see if we can fix that. Tie her up!\u201d She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two apprehenders brought Yukina\u2019s wrists together before locking them in a pair of handcuffs. They then raised her arms up and over her head, causing her flexible spine to arch in a curve. There was a metal hook already nailed straight into the wall above her where here the chain of her cuffs would be hooked onto. The two men stepped back, watching to see the girl naturally struggling against her restraints to test out her chances of escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will take care of Yukina?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">There existed an island with a history of scientists who specialized in genetic modification. Many beasts and monsters were created and caged in laboratories, but they could not be tamed and were locked away. Born as the daughter of two scientists, Yukina grew up as a genetically-modified human subject of a secretive experiment aimed to combat aging which would ultimately meant eternal youth. For over sixteen years, she was raised in captivity of an underground laboratory, constantly monitored as she grew up into an adolescent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had gained an extraordinary healing rate. Any flesh wounds or fractured bones would heal completely within hours with no signs of scars. It was theorized that she possessed eternal youth, unable to age past her prime. However, there was an unintended side effect to the experiment. Her sense of touch was ten times more sensitive than the average human. A plentiful amount of ticklish experimentations was conducted on her throughout her life, occasionally used as punishment for misbehavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, the laboratory was attacked by an escaped monster. In the midst of chaos, Yukina escaped and became an outlaw. Homeless, she fled from the island, lived on the streets, and survived as a skilled thief. However, a bounty of a hundred grand was placed on her head. She was marked as a wanted criminal. While the public views her grand theft as the reason for her high bounty, the real reason was that her body was sought after by many organizations to unlock the secrets of immortality. Unfortunately for them, the seventeen year old thief very much enjoys her freedom to roam the world in which she was deprived of for most of her life and never wanted to go back to a laboratory ever again.<br>\r\n</td>",
