I'd done my best to  keep out of sight, and had for the most part been successful, but that was about to change. just as i was about to enter the main lab where the chemical 'x2976' was kept, i let my guard down and was spotted. I looked at the guard and he looked back at me with equal surprise, then he brought his gun to bear and we began trading shots. I took cover and the alarms began blaring out. all that noise accompanied by the sound of ricocheting lead was enough to spike my adrenaline. I returned fire a few times, and then dove into the lab. As i ran i continued firing at my pursuers behind me and scooped up a canister of the chemical, but what happened next seemed to go in slow motion. A stray shot from the guards hit a tank of gas built into the wall, and it exploded with fiery rage. Shrapnel scratched my face and, more importantly, pierced the canister i was holding. Its explosion set off a chain reaction that torched the building and ripped me apart, causing me enough pain that when darkness came, it was a welcome comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange part is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up  six months later in a hospital bed, without even a scratch. Not even a scar. I lay there for a moment thinking it must have all been a bad dream, until i took in my surroundings... everything was massive, and i couldn't have been any more than 2 inches tall. everything in my immediate vicinity was tailored to my size, but beyond that, the walls, the lamp, the draws... it was all huge. i started to panic, until i spotted the doctor coming over, and the n questions just started pouring out of my mouth. She was cute, black hair with green eyes, and a decent sized ass.<br>\r\n\u2018\u2019what happened, where am I, why am I so small, who are you\u2019\u2019 I said. She stifled a little smile and said \u2018\u2019I\u2019m Dr Thurlestone, but you can call me julie. You\u2019re at Moorhaven medical centre London, because you were in a severe accident whilst on mission, which left you the size you are\u2019\u2019. It all came flooding back to you and you had one more question. \u2018\u2019 how long have I been out ?\u2019\u2019. She shifted a little, looking almost nervous, and came I  so close I could feel her warm peppermint breath. \u2018\u2019Six months\u2019\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the weeks that followed, I spent most of my time finding my feet again, with the help of Julie. Having to hold onto her finger whilst my legs got used to walking again. <br>\r\nEventually (once I was fully mobile again) she got permission to take me home with her, and set me up a little bedroom on her bedside table. The rules were: No peaking, Don\u2019t do anything dangerous, and not to go in the bathroom without her, as she was worried that I might fall in the toilet, or get washed down the drain. Whilst living with her for a few months, we grew close, and we found out more about each other. I found out she was 34, had a daughter of 19 at college studying music and dance and her fella buggered off after birth,  she loves peanut butter, and having her feet rubbed. She found out I was 26, am fascinated by technology, love extreme sports, and hate being tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mornings usually go, we\u2019d get up and take a shower. I\u2019d stand In the soap dish and face away, out of respect for her privacy, and we\u2019d take our shower.<br>\r\nI later came to the realization that I must be showering in the water that falls off her, which from then on made me blush every time we had one.<br>\r\nAfter we\u2019d dried and got dressed, we\u2019d get breakfast, and I would have a little off of whatever she made, and she is a damn good cook.<br>\r\nWhen it was time for her to go to work, she\u2019d slip me in her top pocket, next to her left breast, to give me a comfortable stowage. She didn\u2019t mind this as both of us knew it wasn\u2019t meant in a sexual manner, but it did prove interesting if she had to run somewhere, carry something, or squeeze up against something.<br>\r\nWhen we got home in the evening, it\u2019d usually be a mix of housework, movies and TV. Lunch and dinner were much the same as breakfast.<br>\r\nOn Saturdays we\u2019d just chill and have fun. One Saturday evening we were giggling away, whilst watching something funny on TV, when she looked down at me in her lap. \u2018\u2019um... </span></div></div>",

Now she was the one stunned. \u201cwell...do you...\u201d \u201cyes\u201d I replied quicker this time.<br>\r\nSo she picked me up smiling, and deposited me at her bare feet on the coffee table. I\u2019d seen them before as she walked about the house, as she usually went barefoot, and a couple of times I\u2019d even thought how pretty they looked, but I\u2019d never feigned to get too close for fear of being squished. Now I was closer than ever. They didn\u2019t smell too bad, a mix of perfume and musky, but on the whole rather pleasant. The bottoms of her feet were slightly moist and soft to the touch, and when I rubbed she let out cute little noises of pleasure. She also found it immensely funny when I got stuck between her toes for a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ndoes she help?</span></div></div>",

I decided to delve \"how so\" \"well when she was fourteen she tried to get me and her teacher 'Mr Johnson' to go out, by causing a disruption in class, getting me called to the school, and the disappearing when we were in the same room together and locking the door\". I found this highly amusing, and fell over in her palm laughing. she saw the funny side too and added \"Its not that he wasn't attractive, but I've never heard a man talk for so long about the dangers of modern technology, and how it turning all of our brains to mush\". This just made me laugh all the more. \"and another time when she was sixteen,\" she continued \"when she had her own way of standing up to the school bully. She made him think she fancied him over the course of weeks, and then invited him behind the school stage curtain for some 'alone' time\". What he didn't know was half the school was in the auditorium expecting a presentation on the human body, and well... i suppose they got it when Katie and her friend pulled back the curtains to see him wearing... well... nothing\" she giggled. I had only just recovered from my last bout of laughter and i was off again. When i finally caught my breath and my stomach stopped hurting i said \"not to sound weird, but I'm looking forward to meeting your daughter\". \"don't worry,\" she replied noticing a slight sense on nervousness in my voice (me of all people, an international spy 'nervous') \"she's nice, she'll like you\". I smiled up at her \"Thanks, so when does she get back?\" \"In a couple of months, so enough time for me to tell you more embarrassing stories\" she chuckled, \"now, shall we...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We went to bed still snickering, and talking about what the future may hold. I rested quite contently, and my thoughts drifted to the practicality of being my size. How strong was i, evidently not very considering i couldn't get out of Julie's toes on my own. How fast could I run was another, and how durable was I. I figured all of this would be answered in time and allowed myself to drift off into the warm embrace of my little bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few weeks flew by, with me still finding the limitations and perks of my new size, going to work with Julie, and trying to find some solution that would get me back to normal size. The later has had no progress, as it appears to the doctors that my blood is no longer comprised of the normal elements of the human body In fact they say that its a miracle i am still alive with all the chemicals coursing through my system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of months Katie  (Julie\u2019s daughter), came home on summer break. She looked stunning, and we got on really quite well. She has a habit of walking around in sports bras and yoga pants, and looks remarkably similar to her mother, just a touch younger. She reckoned it was kinda nice having a \u2018cute little guy\u2019 around the place. Me... I\u2019m still adjusting to having two \u2018cute giants\u2019 around the place.<br>\r\nI will be honest. It\u2019s kinda nice having someone around who I can break the rules with. Especially now that I\u2019ve moved into Katie\u2019s room. When I asked her why Julie moved me out of her room she said \u201ccoz apparently, I need a 'little' more responsibility . Why... don\u2019t you want to be in here with little ol me?\u201d she asked giving the biggest set of puppy dog eyes ever. \u201cdon\u2019t be stupid\u201d was my curt retort.<br>\r\nNow when I said breaking the rules, I only really meant the second one in regards to fun stuff, Like me jumping off the top banister and Katie catching me at the bottom. <br>\r\nShe\u2019s also athletic, and takes me with her on her runs to keep her company. I\u2019ll usually sit on her shoulder and hold onto her hair, though I have nearly slipped a few times when she gets sweaty. Her retort when I brought up the subject was \u201cwell if ya do slip, ya not gonna fall too far\u201d she said with a wry smile.<br>\r\nShe\u2019s also a bit of a trickster and a flirt, like when I woke up one morning with her bare ass rested on the bedside table, not 5 inches from me. Though when stuff like this happens, the answer is always playfully \u201cI forgot you were there\u201d.<br>\r\nTowards the back end of summer break, we ordered pizza. Julie and Katie sat opposite each other with me and the pizza between their legs. All the different smells were driving my head nuts. The feet, the pizza, the... something else I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on. Katie took a slice and tore me off a little piece that was the size of a large pizza to me.  It was great being able to talk to them about science, technology, each other, just having a good time. Then Julie said \u201cso, me and Katie were talking, and we decided that you should decide weather you want to stay here with me, or go back to college with Katie?\" I scratched my head looking confused \"why are you asking me this?\" \"well me and mom both don't mind looking after you, so we thought it best to ask you who you wanted to stay with... for now\" Katie said with a little playfulness at the end. They both looked at me expectantly, and i faltered. On one hand i had loving, caring, kind Julie. And on the other i had kind, fun, playful Katie. \"Um... well... I guess I'll go with...</span></div></div>",

When she lowered me to the ground, Julie spoke again with a little playfulness in her voice, \u201cjust remember, if I get any bad reports from Katie...\u201d she chucked a piece of pizza about my size into her mouth and swallowed it whole, tracing the small lump down her throat, continuing between her breasts and finally patting her belly, \u201d...I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make a delicious snack\u201d. I took a couple of nervous steps backwards towards Katie, staring at Julie\u2019s bare midriff, imagining myself in there instead of the pizza, trying to get out of the endless dark depths of her stomach. Julie\u2019s new kind of playfulness scared me a little, that is until she grabbed me and pulled me into a hug herself. \u201cdon\u2019t be so silly\u201d she said, \u201cyou know I\u2019d never do such a thing\u201d and gave me a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, after we\u2019d said our goodbyes to julie, and she\u2019d made me promise to come back, me and Katie caught a taxi to the nearest train station a couple of miles away, and got a ticket to Edinburgh. The journey took the best part of a day, with the changing of trains, the underground etc. Whenever we went through a barrier she would hide me in her coat pocket, so I wasn\u2019t noticed. There was no point in paying for 2 tickets when one of us could be hidden on the other, haha. <br>\r\nIt was a little different when the conductor came round on the train though, as she didn\u2019t spot him until he was almost atop us. <br>\r\nIn a reaction she knocked me from the table I was on, (reading a magazine by hopping from page to page), down into her boot. Luckily she was wearing knee high boots, so I only slid down to her calf. I still wasn\u2019t too sure about my new durability, but I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to test it out under her foot. I heard snippets off chatter, then he wished her a good day and moved on.<br>\r\nShe reached down into her boot to retrieve me, and brought me back up to the table. \u201cwell as far as conductors go he was quite friendly\u201d she commented. \u201cyeah, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019d have been a whole lot less friendly if he knew we were short changing him\u201d I said. We laughed and continued, \u201cso, you live alone?\u201d I asked. \u201cnope, I live with five others in a really big house\u201d she replied, \u201cyeah right\u201d I said sarcastically,  \u201cno I\u2019m serious\u201d she said and pulled out her phone. She flicked through pictures of the place and her friends. Listing them one by one \u201cOK, so top left is Faye (brunette and quite fit), bottom left is Nikita(brunette, tanned skin, gamer girl), middle is April(redhead, glasses, really cute tech head), top right is Dani(blonde, fashionista and cheerleader), and bottom right is Laura(blonde uber fit martial arts expert). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the picture stunned until she closed it, then I turned to her. \u201cso for the foreseeable future I\u2019m going to be living in a house at 2 inches tall, with six attractive females?\u201d \u201cyeah, pretty much\u201d she grinned down at me, \u201cright... any survival tips?\u201d I asked, \u201cmmm... don\u2019t try to wake Faye, she bites In her sleep, ya pretty safe with April, don\u2019t go anywhere near Niki\u2019s feet, that\u2019s coming from someone my size, Dani can be a bit clutzy on the rare occasion, and just don\u2019t piss Laura off, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a martial art she hasn\u2019t mastered.\u201d She reeled off. \u201ccool, thanks\u201d I said with a slight nervous laugh. \u201caww, don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll be fine\u201d she reassured me, \u201coh, also...just watch out for any silliness and playfulness. You already know how I am, and there\u2019s a lot more of it with the others in the house\u201d \u201cRoger that, watch out for full moons\u201d I laughed. She giggled as well and added \u201camong other things\u201d.<br>\r\nThe rest of the trip was pretty uneventful, and it was evening by the time we got into Edinburgh. Her home here was another taxi ride out to the nice suburban area known as \u2018the states\u2019, after what American suburban streets look like in the movies. The house we pulled up to looked quite American itself. We walked up the porch and just before going inside she said to me \u201cnow, when we go inside everyone is going to want to meet you, so it may be a bit chaotic\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s fine\u201d I said, \u201cnothing wrong with a little chaos\u201d. She smiled and rang the bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was April, who answered the door. \u201cguys, Katie\u2019s back!\u201d she called to the others, then embraced Katie in a hug, nearly dislodging me in the processes, and led her through to the living room. April sat down, and they all sat there in a row, looking expectant. \u201cso... your text said you were bringing someone back with you\u201d Niki said with an Irish accent. \u201cwell I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t see him when you hugged me\u201d she said, gesturing to April. She looked confused, so Katie picked me off her shoulder and placed me on the coffee table in front of them. <br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, my world got a lot smaller. The girls all crowded in around me and started asking both me and Katie a cavalcade of questions. Who am I, where am I from, where Katie found me... they came thick and fast but we answered them all. When things calmed down, Katie went to make us all a cup of tea, leaving me with the girls. \u201cso you\u2019re lucky to be alive then\u201d Laura said genuinely amazed \u201cyeah, even if it did cost me my size\u201d I replied. \u201cawww, poor little guy. I just wanna give him a big hug\u201d Faye cooed. \u201cgo ahead\u201d Katie shouted from the kitchen, and stuck her head around the door with a wink. <br>\r\nI realized a little too late that this was one of the playful moments I was supposed to look out for, as I was hoisted to Faye\u2019s chest and was winded by the immensity of the hug, her large soft breasts adding to the power. When I was put back on he table, I layed down, dizzy and unbalanced. Katie laughed at the sight upon her return, and thought it better if we all went to bed, since it was getting late. So we took our tea up to the bedrooms.<br>\r\nKatie shared a room with Laura, Faye with Dani, and Niki with April. <br>\r\nLaura cleared a space on the dresser, and Katie asked her if it was OK for me to borrow one of her towels for the night, until we could get me some proper stuff tomorrow. She said it was OK and chucked Kat a towel. She folded it into a little bed and made sure I was comfy before bedding down herself. We all said goodnight and went to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The movements she made were very delicate and quiet, probably so as not to wake anyone up. She crept downstairs, opened the front door and quietly clicked it back into place behind her. The gentle swaying turned into rocking, and rocking turned into a rough ride, as she went from walking, to jogging, to running. As she ran I was tossed around and into things for what seemed like ages, until we finally came to a stop. When I went to get up I realized my ankle was caught in something. I tried hard to free myself until I was distracted by the zipper opening. light poured into the bag as it was unzipped, and was followed by a hand which grasped whatever I was caught on. I, along with it, was hoisted into the air, and met with Laura\u2019s massive visage . Turns out the thing I was caught on was the inside seam of her sports shorts. She placed them on the ground and stood in the two holes, placing a foot either side of me. She bent down and began to pull them up as I tried frantically to free myself. No matter how hard I tried, the material would not break. With her legs sliding past on either side of me and her ass rapidly approaching I yelled as loud as I could, hoping my last ditch effort would grab her attention... but it didn\u2019t. And my yells were muffled as I was dragged deeply and firmly between her buttocks.<br>\r\nThe next two hours were a living hell. Every time she did squats I was subject to crazy amounts of pressure as her ass squeezed in on me, and if she wasn\u2019t doing squats it\u2019d be sit ups grinding her ass on the floor, or the rower thrusting her ass back and forth. Every single constricted movement of her ass made me feel as if I was going to pop, and the fact that every so often she\u2019d let out a little fart that had nowhere to go made it inhospitable, especially since I ended up breathing them.<br>\r\nShe did however save the worst til last... a full hour on the bike with the seat shoving me even further up. Far enough up actually, that I nearly ended up \u2018inside\u2019 her asshole.<br>\r\nWhen she\u2019d finished she went back to the changing rooms to get a shower. Whilst having a drink she noticed the wedgie she had accumulated and used her thumb and finger to pull it out. This of course finally dislodged me and brought me away from the material. Still unable to move through exhaustion, I fell out of the bottom of her shorts and, ironically, back into the bag she was standing next to. As she reached down to get her wash bag, she finally noticed me atop her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she react?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She was NOT happy. \"What the hell are you doing in my gym bag!?\". Regaining some semblance of cognitive function, I tried to explain what had happened. Unfortunately it just came out as a load of babel, and she still looked pissed. \u201cwell, if you\u2019re gonna go snooping around in a girls gym bag, you should have everything that goes with it\u201d she said as she reached for me. I tried to run but had nowhere to go and was thus caught in her grasp. She brought me up to her face still angry, and used her free hand to unclasp her sports bra. I was then unceremoniously dumped into the wet sweaty bra, screwed up, and chucked back in the bag. Whilst she showered and stormed home, the sweat seeped through the bra and onto me, coating me and getting in my mouth and ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow in the last few of her storming back to he house, I managed to wriggle my way free from my sweaty prison, and laid in wait for my first opportunity to make a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she set the bag down inside the door, and undid the zipper just enough, I launched from the bag and took off across the floor. This surprised her a little and she took off after me. Guess I answered that question from before, how fast can i run, apparently very when it counts. I ran into the kitchen, where the girls were having breakfast, \"heeeeelp\" I yelled as Laura charged in after me. Niki scooped me up before Laura could make contact, and April held her back. \"whoa whoa whoa, whats this all about\" April said. \"I caught that little creep snooping around in my gym bag\" she replied. The girls all turned to me \"Is that true?\" April asked me, \"No i fell in there from her shorts\" i said without thinking. Katie leaned in, and with the most serious tone I've ever heard, said \"explain\". I blushed furiously and began my tail. \"Laura, you lent me a towel last night to sleep on didn't you\" I began, \"yeah so\" she replied still annoyed. \"when you went to the gym this morning where did you pick up your towel form\" I continued \"well, the dresser...\" she trailed off at the end, \"oh shit\" she said and put her hand to her forehead. \"yeah. i kinda got pulled into your bag with your towel\" I said. \"But that doesn't explain how you got in her shorts\" Katie said, and you replied \"well... i kinda got caught on the inside seam of her shorts and... well... when she put them I... went places. I tried to get out I swear\". By now we were both the color of a London bus. \"so my whole session you were...\" Laura pointed to her butt. I nodded, \"sorry\" she said quietly, \"yeah, sorry too\" i said, \"not a place I'd wish to be again\". She perked up a little at that, and took on a more playful demeanor \"so are you saying i don't have a nice ass\", April released her and she stood over me hands on hips eyebrow raised. \"no no, that's not what i meant, you have a great ass... wait wait, i mean... not like that, its um...I ...I\" I stumbled over myself. She giggled and shushed me \"you should be honored, men have received broken bones for touching my ass, and you got the full experience. Truth be told I'm surprised you survived, my buttocks must have be pushing on a whole lot of pressure\" she said with a playful grin, \"yeah, we still good though?\" I said bashfully. \"Sure\" she held out her little finger for me to shake, \"so long as the next time you try that, i know\" she said with a wink, which made my face feel like it was going to catch fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So girls... and cute tiny boy, what are we doing today? It is the last couple of days before we have to start class again\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDo you want to play a game\u201d she said, \u201cSure\u201d I replied. She put me on the coffee table and went over to a cupboard and looked inside. \u201cAh damn\u201d she muttered, \u201cwhat\u201d I said, \u201cI had a clear out not so long ago, and got rid of most of the board games. Since my daughter Katie isn't living at home anymore\u201d she replied. \u201cWell, you said most. What do ya have\u201d I attempted to resolve the situation, then she said \u201cwe've got chess, but its missing half the pieces and is boring as hell, or we've got monopoly but we'll need to make some money of our own\u201d. I weighed up our options. She was right chess was boring as hell, and to be fair, how hard could it be to make some monopoly money. It was a no brainer. \u201cI guess we'll have to go for monopoly\u201d I said. She threw her hair back \u201cthank god you said that, the last time I played chess was at med school, and I fell asleep\u201d, I chuckled and she brought over the box and set it beside me on the table. \u201cI'll be right back\u201d she said, and raced upstairs, presumably to get paper and pens. As I sat there thinking about my luck I got to thinking, maybe it wasn't too bad. Sure my life as a spy was probably over, but at least I was here with Julie, and Let's be honest, she's a knockout, and kind, and fun. I snapped out of thinking when I heard her footsteps coming downstairs, carrying a few sheets of paper and a pen pot as predicted. When she got to the edge of the couch however, her haste caused her to trip on it and send the supplies flying my way. I tried to jump out of the way but the stone pen pot hit me square on. it felt like it went through me as it hit the glass surface of the coffee table causing it to shatter. The ground fell away form beneath my feet and for a second I was weightless, then I hit the actual ground and the pen pot fell on me once more and rolled away, pens and paper strewn all around me. I was dazed, vision a little blurry, but on the whole I felt strangely fine. When i could focus again I saw Julie's visage hovering directly above me. \"Oh my god, oh my god, are you OK please tell me you're OK. you're not dead are you\" she panicked. i coughed up a pained laugh \"no i don't think so. actually i feel oddly... completely fine\", I heaved myself up and checked all my appendages were in place, they were. Nothing felt amiss, then I heard Julie's voice again, a little calmer this time \"how did you survive that. The pot isn't light and it hit you directly, you fell the equivalent on a five story building, it hit you again and you're... completely fine?\" \"Yeah, I think so\" I replied \"and you're sure it doesn't hurt anywhere?\" she said, \"not anymore. Obviously it hurt when it hit me, but not as much as you'd think. Like... getting hit with a soccer ball\" I replied. \"Hmm\" she hummed thinking as i looked up at her \"mind if i try something?\" she said curiously, \"what's that\" I said, \"test out your durability\" she replied. \"How are you going to do that?\" i said, she just looked at me and wiggled her fingers. \"i don't know\" i said with some caution, \"listen\" she said carefully, \"i need to know how durable you are if you're going to stay here for a while. I'll just press you between my hands and if it gets too much just say and I'll stop\". i thought it over and she did have a point, knowing my durability would be useful at my new size. \"OK, i trust you\" i said. She smiled gently, then picked me up and put me in the palm of her hand, \"remember, if it gets too much just say stop\" she said. i gave the thumbs up and she hovered her other hand over me. gently she pushed down on my body and i could feel the warmth and slight moisture of her hands. The pressure increased, but with very little pain, a slight uncomfort but nothing i couldn't handle. i closed my eyes as it increased further, and then light hit my closed eyelids. \"Still nothing yet\" i shouted presuming she thought it had got too much. \"Umm... open your eyes\" she said and i did. What I saw surprised me... i was completely flat in the palm of her hand, and then i begin to reform shape rapidly.<br>\r\nShe looked down with a look of being impressed and curious, \"well i guess we'll have to call you Mr indestructible\" she said with a slight laugh as i got up, \"good to know\" i said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that we cleared up the mess (Julie did most of it), and made our monopoly money. When we were about to start the game (now on the carpet) Julie said \"since its getting late how about we make this interesting?\", \"how so?\" i asked. \"Well lets say jail is endgame, and if you land on jail you go to 'jail'\" she said, \"what do you mean\" i asked. She didn't say anything, just took off her shirt leaving only a bra. i blushed and she saw it, \"oh you don't have to be bashful, we've known each other a little while now\" she said with a smile. She then grabbed a removable pen and drew a crude jailhouse on her toned stomach. i looked at her \"are you mad?\" i said, \"look, we already know you can't be hurt, the pot is proof of that. Are you scared you're gonna loose\" she taunted. in truth i was more nervous of going to 'jail', but her taunt got the better of me and i gave my response. \"Fine, but what do i get if you go to jail?\". She thought for a minute \"well tomorrow is Sunday, and if i go to jail then I'll do whatever you what for the whole day\". \"Seems fair\" i said. it was a 50/50 chance, and i liked the idea of being the boss for a day. \"Deal\" i said and we sealed it by shaking hands, well more like me shaking her pinkie. Then we began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwho went to jail?</span></div></div>",
