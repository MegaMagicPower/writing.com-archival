Your joints lodged their complaints against last night's conditions; with your bed overtaken with junk-food wrappers, curling up on the floor seemed like the easier decision.  A slightly faded blanket slides off of you as you rise.  Past the shot of pain from an emergent headache, you attempt to gather yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wrappers need to go in the trash.  Soon. Sleeping on the floor is killing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your computer hums in the corner.  Nausea gurgles up in you as you recall last night's \"session\".  And you left it on through the night.  Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wrappers are on the bed because the can is full of empty bottles.  Later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A momentary stretch eases your stiffness, if only slightly.  Accompanied by the obnoxious barking of your neighbor's dog, you resign yourself to the day.</span></div></div>",

The mirror was purposefully avoided, but you still feel like the shower was so much roomier in days long gone.  Putting on clothes was in a whole other league; you feel a shot of fear as you hold the work pants out in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They still fit, although they are annoyingly snug.  You finish dressing, and decide to leave without any breakfast.  You don't feel particularly hungry at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your self-consciousness follows you as you leave your home.  You tug at your shirt and alter your step to try and avoid feeling your body inside of your clothes, but nothing quite works.  The walk to the hardware store is short, at least, and however unfulfilling, your job should at least distract you from how you've been out-eating your uniform.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A \"Help Wanted\" hangs in the window that was not there during your shift last Sunday.  Perhaps one of week-day people got booted?  You enter, resolving to at least be here for the <b>second</b> half of your shift, to find the manager standing by the front counter.  His gaze rise from his clipboard, and turns into a glare as his eyes rest on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you decided to arrive after all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're very sorry you're late, sir.  You had a rough ni--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't. Care.  I did not care about excuses or 'sorry' last time, and I don't now.  Unless you somehow were in the hospital, only to show up looking fine now, or you're fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeble cover story.  Perhaps involving an alley fight.  But you know he wouldn't bite.  And even if there was a sliver of a chance he might, you just don't feel like you can muster up the will to bother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so.  You're out of warnings, we're done.  Buy something if you want, or leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was done.  It was over.  You thought over the lectures you had received about reliability in the past.  You thought about how much sense that sign makes in hindsight.  You try to think about anything but how you're going to pay your bills; you had been counting on this part-time job as extra income.  Why couldn't he cut you some slack? Or at least listen to you, for once?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The slight rumbling of your stomach brings you back to reality, in which you had been aimlessly wandering down the sidewalk.  It was time for a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
