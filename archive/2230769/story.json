The procedure is either a test of that relative's shrinking device, or a test of a microscopic submarine designed to fly into other people's bodies. The boy might have also accidentally activated said shrinking device and burns out, leaving him permanently shrunken in his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExposure to Virus, Sickness, or Chemical: The boy is shrunk down by an unknown agent. Whether a virus, sickness, or chemical, the exposure leaves him and possibly other boys his age an inch tall. He will have no one to rely on but his female relatives or any woman working where he contracted the shrinking agent, including his school or the hospital he's staying at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysical Genetic Disorder: The boy is born with \"reversal pituitary glands\" which shrinks his physical body as he grows older, including his muscles, organs, and skeleton. The boy will be shrunken down to the minimal size of 1 centimeter, but his glands will also be triggered by early stages of puberty and arousal, which is bad since some of his female relatives are either flirtatious or revealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagical Spells: The boy is shrunken down by a magical spell. In one route, he is shrunken by a stage magician during one of her magic tricks and intends to keep him that way. In another route, the boy is the victim of an occult ritual overseen by his female relatives. In another route, he is cursed by a black magic gypsy that he accidentally angered. In another route, the boy finds a magic spellbook stashed away in his family's attic and read the Latin texts, shrinking him down.</span></div></div>",

As a child, Tommy was doted on by his loving sister, Brianna, and initially volunteered to be the guinea pig for her experiments. As Tommy grew older, however, he realized that the side effects of Brianna's experiments have often humiliated him, thus making him cautious and distant from her. His cautious behavior has also turned hostile towards his brilliant sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Brianna Winslow<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 16 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes: </b>Blue<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5' 6\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 132 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Brianna Winslow is the second daughter of Kelly Winslow, the younger sister of Lindsey, and the older sister of Tommy and Wendy. Born with a gifted intelligence, Brianna consistently performed a variety of scientific experiments which some believed were years ahead of our time. Brianna constantly babies Tommy for being adorable and has often used him as the perfect guinea pig for her experiments. Her latest work with shrinking technology could open new avenues for the evolution of medical science. Most of her scientific experiments happen in the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Kelly Winslow<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 42 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Light brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 6' 3\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 187 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Kelly Winslow is the mother of her daughters, Lindsey, Brianna, and Wendy, and her only son, Tommy. After a messy divorce following the discovery of her husband's cheating with his co-worker several years, Kelly acquired her children and the house and has long forgotten the incident. She loves and supports her children, but she is firm when it comes to the house rules. She works full-time at an office weekdays and returns home later in the afternoon, sometimes later on Friday evenings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Lindsey Winslow<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 21 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Light brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5' 9\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 172 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Lindsey Winslow is the eldest daughter of Kelly Winslow and the elder sister of Brianna, Tommy, and Wendy. As the eldest daughter, Lindsey sometimes takes command of the household while her mother is out working her catering business and is strict about the household rules. She goes to a nearby college where she's studying law practice and currently works part-time as a morning floor person at a pharamcy/convenience store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Wendy Winslow<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 9 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Curly brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 3' 8\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 105 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Wendy is the youngest daughter of Kelly Winslow  and the youngest sister of Lindsey, Brianna, and Tommy. The baby of the family, Wendy often pouts at the mention of being the little sister and often wishes to become bigger. Despite this, she loves her mom and her siblings dearly, especially Tommy since he often takes time out of his schedule to play with her. At her young age, Wendy is often curious and loves tiny creepy crawlies like ants, caterpillars, and spiders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b><br>\r\nBeing born the only boy in a household consisting of three sisters and a divorced mother is hard work for ten year-old Tommy Winslow. Being the little brother of a sixteen year-old sister with a high IQ and a genius scientific mindset is even harder work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was always the subject of his sister, Brianna 's scientific experiments ever since he was six years old. Initially, Tommy enjoyed being the guinea pig to test out Brianna\u2019s scientific prototypes that seemed like his own personal toys, like an artificially intelligent bed which spoke in their mother\u2019s simulated voice, or a bubble wand which was designed for him to blow any bubbles in different shapes, sizes, and dimensions, apart from their typical spherical shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grew older, however, Tommy noticed how annoying Brianna was with her constant babying towards him and how dangerous her experiments had become. Experiments, such as an invisibility cloaking device that turned Tommy and his clothes invisible and a tonic to help increase his mental capacity, ended up having embarrassing flukes. The cloaking device ended up shortening and Tommy was visible again, but the cloaking device also ended up turning his clothes permanently invisible. The tonic ended up turning his skin a variety of wavy rainbow colors with brightly colored polka dots. In both instances, Tommy was exposed in front of his peers and was consistently laughed at, thereby labeling him the class outcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that moment on, Tommy did all he could to avoid Brianna and her experiments. He often found protection in the form of his forty-three year-old mother, Kelly and his twenty-two year-old oldest sister, Lindsey, who forbade Brianna from further experimenting on him. Tommy\u2019s nine year-old sister, Wendy even promised to hate Brianna forever if she ever did something so mean to him again. Yet, despite Tommy\u2019s best efforts to avoid his scientifically-obsessed sister and Brianna\u2019s word that she wouldn\u2019t experiment on him without consent, she always found a way to get him to become the subject of her experiments. The last time she did, she slipped an orange powder inside Tommy\u2019s orange juice designed to give him super speed, and it ended up energizing his speed to the point where he had no control over it for twelve hours. Brianna received a well-deserved scolding and punishment, but she privately vowed never to give up on her pursuit of scientific knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time around, Brianna knew that she would make Tommy an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, after Tommy returned from school, he became vigilant of his surroundings, wary of her presence lingering around the house. As he stepped inside, he was suddenly tackled by a massive weight and crushed in Brianna\u2019s signature overbearing bear hug. \u201cWelcome home, little brother! Did you learn anything new and exciting today?\u201d she asked in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrianna! Let go of me!\u201d Tommy screamed as he tried to break free from his tormentor\u2019s grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooo, I don\u2019t wanna let you go! I wanna give you my signature big sister hugs n\u2019 kisses!\u201d Brianna nuzzled her cheek against Tommy\u2019s cheek and gave him a big, wet smooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEwww, get off of me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy broke his arms free and pushed his overbearing sister away from him. He then hopped on his toes and held his fists up like a sports boxer, straining the meanest look his facial muscles could produce, but that only made Brianna fawn over him even more. \u201cAwww, look at you. You\u2019re surrounded by girls who wanna kiss you and hug you, and you\u2019re pushing them away and acting like a big strong man.\u201d Brianna wiped a tear away and sniffled. \u201cMy little brother is becoming a man already. I\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave me alone, Brianna!\u201d Tommy shouted. \u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to do and it\u2019s not working! I\u2019m not letting you experiment on me again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, but testing my experiments has always been a fundamental part of our relationship,\u201d Brianna whined, \u201cand speaking of which, I have a new experiment that I\u2019ve been working on as a personal pet project.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo away, I don\u2019t wanna hear about it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Tommy, hear me out at least!\u201d Brianna begged the boy. \u201cIt\u2019s a revolutionary invention that\u2019ll solve the world\u2019s hunger project and possibly medical science! It\u2019s a shrinking radiation that I\u2019ve been perfecting the past couple of weeks that allows anyone exposed to the radiation to safely shrink to the size of the bug, and it\u2019s worked so far! I\u2019ve been able to shrink organic fruit, my laboratory rats, and any nonorganic object that doesn\u2019t hold any value, and nothing\u2019s gone wrong so far! I only need a test subject to realize its success and I instantly thought of you, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m not going to get shrunken for your stupid brain!\u201d Tommy screamed. \u201cWhy would I even want to test it out for you!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s for the upcoming science exposition,\u201d Brianna answered. \u201cPlus, if you promise to help me out on this project, I\u2019ll never bother you with my \u2018loving big sister act\u2019 again. I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer seemed shady, but the trade-off was just too tempting to pass up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Tommy\u2019s answer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Tommy reluctantly, but willingly volunteers with the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Tommy harshly rejects Brianna's offer, prompting her to forcibly drag him to her laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Tommy harshly rejects Brianna's offer, but Brianna sends him down to the laboratory to retrieve something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No!\" Tommy snapped, breaking away from Brianna's iron-tight embrace and staring her down with righteous fury in his eyes. \"I said I don't want to be part of your stupid experiments again, but you don't listen! I'm sick of being your guinea pig, and I'm sick of you treating me like a little kid! No one wants to be friends with me because of your stupid experiments making me look like an idiot, and I'm sick of it! Stay away from me, Brianna! I hate your experiments, and I hate you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Brianna looked physically hurt from her younger brother's rant, her heart broken, shattered, and stamped on. \"I... I can't believe you just said that, Tommy. How could you say that, after all that we've been through together?\" A tear ran down her cheek and her lips quivered from the internal hurt. All of a sudden, something snapped inside her, her quivering lips stretched and hardened into a growling frown, her brows furrowed deep. \"You know what!? Fine! I tried being nice to you, Tommy, but forget it! You've really crossed the line here, Tommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy figured that he had let his temper go too far this time, but he figured too late as suddenly, his wrist was clamped in a tight, feminine fist, prompting him to yelp and squirm in her grasp. \u201cOW! OW! OW! Brianna, what are you doing!? Let me go!\" Tommy screamed, even louder as Brianna squeezed his wrist tighter. \"Okay, okay, Brianna, I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna yanked Tommy closer to her, held him against her, and pressed her face into his to showcase her furious outrage towards him. \"Shut up and listen, you little brat! I've had it up to here with your recent attitude towards me and my experiments! We used to be closer when we were younger, but now you're avoiding me and I don't appreciate it as much as I appreciate your contempt towards me and my experiments! If you really hate me that much, then forget being the loving big sister you need! Starting right now, I'll be the worst sister you'll ever have! I'll put you through the worst time of your life and then you'll be sorry you ever talked to me the way you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Brianna did to prove her point was drag her little brother by the wrist, pulling him with so much force, it put him through physical agony. Tommy wriggled and squirmed in his sister's surprisingly strong grasp. There were tears leaking from his eyes as he tried to pry away her fingers tightly clamping his hand. \"Brianna, please, let me go!\" he begged and pleaded, which fell on deaf ears. \"I'm sorry, okay!? Please stop tugging me like that! You're... you're hurting me...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna kicked open the basement door and with her weaponized signature iron embrace, she hoisted the screaming, squirming ten year-old down the basement stairs. Tommy tried to kick her with his heels, but Brianna ignored those kicks, even as she threw him on the floor and dragged him further into the deeper area of her basement laboratory. The screaming and crying was eventually muffled by the insulation in the basement walls, so not even anyone who just arrived at the house could hear him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laboratory was like any typical science lab, with white, sterilized floors and walls, chemistry sets with the stereotypical chemistry kit and distilleries, and scientific inventions that were years ahead of anyone else at Brianna's current teen years. Up ahead in a particular area was a special cylindrical chamber, outfitted on the inside with radiation-emitting lights, and a metallic bed with the leather straps on the railings. This was Brianna's latest experiment, and what better way of testing it now than using it to punish her defiant little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angered genius sister punched in a keycode, and the doors opened. Then she forced Tommy into the chamber, threw him onto the floor, and quickly hit the button to close the doors just as Tommy quickly recovered and bolted towards the closing door. \"Brianna! Open this door!\" Tommy shrieked, crying and slamming the thick glass with his palms desperately. \"Please, Brianna, I'm sorry! I'll be a better brother, I promise! I'll take back everything I said, I'll volunteer as a guinea pig for your experiments, I'll do anything you want me to do! I promise I'll do whatever it is you want! Anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of her entering a code within the keypad, Brianna suddenly stopped and turned to her poor, desperate brother with a deep loathing glare. \"Really? You'll do anything I want? Even if what I want is disgusting, deplorable, and degrading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... yes, I'll do anything you want me to do! Please!\" Tommy's face spread with a na\u00efve grin, hoping that his negotiations would set him free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then here's the first thing I want you to do...\" Brianna pushed a red button, and the chamber whirred to life. \"...start screaming, and try not to move around too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's panic rose as the chamber's whirring grew louder and the radiation-emitting lights in the walls and under his feet flickered on. He could already fell the heat and the electricity running through his body, along with a new sense of fear. Suddenly, he found himself pounding the glass even harder and screaming even louder. \"BRIANNA, OPEN THIS DOOR!\" Tommy screamed bloody murder. \"BRIANNA! LET ME OUT! HELP! MOMMY! WENDY! LINDSEY! SOMEONE HELP ME! DON'T LET BRIANNA DO THIS TO MEEEEEeeeeeee....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's pleas for help was drowned out as the machine's whirring reached their full volume, and then came a sudden blinding, flickering flash from within the glass. Then the chamber's mechanisms calmed down as the lights within flickered off, their function complete. Thick clouds of steam and smoke built up from within the chamber, obscuring Brianna's view of her test results. She immediately recalled, Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, a famous thought experiment and paradox where a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive sources and a flask of poison. The experiment dictated that the cat would be simultaneously dead and alive, but after opening the lid of the box, the cat would either be dead or alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna didn't know if Tommy was dead, alive, or already felt the effects of her chamber inside. The most critical moment of this experiment came down to the push of the button. Brianna pushed the button and opened the chamber and released all the pent-up steam inside, either quickly dissipating or being ventilated to the outside via the ventilation system. Brianna stuck her head in, carefully observed the interior of the chamber, and found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Tommy had shrunken to the size of a grain of rice.<br>\r\n2.) Tommy became a human/fly hybrid after a young housefly flew inside the chamber with him.<br>\r\n3.) Tommy hasn't felt the effects of the scientific chamber (but will steadily shrink throughout the afternoon).<br>\r\n4.) Tommy hasn't felt the effects of the scientific chamber (but will steadily shrink throughout the night).</span></div></div>",

He was the size of the game pieces from The Game of Life, extremely tiny. As Tommy emerged from the smoke, disoriented by the effects of the flashing lights, he stumbled forward and hit his face on something. He looked up and saw himself face-to-face the white tip of a Converse sneaker, part of the biggest pair of Converses he's ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy trailed the shoes upward and screamed as the giant figure of Brianna loomed over him like a goddess. She looked like a living brown-haired colossus with a Hime cut hairstyle and big square glasses. Her black-and-white striped sweatpants stretched as high as the Gateway Arch, and her t-shirt was as enormous as a circus tent cover. If Tommy was normal sized, then Brianna would be an angry eighty foot giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened!? Why is everything so big!?\u201d Tommy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything didn't go big, you bug,\u201d Brianna\u2019s voice echoed above him. \u201cYou were just shrunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna squat down over Tommy\u2019s tiny frame and reached down to pick up her bug-sized brother. The shrunken boy screamed and ran away from the oncoming pair of giant fingers reaching for him, but Brianna brought a building-sized finger into Tommy\u2019s path, knocking him in the tummy and on the floor. Then she used both that finger and her thumb to pinch Tommy between them and lift him up. Tommy screamed and wriggled as he was brought up to the giantess\u2019s face at the speed and feel of an elevator ride at a theme park, stopping to face her impassive face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Please, big sis, put me down!\u201d Tommy begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I? You made me feel small by telling me you hate me, so I thought I'd return the favor by shrinking you down and putting you in your place. How does it feel to be small now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease!\u201d Tommy screamed, tears leaking from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna sighed. \u201cYou know something, little bro? You\u2019ve become a real bother to me ever since you started badmouthing my experiments. Sure, maybe there were a few unintended consequences along the way and maybe they were botched failures, but those were honest mistakes, and I never once received some sign of forgiveness from you for my honest mistakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant genius swayed her hand back and forth, watching Tommy\u2019s tiny limbs sway the same way. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve hurt my feelings, I think it\u2019s appropriate that you receive a punishment fitting for your size,\u201d the giantess declared like a goddess judging an impertinent mortal. \u201cI think for your punishment, since you thought you could step all over me, I think I\u2019ll put you on the ground and step all over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna slipped her foot out of her Converse, and with her other foot, she gently opened up her sock from behind and revealed her wrinkled sole. She gently lowered Tommy down to the floor, and the screams and wriggling became louder and clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate enough,\u201d Brianna said as she snapped the opening of the sock shut and brought Tommy back to her face. She playfully contemplated Tommy\u2019s punishment and practically fluttered her finger at his face. \u201cPerhaps since you being a little ass, I can put you in the back of my underwear and see if you survive being smothered by my butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna opened the waistline of her pants from behind and turned her body to reveal her underwear-clad behind to her shrunken brother. Self-conscious about her appearance, Brianna often wore lady\u2019s briefs because her behind was nothing to how Lindsay\u2019s behind was sexier than hers. She lowered the tiny Tommy to the opening, and like before, he screamed and wriggled, but this time he was close to crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think your punishment should be a little more humiliating,\u201d Brianna said, bringing Tommy to her chest and holding her other hand over it. \u201cYou really broke my heart when you snapped at me like that, little bro. Since my heart is underneath my chest, I think I\u2019ll smother you with my boobies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing that other hand, she opened the collar of her shirt and brought the fearful Tommy to it. Before she could drop him in, a thought came to Brianna. \u201cActually, you might enjoy that too much, but I have a better idea,\u201d she said, bringing Tommy up to her lips, instantly filling the boy with dread. \u201cSince you chewed me out for being a bad sister, then maybe I should eat you. Yeah, eat you like a piece of meat, savor you like a piece of candy, and then when you down my throat, you\u2019ll end up as a part of your big sister\u2019s meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna parted her lips and opened them wide enough for Tommy to get a look at his possible new and final destination. A gust of hot, muggy breath washed over his entire body. Her somewhat yellow teeth framed the dark interior of her moist maw, her tongue wriggling in anticipation, her throat beckoning her to drop him down and swallow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her mouth with a grin, Brianna curled her fingers around Tommy and constricted him in her fist. \u201cWell, little bro, I\u2019m not really sure how to carry out your punishment,\u201d the giantess confessed to the poor young tiny. \u201cShould I crush you underneath my feet, smother you with my butt, squish you in my boobies, or swallow you whole like a little piece of food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Brianna puts Tommy on the ground; she intends to stomp him!<br>\r\n2.) Brianna puts Tommy in the backside of her underwear; she intends to smother him!<br>\r\n3.) Brianna puts Tommy in her cleavage; she intends to suffocate him!<br>\r\n4.) Brianna puts Tommy in her mouth; she intends to swallow him!</span></div></div>",

The shrieking stopped when Tommy felt the impact of the floor, knocking his breath out and leaving him in absolute agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken boy whimpered and choked as he struggled to crawl away from his giant big sister, like a bug who had its limbs pulled off and was crawled at a similar speed.

And do you know what happens to grain, little bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna lifted Tommy up over her face and licked her teeth. \"They get eaten, of course, and now you're a little speck of grain yourself..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nerdy giantess opened her maw wide enough for Tommy to get a good look at his next destination. At this, Tommy screamed, cried, and thrashed around in Brianna\u2019s grip, sobbing hysterically while his pleas to his giant sister to let him go and not eat him fell on deaf ears. Brianna slowly wiggled her tongue and ran outwards across the bottom of her lip, washing Tommy with a hot wave of bad breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what's gonna happen, you pathetic bug. I'm gonna gently drop you in my mouth, onto my outstretched tongue, and quickly close you off from the world behind my teeth and my lips...\u201d Brianna licked her chops, brought Tommy to her wide open maw and clamping her teeth close to his feet, making him cry out fearfully. . \u201c...and once you\u2019re fully inside my mouth, I\u2019m gonna roll you across my tongue and savor you like a nice piece of candy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna smacked her lips repeatedly, imitating the sexual way for a woman to savor their food like a connoisseur. \u201cThen, once I collect all the flavor of your tiny body, and your flavor becomes tasteless...\u201d Brianna lifted her head up and revealed her neck to Tommy, her neck pulsing as she swallowed deeply, moaning deeply, and tracing her finger down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna wriggle and squirm down my esophagus as my throat muscles deep into my body, and deeper, and deeper, until you finally reach my stomach.\u201d Brianna moved her hand down to her abdomen and gently rubbed it in circles. \u201cI can practically feel you falling into my hot stomach acids already. I imagine it\u2019ll feel like falling into a hot tub with your invulnerability, surrounded by pulsing, gurgling flesh, and listening to my body\u2019s other functions. You\u2019ll probably squirm around and pound on my stomach and begging me to let you out, but all I\u2019ll feel is a slight tickle coming from my tummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna ceased her tummy rubbing and gently smacked it, turning to her scared little brother in her fingers with a sly smile on her face. Tommy\u2019s face contorted in fear as tears poured from his eyes. \u201cPlease, big sis, I\u2019m sorry I was so mean to you! I\u2019ll be a better little brother for you, but please don\u2019t eat me! I don\u2019t wanna be food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna scoffed. \"To me,  that\u2019s all you are right now: a little piece of food who should know better than to bite back at your big sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck out her tongue and wiggled the tip across Tommy\u2019s face, smothering both sides of his face with saliva. The egg-headed giantess brought her tongue back into her mouth and smacked it, collecting her tiny brother\u2019s flavor, savoring it before she gently swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm... you have a nice salty caramel flavor with extra sea salt. Perfect for a little badmouth like yourself. And speaking of badmouth...\u201d Brianna shifted her hand so she was pinching the back of Tommy\u2019s shirt and lifted him up over her raised head. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to take a nice long time-out inside your big sister\u2019s stomach. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be sure to let you out... in about eight hours...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last waft of hot breath, Brianna opened her mouth and eagerly lolled her tongue from over her bottom lip. Tommy screamed the loudest scream he could ever scream as he was tangled above Brianna\u2019s giant mouth, intent on dropping him inside and swallowing him, trapping him inside the darkness of her belly. Brianna gently lowered him to the center of her spongy bubblegum tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Brianna savors Tommy and swallows him whole.<br>\r\n2.)

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brianna gently lowered her tiny little brother to her maw and gently dropped him in the middle of her tongue. After the taste of salty caramel touched her taste buds, Brianna slurped up little Tommy into her mouth and began to rub her tongue all over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the darkness of her humid maw, Tommy screamed and kicked against the defiant serpent that was his big sister\u2019s tongue. Brianna\u2019s jaws moved in motion as the giant spongy tasting muscle slathered Tommy in saliva, choking on some that flowed down his throat. He already felt sick to his stomach from the saliva, and the motions weren\u2019t helping. Tommy tried to resist, but the combination of the saliva, Brianna\u2019s undulating tongue, and the movement of her jaws caused him to slip onto his belly, making him wail even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside of her maw, Brianna was savoring the flavor her little brother gave off, making her moan pleasurably. She rolled the tiny shrunken brother around the inside of her mouth like a fine caramel candy, sucking up all of the flavor he could produce. \u201cMmmmhhh... oh yeah... so good...\u201d Brianna moaned as she smacked her lips. \u201cI gotta say, Tommy, you might be the tastiest snack I\u2019ve ever tasted before. Kinda makes me wish I didn\u2019t have to swallow you, but... mmmhhh\u2026 aaahhhh\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very thought of the inevitable moment when Brianna would send Tommy down her throat jolted her nerves pleasurably. On the inside, Tommy heard every word his giant voracious sister said like a dank food chewing and swallowing ASMR video. Her amplified voice pounded in his ears and into his head. What was worse was the implications of what she would do to him. As Tommy attempted to resist Brianna\u2019s tongue, the giant muscle pressed him against the roof of her mouth, taking in the ticklish feeling of his squirming and collecting his flavor. The tongue dragged him towards the clamping teeth, around the molar section where it threatened to compact his tiny body into paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy quickly rolled away as his colossal sister\u2019s jaws clamped onto his shirt, ripping it from both the force of her chewing and the tension caused by the clamping and Tommy\u2019s roll. The tiny boy was left without a shirt on, half-naked inside his sister\u2019s mouth, whose tongue suddenly went into overdrive as it picked up on his added flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm... you know, I think you taste better without the shirt on,\u201d Brianna said, tapping a finger on her chin as she carefully noted the added salty caramel taste to her tongue. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, little brother, I\u2019m not gonna strip your pants. That would just be wrong, and a mighty giantess like myself needs to have standards, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaliva continued to build up inside the cage of Brianna's mouth. To Tommy\u2019s perspective, it was like filling in the shallow part of a large swimming pool with disgusting mouth liquid and was beginning to drown in it. Brianna began to slurp and slosh him around with the saliva casually, not caring one bit about his well-being rather his taste and his size. She felt a tickle at her lips as Tommy\u2019s hand stuck out between them, but she slurped it up like a spaghetti noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna see the outside world one last time, Tommy?\u201d Brianna asked. \u201cI think you should. Fair warning, it\u2019s gonna be the last time you're gonna see the light of day before I swallow you down.\u201d Suddenly, the auburn-haired giantess opened up her mouth, revealing the tiny boy splashing around in a small pool of warm, stagnant froth. His eyes squinted as he saw the lights of the basement shining inside and anything beyond his giant sister\u2019s lips momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to go down, Tommy,\u201d Brianna informed, making the tiny boy in her mouth freeze. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a long stay for you, little brother... but don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get out eventually. After all, there\u2019s no better place for you to stay than on the inside of my body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Tommy tried to crawl from the pool and onto the tongue, Brianna unceremoniously clamped her mouth shut. She swirled her tiny brother around with her collected spit a couple of times, tilted her head back, and with a swallow, dumped everything in her mouth down her esophagus. She gave another swallow to feel a certain squirming bulk travel down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh there you are... I can feel you going down... down... down... just like I promised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside, Tommy screamed and squirmed as he was spilled and squeezed down a long, fleshy tube heading downwards and deeper into darkness. The wet peristalsis pushed him along with the torrent of slacks as it drained deeper into Brianna\u2019s digestive system. From outside, the screaming young tiny felt a pair of fingers push up against the esophagus, slowing down his descent as the giantess moaned to the sensation of him squirming her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five seconds of terror, Tommy\u2019s descent came to a close when he felt a tight construction traveling up his body from his feet to his chest, holding him as his legs flailed in midair. The tight sphincter gradually pulled the tiny boy through, and he fell three stories into a dark, stuffy, humid sac of flesh and dropped into a shallow lake of bubbling hot liquid. Tommy quickly surfaced and swam towards the nearest incline where he couldn\u2019t touch the stagnant stomach acids, flopped down on the floor, and wailed bloody murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, there you are. I thought I could feel a little squirming in there,\u201d Brianna taunted as she gently rubbed her abdominal area and smacked it, creating lots of turbulence for her tiny brother. \u201cSo how does it feel to be trapped inside your big sister\u2019s stomach? Is it dark? Is it humid? I bet the stomach acids feel like a boiling hot jacuzzi, but I can also bet you didn\u2019t feel your skin corroding from the acids because of the effects of my shrinking chamber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic overtook Tommy as he quickly crawled over to the stomach wall and started pounding on the fleshy surface. \u201cBrianna, please let me out! I\u2019m sorry! I don\u2019t wanna be food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire stomach jolted as Brianna keeled over, chuckling at the ticklish sensations against her stomach walls, clutching her belly. \u201cOh, that does tickle! It\u2019s just as I imagined it!\u201d she chuckled as she went back to rubbing her belly. \u201cMmmhh... you feel good inside of me, little brother. Now you\u2019re gonna stay inside of me for the rest of the night... but don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be able to have your dinner soon... when it reaches my stomach that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy screamed, begged, and cried to Brianna to let him out of her stomach, but underneath the heart pumping and the stomach grumbling to its newest occupant, she couldn\u2019t hear him. He tried to punch and hit the stomach walls, but they came across as a tickle to Brianna\u2019s size. Devoid of all hope of escape, Tommy curled up and cried against the stomach floors. He had to maintain himself against the movements of the stomach as Brianna moved about the house, satisfied that she sealed her only brother away inside of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Skip to the evening with Brianna having dinner with her family.<br>\r\n2.) Skip to the night with Brianna sleeping and Tommy trying to escape her digestive system.<br>\r\n3.) Skip to the next morning with Brianna releasing Tommy from her bowels.<br>\r\n4.) Brianna goes back on her word and decides to keep Tommy inside her stomach forever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The year is 20XX, and a secret terrorist organization called FEMME, a female-only radicals dedicated to destroying the destructive influence of men all over the world, finally make their move. To do this, members of FEMME kidnapped a brilliant virologist, held his family hostage, and forced him to finish the formula for a genetically altered self-sustaining virus which, when inhaled, mimics the cold and flu symptoms. The virus affected the XY genes only, so once the contagion is inhaled and metabolized, the male host is shrunken down to an inch tall which has no cure or antidote for the affected victims, since the virus dies from body heat when inhaled to avoid tracing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the viral agent was completed after two weeks of forced labor, the secret leader of FEMME personally tested the virus on the virologist and one of her loyal henchwomen. Needless to say, the virus worked like a success, as the affected FEMME member only suffered flu-like symptoms, but the virologist was shrunken out of his clothes. Despite the virologist's please to be released, the leader of FEMME made his family watch via livestreaming as she took her boot and squashed him flat under her boot. She made sure the virologist's wife and daughter saw the mess he made on the bottom of her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, FEMME dragged the virus container up the tallest tower of the city, which they took at gunpoint. After an elevator ride to the top and a couple flights of stairs, the FEMME members brought the virus to the top of the tower where the wind blew in different directions. It was the perfect place to spread a worldwide pandemic which spelt the end of man's rule over the world as they spoke. Just as the police arrived on the scene, the FEMME leader personally twisted the cap off and released a purple cloud into the air, which instantly turned colorless upon oxidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colorless cloud was carried in all directions of the wind, self-sustaining in the air, descending onto the police and citizens in the street down below. When the police showed up at the top of the building, the leader of FEMME quickly pointed the virus at the officers. In a matter of a few seconds, the officers felt this strong urge to cough. Their throats became scratchy, their muscles ached, and their fever ran past 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Finally, they felt their clothes loosen like an inflatable after the air was being sucked out as their entire world grew bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the virus' purpose was fulfilled, the police officers stood among their discarded clothing in the nude. The leader of FEMME watched with sick satisfaction at the sight. With just a few steps, she stood tall over the cowardly men who screamed at her sudden stature. She took the same boot that killed the virologist and stamped the two officers dead amongst their clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as the FEMME leader laughed triumphantly at her success, the virus spread all over the city, secretly inhaled through the lungs and dying from the host's body heat. The women in the streets only felt the sudden case of the flu, but they would still be physically okay compared to the grisly fate the men suffered that day. The men began to shrink, causing vehicles to crash, while the other men met their demise in the bellies of the giant animals who saw them as food. FEMME considered this a red letter day to all the world governed by men's greed, pride, and weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat FEMME also counted on was the male children shrinking from the effects of the virus. The self-sustaining virus was carried throughout the four winds over the city and into different counties and cities beyond the limits. The virus was designed to find a suitable host to die in, and an XY chromosome carrier to shrink. It didn't care what age they had the chromosome, they would all be shrunken this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, the virus cloud found itself drifting towards an area where the children were unfortunately present when itself caught in the line of fire. The only question is, where did the virus affect the children?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA school district (i.e. a kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, high school)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA playground (i.e. an outdoor park, a Chuck E. Cheese, an amusement park, etc.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA children's hospital<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA school field trip (i.e. in the city, in a museum, in the red-light district, etc.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This particular breeze carried some of the virus towards another county, right over a small town known for its school district. The district consisted of a kindergarten, an elementary school, and a middle school merged with the high school in the same building. The one thing that connected these buildings were the large fields, the playgrounds, the baseball diamond, the soccer field, and the track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this time in the late morning when the wind guided the virus towards the kindergarten and into an open window where the children were currently playing with their toys, watched over by their female teachers. At the elementary school, the children were playing on the playground during recess, giving their bodies the energy to build up their appetite. In the middle school and high school building, the students of the former were eating their lunches while the students of the latter were sitting in class and listening to the teacher drone on and on about their lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, these students would share one thing in common: their contraction of the virus. The shrinking pathogen would linger about in the air, getting sucked into their hosts, and carried into their circulatory systems. The girls would only feel dizziness, muscle aches, and a dry cough, but they wouldn't be totally affected by the virus one-hundred percent, since the virus wasn't designed to disrupt the XX chromosome. The boys, however, are a different story altogether. Once the virus penetrates their circulatory system, they'll be reduced to an inch tall, and it would be pandemonium for the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is, which school will you choose to follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kindergarten<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elementary School<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Middle School<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe High School</span></div></div>",

While not enjoying time with his video games and action figures, he is navigating a household where his mother and older sister loom large over him. While Tony appreciates the love he receives from his family and loves them in return, he is tired of the affection constantly heaped upon him, and dreams of the day he is big enough to put an end to it. An experimental size-altering chemical has the potential to turn the tables on his overly adoring family - if he can just make sure he can get it to them without a hitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Betty Ann Sawyer<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 34<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Green<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 6\u20195<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 170<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> Caucasian <br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> The mother of Megan and Tony, Betty Ann has been devoted to her children since day one, and, following the death of her husband, has thrown herself into raising them. In spite of this tragedy, she remains cheerful and positive, keeping an upbeat look on life. She supports the family by running a small dance studio, working closely with Megan, and sometimes \u201cvolunteering\u201d Tony as a mostly unwitting dance partner. Betty Ann tries to spend any spare time she has with her children, playing dolls with Megan or action figures with Tony (and her whimsical side occasionally finds her playing with their toys by herself when they are out of the room). She loves showering her children with hugs, kisses and physical affection, particularly Tony, whom she does not want to believe is growing up, and is inclined to mother him constantly, over his objections. Despite her kind, loving nature, Betty Ann is not particularly bright, and is a bit of a klutz. Her ditziness sometimes results in her inability to pick up minor details about things going on around her - like one of her children shrinking down to 3 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Megan Sawyer<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 9<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Blue<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Red<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5\u20193<br>\r\n<b>Weight</b>: 110<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> Caucasian <br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Tony\u2019s older sister, who sees her little brother as her constant playmate, whether he\u2019s willing or not. Megan takes after her mother in both size and personality, often joining her in smothering Tony with love. Spare time finds her practicing ballet or playing with dolls, and trying to convince Tony to do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Dr. Lucy Leonhardt <br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 29<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Blue<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Blonde<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5\u20198<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 125<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> Caucasian <br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> The Sawyers\u2019 eccentric but kind next-door neighbor, Dr. Leonhardt has invented numerous gadgets and formulas allowing humans to do extraordinary and dangerous things. Dr. Leonhardt is fond of Tony, and often gives him samples of her creations to use at home. While working, she tends to tune out the world and ignore anyone who may enter her laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt last! It is finished!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Lucy Leonhardt reaches into the chamber and extracts a small blue bottle. On a nearby table, 6-year-old Tony Sawyer watches excitedly. Tony is a frequent visitor to Dr. Leonhardt\u2019s basement laboratory, as the young scientist has produced a wide array of inventions and chemicals that allow humans to perform incredible feats. The best part is, she will often give him samples to take home and test out. At various times, she has allowed him to fly, become invisible, and break the sound barrier while running. Dr. Leonhardt holds her latest concoction triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d she announces, \u201cis the world\u2019s only known shrinking formula. Not only will it shrink the drinker down, but while in effect, they will be nearly immortal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean,\u201d Tony asked, \u201cthat if you use that stuff to shrink, nothing can hurt you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d Dr. Leonhardt explained. \u201cThere are very few things that would be fatal, but my experiments have shown that the user can still very much feel pain. When I was testing it the other day, a bowling ball rolled over into me. I didn\u2019t suffer any permanent damage, but it did hurt to the point I wished I was dead.\u201d Sensing the excitement on Tony\u2019s face, Dr. Leonhardt hands him the bottle, and answers the unasked question. \u201cI can let you have this sample,\u201d she tells him, \u201cbut you have to be careful with this. The formula is very volatile. A few drops can shrink you down to a matter of inches. And while I can make this chemical easily, it takes a while to make the antidote. That won\u2019t be ready for at least a few days.\u201d Tony thanks her and hurried out of the laboratory towards his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony steps through the door of his house and into the hall, hoping to make it to his room in peace. If he is quiet enough, he may be spared the overbearing ritual that usually accompanies his arrival. The cream of a floorboard stops him in his tracks, and as Tony looks up, the sight of a pink-clad streak bearing down on him dashes his hopes of a quiet arrival. With a shriek of delight, Tony\u2019s older sister Megan leaps and levels her brother with a flying tackle, trapping him under her full weight. \u201cHi, Tony,\u201d she calls out happily. \u201cHow\u2019s my favorite little brother doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony struggles to escape his big sister\u2019s iron grip. For a girly girl who lives for ballet and dolls, Megan possesses a fair amount of physical strength. Sibling rivalry in the Sawyer house is practically nonexistent; in fact, Tony wishes his sister would argue and fight every now and then instead of the persistent hugs and forceful drafting of him into her girly games. He finally manages to struggle free, and marches off, trying to catch his breath. If he wanted to be greeted this way every day, his mother should let him get a dog - it would at least have a higher IQ. Tony sets off on his way once again, only to freeze in dread when Mega\u2019s voice again cuts the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOM! TONY\u2019S HOME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground begins to rumble, and Tony sees an even more imposing figure barreling down on him: his mother, Betty Ann Sawyer. With no time to dodge or escape, he can only brace for impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2018s my little boy,\u201d she announces as she grabs her son, And lifts him effortlessly into the air before pressing him into her chest. \u201cDid you have a good day today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmph! Grrrgle! Mrrrm!\u201d was all Tony could manage. Almost everything about his mother was big: big eyes, big lips, big hands, big feet, big bosom, big hips, big butt, and big heart. The only exception was her tiny brain. Betty Ann finally releases her grip, allowing Tony to fall to the floor, gasping and panting for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony finally reaches his bedroom, still sore from the hugs he received moments earlier. As he sets the vial of shrinking formula on his nightstand, he knows how he\u2019s going to use it. While he loves his mother and sister very much, and appreciates the love they have for him, he is fed up with it coming in such powerful ways. Now he can play his video games without being dragged off for a tea party. Now he can take a shower on his own instead of his mom giving him a bath. Now he can have a break from bone-crushing hugs and slobbering kisses. Now he will be the big man in the house. Tony trudges downstairs to dinner, pondering how best to shrink his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as Tony sits in front of the TV, still mulling his strategy over, he begins to feel light-headed. The feeling soon cascades to his entire body, and he tries to stand up, only to collapse to the floor, his strength completely sapped. Betty Ann, maternal instincts in full gear, races over and feels Tony\u2019s forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my poor baby,\u201d she declares. \u201cLooks like you have a fever. Come on, Mister, it\u2019s straight into bed with you.\u201d Betty Ann lifts Tony up and carries him to his room. She ventures to the medicine cabinet and returns to Tony\u2019s room with a small blue bottle of medicine. \u201cNow just take a little of this,\u201d she instructs, giving her son a few spoonfuls of the liquid, \u201cAnd you should feel better in the morning.\u201d She kisses Tony good night and leaves him to fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, as Tony opens his eyes and sits up, he sees his door open and Betty Ann walk into the room, with Megan bounding in behind her. \u201cHow\u2019s Mommy\u2019s little angel doing today?\u201d she asks sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot better today, Mom,\u201d Tony replies. \u201cI don\u2019t even feel anything anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Betty Ann says. You must have just had a 24-hour flu. Still, you should probably take a little more medicine just to be sure. Megan, honey, can you hand me the medicine bottle? It\u2019s over there on the nightstand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Mom,\u201d Megan answers, as she reaches behind her to grab the bottle off the nightstand. She hands it to her mother, who gives Tony a liberal helping of the liquid. When she finishes and they exit the room, Tony smiles evilly as he picks up his bottle off the nightstand, invigorated and ready to put his plan into action. He turns the bottle over in his hand, only to gasp in horror when he reads the label:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCOLD AND FLU MEDICINE <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization hits Tony instantly. \u201cThat means,\u201d he mutters to himself, \u201cthe bottle that Megan grabbed...the stuff Mom poured down my throat...that was....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony feels himself falling back down into his mattress, as walls, bookshelves and pillows stretch up to tower over him. When everything finally stops, Tony glances over to his dresser, to estimate that he is about half the size of the Transformer action figure on his dresser. He estimated his size to be that of Megan\u2019s doll children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room begins to shake and thunderous noise that Tony quickly recognizes as footsteps approaches. The door opens and in comes...</span></div></div>",

Tony can only watch in amazement and horror as the monstrous being crosses the room, a terrific *BOOM!* and a mighty tremor heralding each footstep. Tony had always liked kaiju movies, and delighted in seeing gigantic monsters level a city as people fled in terror. But while he enjoyed this experience on screen, he never would have imagined that he would live through it, especially not in his own house. And he would have imagined even less just what type of enormous beast he would end up staring down. This was no mutant lizard or titanic alien conqueror, but the mountainous menace is something both freakishly imposing and incredulously familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s terrifying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s humongous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s blood-curdling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S MOMMY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice, at once a thundering boom and a cheerful sing-song, left Tony no doubts as to the identity of the colossal intruder. He stands transfixed on his bed as his overgrown mother lumbers towards him, with a smile that is at once lovingly sweet and blissfully ignorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoo-hoo! Mommy\u2019s back!\u201d Betty Ann calls out as she approaches her son\u2019s bed. \u201cTony? Honey? Where are you?\u201d She begins to look around quizzically when she doesn\u2019t see or hear him, unaware that she is in fact looming over her now-miniaturized child at that very moment. As she paces around searching for her little boy, Tony frantically tries to catch her attention from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Mom! Down here!\u201d Tony yells, struggling to maintain his balance over the trembling of his mother\u2019s  footsteps. As Betty Ann walked, Tony realized that she was not looking down, and was not noticing where her enormous feet were landing. He breathed a sigh of relief that he was safe on his bed...for now. Although his voice was not powerful enough to attract his mom\u2019s attention, he continued to jump up and down and flail his arms in a desperate effort to catch her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether through Tony\u2019s efforts or by sheer luck, Betty Ann eventually makes her way back to Tony\u2019s bedside,  continuing to look for her son. \u201cTony? Tony? Are you in here?\u201d she wonders as she looks down towards the bed. Tony stares up and waves at the giant woman, hoping against hope that he managed to attract her attention. </span></div></div>",

Tony stares directly upwards tracking the form of his Statue of Liberty - sized mother for what seemed like an eternity. Betty Ann casts her gaze down, and Tony once more begins jumping and screaming, begging that he ends up in the protection of his loving mother before the dangers of the shrunken world overtake him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony\u2019s prayers are soon answered when his mom\u2019s gigantic head lowers to his level, her eyes settling on him. \u201cTony,\u201d her sweet voice thunders, \u201cThere you are.\u201d She looks her son over, a quizzical expression of concern on her face. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d she intones, \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. What is going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, you see...\u201d Tony stutters, trying time find where to start, Dr. Leonhardt next door...she gave me this chemical...when you gave me my medicine, I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness, I see it now,\u201d Betty Ann cuts him off. \u201cMommy hasn\u2019t had her good morning kiss yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony stares incredulously. \u201cA kiss? Mom, look at me. There\u2019s no way you can...*urk!*\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony\u2019s pleading is cut short when a huge, pale hand wraps around his body, squeezing him with unbearable force. He is soon whizzing through the air, into the path of an enormous pair of lips that crash into the side of his tiny face. The noise echoes around his ears, and the sensation is one of his face being pulled off by the world\u2019s most powerful suction device. Both seem to last forever, until the lips finally release their hold, and Tony falls back into the palm of his mother\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, what are you doing?\u201d Tony snaps angrily, dizzy and covered in lipstick and Mom-spittle. \u201cCan\u2019t you see how small I am now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course I do,\u201d Betty Ann answers. \u201cYou\u2019re Mommy\u2019s little baby boy. And I love you so, so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony cannot believe what he just heard. His mom didn\u2019t even notice he had shrunk, despite the fact that he was STANDING in the PALM of her HAND. All this dumb woman could think about was mothering him. And then her next words, while ordinarily evoking annoyance and leading to well-meaning discomfort, now filled him with sheer terror and fear for his life: \u201cAnd now Mommy\u2019s little boy is going to get a big hug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA...hug?!?\u201d Tony stammers. \u201cNo, Mom, no! Please not a...\u201d his pleas are cut short as Betty Ann slams him hard against her chest. Betty Ann sighs lovingly as she cuddles her son, failing to notice the tiny pair of feet thrashing vainly beneath her fingers, the only part of his body that was otherwise visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped in her grip, Tony is left at the mercy of his oblivious mother. Failing to notice her son\u2019s diminished size, she applies the same strength she uses that Tony finds excessive at his normal size. Now he is stuck between her hand and her bosom, not sure if the unbearable heat or the unrelenting pressure would finish him first. Finally Betty Ann releases her grip in her usual way: by opening up her arms and allowing him to plummet to the floor. Fortunately he was able to land on the mattress, lessening the height of the fall and providing a soft landing surface. As Tony pulls himself back to his feet, once again staring up at his behemoth of a mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re feeling better, honey?\u201d Betty Ann asks. \u201cHere, let me feel your forehead.\u201d Tony prepares to implore her to notice his situation and act accordingly by gently sending down a single finger. But before a single word can escape his mouth, an immense object blankets him in shadow. Seconds later, his entire body is mashed under his mother\u2019s hand. He is instantly wracked with intense pain, with the sound and sensation of every bone in his body cracking. When she lifts her hand back up, he feels his bones resetting, sits up to discover that like Dr. Leonhardt with her bowling ball, he is unharmed, though in immense pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re still a little warm,\u201d Betty Ann muses. Tony struggles to tell her that it was because of the body heat from when she nearly suffocated him moments earlier. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, sweetie, I\u2019ll take care of you all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being crushed twice in a short period of time, Tony begins to think that he\u2019d be better off braving the shrunken world than the dangers of his loving mother. </span></div></div>",

He could be living in a nice suburban neighborhood, waited on hand and foot in a wealthy mansion, lounging about in a small apartment complex, or sharing another living space in a converted two-story house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe One-Inch Orphan: The boy is orphaned at a very young age. In one scenario, because he was born so small, the boy is abandoned at the side of a road in a certain location. In another scenario, the boy wasn't abandoned by his parents, but he lost his mother in an automobile accident. He is either sent to the all-girls orphanage in the hoped of being adopted or is assigned to his foster mother or godmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tiny Race of 'Tweens: The boy(s) come from a race of naturally tiny people. In one route, the boy(s) is a fairy or a pixie living in a forest or around a garden. In another route, the boy(s) is a borrower lives inside the walls of a house/living area of a giant human. In both cases, the young tiny folk explores the residence of a giant female human, but whether or not the women catch them and what they do to the tiny folk is entirely up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ant-Sized Anthro: In a different universe, the boy is an anthropomorphic inhabitant in a world where everyone is not only anthropomorphic, but their size is dependent on their species. The boy could be an anthropomorphic insect, a mouse, any land-based animal small enough to appear nearly unnoticeable by the larger female anthros or delectable by the larger predators.</span></div></div>",

The boy will be found on the doorstep by a normal-sized woman living there, so she takes him in and adopts him. The woman who adopts him is a single mother with two daughters, so he will become the brother the two girls always wanted. The neighborhood is also occupied by an unmarried bachelorette office worker, a married lesbian living with her partner, a middle-aged woman whose children have left for college, or a lonely elderly woman who desperately wished for children, all of them friends with his adopted mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe City Backstreets: The tiny boy is dropped off in the backstreets of a city, near the entrance of one of the more dangerous alleyways. The boy will be found in a box with a note telling whoever finds him to give him a good home. The female character who finds him is either a cougar-aged stripper recently off the clock, an immigrant police officer on midnight patrol, a runaway teenager looking for a safe place to sleep, a party girl returning home from celebrating her night out with her friends, or a drug addict looking for their next rush. Despite their questionable positions and the neighborhood they live in, one of these ladies will take the boy in as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn All-Girls Orphanage: The tiny boy is dropped off at the Sunshine Smile Orphanage for Girls, an orphanage which only accommodates girls. Although, in recent years, the orphanage has accommodated another tiny boy who was sent there by Social Services because they felt a mixed orphanage or an all-boys orphanage would be considered dangerous for his tiny size. The tiny boy grows up with the girls, their plump caretaker, and the other tiny boy with whom he looks up to as an older brother figure.

Despite this, the following maternal figures will never give him up unless they had no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b><br>\r\nIt was just after midnight, when there were hardly anyone roaming the city streets after dark, except for the streetwalkers, the partygoers, and seedy individuals lurking in the shadows like predatory nocturnal animals. In one particular street at around this time, a suspicious vehicle pulled up to the side of the street, stopping near the opening to an alleyway with the squeak of the breaks. A dark figure stepped out of the car and carefully placed a small box big enough to fit a coffee mug near the opening of the alleyway, right before returning to the vehicle and beating a hasty retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the vehicle's tires squealed away into the distance, violating the city's speeding law in the process, the sound of a baby's cries echoed through the streets. It turned out that the contents in this box was a little baby boy the size of a female adult's thumb. The boy slept in a bed of cotton, a scrap of a soft silk blanket, and a little beanbag for a pillow. Taped on the outside of the box was a folded letter which read: <i>\u201cThis is Benny. He was born this way. Please give to a good home.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular street was seldom active at midnight, save for certain individuals who would pass by this street and discover the small box, containing a tiny-born baby who would grow up to grow curly black hair and a curious personality, but abandoned by his birth parents who abandoned him not long after his arrival on planet Earth. The only question is, who on this street will discover little Benny at this time of night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Angela \"Mama Angie\" Bennett: A veteran stripper at the XXX Bombshells Club who recently clocked out of her shift.<br>\r\n2.) Police Officer Carmen Diaz: A Hispanic police officer patrolling the streets during her midnight shift.<br>\r\n3.) Elizabeth Harper: A runaway in her late teens who was sleeping in the alleyway.<br>\r\n4.) Rachel Addison: A drunk party girl who was returning to her apartment after a night out clubbing.<br>\r\n5.)

Her thick assets, her D-cup breasts, and her luscious lips arouse her customers' fantasies. After her shifted ended at midnight, Angela would discover a certain baby boy, abandoned on the sidewalk, born the size of her thumb. She'd soon find another meaning to her stripper name \"Mama Angie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Sayori Tanaka<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 67 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Black<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5' 5\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 169 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> Asian/Japanese<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Sayori Tanaka is an elderly Japanese immigrant who moved with her family to the United States from the Kanto region of Japan in the late 1960's/early 1970's. Ms. Tanaka lived a difficult life in the poorer backstreets of the city and being the target of discrimination, but she became happy later with her husband and her daughter until he passed away from a fatal heart attack. Since then, Ms. Tanaka's become cold, bitter, and often hostile towards her tenants... that is until she inevitably discovers Angela Bennett's adopted tiny-born son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b><br>\r\nIt was around midnight when Angela walked back home after a long night. Her D cup-sized breasts and her assets large enough to fit inside a large salad bowl jiggled with every click of her black heels. Her bulging belly stretched her lingerie to her buttons. Her great, pink lips parted as her mouth opened wide to let out a roaring yawn. She flipped her dark, pitch-black hair over her shoulder, the bangs cut across where her eyebrows should have been. It was a hell of a night, Angela figured, and she made plenty of money for a pole dance and a few lap dances. Those rolls of cash in her purse was evident enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela was a stripper who worked at the XXX Bombshells Strip Club in the back streets of the city. She had a reputation for living up to the strip club\u2019s name because she was an absolute bombshell of a woman for her age and figure. At the same time, she also had a reputation for being welcoming, motherly, and arousing. She was pretty much the great leader of the other girls in the club even though her manager was the one calling the shots. If there was one thing that any girl wanting to strip off their clothes and dance around the pole would want, it was to be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angela turned down the street to her apartment at the far end, she passed by the alleyways when she heard a baby's wailing. She stopped and tracked the noise where it came from, case in point, inside a little box. She spotted the note taped to the outside of the box, unfolded it, and read the letter. A sick feeling ran through her gut as she carefully uncovered the box and gasped. There she saw the little baby, laying in a makeshift bed, crying and reaching his tiny little hands up to the opening of the box. Angela felt her heart break from the mere sight alone; who could've abandoned such a beautiful baby in a dangerous place like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou poor baby, come here,\u201d Angela cooed as she gently scooped up the box and cupped it to her breasts. She gently shushed the baby, rocking the box back and forth and bobbing in place to soothe Benny's crying. If there was one true perk to her nickname \"Mama Angie\" aside from her being the maternal figure to her younger strippers at the club, it was how she used a soothing, sultry voice to melt the customer's nerves and feel like putty in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere there, it\u2019s okay, little one. There\u2019s no reason to be afraid,\u201d Angela continued to soother the distressed baby. \"Mama Angie's here. Mama Angie will take care of you. She won't let anything bad happen to you, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby eventually stopped crying. Benny opened up one eye, and the first thing he saw was the gigantic face of a mature giantess smiling down on him the same way a mother would her child. The baby's instincts immediately imprinted itself onto the mature stripper, seeing her as his new mother unlike his biological mother who callously dropped him off in this dark place. He burbled and giggled, reaching his stubby hands towards the giantess. Angela responded by dipping her giant finger into the box, close enough for Benny to grasp both hands on the ridged edge of her finger alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling tired and fatigued after being left by his real mommy and being acquainted with his new mommy, Benny yawned and fell into a warm sleep. Angela's heart melted to see the baby sleep happily in the box, but she was also worried about where she was and where she found him. \u201cPoor baby, he shouldn\u2019t even be here,\u201d Angela told herself as she gently closed the box. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get you out of here, Benny. Whoever put you here obviously hasn\u2019t realized we\u2019re next to a bad neighborhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the box under her other arm, Angela quickly hugged the box against the top of her breasts and quickly strode down the street and away from the alleyways, the movement of her footsteps and the rocking of her D-cup boobs rocking the baby deeper into slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the end of the street, to a slightly run-down apartment building, occupied only by her and her cranky older landlady of Asian descent. She unlocked the front door and carefully walked in, hoping that her landlady, Ms. Tanaka was totally fixated on her international soap operas and nothing else. As she closed the door behind her, what happened next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Angela returned to her apartment without incident.<br>\r\n2.) Angela encounters Ms. Tanaka, her strict and cranky landlady.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Angela was fortunate that Mrs. Tanaka was so fixated on her Japanese soap operas that she didn't notice or hear her walk in the front door. Just to be safe, Angela slipped off her shoes and carried them with her purse with one hand while cradling the box that contained the tiny baby boy against her bosom in the other. She snuck past the landlady's office barefoot and climbed a set of stairs leading to the second floor. She ventured through the hallway to the fifth door on her left, where she stayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter unlocking the door, Angela entered inside the apartment, which consisted of a living room, a kitchen, a bedroom, and a little bathroom. The room itself was big enough to hold up to three, maybe four occupants, but Angela figured it would help shelter the tiny-born baby resting against her thick bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted from her night of exotically erotic dancing and the climb upstairs, Angela settled into her favorite sofa, propping her sexy, plump feet on the ottoman. Her toenails were painted dark navy blue, and they gleamed in the night. After setting her purse and shoes down, the thick stripper gently opened the lid of the box so to not disturb the baby inside. Benny slept in a peaceful sleep, deepened by the rocking of his giant savior's footsteps and her bobbing breasts. The stripper couldn't help but swoon over how adorable Benny was, from his adorable diminutive form wrapped in its makeshift blankets down to the little tuft of black hair growing at the top of his head. She was so enamored by the sight that she gently scooped the tiny baby from his \"bed\" and raised him up to her pursed lips, gently pecking him on the head, covering it with rouge lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sparked an instantaneous reaction from Benny, as he began to burble and cry. Angela gasped and quickly moved him down to her breasts, gently cradling him in cupped hands as she rocked him back and forth and bobbed her body to help lull him back to sleep. \"Shhh... it's okay, Benny. Mama's here, Mama's got you,\" she cooed, using her sultry signature voice to soothe the baby's nerves. \"Please, don't cry, baby, Mama's here. She'll keep you safe and drive away your fear. You may be young and you may be small, but Mama's love will never change at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela continued to sing and hum until the baby's crying began to diminish. Finally, just like when Angela found , Benny steadily fell back to sleep. Angela heaved a sigh of relief. If the baby had cried a little longer, then the few neighbors on her floor would have heard the screams and they would've called Mrs. Tanaka on her. If that cranky Japanese landlady found him, she'd lose him in a heartbeat, and she couldn't let that happen, not while she promised to not let anything happen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela gently placed Benny back in his ox and carried it over to her nightstand. Then, when she had settled the box on the nightstand, she went to get ready for bed. She stripped off her clothes down to her silk D-cup bra and panties. She relieved her bowels and bladder in the bathroom then went to brush her teeth. Afterwards, she turned off the house lights, climbed into bed, and turned off the nightstand lamp. Then, in the darkness, she laid on her back, trying to clear her mind so she could drift away into slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, she couldn't fall asleep, and for good reason, too. She turned to her nightstand where the box sat, the baby sleeping in his makeshift bed, her mind aflutter with so many questions. She couldn't help but contemplate who would drop that adorable miracle of life in a cold, cruel, and unforgiving place, and she couldn't help but wonder why. Angela may have been a stripper working in a place of lust unsuitable for children, but she could never treat a child the way anyone else would treat their children, or any children at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything was made clear for her. It would only make sense Benny's birth parents were the only people close to him who would dare leave him out in the open like that. They must have despised him for being born with his condition, so they dropped him at the back alley in the middle of the night and drove away. Angela was glad to have passed down the street when she did, but the thoughts of what could have happened to Benny infuriated her. The baby would have most likely starved to death or catch his death of cold. Someone would have found him on the streets and take him away, to be used or sold for slavery, or any unforgiveable profit in the black market. He would have been taken by some punk drug addict, or a bunch of party girls too inebriated to carefully handle him. She would have been fine if it was a police officer or a good Samaritan, but anyone else would show the baby no mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Angela sat up in her bed and reached into the box. She gently curled her fingers around the tiny little bundle and carefully lifted him out, bringing him to her breasts again. She made sure he was face-up, as it was common knowledge to keep a baby lying on their back to avoid suffocation. Her heart melted at his innocence and obliviousness to the dangers he was put through tonight, but it was replaced by a newfound love for the boy: the kind of love a mother would reserve for their children. with one hand cupping him, Angela gently stroked Benny's body with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be okay, Benny. Mama's not gonna let anything bad happen to you,\" the thick giantess said, bringing him up to her puckered lips and gave him another loving peck, this time not waking him up. \"I'm gonna be the best Mama in the world. I'm gonna take care of you, watch you grow up into a fine, little man, and no one is going to take that away from me. You'll always be safe with me, Benny. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of putting him back in the box, Angela kept her gentle grip on the tiny baby in her hand as she laid down on her side. Her fingers were firmly curled around Benny's body, providing him comfort and security. Her eyes fluttered shut, a long and content sigh escaping her nostrils as she instantly drifted off. Angela had the tendency to sleep with her enormous mouth open, allowing hot gusts of breaths to blow from her wide-open maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis concluded the first night between the voluptuous stripper and her newfound tiny-born son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Skip to five years later with Angela and Benny waking up one morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Benny crawls out of Angela's hand and curiously explores her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.)

She gently reached two fingers into her cleavage, pinched the ticklish little bulk by her fingernails, and pulled it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld between two gentle giant fingers was Angela\u2019s five year-old adopted son, Benny. His head of hair grew longer and as black as Angela\u2019s hair color. He giggled childishly along while the giant hand which held him curled upwards, making him roll down her gigantic  fingers and into her soft palm the size of a king-sized bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Mama!\u201d Benny shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, my cute little buggy.\u201d Angela brought her tiny son up to her massive pillowy lips, which pursed as she used said pillowy lips to kiss the top of Benny\u2019s head. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh. Your boobies are so soft, they\u2019re the best bed I\u2019ve ever slept in!\u201d the tiny boy disclaimed, laying in the softness or his mother\u2019s giant hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that before,\u201d Angela said, standing up from her bed and . \u201cCome on, lets go have breakfast. Does my cute little buggy want something special?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlueberry pancakes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the boy\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cBlueberry pancakes it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stripper-turned-mom placed Benny in a special high chair on the table, strapping him in so he couldn\u2019t escape or topple over while she went and prepared breakfast for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that only yesterday that Benny was a baby abandoned on the street when Angela found him. Thanks to the support of her boss, Meryl, and her fellow strippers, Angela was able to make it to five years being an adoptive mother to a tiny-born boy. The first couple of years involved her teaching him to crawl and walk, as well as incubating him and helping him adapt to the warm and dark sanctity of her stomach, which was where he mostly slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two years involved teaching Benny not only to read, write, speak, and count, but to also teach him to sleep outside the sanctity her belly. To Angela\u2019s credit, Benny was smart for his own age. One time, Angela slept with her mouth wide open, prompting the young curious Benny to crawl into her mouth and was promptly swallowed by his giant mother figure. He received a good scolding the next day after he was carried through his mother's digestive system to her curvy rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the age of five, Benny began to use Angela\u2019s body as his personal playground. He\u2019d try to wrestle his mother\u2019s giant toes, climb up her mountainous body and over her breasts, and slide down her backside. Sometimes, Benny would engage in a game of Rampaging Giant with his gigantic mother, trying to run away from her as much as he could until he is stamped by her giant barefeet or snatched up and \u201ceaten\u201d by her. Angela would never swallow Benny now unless he needed a time-out inside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery so often, Angela and Benny would receive a visitor, mostly the women who worked with her at the XXX Bombshells strip club. Meryl would try to spoil little Benny with gifts and showers of love like the loving grandmother figure she presented herself. Angela\u2019s co-workers, Benny\u2019s \u201caunties\u201d would normally come over to babysit him while Angela would be out on important errands. And when Angela was busy every night at the strip club, she would have her Japanese landlady, the widowed Mrs. Takahashi, look after him. Mrs. Takahashi was old, usually cranky, but she always had time to watch over Benny and found a certain fondness for the sweet minizora kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on this day, five years after the beginning of Angela\u2019s established role as a mother,the now forty-five year-old stripper cooked up pancakes for herself and her tiny baby boy. She created the pancake from mix and added in blueberries to liven up the flavor. Angela learned to make blueberry syrup as part of her growth as a mother, and she always doused Benny\u2019s pancakes in that syrup the way he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela added a tiny drop of mix to be proportionate to Benny\u2019s tiny stature. She added two more in case he was really hungry. When all was done, both the curvaceous stripper mother and her tiny adopted son sat down to a small stack of blueberry pancakes each, much to the boy\u2019s childish glee. The blueberry syrup was poured, the orange juice was served in different sized glasses, and both Angela and Benny were about read to dig into their morning meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Angela and Benny eat their breakfast without any interruptions.<br>\r\n2.) Angela and Benny eat their breakfast, but a knock on the door interrupts them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning sunlight shone through the apartment window, it\u2019s shine reaching the bed of a certain voluptuous brunette stripper sleeping peacefully on her side. Her D-cup breasts was covered with a lacy red bra, squished together like two giant mounds of pudding pushed together. Her crimson coated lips were parted into a gigantic shape of an \u201cO\u201d, expanding and shrinking with each gargling breath she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at last, the sun\u2019s rays shine into her eyes that Angela was stirred awake by the brightness. She inhaled through her nose, turned on her back, and gave a gigantic yawn which reverberated through her apartment room. In her right hand, her fingers gently curled around the tiny form of her newfound tiny baby son. She turned her head to gaze at her palm where little Benny slept, wrapped in his blankets like a miniature burrito wrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt warmed the stripper's heart to see the bite-sized baby resting in her hand. She felt like a motherly goddess recently appointed to watch over the growth of the world's children, and Benny was her initiation into such an appointment. She sat up on her bed and lifted Benny's form up to her lips in cupped hands, giving him a gentle good morning kiss on his head. In response, the baby began to wiggle and cry, prompting Angela to gently cradle the baby and gently shush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, it's okay, Benny,\" Angela quietly cooed her diminutive child. \"It's me, it's your Mama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny ceased his crying under the calmness of Angela's soothing voice. He opened his little green eyes and beheld the sight of the giantess who took him in the previous night. As his first childish instincts kicked in, Benny began to burble happily as he reached his little arms out to the giant stripper, his hands open and begging to clasp onto the motherly giant. Angela leaned her face in until the tip of her nose was within Benny's reach. It was surreal, feeling tiny baby fingers grab onto the tip of her nose, since the use of her fingers were too big for him to grab onto, and the sheer size of her nails could cut the baby by accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny felt around his new Mama's nose, eventually reaching to the inside of her nostril. One touch of her nasal hair prompted Angela to gasp and pull her nose back, wiping and snorting to get the ticklish feeling out of her nose. Benny giggled at the display, and Angela couldn't help but smirk and giggle too. \"You little rascal, you. Are you trying to make me sneeze? You'd be flying in the air if you did make me sneeze, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny once again giggled as Angela brought him up to her lips once more for an affectionate kiss, giving him a gentle peck on the side of his cheek. \"Come on, let's get breakfast. I don't have any baby food for you or know how to feed you at your size, but we'll have to improvise somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith cupped hands, Angela carried Benny into the kitchen and set him lying face-up on the table. She quickly whipped out her phone and searched how to feed tiny-born babies. There was a scientific page on the Internet that told her that any woman who gives birth to, or adopts a tiny-born infant will trigger a maternal affection towards the baby, which somehow activates the lobules in the woman's breasts which causes them to produce milk. The ducts were as big as the baby's head, but according to that page, a few squeezes of the breast will produce a few drops which, compliant to the infant's size, will be considered a full meal to it<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe thought of breastfeeding seemed weird for Angela, but in a different perspective altogether, a few squeezes into Benny's mouth will keep him well-fed for the next few hours. At least her D-cup breasts would have a better use than attracting the ogling eyes of her customers. Sighing, the stripper gently cradled Benny in her hand brought him to one of her naked breasts, holding it with the other hand to help squeeze the lactation out. Gently, Angela held Benny's mouth to her nipple and gently squeezed. It was a weird tingle, feeling the creamy liquid leave her breasts in tiny drops, which flowed gently out of the duct in a suspended drop. Benny gently slurped and swallowed the drop, taking as much of it as a baby would take a whole bottle of formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the drop was completely drunken up, Angela remembered that babies needed to be burped after being fed. She gently turned Benny over in her palm and held him over the edge, using the finger in her other hand to pat his back repeatedly. After several good pats, a tiny baby-like belch escaped Benny's stomach. Angela gushed from how adorable it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a little piece of work, aren't you, Benny?\" Angela asked. \"You're pretty high maintenance for someone so small. I'm gonna need some help if I'm gonna take good care of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela searched the Internet on her phone about the basic steps about raising a tiny-born baby. There were a lot of steps condensed into smaller paragraphs, with an extensive list of supplies needed for any tiny-born infant to survive, including basic baby supplies, a smaller crib, a special spoon small enough to fit into the infant's mouth, and even a special chute designed to shrink to the smaller nozzle and give a tiny-born infant its required amount of liquid nourishment, which could be attached to a funnel or a breast pump. Angela sighed and ran her hand through her hair, wondering what she got herself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a stripper who worked late nights until midnight, living under a roof of a run-down apartment filled with poor and sometimes shady occupants, watched over a cranky middle-aged landlady like a hawk. Her new position couldn't exactly afford to have her bring Benny to a place that only twenty-one year-olds could go drink and watch the curvaceous ladies slip their clothes off onstage and dance lustfully around a tall, metal pole. That wasn't a good place for a child his age to hand around. She knew that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela heard the happy garble of the tiny baby lying on her kitchen table. She smiled and gently rubbed her finger over his body, eliciting a happy giggle from him. She took comfort in his innocence and his laughter, but there wasn't much she could do at the moment. She needed time to think who could help her. Someone who knew their way around raising a tiny baby. Someone who was the very figure of patience and understanding of childbearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Angela brings Benny to work that night to talk to her boss about her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) There's a knock on the door; it's Mrs. Tanaka, the cranky landlady!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) There's a knock on the door; it's police officer Carmen Diaz!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) There's a knock on the door; it's one of Angela's coworkers at the XXX Bombshells Club!</span></div></div>",

Though she was born underdeveloped than her fellow peers, she makes up for it with her body's flexibility and hypnotic dance moves. She is also very fond of cute things, including puppies, kittens, and babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela knew this was a bad idea as she strode to the XXX Bombshells, her enormous boobs jiggling with every step, carrying the box containing Benny's tiny form inside. Earlier that morning, she was at a crossroads, debating whether or not she could bring Benny to the club, seeing as how he was a baby and a minor. Unfortunately, she hadn't trusted anybody in the apartment, not even her cranky Japanese landlady. So she went for broke and carried the tiny baby to the club in the red-light district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela entered through the rear entrance of the strip club, an access to the dressing room. When she entered the dressing room, five of her \u201cgirls\u201d -all young women who were younger than 35 that she personally taught and trained in stripping and dancing- were all getting ready for their graveyard shift. Currently among them was Shanice, the African-American woman with a larger asset than Angela's; Sofia, the thick Latina who was currently humming her native country's music; Mary, the lovable ditz who was having trouble with her makeup, not remembering which eyeshadow was a darker color; and Emily, the cute redhead who was practicing her sensually flexible movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angela walked in, Shanice took notice of her in the mirror as she applied her mascara. \"Well, look who's showing up so early in the evening,\" the black woman \"greeted\" her mentor. \"What's wrong, Mama? You couldn't afford to pay the bills, so you decided to come in an hour before your shift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can manage my finances, thank you, Shanice,\" Angela responded with the same snippiness as her second-oldest coworker. \"Is Meryl here? I really need to talk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just missed her, <i>mam\u00e1</i>. She stepped out to get a coffee from the store just a few minutes ago,\" Sofia answered, totally focused on her false eyelashes in her reflection. \"She'll be back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit. Well, I guess there\u2019s no other way around it,\" Angela murmured. \"Girls, could you come around, please? I need to show you all something.\u201d The other four strippers assembled at Angela's desk, but Sofia went and dragged the oblivious Mary away from her eyeshadow crisis to the desk. Angela set the box and carefully opened the lid to the box, revealing the palm-sized boy sleeping inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaaawwwwww!\u201d the strippers all exclaimed, their hearts melted by his cuteness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssshhhhh! Not so loud, girls! He's sleeping!\" Angela quietly urged the younger women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Sofia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Benny. That\u2019s what it said on the note, anyway,\u201d Angela answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNote? What are you talking about?\u201d Shanice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night, when Iwas walking home after work, I heard him crying in this exact same box you see here,\" Angela explained. \"In it was a note telling someone to give Benny a good home and nothing else. It was cold, dark, and the alleyways were prone for wild animals and muggers, so I had to take him home with me so he could be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean he was abandoned?\u201d Mary gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that poor thing,\u201d Sofia cooed sadly, gently rubbing Benny's head with her sand-colored finger, careful not to wake him up. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, <i>chico</i>, because your new Mama is going to take care of you, like she took good care of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's the problem, Sofia, I'm not sure how to take care of him,\" Angela clarified. \"I only came in to talk to Meryl because she's had experience raising her daughter and helping raise her grandson and I need her help to do it.\" The maternal stripper gently rubbed her thumb on Benny's head, feeling the warmth coming from the soft texture of his skin. \"Plus, this isn't a safe environment to raise a child in, and I can't trust anyone in my apartment with taking care of him because he'd either be kidnapped or legally taken away, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you need Meryl to give you tips and pointers on how to raise him,\" Shanice curtly finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Angela said with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never thought of calling us or asking us for help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but everyone else has too much on their plates to make time to babysit a tiny baby, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we just pitch in and see if we can take turns looking after Benny?\" Mary asked, and everyone turned to her incredulously. \"What? Benny needs someone to watch after him, and she shouldn't have to be the one to do it all alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I mean, I already have a babysitting gig that pays me hourly,\" Emily explained, \"but for Angela, I'd be willing to watch him for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it or not, even though we strip ourselves and dance naked in front of a drunken crowd, we're not gonna let some kid grow up without a mom in his life,\" Shanice explained, crouching over Angela's shoulder and watching the tiny bundle of joy sleep in the little box. \"Trust me, I grew up without my mama and I haven't exactly turned out for the better. Trust me, that boy needs his mama, and that mama has to be you, Angie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of you to share, Shanice,\" Angela said, \"but I'd rather have to hear what the boss has to say about this first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door opened, and in walked in the manager and the owner of the XXX Bombshells strip club, over twenty years Angela's senior. Her white hair was pixie cut and parted over to her left side, her wrinkles hardly noticeable from a distance. \u201cPlaces, girls, this is gonna be a busy night,\u201d Meryl, the bombshell GILF said as she walked in with a hot cup of coffee in her hand right before she noticed the newer arrival. \u201cOh, Angela, you\u2019re here early. Is there something I can help you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meryl, we need to talk,\" the older brunette stripper started, skipping the pleasantries. \"I was on my way home last night, and on the street, I saw...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryl's gaze was diverted to the smaller box sitting on Angela's desk. \"What is this?\" she asked. She approached the box, caught a first glimpse of the tiny boy in the box, and covered her mouth with a large gasp. \u201cWhat is that..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is exactly what I needed to talk to you about,\" Angela said urgently as she rushed to her boss's side. \"Please, you have to listen to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Meryl listens to Angela as she explains the situation, and she helps decide what Angela should do<br>\r\n2.) Meryl is disgusted by Angela bringing in Benny to even listen, so she kicks them out<br>\r\n3.) Meryl quickly snatches up Benny and inspects him, prompting her to take action into her own hands<br>\r\n4.) An impatient crowd outside forces Meryl to have Angela to wait to discuss the situation</span></div></div>",

The smokin' senior citizen would have fired Angela on the spot for breaking their most important 21+ age limit, but the desperation and worry in Angela's eyes made her stop. Heaving out a stressed sigh, Meryl regained her composure and turned to her veteran employee with a passive stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Angela, I\u2019m listening,\u201d Meryl said, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela huffed contently and flipped a strand of her hair backwards. \"As I was saying, Meryl, I was just walking home last night when I heard a baby crying in the streets. It came from the box you see right there, right at the edge of an alley, and inside that box was that tiny baby you saw,\" she explained. \"I took him home and I kept him safe and warm through the night, and this morning, I've been busy trying to take care of the baby, but I didn't know what to do! I couldn't leave him alone at my place, and I remember you telling me how you raised your daughter and helped raise your grandson, and I needed to tell you this in person, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you gambled telling me in person by coming to work with a baby in a stripper club,\" Meryl deduced. \"I understand why you didn't call me ahead of time, Angela, but if you needed to talk to me, you could've invited me to your place instead of going through all this trouble.  You did the right thing coming to me for help, Angela, but this is no place for a baby to be, you know that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela sighed. \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I see him please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela nodded her head, and Meryl approached the box at her table. She gently reached inside, scooped her palm inside the box and gently raised her cupped palm to her face, supporting the hand carrying tiny Benny with her other hand. \u201cHey, little guy. You\u2019ve had an eventful past couple of days, haven\u2019t you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryl brought the tiny baby to her wrinkled pursed lips and gave the toddler a gentle kiss. Benny seemed to giggle at the sensation, and it warmed the older woman's heart. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, little Benny, we\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll grow up in a nice home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryl gently returned Benny to his makeshift bed, tucking him in for warmth. The baby yawned, coming out a squeak, and the memories of being the mother to her newborn daughter and the grandmother to a grandson made her smile warmly. With a sniffle, Meryl turned and placed a hand on Angela's shoulder. \"I appreciate you for coming to me for this, Angela, and I know that taking care of the baby has been tough on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) \"...which is why we'll help you raise him.\" (Meryl allows Angela to become the adoptive mother of Benny, and the other strippers will volunteer to help.)<br>\r\n2.) \"...which is why we'll have to find someone else to take care of him.\" (Meryl doesn't allow Angela to be the adoptive mother of Benny, and they both put him up for adoption.)<br>\r\n3.) \"...and that's why I have to let you go.\" (Meryl terminates Angela's employment for fear of Benny's exposure to the strip club, but she helps fix Angela up with a new job and a nanny.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the age of six, Olivia perished in an accident, leaving the orphaned Oliver to be taken by Social Services to an orphanage that accommodated girls under the impression that he would receive motherly and/or sisterly love there. At the orphanage, Oliver is kept under close observation by the caregiver, Valerie, and the girls who love to play with him, tease him, or try to smuggle him out of the orphanage during Adoption Day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Valerie McCormick<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 47 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes: </b>Brown<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5\u201910\u201d<br>\r\n<b>Weight: </b>236 pounds<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Valerie McCormick is the head caretaker at the Sunshine Smile Orphanage for Girls. When Social Services notified her about the arrival of the tiny Oliver Martin, Valerie was genuinely surprised, but she was nonetheless willing to accommodate the orphaned tiny. Valerie is as loving as a mother and as firm as a father who dutifully has the girls learn to routinely do their chores and doles out fair punishment for any misdemeanor. She takes especially good care not to let any of the girls take Oliver during Adoption Day, despite how close he is to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver Martin was the only boy to stay at the Sunshine Smile Orphanage for Girls, an all-girls orphanage, mostly due to his three-inch height. Social Services thought this would be a better recourse on account of how wild the boys orphanages were and feared for his safety. For the first couple of months he was sent there, Oliver felt out of place, despite how friendly he was with the girls residing at the orphanage. Often times, he'd become so friendly, the girls would try to sneak him out, but Valerie, the head caretaker would catch them before they'd take him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery quarter year, the orphanage hosts an Adoption Day, where the girls are adopted by a single parent or a couple, and then they would be taken away to a new, better life. Poor little Oliver was left alone, having nobody considering adopting him. All he wanted was a family, someone to love him like how Olivia, his late mother did before the car accident claimed her life. Every day, he prayed for a new mother, a big sister, heck, even a grandmother who would love him, comfort him, raise him into a better child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever Oliver felt down, the head caretaker, Valerie, always comforted him and did her best to soothe his troubled soul. She'd gently clutch his tiny body to gently embrace him in her pudgy fingers, massage his back with her thumb. She would then indulge him by allowing him to sleep on her fat belly or in between her massive breasts. Despite everything she did to comfort him, she could never replace the hole his mother left behind in his heart. Even so, she was happy to see Oliver getting along with the girls, except for when they'd take things too far by displaying their power over his tiny size. She would protect him like any mother would, and that was a fact the girls had to learn on the first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of these routes will follow each of these characters?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been a year and a half since Oliver was first admitted to the Sunshine Smile Orphanage for Girls. A year and three quarters since his mother died and was taken in by the friendly caretaker of the orphanage. Not that there was anything wrong with the orphanage. The tiny-born boy liked it there. Miss McCormick has been very kind to him, and so have the girls living there, but he didn\u2019t want to stay there forever. He missed his mom terribly, and he wanted to have a new family with a mom who loved him unconditionally like his mom did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, it was the third Adoption Day since Oliver had been brought to the orphanage, and every time, it was the same thing: He\u2019d watch helplessly as all the fortunate girls get accepted by a new family and leave the orphanage for good. Then he\u2019d wait until the next Adoption Day at the orphanage six months later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Oliver watched the girls he befriended and grew up with leave him behind, all alone and brooding. He wanted to go with the girls so badly, but Valerie had the eyes of a hawk when it came to him. She\u2019d know when a girl was trying to smuggle him out and intervened before they succeeded. Still, at least they kissed him goodbye, but it didn\u2019t make the pain of loneliness go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree Adoption Days, and Oliver still hadn\u2019t had a family come to him. Nearly all of the girls he knew were gone and he couldn\u2019t see them again. He began to realize the futility of finding a family. The loneliness began to eat away at him, so he kept himself alone and away from everyone else. He mostly kept to his room, curled up in his bed in his dollhouse, and that\u2019s where he stayed for the past week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after the first week, Oliver laid in his bed, facing the wall and brooding over the possibility of not being adopted. Valerie watched the tiny boy from the doorframe and a saddened frown spread across her face. She gently hugged little Oliver with her giant pudgy fingers curled around his tiny frame and gently massaged his head with her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOliver? Are you okay, honey?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver shook his head. \u201cNo. Everyone I love is already going away to a new family and I won\u2019t have a family to live with. A real family.\u201d He felt the urge to sob rising in his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be alone! I wanna have a new mommy who loves my like my mommy did!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sweetie.\u201d Valerie scooped up the tiny boy in his palm and cradled him against her gigantic breasts. Filtered through her organs, muscles, and skin, her muffled heartbeat brought the tiny boy some comfort as he sniffled and sobbed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel this way, but you don\u2019t have to worry anymore because I have some good news for you: You\u2019re gonna find a new family today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the boy\u2019s sadness melted and lifted brightly on his young features. \u201cReally!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. They heard about you and your condition, so they already filled out the paperwork and they\u2019re ready to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in a year, Oliver felt genuine hope for his future. Valerie cradled the tiny boy against her breasts as she made her way down to the meeting room where a certain woman waited for them.

Either way, Lincoln (and/or his friends) is shrunken down to the size of Lily's pinkie finger, small enough to get stepped on or eaten alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorn Tiny: Lincoln is one of the billions of children born tiny due to the genetic deficiency of the XY chromosome, so in a family of ten sisters, he is either doted on by the giant girls in his life, or he is seduced by them. He is aware of the dangers posed to his size, so basically, it\u2019s like any other day in the Loud House, but much, much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat Big Parallel Universe: Lincoln stumbles into Lisa\u2019s portal which sends him to an alternate universe where he is tiny, but his parallel universe mother, sisters, female friends, or female friends of friends are all giants. In this universe, the boys are completely under the whim of the giantesses in the world, and Lincoln discovers that he is no different from the boys his size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttack of the Fifty-Foot Sisters: Lisa\u2019s experiment with size-alteration accidentally goes haywire while Lincoln is out. Instead of Lincoln shrinking, however, the Loud sisters grow by fifty feet tall, along with some other girls that might have been in range of the experiment's reach. The Loud sisters wreck havoc on Royal Woods and the world, and their focus is mostly shifted on Lincoln and any boy under the age of fifteen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another weekend in the Loud House, only on this particular spring day, it was a very busy weekend. The entire Loud family was doing their annual spring cleaning where the family members were given a raffle to see which of the chores each Loud family member given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Loud sisters and the parents all did their part with the downstairs, a certain white-haired boy was too busy hauling boxes filled with bulky materials to the open attic door. He grunted as he carried the two-ton box over to the door and dropped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew, that\u2019s another box down, only twenty-seven more to go,\u201d Lincoln sighed, wiping the sweat from his head before turning to face the audience. \u201cSpring cleaning is as hard as hard work gets when you live in a big family like I do. And when you live in a big family, getting randomly selected for a spring cleaning chore is like getting a box of chocolates: You\u2019ll never know if you\u2019re gonna get one that\u2019ll leave a bad taste in your mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln cringed and felt nauseous. \u201cBleeuugh, coconut,\u201d he said with a shudder. \u201cEvery year, my family drops a name in a hat and we get picked for the chore we have to do. Case in point, I was given the arduous chore to bring down all of the boxes in the attic so we can clean them, polish them, and sell them for our upcoming garage sale... which believe me, it\u2019s not easy as it looks given how my sisters love to cling to the past and not let it go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln went over and picked up another box, this one heavier than the others. \u201cNow if I could just get this downstairs... WHOA!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lifting the box, the shifted weight inside caused Lincoln to fall backwards and crash into small tower of stacked boxes, all of the boxes and everything inside to come crashing down all at once. One particular box, labeled \u201cLISA\u2019S EXPERIMENTS\u201d spilled its contents over, knocking out some of Lisa\u2019s old defunct experiments. A few of the contents were glass beakers containing an odd-colored liquid which splashed all over Lincoln just as he was caught in an avalanche of junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln cringed and cowered in a fetal position as everything crashed around him. When he opened one eye, he saw he was still alive but laying in a green puddle. \u201cHuh? What happened to me? Am I still alive?\u201d Lincoln patted his body, then his face, then shone a big smile of relief. \u201cI\u2019m alive! That\u2019s a relief. For a second there, I thought Lynn\u2019s giant bowling ball was gonna crush me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lincoln froze on the spot; something was terribly wrong. \u201cWait... a giant bowling ball?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his nose up to see a familiar bowling ball looming over him. The severe cracks around the finger holes where Lynn threw a particularly hard throw during a bowling tournament where she earned first prize because the judges wanted her out before she could cause anymore damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut wait... that\u2019s impossible... that\u2019s Lynn\u2019s bowling ball and I don\u2019t remember it being so huge! It couldn\u2019t have grown in size unless...\u201d At a horrible realization, Lincoln looked around and saw everything was huge. The ceiling looked as high as the sky, the floor looked like it was in an extreme close-up view with high definition, and everything else stood over him as tall as the house itself, even taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve shrunk!? How is this possible!?\u201d Lincoln inspected the large puddle he was laying in, then to the cracks of the shattered beaker dripping with the liquid, and the answer came to him in an instant. \u201cOf course, Lisa\u2019s chemicals! She put the chemicals in the attic because they were inconclusive on their own, but combined, they must've created a shrinking chemical that shrunk me, and now I can\u2019t get back to normal size! And then that means...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln hurriedly three off his clothing until he was in his underwear and inspected his body. \u201cOh no! I got doused with Lisa's discarded chemicals! How do I look!? Is my skin different!? Do I have some wings or a tentacle sprouting out of my arm!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln quickly checked his reflection in a nearby shard of broken glass, and sighed contently. \"That's a relief, I thought I was turning into a monster. Still, there's the same problem, though. How am I supposed to return to my normal size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln, what was that noise!?\u201d The tiny white-haired boy stopped as soon as he heard a familiar female voice coming up from the base of the attic steps. \u201cYou\u2019d better not be screwing around up there \u2018cause you\u2019re gonna be in big trouble if you don\u2019t get your chores done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the attic steps creak and felt the footfalls as the giantess climbed up into the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it that climbed into the attic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) His mother, Rita Loud, who heard the commotion as she was passing under the attic door. She came up to investigate the noise and saw the mess, but Lincoln was nowhere in sight, so she swept up the broken glass and threw it in the recycling outside, unaware that she also tossed Lincoln into the recycling as well. Lincoln has to survive the gigantic outside world, as well as the other Loud sisters working outside for their chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) His eldest sister, Lori Loud, who heard the commotion as she was vacuuming the top floor of the house. She came up to investigate the noise and saw the mess, but Lincoln was nowhere in sight, so she threatened to toss out an old stack of Lincoln's<i> Ace Savvy </i>comic books. Desperate to save his collection of vintage comics, Lincoln tries to get Lori's attention, which may or may not end well for him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just another day in Royal Woods, Michigan, as the sun rose over the quaint suburban neighborhood, waking up its inhabitants for the day. The sunlight shone through the windows of a certain old house slowly coming apart at the woodwork, shining through a circular window leading into a certain white-haired boy's bedroom. The light made the boy's eyes flutter open, and he sat up in his bed, yawning and stretching. He then licked his lips, scratched his back covered by his pajamas and turned to the audience reading this chapter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey, you guys! Good morning!\" Lincoln Loud greeted the audience through his usual fourth wall-breaking ability. \"Sorry, I didn't know you were coming over this early. If I had known ahead of time, I would've put something more decent on. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln Loud hopped out of his bed, dug through his dresser, and pulled out his signature orange button shirt and blue jeans. He quickly threw his orange pajamas off of himself and slipped his daily attire on. He opened the door to an empty bedroom and slide on the railing downstairs, relieved that he was the only one who occupied this space. More specifically, as the camera zoomed out, he lived in a dollhouse sat on a desk in a closet-turned-bedroom which highly resembled his dollhouse bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I bet you're wondering why I'm so small and living in a dollhouse like I was living in Gulliver's Travels?\" Lincoln addressed the audience. \"Well, it's a common genetic deficiency found in male infants that makes us born this small while the other females keep their normal size, but to boys born this size, it's like we're living in a different world full of giant girls! And when you're living in a family with a mom and ten sisters, being this small can be chaotic. Take my sisters, for instance. There are times when they just love to dote on me to butter me up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-FLASHBACK-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s second eldest sister, Leni, a regular ditz but a kind-hearted fashionista, finished putting the final stitches in her latest fashion line. It was a snazzy leather jacket with sparkling glitter, just about her little brother's size. She then showed it to Lincoln, who was genuinely surprised by the design. \u201cHere, Linky! I saw this style trending in Young Fashion magazine! It may be a bit snazzy and sparkly, but I guarantee that when the girls at school get a good look at you, they\u2019d just want to eat you up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln graciously took the shirt and instantly popped it on. \u201cWow, Leni, this is so cool! Thanks!\u201d he said excitedly, admiring his look while the giant ditz of a sister handed him an equally tiny pair of sunglasses. He posed like a cool kid, but the fun stopped when he realized what Leni just said. \"Wait, wait, wait, what? The girls at school wanna eat me up? But I'm already having enough trouble trying to avoid the girls in this house who're trying to eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Lincoln, you've got to see the positive side to this suit,\" Leni waved off her brother's worry. \"Think about it, you'd look so cool, the girls will be too distracted fighting over you to even want to eat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Lori, the eldest and bossy sister of the family, walked into the bedroom, her eyes locked to her cellphone as per usual. \u201cHey, Leni. Mom says not to cut anymore fabric from the...\" Suddenly, Lori gasped and froze in place as she caught a vision of Lincoln wearing his latest jacket. \"Wow, Lincoln, you look so cool that I literally just wanna eat you up right here and now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? No way, I wanna eat Lincoln first!\" Leni protested, getting into Lori's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off, ditzy! I'm the oldest, and you already ate him the last time!\" Lori rebuked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm the sister who loves him the most!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're dumb enough not to see or hear him in your mashed potatoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two oldest sisters began to butt heads, and a very worried Lincoln began to back away. \"I guess Leni's right about one thing, this suit does keep the girls from eating me, but it's stirring up another sister fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln quickly jumped off the bed and into his toy car, which he turned on and quickly drove away from his two giant sisters, who just noticed him driving out of their bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lincoln, come back!\" Lori squealed as she gave chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to give you something nice!\" Leni shouted, following the chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-FLASHBACK-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Lincoln's older sisters, Lola, entered Lincoln's newly redecorated bedroom and placed a two-story dollhouse on the nightstand table. Lincoln watched as the drama queen unfolded the front of the dollhouse, revealing a girly pink exterior. \"You like it, Lincoln? This was the dollhouse mom and dad got me a couple years ago at Christmas, but since I hardly play with my dolls anymore, I thought this would be your perfect little home away from home. You can decorate it however yoiu like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola scooped up her tiny big brother and placed him inside, the boy looking around the interior with admiration. \u201cWow, Lola, this is perfect! I get to decorate my crib, play my video games, read my comic books on the roof in my undies! I don\u2019t think I can ever pay you back for this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t mention it!\u201d Lola dismissed modestly. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do for retrieving my earring opal from a certain someone\u2019s belly who had no business eating disgusting frog eggs in the first place!\u201d she growled loudly out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not my fault you kept losing your dumb earrings!\u201d argued Lana, the other twin who was more of the dirty tomboy of the twins, popping her head from behind the door frame. \u201cWhich reminds me. Hey, Lincoln! If you ever want to do a Fantastic Voyage video of our digestive system, I\u2019m always free!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Lana, but... I\u2019ll pass for now,\u201d Lincoln gently refused, nauseated by the last time he went into Lana\u2019s stomach to retrieve Lola's opal earring she accidentally swallowed and found some of the most disgusting half-digested mush and goop in her acids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, okay, but my offer still stands!\u201d Lana called, ducking behind the door frame. \u201cOh, look, termites!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? Termites!?\u201d Lola screamed, zipping out of Lincoln\u2019s room in an instant. \u201cLana, don\u2019t you dare keep those termites in this house! We are not going to endure another weekend with Aunt Ruth and that's final!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his sisters' behavior, Lincoln slapped his forehead and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-FLASHBACK-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, bro. My first music player from when I first started rockin' out,\u201d Luna, the third oldest sister and rocker said as she gently set her old miniature music player in Lincoln's dollhouse bedroom, which, at his size, was as big as a normal-sized flat-screen TV. She also plugged in a couple of earphones and twirled them around the player. \u201cAnd as an added bonus, these old earphones will act like your own personal stereo, so you should be really rocking\u2019 to hours of entertainment in your new bedroom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!? Cool!\u201d Lincoln pressed the play button, and SMOOCH blared through the headphones like a mega stereo. The force was so loud and so great, Lincoln was knocked backwards and landed in Luna\u2019s shirt and in between Luna's breasts. The rocker sister was initially surprised, but as Lincoln struggled to climb out, it tickled her where she was laughing nearly uncontrollably. The tiny white-haired boy scrambled up to the collar, popped his head out of the torn collar, and gasped for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, bro, I didn't realize that you really had it in ya.\" Lincoln looked up to Luna's towering amorous face, and his was flushed a beet red. \"If you really want a good time, I can call up Sam and her brother over, and we can have a real playdate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Luna, it's not like that!\" Lincoln stammered. \"It was an accident! I didn't mean to...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was interrupted by a pair of giant fingers pinching him from the back of his shirt and lifting him up to Luna's smiling face. \"Aww, come on, bro, I'm just joshing with you, you know that,\" the Loud family's rock star said, clenching her tiny brother in both hands and snuggling him against her freckled cheek. \"But, if you ever want to join in the fun with Sam and I, I'll be here when you're ready to roll with the changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna kept her hands clenched as she brought him to her pursed lips, enveloping his face in a kiss and covering him in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LUNAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-END FLASHBACK-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, and if you live in a big family like I do with nothing but a mom and ten sisters, then you'll be the object of everyone's desire,\" Lincoln informed the audience, \"but that's just another average day in the Loud house. Every day for kids born with the same shrinking condition like me is an adventure or a struggle to survive an entire world that's big enough to eat you or squash you flat. Luckily for me, I can't be killed by those means, but that doesn't make them any less painful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, as the narration ended...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Lincoln drives his car to the bathroom through a chaotic, sister-infested hallway.<br>\r\n2.) Rita Loud enters; it's time for breakfast, and she's carrying him and Lily downstairs.<br>\r\n3.) One of Lincoln's sisters enters; it's time for their scheduled hangouts.</span></div></div>",

The cast consists of predominantly female characters (such as Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl, Connie Maheswaran, etc.) and naturally and unnaturally giant women (such as the Diamonds, and the giant Gem Fusions).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<b>A/N: </b>The routes can include AU routes where the Gems are humanized.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is, which of these scenarios will you apply to the young <i>Steven Universe</i> male cast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSize-Alteration: There are many ways that the Crystal Gems can shrink or grow, such as shapeshifting or Homeworld's size-alteration technology, but what happens when they apply to a human boy? In one scenario, Steven tries to shapeshift with his Gem, but he ends up permanently shrinking with every failed try. In another scenario, a young male character around the required age limit or lower gets ahold of Homeworld's technology, leaving them shrunken and at the mercy of the giant women from Earth or Homeworld. In another scenario, Yellow Diamond demonstrates her size-alteration ability and uses it against the young humans of the Earth or the Zoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorn Tiny: The male cast is only a tiny fraction of the billions of children born tiny due to the genetic deficiency of the XY chromosome, so with a cast of predominantly female characters, they are doted on by the giant girls in their lives, or they are seduced by them. The characters are aware  of the dangers posed to their sizes, so basically, it\u2019s like any other episode of <i>The Loud House</i>, but with a cast of bigger female characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormal-Size Among Giantesses: The male characters are born normal-sized, but the female characters in the series are more massive than him. In one scenario, the Gems are all gigantic thanks to Yellow Diamond's size-alteration abilities to use for conquest, but the Crystal Gems are big enough to stop the conquest. In another scenario, the Gem Fusions are natural Gem giants who don\u2019t need to be formed by fusing their base Gems (i.e. Sugilite, Sardonyx, Opal, Obsidian, etc.). In another scenario, a young male character is raised by the Diamonds, and they all indulge on his tiny size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorrowers: The male characters are borrowers, a race of tiny people who hide within the walls of the bigfolk and \"borrow\" discarded or lost items. The borrower makes refuge in the home or a different location where a female character(s) from the series is prominently seen. (<b>A/N:</b> In this route, if Steven is born a borrower, then the Gems become humanized characters since Steven being born a half-Gem hybrid would tie in to the Born Tiny route.)</span></div></div>",

Because of the young prince's innocence and cuteness, he is often toyed with by Peach and her friends, Toadette, Princess Daisy, Rosalina, and Pauline. Similar to how Princess Peach is often kidnapped by Bowser, the young prince is often kidnapped by a female villain such as Wendy O. Koopa or <i>Super Mario </i>enemies wearing the Super Crown (i.e. Bowsette, Booette, Chompette, etc.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun shone over the green and vibrant Mushroom Kingdom. Its warm and bright radiance cast the elegant glow over Princess Peach's Castle, home to the eponymous crown princess who rules over the Mushroom Kingdom with grace and elegance. Though the windows were covered by curtains, the sunlight still shone through the fabric inside the royal bedroom, brightening up the entire room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis slight shift in brightness allowed the occupant sleeping in the bedroom to flutter her eyes open, and slowly sit up with a yawn and a stretch. With a large, content sigh, she looked into her half-exposed bosom, gently reached two pinching fingers deep insider her cleavage, and pulled out a certain seven year-old human boy with short blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey, wakey, Lemon. It's time to wake up,\" Peach cooed as she brought the tiny boy to her pursed lips and kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being named after the sour fruit, Prince Lemon was a sweet and gentle boy made all the more sweeter from his upbringing courtesy of his relative, Peach. He was often curious, but he loved the people in his life, especially the women who loved him back and enjoyed playing with him. Unlike the boys his age, Prince Lemon enjoyed tea parties, shopping, and attempting to apply beauty makeup on the giantesses who babysat him. He was especially fond of being cuddled and held by the giant girls; it was easier on the nerves this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLemon rubbed his eyes and yawned, waking up to the sight of his goddess of a guardian smiling down with her signature plush lips. \"Good morning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) \"...mama.\" (Prince Lemon was born from the lonely Princess Peach wishing to the Star Spirits for a child, so the Star Spirits infused a part of her hair into special glowing flower bud, and the flower bloomed to reveal her son. Today, she's meeting with the dignitaries from the other Kingdoms, so Toadette will be babysitting him.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) \"...big sister.\" (Prince Lemon was born a tiny human lost in the Mushroom Kingdom, but he was found by Peach during a pleasant picnic and was adopted not long after. Peach often teases Lemon like any older sister teased their little brothers, but Lemon didn't mind the teasing at all. Today, she's invited her friends, Daisy, Rosalina, and Pauline for a get together, and Peach has something mischievous planned for Lemon.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) \"...auntie.\" (Prince Lemon is the son of the Princess from the Tiny-Huge Lands who was met with an unfortunate fate by being swallowed by a giant fish at sea. With no sign of her return, Prince Lemon was taken in by his mother's dear friend, Princess Peach, who dearly loved playing with her surrogate nephew.

She quickly planted two more kisses to his little body, and one more for good measure. \"Sorry, but you were just so cute waking up that I just couldn't resist,\" Peach apologized. \"Come on, let's get dressed and ready for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach gently brought him over to her changing station where they got dressed in their attire and ready for the day. While Peach dressed up in her signature pink-colored ball gown and crown, Prince Lemon was dressed up in a yellow-colored uniform to compliment the fruit he was named after, and wore a small crown on top of his head. It wasn't embedded with a jewel, but it nevertheless showcased his royal status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lemon was fully dressed for the day, a white-gloved hand suddenly pinched the back of his uniform. The tiny boy yelped as Peach lifted him up to her bosom and pressed him into her cleavage, squeezing him between her massive breasts. \"Hey, big sis, what are you doing!?\" Lemon yelled as he struggled against Peach's boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm just trying to make lemonade,\" Peach teased, jiggling her massive mammaries and burying the boy deeper inside her cleavage. <br>\r\n\"After all, what's lemonade without a freshly-pressed Lemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, stop! We're gonna be late for breakfast!\" Lemon whined, muffled by Peach's breast flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Lemon, I'll carry you there this way,\" Peach assured with a little giggle, pulling up her white frilly shirt over her exposed cleavage and carrying him while she exited the bedroom and walked down the hallway. \"Oh, and just so you know, we're not gonna eat breakfast alone. The girls are going to be joining us for breakfast shortly and then we're going out for a day on the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of those names, Peach felt a struggling tickle inside her breasts. She held in her urge to laugh out loud as Lemon's little hands tickled her boobs trying to crawl out. He popped out of the top of the white shirt with a gasp. \"Daisy, Rosie, and Pauline's coming over too!? Why didn't you tell me this before!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted it to be a surprise, so... surprise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLemon whined while the giantess giggled at his reaction. \"Why do you keep doing this to me, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, isn't it a big sister's job to tease her little brother?\" Peach asked rhetorically as an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLemon only sighed as an appropriate response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe title of big sister was something Peach took both lightly and lovingly since the day Peach discovered Lemon when he was just a lost little human who wandered into the castle grounds, avoiding the Toad guards and scavenging for food from the bushes. It was around the early afternoon, and Peach and her friends having a delightful picnic in the castle's backyard area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach, Daisy, Rosalina, and Pauline were all enjoying a lovely gathering and gossip over delectable food, tea, and coffee. Unbeknownst to them at the moment, the lost and hungry tiny boy of six years was scavenging for apples to eat from the bushes when he saw the delicious food laid out on the plaid picnic blanket. Out of all the food spread out, the one that got his attention was the cake Peach made herself. He snuck up to the cake while Peach's back was turned and tried to take a chunk of the delicious baked goods. As he went for a few big mouthfuls, Peach sliced off a parts of the cake and handed them to her friends, while she took the one with Lemon in it, burying him inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Peach scooped a portion of the cake slice with Lemon buried inside, the tiny boy popped out and screamed as he was headed into a giant mouth, a big pink maw outfitted with large, chomping, chopping teeth, and glistening with coats of saliva. Fortunately, that scream was all it took for Lemon to grab Peach's attention, as well as Daisy, Rosalina, and Pauline for all to see. He was understandably afraid at first, seeing he was almost eaten by the giant princess of the Mushroom Kingdom, but he was gently shushed and comforted by Peach. Lemon felt at ease under the blonde giantess's gentle touch and remained by her side throughout the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, Peach adopted him and raised him as her little brother. She explained she loved her Toads as her own children, and Lemon was young enough to be her little brother. Despite using the Super Mushroom, Lemon's size didn't grow one bit. That was okay because Lemon was cuter this way. He was so cute, that Peach's sisterly instincts began to tease Lemon, constantly placing him in her breasts,<br>\r\npretending to eat him, and laying with him with her feet. She also enabled her friends to lovingly tease him too, eventually making the young prince a target for their affection and personal desire for their whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to Lemon's innocence, the young prince didn't catch on to their own brand of playfulness. He didn't mind being playing with them, it was a nice pace from being teased by Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two siblings entered the patio where a large round table sat outside, set and ready for their arrival, plus their friends. The table featured a miniature table so that Lemon could eat alongside Peach. The table was loaded with a most delicious sight. There were plates of pancakes, berries, and syrup assembled on one portion of the dining table, plates full of protein breakfasts like bacon, sausages, and eggs cooked in all different kinds, and a few plates with slabs of meat. Whatever the siblings didn't eat, they donated to the servants and the rest to the local Toad orphanage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, this looks delicious!\" Lemon practically squealed. \"I wanna try them! Please, please, I wanna try them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sounds like someone's getting hungry,\" Peach observed as she held up her breasts from the bottom, a teasing glint shining in her eye and a coy smirk at the corner of her mouth. \"Are you hungry, little brother? Are you sure you're really hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I'm hungry!\" Lemon shouted, bobbing in place in his guardian's cleavage. \"Come on, big sis, let's sit down already! Please!? I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, Lemon, you're gonna get your food,\" Peach said teasingly, making Lemon's eagerness fade away and replaced with uncertainty. The boy could only watch as Peach adjusted her breasts with one arm and reach for him with her other white-gloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Peach takes Lemon out so he could join her and her friends for breakfast.<br>\r\n2.) Peach stuffs Lemon further into her cleavage, and the prince is held tightly as Peach goes on with her get together with her friends.<br>\r\n3.) Peach takes Lemon out, plants him on her plate, and buries him in food so she could tease him by eating the food around him (and possibly him, too).<br>\r\n4.) Peach takes Lemon out and places him on the floor where he has to dodge the giant feet of his giant sister and her friends.<br>\r\n5.) Peach takes Lemon out and puts him in one of the seats at the table so he could be squashed under his sister's or friends' behinds.</span></div></div>",

The game became such a huge success that Nintendo launched the titular game franchise that video game fans know and love, with iconic releases such as <i>A Link to the Past</i>, <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, and <i>Breath of the Wild</i> not only driving the franchise to success, but also becoming significant milestones in the development of video games as a whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecades after the launch of the first <i>Legend of Zelda</i> game, Nintendo released an official timeline in their book, Hyrule Historia, explaining the chronological order of the game series, from Hyrule\u2019s foundation in <i>Skyward Sword </i>to the timelines diverging into three separate timelines during the events of <i>Ocarina of Time</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first timeline, The Fallen Hero Timeline, contains the events of <i>Zelda</i> games featuring the series\u2019s overhead view functions, such as <i>A Link to the Past</i>, <i>Link\u2019s Awakening</i>, and <i>A Link Between Worlds</i>. The second timeline, the Child Timeline, contains the events of <i>Majora\u2019s Mask</i>, the sequel to <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, and <i>Twilight Princess</i>. The third timeline, the Adult Timeline containing the events of <i>Zelda</i> games featuring Toon Link, including <i>The Wind Waker</i>, it\u2019s sequel <i>The Phantom Hourglass</i>, and <i>Spirit Tracks</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Great Calamity timeline remains unclear where in the official timeline it belongs, seeing as it contains multiple references to all three timelines above, so for the sake of argument, that timeline will be separated into its own category, containing events from <i>Breath of the Wild</i>, it\u2019s ambiguously canon prequel, <i>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</i>, and the sequel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is, which timeline will you choose to follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHylia &amp; the Hero of Time (i.e. Skyward Sword, Minish Cap, Four Swords, Ocarina of Time)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFallen Hero Timeline (i.e. A Link to the Past, Link\u2019s Awakening, A Link Between Worlds, Oracle series)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChild Timeline (i.e. Majora\u2019s Mask, Twilight Princess, Four Swords Adventure)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult Timeline (i.e. Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat Calamity Timeline (i.e. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Breath of the Wild, the sequel)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This timeline contains the events of <i>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</i>, <i>The Minish Cap</i>, and <i>Ocarina of Time</i> in chronological order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrior to the events of <i>Skyward Sword</i>, the three Golden Goddesses - Din, Goddess of Power; Nayru, Goddess of Wisdom; and Farore, Goddess of Courage - descended upon the chaos of the universe and created the realm of what would be known later as Hyrule. Din created the material realm, Nayru gave the realm order and law, and Farore created life to follow the order. When the world was created and their labors done, the three Golden Goddess left behind a piece of their essence in the form of three golden triangles called the Triforce and left it in the careful hands of the Goddess Hylia before departing into the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the creation of the realm, the Demon King Demise sought to wield the power of the Triforce, so he led a horde of demons onto the realm to wrest it from Hylia's hands. To prevent this, Hylia gathered the remaining humans of the land and sent an outcropping of the land into the sky where the Triforce was hidden inside the floating outcrop above the cloudy barrier. Hylia and the five tribes of the land battled Demise and sealed him away where the outcrop used to be, but the Goddess suffered many injuries. She tasked the spirit within the Goddess Sword, Fi, to assist her chosen champion before she was reborn in the form of a mortal girl, the first Zelda in the floating outcropping called Skyloft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn <i>Skyward Sword</i>, Zelda was forced from the sky by a tornado conjured up by Demise's servant, Ghirahim, prompting Zelda's childhood friend, Link to find her. After Link meets Fi, the spirit residing within the Goddess Sword, he is tasked to obtain the gifts of the three Sacred Flames to bless the Goddess Sword into the Master Sword. After Zelda reveals herself to be Hylia's mortal form and was put into a deep slumber, Link is tasked to gather parts of the \"Song of the Hero\" from the Goddess's appointed dragons to unlock the entrance to the Sky Keep where the Triforce laid hidden. The Hero eventually reaches the Triforce and sends Skyloft plummeting into the ground, destroying Demise's sealed form, The Imprisoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Zelda reawakens, she is kidnapped by Ghirahim and sent to the past where the Demon Lord successfully drains Hylia's essence into The Imprisoned, absorbing Zelda's essence and reawakening Demise. After a victorious battle against the Demon King, Demise curses Link and Zelda's later incarnations into a never-ending cycle against Demise's mortal forms before he was destroyed. Link and Zelda return to the present, and the land of Hyrule was established.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrior to the events of <i>The Minish Cap</i>, the land of Hyrule was infested by evil spirits who were turning the land of Hyrule into darkness. Just as the world seemd to be cast in shadow, the tiny humanoid race, the Picoris/Minish descended from the skies and bestowed a courageous hero the Light Force and the Picori Blade. The Hero of Men used his wisdom and courage, along with his gifts to defeat the demons and restore peace in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn <i>The Minish Cap</i>, Link's childhood friend, Princess Zelda is sealed in stone by the Sorcerer of Winds, Vaati during a tournament in the midst of the celebration of the Picori's first appearance in Hyrule. Vaati was formerly a Minish, an apprentice under the wise Minish sage, Ezlo, who created a magical wishing cap that granted the wearer their wishes. Vaati stole the magical cap, became a powerful sorcerer, turned Ezlo into a talking bird-like cap, and went to steal the Light Force form himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasked by the King of Hyrule to seek out the Picori's help, Link travels to Minish Woods where he meets Ezlo in his cap form, attacked by a group of Octoroks. After Link saves Ezlo, the former Minish sage helps Link travel to the Minish Village by shrinking down to the size of the Picori, and is given the task to reforce the Picor Blade by collecting the Four Elements, the embodiments of earth, air, fire, and water. After obtaining the Four Elements and fusing them with the Picori Blade inside the Elemental Sanctuary hidden within Hyrule Castle, the sacred Four Sword was reforged, and Link uses its duplication powers and his shrinking abilities to defeat Vaati's ghastly forms and seal him away in the Four Sword. Princess Zelda is released from her stone imprisonment and Hyrule is restored to peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, the evil king of the Gerudos, Ganondorf, sought the Triforce by sending monsters to sicken Kokiri Forest, Death Mountain, and Zora's Domain where each of the locations kept hidden a Spiritual Stone to unlock the Master Sword sealed within the Temple of Time, the key to the gateway to the Sacred Realm where the Triforce was kept safe. Young Link, a young Hylian raised by the Kokiri, a race of forest children appointed with a fairy guardian, was given his fairy partner, Navi, to help save the land of Hyrule from Ganondorf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Link claimed the three Spiritual Stones by vanquishing Ganondorf's monsters, the King of Evil made his move by raiding Hyrule Castle. Link is given the Royal Family's most sacred treasure, the Ocarina of Time, by Princess Zelda as she rode to safety with her retainer, Impa. After Link gained access to the Master Sword inside the Temple of Time, Ganondorf followed Link into the Sacred Realm, claimed the Triforce, and plunged Hyrule into seven years of chaos. Meanwhile, Link grew to become seven years older, armed with the Master Sword, and tasked by Rauru, the Sage of Light to gather the six Sages of each race in Hyrule. Aided by the mysterious Sheik, Link gathers the Sages and defeats Ganondorf's monsters in each hidden Temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the last Sage was rescued, Sheik reveals himself to be Princess Zelda in disguise right before she was kidnapped by Ganondorf and imprisoned within his castle where Hyrule Castle once stood. After a lengthy battle against the King of Evil, Link defeats Ganondorf, who is then sealed in the Dark Realm by the Sages. Guilty about being a part into Link's forced maturity as a child, Princess Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back seven years to stop Ganondorf, while Navi flies away with her task completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the sequel, <i>Majora's Mask</i>, Link is ambushed by two Fairies, Tatl and Tael, working with their partner, Skull Kid. While Skull Kid played with the Ocarina of Time gifted to Link by Princess Zelda, the child Hero of Time pursues Skull Kid into the parallel world of Termina where he is turned into a Deku Scrub by the effects of the eerie Majora's Mask stolen from the Happy Mask Salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs part of an agreement, the Happy Mask Salesman tasks Link to retrieve his Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask from the Skull Kid within three days' time in exchange that the Salesman would teach him a song to restore him back to his former form. Link, along with Tatl who was accidentally left behind by Skull Kid, aids Link in retrieving the Ocarina of Time, but discovers that Skull Kid was using the power of the mask to send the Moon to collide with Termina in three days' time. By repeatedly using the Ocarina of Time and traveling back to the first day, Link and Tatl travel to the four different areas in Termina's cardinal directions where they must defeat the Skull Kids' masked monsters and awaken the Four Giants to prevent the Moon from destroying the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awakening the Four Giants, Link prevents the Moon from falling onto Termina while also breaking Majora's Mask's influence over the Skull Kid. Link then travels inside the Moon to defeat the three different forms of Majora and restore peace to Termina. Link and Skull Kid become friends, the Happy Mask Salesman leaves with the depowered Majora's Mask back in his hands, and Link ventures off to search for Navi, never heard from again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<b>A/N: </b>Although<i> Majora's Mask</i> takes place in the Child Timeline, it would make sense to merge both <i>Ocarina of Time</i> and <i>Majora's Mask</i> into a single route.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is, which game(s) will you choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkyward Sword<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Minish Cap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcarina of Time/Majora's Mask<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In one scenario, a boy character(s) finds a mushroom spore in a forested area which permanently shrinks anyone who comes into contact with the spore, but can be administered with an antidote. In another scenario, the characters have their sizes altered by magic, from boys within the age limit being shrunken by Majora's Mask to female characters growing to giant size by the Giant's Mask. In another scenario, the characters have their sizes affected by a size-alteration potion which spells disaster for whoever drinks it, even more so when the potion spills into the river, Hyrule's main freshwater supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorn Tiny: The young male character(s) are a fraction of the hundreds of children born tiny due to the genetic deficiency of the XY chromosome, so with a world full of predominantly female characters, they are doted on by the giant girls in their lives, or they are seduced by them. The lands of Hyrule and Termina is dangerous enough at normal size, but that danger at their size is multiplied a hundred fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormal-Size Among Giantesses: The male character(s) are born normal-sized, but the female characters in the series are more massive than him. In one scenario, the boy is close friends with/raised by the Great Fairies, who are already gigantic in comparison to a normal-sized Hylian. In another scenario, after the events of Ocarina of Time and/or Majora's Mask, the women seem to be larger than normal size by an unknown form of magic, with the young girls being the size of the Goron chief, Darunia and the adults as large as a two-story house in Castle Town Square. In another scenario, the Gerudo become taller than their average normal adult size seen in both games, and they're looking to adopt/play with the male characters who enter their territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpace-Time Rift: The young male character(s) accidentally open or discover a rift in space of time that takes them to anywhere in Hyrule, or into a different era in the past for the future. The only problem is that the rift also has some nasty side-effects which makes the young male character(s) appear as small as a Minish on the other side of the rift and at the mercy of the gigantic female characters! </span></div></div>",

When touched, it released little spores which shrinks the character to the size of a Minish and turn their skin color to purple and their eyes red. There is an antidote that can be administered, but the process takes too much time and the ingredients are rare to find, so the character who inhaled the spores are permanently tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurse of the Masks: In Termina, the Masks contain special magical abilities that even linger in the outskirts of that parallel dimension. However, the Masks aren't to be used very lightly because doing so will create a magical drawback. In one scenario, Skull Kid uses Majora's Mask to shrink down a character (himself included) and is teleported somewhere in Termina or even Hyrule. In another scenario, the Giant's Mask is worn by a female character, and she interacts with the boy they're closely associated with. In another scenario, Link uses the Song of Healing to heal a wounded Minish and transforms his spirit into the Minish Mask, which he uses to shrink and explore his gigantic world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess-Sized Gerudo: In Hyrule, Koume and Kotake, the old twin witches who raised Ganondorf with the ability to merge into giant witch, Twinrova, exacts their revenge on Young Link and/or the youth of Hyrule by brainwashing the Gerudo, then using their magic to alter someone's size. They either shrink their victims and they become the Gerudos' plaything, or they expand the Gerudos and send them rampaging into Hyrule as an army of hypnotized giantesses. Either way, Twinrova will be assured both victory and the satisfaction of revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuny-Sized Potions or Enormous Elixirs: There is a potion brewed in either Hyrule or Termina which affects the size of the person who drinks it. In one scenario, a boy accidentally drinks the shrinking potion and he shrinks to tiny size in an inconvenient area. In another scenario, a girl accidentally drinks the  growth potion and she grows into a towering giantess and interacts with the boy she's closely associated with. In another scenario, the potions are accidentally spilled into the river, and either the boys shrink or the girls grow when they drink it.</span></div></div>",

At one point, the Skull Kid uses Majora's Mask to shrink a boy(s) that he targeted and teleported them to an area in Termina or beyond where the female characters are prominently seen.

Somewhere down the line, the Giant's Mask's magic allows its wearer to share some of its magical abilities into another female character.

In response to this, the three Golden Goddesses - Din, Goddess of Power; Nayru, Goddess of Wisdom; and Farore, Goddess of Courage - called upon four light spirits from each province of Hyrule and sealed their power away in the Fused Shadow. Then the Dark Interlopers were banished into the Twilight Realm through the Mirror of Twilight where they adapted to the Twilight and became the race known as the Twili.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany centuries later, after the events of <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, Ganondorf's intentions to dominate Hyrule and claim the Triforce were exposed, so he was captured, tried, and executed by the Six Sages. When the Six Sages used their sword to mortally wound Ganondorf, the Triforce of Power was activated, and Ganondorf broke free from his chains and immediately killed the Sage of Water. The Sages, fearful of this power, banished Ganondorf into the Twilight Realm where his spirit aided the power-hungry Zant into giving him the power to turn the Twili into mindless beasts, usurp the throne from the Twilight Princess Midna, and send Hyrule and the World of Light into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn <i>Twilight Princess</i>, two centuries after <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, Link's home province of Ordona was invaded by monsters and the Twilight Beasts. He ventured into the twilight where he is forcibly transformed into a wolf, catching the attention of Midna in her cursed imp form, wearing a chunk of her Fused Shadow. In this form, Wolf Link meets Princess Zelda who tasks him and Midna to retrieve the Fused Shadows and restore light to Hyrule with the aid of the light spirits. After collecting the Fused Shadow, Zant forces Midna into the World of Light, mortally wounding her until she is healed by Zelda at the cost of her own spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Midna venture to the Sacred Grove where Link pulls the Master Sword from its resting place in the ruins of the Temple of Time. He then journeys around Hyrule to retrieve the Mirror of Twilight to reopen the gateway into the Twilight Realm where they vanquish Zant, who reveals Ganondorf has returned to Hyrule. With the power of the Fused Shadow, Link and Midna journey into Hyrule Castle and defeat Ganondorf's spirit, who possessed Zelda's body and transformed into a beast. In a final battle against the King of Evil, Link plunges the Master Sword into Ganondorf's heart and kills him, breaking the curse over Midna, revealing her true, beautiful form. Midna departs from the World of Light and the Mirror of Twilight shatters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn <i>Four Swords Adventure</i>, Princess Zelda calls upon her six Maidens and attempts to enforce the seal on the sword, but the shadowy form of Link kidnaps Zelda and the Maidens, and provokes Link to pull the Four Sword from its pedestal. In doing so, Link not only is split into four separate Links, but he breaks the Sorcerer of Winds, Vaati from his seal, freeing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four Links travel across Hyrule and work together to stop the chaos caused by Shadow Link and Vaati, where they also discover that Vaati has been resurrected and used by the King of Darkness, Ganon. Ganon was once a man named Ganondorf who stole the legendary Trident which gave him the power of darkness, as well as the ability to spawn Shadow Links as resentment from being defeated by Link in <i>Twilight Princess</i>. After rescuing the six Maidens, the four Links confront Vaati in the Palace of Winds where Ganon reveals himself as the true mastermind behind the chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the combined efforts of the four Links, Princess Zelda, and the six Maidens, Ganon is sealed inside the Four Sword and laid to rest again. The four Links merge back into the singular Link, who is hailed by Hyrule as a hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is, which of these games will you follow?</span></div></div>",

With the aid of the Sheikah's ancient weaponry, the Guardians, and the four pilotable Divine Beasts designed to combat Calamity Ganon, the princess who carries the blood of the goddess and the hero who possesses the spirit of the hero sealed the Calamity away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hundred years prior to the events of Breath of the Wild, Princess Zelda struggled to fulfill her duties to awaken her powers to seal away the foreseen return of the Calamity, and her animosity towards her chosen knight, Link, whose possession of the Master Sword reminded her of her failures. The Sheikah technology had been unearthed, as well as the Guardians and the Divine Beasts. Each of the Divine Beasts were piloted by a Champion of the other four races governing Hyrule: the Rito, the Gorons, the Zoras, and the Gerudo. With the Champions assembled, victory seemed to be at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Zelda's inability to awaken her power accelerated Ganon's return to Hyrule. Using his malice, the Calamity infected the Guardians and sent Blights to infect each of the Divine Beasts and kill their chosen pilots. As the infected Guardians were about to destroy Link and Zelda, the princess's power awakened as the mortally injured hero laid dying. Compelled by the voice of the Master Sword, Zelda ordered the Sheikah to place Link into the Shrine of Resurrection and put the sword into a slumber before the roots of the Great Deku Tree. With her power, Zelda sealed herself and Ganon within Hyrule Castle and waited until Link's return in the next one hundred years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn <i>Breath of the Wild</i>, Link wakes up to a beautiful voice half-naked, having no memory of his placement as per the effects of the Shrine of Resurrection. The story of Hyrule was imparted to himt by the ghost of King Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule, who urged Link to seek out Impa, the Sheikah elder, and save his daughter, Zelda. At Impa's urge, Link sought after fragments of his memories, traveled the land of Hyrule to destroy the Blights infecting the Divine Beasts, and freed them along with the ghosts of their pilots. With his strength fully returned, Link ventured into the Korok Woods and pulled the Master Sword from its pedestal. He then infiltrated the malice-infected Hyrule Castle and battled Calamity Ganon, weakened by the Divine Beasts' combined assault. During one final battle with the Dark Beast Ganon, Zelda bestows Link the Bow of Light and defeats the beast, freeing Zelda from its hold and allowing her to seal him away. Hyrule is saved, and peace is restored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<b>A/N:</b> The summary of the upcoming sequel will be added here later! Also, no one is permitted to add to the sequel route until its official release and gameplay.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is, which of these scenarios will you choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Size-Alteration:</b> There are many ways a character from The Legend of Zelda series can shrink and grow. In one scenario, a boy character(s) finds a mushroom spore in a forested area which permanently shrinks anyone who comes into contact with the spore, but can be administered with an antidote. In another scenario, the characters have their sizes altered by Calamity Ganon's malice, from boys within the age limit being shrunken to female characters growing to giant size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Born Tiny:</b> The young male character(s) are a fraction of the hundreds of children born tiny due to the genetic deficiency of the XY chromosome, so with a world full of predominantly female characters, they are doted on by the giant girls in their lives, or they are seduced by them. In another scenario, a boy is from a race of tiny people based on <i>Breath of the Wild's</i> concept art. The lands of Hyrule and Termina is dangerous enough at normal size, but that danger at their size is multiplied a hundred fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Normal-Size Among Giantesses:</b> The male character(s) are born normal-sized, but the female characters in the series are more massive than him. In one scenario, the boy is close friends with/raised by the Great Fairies, who are already gigantic in comparison to a normal-sized Hylian. In another scenario,  the women seem to be larger than normal size by an unknown form of magic, with the young girls being the size of the Goron chief, Daruk,  and the adults as large as a two-story house in Castle Town Square. In another scenario, the Gerudo become taller than their average normal adult size seen in both games, and they're looking to adopt/play with the male characters who enter their territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Space-Time Rift:</b> The young male character(s) accidentally open or discover a rift in space of time that takes them to anywhere in Hyrule, or into a different era in the past for the future. The only problem is that the rift also has some nasty side-effects which makes the young male character(s) appear as small as a Minish on the other side of the rift and at the mercy of the gigantic female characters!</span></div></div>",

The mother's heart became bitter and cold from the death of Jack's father and the misfortune which followed. While the village prospered, Jack's farm was dried up with an unquenchable drought. The chickens could not lay any more eggs, so they were all slaughtered. Even the farm's cow, Old Bessie, could not produce anymore milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Jack and his mother discovered that they had only a few shillings and they could not afford to buy food, so the mother forced the cow's reins into his hand and ordered, \"Jack, use what little brains you have and go to the market and sell Old Bessie for profit, and don't give me anything less than what she is valued right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon his stern mother's orders, Jack took Old Bessie to market and showcased her to any of the denizens in the village, but none of them would take her. Just then, a strange old man beckoned him and the cow over to him and said, \"My dear boy, I do not have a shilling on me, but I will make you a better deal. If you give me your cow, then I will give you this box of magic beans. Plant them, and greater fortune will come your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was hesitant, but then again, what good will a handful of shillings do for him and his mother when it will only grant them temporary relief from hunger? So Jack exchanged Old Bessie for the beans and merrily skipped his way home. When he told his mother about the exchange with the old man, the mother angrily smacked the beans out the window, struck him, and angrily chastised him, \u201cYou foolish boy! You stupid foolish boy! We would never fill our bellies on one bean, let alone three! You have been a shameful disgrace since you were growing in my belly! That is why I wish it was you rather than your father who should have died!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was so heartbroken that he had sequestered himself in his room for the rest of the day, his eye blackened from the strike. During that night, the magical beans began to sprout and quickly grew into a giant beanstalk tall enough to stretch into the sky, into the clouds and the heavens above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Jack and his mother were amazed by the sight of the giant beanstalk sprouting from their very own backyard. The beans alone were the size of a horse wagon, enough to fill their bellies and sell for a pretty profit. At her request, Jack's mother urged him, \"Well, what are you waiting for, you stupid boy!? Climb up that beanstalk and collect all of the beans you can find! Bring them down here so we may finally be rich again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack obeyed his mother and began to climb up the seemingly never-ending beanstalk, plucking every bean along the way and letting them fall to the ground. As he climbed higher, he found himself ascending into the clouds, the tiny ice particles chilling his skin. The more he climbed, the colder it seemed to get. He climbed higher and higher until finally, he surfaced above the clouds and into another realm consisting of clouds and the stars more beautiful than the nighttime. He was astounded to find himself in a garden as big as his village with vegetables bigger than the baron's house! Carrots, cabbages, radishes, cucumbers, tomatoes, and so much more, laid out all around him and open for him to pluck it all and to drop to the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the garden was a grandiose castle as big as a large mountain. The doors alone were bigger than the church up to its steeple. The curious Jack hiked through the garden and approached the foot of the door. He pounded it with all of his might. Not so long afterwards, the door opened and out stepped a giant woman the exact size of the steeple, to Jack's complete surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d the giantess called out to what she perceived as no one. \u201cWho dares knock on my door and disappears so rudely!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess hadn\u2019t known that standing at her toes was an astounded little boy named Jack who was small enough to be eaten by her in one bite. The giantess then set her sights at the ground, and Jack\u2019s blue eyes met her beautiful eyes as well. This particular giantess was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.)...a chubby giantess, a kind and loving protector and nourisher of tiny humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.)...a muscular giantess, a barbaric torturer and devourer of tiny humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.)...a young giantess two years Jack's senior, her perspective with the tiny humans ambiguous.</span></div></div>",

While most other giantesses prefer to indiscriminately devour and torture the tiny humans, Helga prefers to care and shelter the humans in her own home, which makes her an outcast among her own people. She works as her house's cleaner, cook, and gardener, but she does not mind the labor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b><br>\r\nJack was taken aback by the appearance of the giant woman standing at her doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess was pot-bellied, chubby around arms and her rotund face. She wore rags similar to the rags that his mother wore most of the time, including the white smock that was stained and dirtied by apparently long hours of labor. The rags dropped all the way to her leather-sandaled feet, caked and stained with dirt, especially in between her toenails and underneath her feet, seen as the giantess wiggled her toes. Her auburn hair, tied together in thick braids, was tucked underneath a rag wrapped around her head. Her eyes were as brown as the droughted dirt implanted around his house, and they gazed at him with surprise and childlike curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy my word, can it be!?\u201d The thick-bellied giantess bent down and quickly scooped up the tiny boy in her palm just before he could get away. Jack was caught in the giantess\u2019s pillowy palm and struggled to move as he was lifted up into the air and up to her face. He got a better look at the giantess\u2019s round, freckled face, her giant brown eyes brightened up in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, it is! A little human boy has stumbled onto my home!\u201d the giantess said marvelously, holding Jack to close proximity to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe size of the giantess\u2019s mouth frightened poor little Jack. The maw was like a cave deep under the sea, dark and wet where hardly any light shone inside its deeper darkness. Her tongue was like a giant pink serpent waiting for its next victim to devour, and the incisor teeth were the size of an executioner\u2019s axe. Worse was the abyssal throat which led down to the boiling cauldron of the giantess\u2019s stomach where her food dissolved underneath their burning juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me, Miss Giant!\u201d Jack begged, cowering in the flesh of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess let out a hearty chuckle. \u201cWorry not, my tiny friend, for I do not desire the taste of human flesh, not even to children such as yourself! I am Helga Fostrajotunn, a kindly giant from a faraway land of giants of myth! Who are you and what brings such a young one to my home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was relieved to hear that the giantess was not partial to the taste of human flesh, and he opened himself up to his giant captor. \"I am Jack, a poor and hungry boy from below the clouds. I was given magical beans from a strange man for my family\u2019s cow, and over the night, the beans sprouted into a giant beanstalk that reached up into the clouds. My mother tasked me with climbing the stalk to pick the beans when I climbed through the clouds and beheld your garden and your castle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Helga listened with a nod. She reached her finger up, lifted Jack's shirt and gasped. \"Why, you poor boy, you're nothing but skin and bones! Come inside. I will treat you to breakfast, but be warned, for most of my kin desires nothing but the taste of tiny young humans like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Helga took Jack to her kitchen and treated him to breakfast as she promised. Placing him on the table, Helga served Jack crumbs of the previous night's supper which seemed like a feast for the village baron. A crumb of bread, a hunk of cheese, a slice of meat, and a thimble full of milk to wash it all down. As Jack was served a bit of honeycomb to add the sweet flavor of honey to his diet, the giantess watched him intently with curiosity, a motherly smile stretched across her rotund face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness, you certainly were hungry, weren't you?\" Helga inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Miss Helga,\" Jack said. \"My farm was stricken by drought since my father's death, and we had to resort to eating our chickens who could not lay eggs. We had to sell my family's cow for profit, but I gave her up for the magic beans, and for that, my mother punished me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punished you?\" Helga parroted. She squinted carefully at Jack's youthful face and gasped at the sight of his black eye. \"Oh, you poor dear! No mother should punish a child this way! I bet your mother also made you climb up the beanstalk in pursuit of riches rather than be concerned for the betterment of her own family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is no problem, Miss Helga,\" Jack insisted. \"My mother worked to the bone to maintain our farm and she has ached her back. I am young and capable of handling arduous tasks myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, that's enough. Even you must realize that your mother has replaced all of the love in her heart for her heart with bitterness and greed.\" Upon the giantess's words, the reality of his mother's hard words and physical punishments made Jack fall silent. His will to feast suddenly dissipated like the moisture of his farm which led to the accursed drought. \"You are loyal to your mother and you hold much love for her, but has she ever returned that love to you? When has she ever declared her love for her own son, despite how poorly your family lives? Any mother who puts their own needs ahead of their own children can never be a real mother to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt the weight of Helga's words descend upon him like her sandaled foot. He pushed away his thimble and honeycomb and curled his knees to his chest. He sunk his head inside his legs and began to cry. \"Oh, Helga, you are right! What am I to do!?\" he sobbed to the giant woman. \"My mother's heart has hardened since my father's death, and the farm has fallen into disaster! We have no money, and soon the baron's tax collectors will be on our doorstep! Worst of all, my mother despises me because of it all, preferring if I had died instead of my father! Oh, Helga, what am I to do!? What am I to do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess's heart broke at the sight of the young human lamenting at his own woes. The saddened giantess placed her palm behind Jack and gently stroke his back with her thumb. \"Oh, Jack, I am sorry for how your life has granted you an unfair boon,\" Helga cooed, \"but weep not, for I may have a solution to your problem which will undoubtedly aid you in years to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a sniffle, Jack looked up to the reassuring giantess with hope in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Are you certain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my child, and it shall make you happy above all else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Helga's solution?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Helga helps Jack with his family's financial troubles with her prized golden goose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Helga adopts Jack as her surrogate human son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Before Helga could help Jack, another giantess approaches!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Marsha is well-known among her people and kin for her power and using her giant axe in battle, but she is also known for her excessive pride for herself and her race, meaning she's not below discriminating any other races, including humans. Everyone knows she views the tiny humans as bugs or delectable morsels, and when she's hungry for them, she likes the fresh taste of the young ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b><br>\r\nJack was taken aback by the appearance of the giant woman standing at her doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess was massive and muscular, especially around the abdominal area where one of the pecs alone was as big as his house. Her raven black hair, as dark as a curtain of the night, hung down to her shoulders. She wore a barbaric outfit, wearing thick leather over her massive breasts concealed tightly behind a metallic breastplate, chained by a pauldron armor on each of her shoulders. At her waist below her exposed midriff, she wore a belt strapping a flowing leather skirt, a giant brown loincloth wrapped tightly under the area between her muscular legs. At her knees and trailing down to her feet, she wore a pair of tall leather boots, wrapped tightly with pelts. She also wore a pair of heavy leather wristbands wrapped around her wrists as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo complete this intimidating appearance, the giantess wore a stone-hardened scowl which softened as her verdant eyes met Jack's tiny form, never minding the fear in the boy's eyes while hers shone an uneasy gleefulness. \"Well, what do we have here? A little human bug has decided to intrude upon my home,\" she said with a cold, dominant tone. \"So nice of you to drop in for breakfast, little worm, especially since little human children are a big part of my breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't even think twice about escaping when he saw the barbaric giantess hungrily lick her chops. The boy quickly turned tail and made for the garden, but he couldn't get more than ten feet away when the giantess suddenly stomped her leather-covered foot right behind him, the shock knocking him to the ground. Jack found himself laying on his belly, and as he tried to get up, a giant feminine hand suddenly clamped in on him, four powerful fingers and a thumb holding him tightly while it lifted the screaming boy up and to the giantess's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal woman eyed the boy in her fist like a predator before leaping in for the kill. She chuckled darkly, watching the young human pitifully try to escape her grasp, only for her to squeeze her fist and compact his body. \"Now, look at this mess you've gotten yourself into. I bet you must've come all the way to the castle just to get a good look at the mistress on the outside,\" the giantess taunted, running her tongue over her upper set of teeth. \"Now that you've seen her, how would you like to get a better look at her on the inside, little boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess's lips parted open wide, showing her young victim his possible next destination. The size of the giantess\u2019s mouth frightened poor little Jack. The maw was like a cave deep under the sea, dark and wet where hardly any light shone inside its deeper darkness. Her tongue was like a giant pink serpent waiting for its next victim to devour, and the incisor teeth were the size of an executioner\u2019s axe. Worse was the abyssal throat which led down to the boiling cauldron of the giantess\u2019s stomach where her food dissolved underneath their burning juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t eat me, Miss Giant!\u201d Jack begged, cowering in the fist of his captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I cannot guarantee that, little human boy. You see, I enjoy the consumption of those who are no bigger than the size of my hand, and little worms such as yourselves are no exception,\" the giantess said, whipping out her signature battle axe and striking the handle into the cloudy ground. Suddenly, her teasing seemed to have dissipated like sugar in water. \"I am Marsha Laejotunn, your captor and your executioner. You have trespassed onto my home and I can only guess you wanted to steal my vegetables from my servants' garden or treasure within my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, Miss Giant, please, I was just...\" The giantess squeezed her fist, choking Jack and stopping his defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, you little worm! You should not have come here so foolishly!\" Marsha bellowed in Jack's face like thunder. \"Many who have foolishly ventured onto my home have met similar fates. They were sliced apart by my axe, stamped beneath my mighty feet, or met their doom in the darkness of my stomach. Some have tried to escape, but they all had one thing in common, little worm: They have all failed, and for that, their lives have ended by my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please...\" Jack wheezed, his lungs feeling like they were collapsing, tears squeezed from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how shall I best punish a bug such as yourself?\" Marsha rhetorically asked her young victim, wiggling the toes of her boots. \"I suppose I could crush you under my feet. It seems fitting, seeing as you are the perfect size for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or...\" Marhsa continued, moving Jack up over her face, shifting her hand so she pinched Jack at the back of his tunic, \"I could always swallow you. You may be only a tiny morsel, but you've caught me during my breakfast, so you should be a part of it as well.\" For the second time, the barbaric giantess opened her maw and showed the dark, dank cave of her maw, blowing a hot gust of breath that made the boy wiggle frantically in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or...\" Marsha wondered, bringing Jack down to the level of her face, tilting her head and spreading a frightening grin on her beautiful face, \"I could always keep you for my slave. I have a bunch of other tiny slaves who serve their mistress without question, and having one more couldn't hurt. Maybe you'll be better off as my insole, inside my loins, or as my toy, I'm sure I can find a better use for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armored giantess pinched the back of Jack's tunic tightly while the boy in question slowed his struggles down as he realized the futility of it all. He realized that no matter what he did, the giantess would have the upper hand. Alongside her strength and size, Marsha also displayed a clear sense of pride and dominance towards him and anyone else his size and age. He was nothing but a bug, an edible morsel, or even a toy for his gigantic captor. Whatever happened to him was up to Marsha Laejotunn, the devourer and dominator giant warrior woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Marsha drops Jack on the ground and crushes him under her foot (he survives, but is flattened against her sole!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Marsha drops Jack into her mouth and swallows him whole (he survives, but is trapped inside her stomach!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Marsha brings Jack in as her own personal slave (he meets other young people of the realm who have been forced into slavery).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) Jack attempts to reason with the giantess to spare his life and his freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) Jack escapes Marsha's grasp, but he must make it to the beanstalk with Marsha in pursuit!</span></div></div>",

However, the Lilliputians are weary of Gulliver's dangerous giant size, and Gulliver discovers that the Lilliputians often emphasize on trivial matters which causes rifts within the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, Gulliver assists Lilliput in their war against the rival country of similarly tiny people, Blefuscu, but Gulliver refuses to convert Blefuscu into a province for Lilliput. He is charged with treason and sentenced to be blinded, but he escapes with the help of a friend to Blefuscu where they prepare a boat for him to sail to sea where a passing ship spots him and carries him back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn later chapters, Gulliver washes up on the shores of Brobdingnag, a country inhabited by giants where he is cared for by the young Brobdingnagian girl, Glumdalclitch.

During spring break, the Walker family decided they were going to fly from their hometown in Florida to Italy for the week. Unfortunately, their flight path takes them through the Bermuda Triangle, an area infamous for the disappearances of different airplanes and ships, and is protected by a mystical lightning storm. This lightning storm will not only change Timmy's fate, but also his small size as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b><br>\r\nThe Walker family was ready to board the flight to their overseas destination to Italy. Michelle Walker, the matriarch of the Walker family, was taking her husband and her three sons to Italy for their spring break. Michelle and her husband was excited to explore the beautiful Italian countryside to see the beautiful sights and tourist attractions. The older two brothers were excited to explore the pretty girls of Italy and vainly attempt to swoon them with their fake Italian accents. Eight year-old Timmy, the youngest member of the family, was excited to try out the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy was the youngest and the most energetic member of his family, having a strong penchant for food at his age. Where Where China had been the country to invent noodles, Italy was the place where they perfected it into all kinds of pastas, pizzas, and soups, and Timmy couldn't wait to try them all out. Their flight path went from Florida to an international airport in Italy, directly over the Atlantic Ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they would find over a certain area was certain doom, because the flight paths went over the Bermuda Tringle, an area off the coast of Florida where strong electromagnetic fields conjured up strong lightning storms and made any magnetic instrument go haywire. The worst part were the mysterious disappearances of different ships and aircrafts reported over the years. Then again, in recent years, those reports of disappearing transports diminished, and the dangers of the Bermuda Triangle were mostly forgotten and scrubbed away. No one could ever predict what would happen to Flight 407 to Italy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened two hours after the airplane took off the runway. The flight was relatively peaceful, people conversing with each other, kids squirming in their seats or preoccupied with their handheld game consoles. In Timmy's case, he was the only kid on the plane playing his Nintendo 3DS, sitting in the window seat while his mother and father took the middle and aisle seats respectively. He was totally engrossed in his game, and the only things that would normally snap him out of his reverie were refreshments, a bathroom break, a movie, and when his DS's battery ran out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway through this ill-fated flight, a strong pounding sensation, a consistent shuddering, and flickering lights snapped Timmy out of it, scaring him and all the other passengers onboard. Timmy turned to the window and saw nothing but dark clouds and the strobing flashes of lightning. Suddenly, he felt his body tingle all over, like every muscle in his body fell asleep and was accompanied with the prickly nerve sensation. He whimpered as he quickly diminished in his seat, he and his clothes shrinking in his seat, loosening the seatbelt. Michelle gasped at the sight of her son shrinking before her eyes... and Timmy could only look up to his now-giant mother for salvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a bolt of lightning struck his window, shattering it and causing the air pressure to get sucked out and everything else small enough to fit along with it. Timmy screamed as he tried to hold on to his seatbelt. Before Michelle could reach him, Timmy's grip on the leather slipped and he was sucked into the open air, falling miles above the Atlantic just as another lightning bolt struck the plane's engines. The plane went down with one of the engines blazing like an apocalyptic fireball, crashing into the ocean the same time Timmy merely plunked into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy quickly surfaced into the turbulent ocean waters and watched helplessly as the plane sunk into the ocean, taking everyone inside with it. Timmy cried for his mommy just as a wave dragged him under the surface, pulling him down with the pressure. Between his tiny size and the ocean's heavy pressure, all Timmy could do was try to swim back up to the surface, but he was too weak against everything else. His struggles led to physical soreness, then to mental fatigue, and then finally, loss of consciousness. Before he blacked out, he vaguely saw giant feminine shapes in the water swimming towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do not fear child. It is not your time, yet,</i> a soothing motherly voice gently spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Timmy knew, he was hacking up saltwater from his lungs. After he hacked up the last of the seawater, Timmy looked around and saw only a beach, but appearing more gigantic to his shrunken size. He stood up in the sand, feeling the sand's grit stronger grit against his feet, and looked out into the ocean. He stared out into the vast ocean waters underneath the bright, blue, and partly cloudy skies and fell into a fetal position. Then everything came crashing down on him as he began to cry, wailing for the death of his family, for the death of his mommy, and for the traumatic event he was forced to endure. He was alone and stranded on this island, and he could never get his family back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the noise of someone striding the sands, accompanied by the slight tremors with each stride. Timmy broke away from his mourning and turned to the direction of the sound. The person (or people) approaching his area was a giant woman by his size! This giantess was none other than...</span></div></div>",

On Paradise Island, there was hardly any corruption or war, but Diana felt there was something for her outside the forbidden mystic barriers surrounding the island with never ending storm clouds. She could feel it stirring deep within her very essence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat feeling came to light when she spotted what looked like a giant metal bird crashing into the oceans far off the shores of Themyscira. It fell like any bird would fall when pierced with an arrow mid-air, except one of its wings was burning alight Icarus's wings before the blazing sun. It fell into Poseidon's wrathful waters with a mighty splash. Her mother, Queen Hippolyta, would often tell Diana of tales when she returned to Man's World to aid in a bloody worldwide war, and one of those tales was of giant metal birds transporting anyone within its belly into the air and across the waters of the world. Diana couldn't help but bow her head and say a little prayer to the gods to deliver their souls into peace while their bodies were fed to the guarding megalodons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Diana witnessed the bird being slowly claimed by the sea, her peripheral vision caught something unusual crawling from the crashing waters on the shores. Gifted with the eyes of Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt and the Moon, Diana squinted her eyes and got a better look. On the shores was the tiny shape of a person laying in the sands in the position of a baby's fetus. The person was small... perhaps it was a child? From what she could see based on the child's shuddering, he was crying. Perhaps the small child was the only survivor of the metal bird\u2019s demise, and traversed through Poseidon\u2019s waters only to wash up on the shores of Themyscira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat Hera. He's all alone,\u201d Diana whispered as she quickly strode over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Timmy had wept, he picked up the hearing of someone striding the sands, accompanied by the slight tremors with each stride. Timmy broke away from his mourning and turned to the direction of the sound. The person approaching his area was a giant woman by his size! This giantess was a beautiful woman with creamy skin, and hair as black as night pulled into a single braided ponytail. She wore a leather breastplate and metal bracelets on her wrists reaching just below her forearms. Around her waist, she wore a belt with a scabbard sheathed with a sword, holding up a short beige skirt, and knee-high leather gladiator sandals worn on her immaculate feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy watched the giantess approach his location. He saw her eyes meeting his tiny stature, he saw how she towered over him, and he began to panic. He quickly got up on his feet and ran as fast as his aching muscles could take him, screaming all the way. <i>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of me,\u201d</i> Diana deduced as she began to pursue him, her strides quickly making up ground. \u201cLittle one, wait! Do not be afraid! I have not come to harm you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the tiny panicking boy wouldn\u2019t listen. Driven by his flight response, Timmy ran as fast as his tiny legs would let him. The booming vibrations of the giantess\u2019s feet behind him began to grow bigger and more powerful as she quickly caught up with him. Then all of a sudden, a sandaled foot crashed at his heel, creating a shocking tremor that knocked him off his feet and land face-first into the sand. Before he could quickly recover, a pair of giant ivory hands gently scooped him up along with a handful of sand beneath him and lifted him up to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy whimpered and scrambled as the sand beneath him drained from the cracks between the cracks of the giantess\u2019s palms and fingers. Past the waist, the belly, and the breasts, Timmy was lifted to the giantess\u2019s beautiful face. Her blue eyes stared down on him like a goddess, judging his every action leading up to now. Timmy felt the fear overwhelm him and he began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t hurt me! I don\u2019t wanna die!\u201d Timmy begged, which made the giantess pout pitifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, little one, I\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d Diana assured as she gently brought her other hand to comfort the boy. Timmy whimpered and curled in her palm, preparing for the inevitable moment when she might crush him. Instead, he felt the giantess\u2019s fingers gently stroke him on the back, the same way his mother used to when he needed her comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is okay, little one. There is no need to cry, I would never harm a child,\u201d Diana cooed, gently stroking the tiny child\u2019s back. She could feel him shivering like he was cold from the water, except he was shuddering out of fear. \u201cMy name is Diana. I am the princess of the Amazons of Themyscira, to which you have washed upon its shores. What is your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy sniffed and choked, wiping his wet nose with his arm. \u201cM-M-My name is T-T-Timmy, M-Miss Giant. Timmy W-Walker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you, Timmy. And please, call me Diana,\u201d the giantess said softly and gently the same way her mother used to talk to her when she was his age. \u201cTimmy, I know this may be painful for you to talk about, but were you one of the people who survived the demise of that giant metal bird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giant... metal bird...?\" Timmy turned to the oceans, and he knew what the giantess, Diana referred to. \"Yes. My family and I were... were flying all the way from Florida to Italy for a family vacation. W-We were flying, and then we flew into the storm, and then... and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories of that traumatic even came flooding back in flashes, the mental images of his miniaturization and what happened afterwards making him cry harder. \u201cTh-th-the plane started rumbling, and I somehow got smaller and smaller! Then the light hit my window and I got sucked out of the plane! Then when I was fuh-fuh-falling, th-the plane was hit by the lightning again, and it went down into the ocean! I tried to swim, but I was pulled down underwater and... and...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy remembered what he saw next, the images of the plane crashing into the ocean with a flaming wing as clear as crystal, taking his family with him into the depths of Davy Jones' Locker. The shrunken boy screamed and wailed at the fates of his family, and fell into the soft comfort of Diana's palm. \"Oh, Timmy, I am so sorry for your loss and for your predicament,\u201d Diana consoled the boy, \"but do not worry, young one, because you are not alone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I am alone!\u201d Timmy wailed. \u201cI lost my mommy! I lost my brothers! I don\u2019t have a family anymore! I\u2019ll never get to see them again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana gently shushed the boy as she clenched her fist gently and held him close to her chest. With her thumb, she gently ruffled his hair, massaging his scalp as he released his inner turmoil into her bosom. Such a cruel fate for a child, Diana figures, to be shrunken down by the same mystical barrier used to protect this island and to lose his family all at once. This boy was small enough to be stepped on or eaten like a little morsel. He needed guidance, and he needed a mother. Unfortunately, Aphrodite's Law dictated that no man should set foot on this island, and this son of Man's World was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she thought of something on the spot, but it was going to be risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Diana takes him back to her secret hiding area in the grotto.<br>\r\n2.) Diana takes him to her mother, Queen Hippolyta, for guidance.</span></div></div>",

For many millennia, Hippolyta has watched over Paradise Island, risen from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean by the Greek gods and protected with a powerful ward from any outside forces. She was the one who crafted her daughter, Diana, from a clay baby and brought to life by the blessings of the gods. She was the one who taught her most of life's most valuable lessons, but was reluctant to teach her the arts of fighting and war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was until the male soldier, Steven Rockwell Trevor, crashed his aircraft on the shores of Themyscira, and then everything changed. The man was to be escorted back into Man's World, and only the winner of the fated tournament she arranged would be the one to do it. Against her mother's wishes, Diana won the tournament and was tasked with the burden to take Steve back into Man's World where they revered her as the iconic heroine she is today. This memory was sparked as Hippolyta witnessed the fiery crash of Flight 407 within the perimeter of the powerful storm wards. Dressed in her finest fuchsia robes, Hippolyta quickly raced to the shores and watched the carrier plane sink into Poseidon's cruel waters, and dipped her head in prayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O Hades, god of the underworld, please allow Charon to ferry the poor souls aboard that flying vessel across the River Styx, and let them be at peace within the heavenly fields of Elysium,\" Hippolyta whispered, a tear shed for each man, woman, and even child aboard the crashed flight. It didn't take much to know that no one could have survived that crash, nor could they avoid the jaws of the megalodons guarding the waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Hippolyta spent a moment of silence for those who suffered an unfortunate fate, she heard a sniffle... a whimper of a youth. It was very faint, almost like the squeaking of a mouse. She followed her ears to that sound and beheld a saddened sight. It appeared to a child, curled up into a fetal position, grieving for whoever he lost in that vessel. The voice alone confirmed that the child was the son of Man's World. Curiously and surprisingly, the boy was as small as a little seashell! Hippolyta knew the fear of his shrunken size also factored in his weeping. She needed to do something, and she needed to be quick about it, for not only were the beasts of the island would be large enough to gobble him up and the Amazons to accidentally crush him where they stepped, but he was violating Aprohidte's Law upon her people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting her staff down, Hippolyta quickly strode towards the shrunken boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Timmy had wept, he picked up the hearing of someone striding the sands, accompanied by the slight tremors with each stride. Timmy broke away from his mourning and turned to the direction of the sound. The person approaching his area was a giant woman by his size! This giantess was a beautiful woman with creamy skin, and hair as black as night curled like campfire smoke, some of the longer strands curled up in a ponytail. She wore fuchsia robes which bore the size and flow of a theater curtain, and was adorned in a gold belt, and old accessories on her ears and around her neck. Gladiator sandal-clad feet poked from underneath the robes, headed right for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy's panic and flight instincts took over as he screamed and ran away from the approaching giantess. \"Wait! Little one, wait!\" the giantess implored the young shrinkee. \"Do not be afraid, little one! I am not trying to harm you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the tiny panicking boy wouldn\u2019t listen. Driven by his flight response, Timmy ran as fast as his tiny legs would let him. The booming vibrations of the giantess\u2019s feet behind him began to grow bigger and more powerful as she quickly caught up with him. Then all of a sudden, a shadow loomed over him as the giantess's left sandaled foot stepped over his tiny frame, landing a ways ahead of him with a boom, enveloping him in fuchsia shadow. On his right, the giantess's right foot stopped shortly ahead of him. Timmy screamed as he was trapped in the shadow underneath the giantess, unable to see, unable to find his way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo additional quakes rocked him from within the darkness. Then a doorway in the darkness lifted into light, and a giant feminine hand adorned in a metallic bracelet reached in, quickly curling a set of five fingers around his tiny frame. Timmy's panic upgraded into hysterics as the giantess held him in her fist and brought him out into the light, lifting him up to her worried face. Hippolyta frowned at the sight of the panicking tiny boy in her palm, stricken by Phobos and overwhelmed with grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Miss Giant, don't hurt me!\" Timmy begged, curling up his body and turning to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, child, be at peace. I do not have the desire to harm the son of Man's World, even if he is quite small,\" Hippolyta gently assured the boy. She gently pet her fingers against Timmy's body, who flinched at the touch at first, but settled under it. \"You were aboard the vessel, were you not, child? You were somehow shrunken in the process and ended up on the shores of Themyscira. The fates have not been so kind to you, child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled into his sleeve, and sat up in the middle of Hippolyta's giant palm. He built enough courage to stare into the giant queen's eyes, who looked down on him with pity and sympathy. \"It is alright, child. I promise no harm will come to you on Themyscira,\" Hippolyta gently assured, using the same assuring voice she used when Diana was the boy's age. \"I am Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons and of this island you were washed upon. Can you tell me where you are from and how you came to be this way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy nodded, whimpering. \u201cT-Timmy, your majesty. T-Timmy Walker,\u201d the bite-sized boy answered. \"I-I was flying with my family over the ocean to Italy when... when... when a scary storm hit the plane! I don\u2019t know what happened, but I shrunk to this size and I was sucked out of the plane! I fell into the water and I tried to swim but I was so tired, I couldn\u2019t swim anymore! Then I woke up on the beach all alone and... and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy couldn\u2019t hold back the urge to cry as he buried his face in his hands. \u201cThey\u2019re gone! They\u2019re gone and I can never see them again! I\u2019ll never see my big brothers again! I\u2019ll never see my daddy again! I\u2019ll never see my mommy again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Timmy wept in the queen\u2019s hand, keeling over letting tears flow from his eyes, Hippolyta couldn\u2019t help but feel heartbroken for the poor boy. With her other hand, she gently stroked Timmy\u2019s back, cradling him in her gentle grasp. \u201cI am sorry, little one. This is a fate you did not deserve to suffer from. I can never imagine the pain of your loss and the terror of being so small compared to the rest of the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled and choked. \u201cI miss them so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, young one. Your grief speaks of it in volumes,\" Hippolyta answered. She could only watch as the boy poured out his devastations in the palm of her hand, feeling as if he needed someone else in his life, someone who needed a mother more than anything else in the world. \"Timmy, I know this may sound so sudden now, but your presence here on this island goes against our rules stating that no men is to enter these shores. Even though you are a child, Timmy, you are still a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy continued to weep, his head drooped down in sorrow. A giant gentle index finger lifted his chin and met with Hippolyta's gentle eyes. \"But there is still a way for me to bypass this law,\" the gentle giantess said softly. \"If any man is willing to remain on this island, then the man must be bound to an Amazon in servitude. The man will serve the Amazon well, but in accordance to Aphrodite's Law, we must also provide them food, shelter, and comfort in the name of love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what does that mean?\" Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means, child, that since you have no family to turn to on Themyscira, you will be living here with me,\" Hippolyta clarified. \"You will have to do what I ask of you in exchange for food and a place to live, but I am sure they will be simple for you, given your current size. I cannot in good conscience ask of you got me to replace the mother you lost, but all I ask is you let me take care of you, nurture you, and encourage your journey to growing into a man. Do you accept this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled, wiping his wet nose again, and nodding his head. \"Mm-hmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Now hold out your fists to me.\" Timmy held out his fists, just as the queen ordered him to. \"Turn them over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy overturned his arms, showing the underside of his fists. Hippolyta gently laid her gigantic hand over Timmy's arms, and suddenly, her bracelet glowed as a little drop of light trickled onto his wrists. The light wrapped around the wrists and faded, giving Timmy a pair of metal bracelets just like the giantess said. \"Now you are bound to me, young Timmy Walker. As long as you are bound to me, no harm may come of you, nor shall any Amazon attempt to break it. When you are in distress, these bracelets will glow, indicating you are in trouble. In exchange, you will need to do as you are told, but the tasks I will assign you will accommodate your youth and size. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, your majesty,\" Timmy stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" Hippolyta nodded. \"Come, let us retire. You must be weary from your struggles and you must rest. Allow me to carry you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Hippolyta reached dress, and gently inserted Timmy into her cleavage. After securing him in her breasts, the Queen of the Amazons took her staff and marched towards the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.)

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Queen Hippolyta marched through the city, her newly-appointed young charge hidden between her breasts. Timmy's face burned bright red as his new giant caretaker strolled through the ivory streets of the Themysciran city, embarrassed by the fact he was restrained between his adopted mother's breasts which bobbed and bounced with each new taken step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was obscured behind the hem of Hippolyta's fuchsia gown, keeping him hidden from the eyes of the Amazon Queen's fellow sisters. Hippolyta knew they'd frown upon the idea of allowing a man to stay on Paradise Island, no matter how young he was, and they would frown deeper upon learning that their queen had bound him to her service. Hippolyta would have to explain it later once she reached the palace, feeling the tiny bulk of his frame held in her cleavage, keeping him tightly close to her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the hem of the gown, Timmy peeked and observed the city filled with women, all of them around his late mother's age. They were all dressed in similar robes, gowns, and togas, and every one of them engaged in their mundane routine and minding their business. He was quite surprised to see how the women stopped and revered at the sight of their Queen passing them, exclaiming their courteous greetings to her, and the Queen herself returned those courtesies with a smile and a nod. A few Amazons approached her like a good friend and asked her for her review on botanical arrangements, hunting, fishing, and the arts. Each time, Hippolyta gently replied she would review their questions for another time and excused herself to retire for the afternoon. With every step she took, Hippolyta's breasts bounced, rocking the tiny Timmy between them to Morpheus's slumbering bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta reached her castle and ascended her stairs, guarded at the bottom and the top by her finest soldiers. As soon as she strolled inside the entrance, she was greeted by two of her most trusted soldiers and friends: Phillipus, a dark-skinned Amazon and general of the Amazonian army, and Artemis, the fierce red-haired warrior of the Amazons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen,\" the two Amazons bowed to Hippolyta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sisters,\" Hippolyta addressed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything to report to the high council regarding the flying vessel beyond our shores?\" Phillipus inquired, to which the Queen sadly shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nay, Phillipus, the aircraft has been struck down by the protective wards and has been claimed by the sea,\" Hippolyta said regretfully. \"To my knowledge, no one would have survived this horrific accident... no one, save for this...\" Hippolyta reached into her chest, gently pinched the tiny carrier in her cleavage up, and brought a curled fist to her most trusted allies. She uncurled her fingers, and in the center of the palm laid the miniscule figure of Timmy Walker, curled up as he slept some of his physical exhaustion off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen, what is this?\" Artemis asked, clearly surprised by the revelation along with Phillipus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the son of Man's World who only survived because of the protective ward's effect on him,\" Hippolyta explained. \"I do not know exactly what has become of his family who was aboard the craft or how he bypassed the megalodons, but young Timmy Walker here has been shrunken to his current size, washed up on the shores of Themyscira alone, and is in dire need of a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen, Aphrodite's Law clearly states that no man is to set foot on the island, even one so young such as him!\" the ebony Amazon pointed out. \"To allow any man on the island is to defy the will of the gods! He cannot be allowed to longer, you know this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, Phillipus, and your concern is duly noted,\" Hippolyta replied, \"however, there is another part of the law to which you have also forgotten. Should any man wish to remain on this island, they would be bound to serve an Amazon. Though he is quite young, the boy has no one else to turn to, and I have already establish his bond of servitude to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillipus and Artemis looked closer, and they saw the same metal bracelets the Amazons were bound to on his wrists as well. \"The boy is now bound to his servitude to me, which means his life belongs to me as well,\" Hippolyta continued. \"He may be a man, but he is still a child, and it is the Amazon's nature to encourage the growth of children and to protect them out of love, much like how we raised Diana into the finest warrior in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, my Queen...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is enough, Phillipus,\u201d Hippolyta interjected, raising her hand. \u201cI have made my decision. I will be in my chambers to accommodate the boy to my chambers. The trauma he has endured today has drained him of his energy, so I will allow him to rest until the morning when his service to me officially starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motions and the noise were enough to stir Timmy awake in his spot within the giant queen's palm. He rubbed his eyes, heaved a mighty, and sat up in the middle of the warm, leathery platform. He fluttered his eyes open, and was immediately frightened by the sight of two giant fierce-looking women beyond his caretaker's semi-truck-sized fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" Timmy screamed, curling up instinctively. \"Please don't hurt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be at peace, child, they will not harm you,\" Hippolyta gently cooed, daintily rubbing Timmy's shuddering frame with her free fingers. The fearful shaking eventually stopped under the giantess's gentle strokes, and Timmy felt compelled to crawl to the edge of her fingers and get a better look at the women who scared him. \"These are my most loyal soldiers and sisters, Phillipus and Artemis. Do not let the way they look at you frighten you, young Timmy; you will come to see they have a tender heart beneath their fierce demeanor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That remains to be seen,\" Artemis grumbled, giving Timmy a slight glare, which made him hide behind the queen's monolithic fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen, I only hope you know what you are doing with this child,\" Phillipus asked, fearful of the gods' wrath that would be inflicted upon the island, and concerned for the well-being of her Queen and her decision. \"The boy must prove his worth of being under our personal charge. If he cannot prove himself, then by the laws bestowed onto us, we would have to force him off the island by way of the sea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, Phillipus,\" Hippolyta confirmed, stroking Timmy's back gently like a baby bird, \"but you mustn't fear, my love, because we will show him the ways of the Amazon and encourage him to follow on the righteous path, and I will count on you and Artemis to help discipline him should he falter in his tasks.\" Hippolyta brought her forehead against Phillipus's forehead and looked into each other's eyes intimately. \"Please trust me, Phillipus, this is what's best for the child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do trust you, my Queen,\" Phillipus said with a low volume, \"but I pray that the boy does not end up like all the other men who have failed in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we will make it an effort to make sure it never happens. You and Artemis are dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bow, the two giantesses turned and exited the palace, leaving Hippolyta and Timmy alone as they were headed for the Queen's chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lady with the red hair scares me,\" Timmy said meekly, making a Hippolyta chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is natural that she is intimidating. After all, she\u2019s the fiercest warrior among us now,\u201d she said, gently stroking her new charge\u2019s back as she entered the chambers and placed him on the nightstand. \"Now, Timmy, I want you to understand that what you heard between me and Phillipus is the truth. I cannot guarantee all of the tasks will be easy given your youth, stature, and inexperience, but every task is to help the betterment of your maturity. If you want to stay among the Amazons, you must complete these tasks and you will earn your place among the Amazons, even as a persona servant or pet. Do you understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" Timmy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Hippolyta retrieved a birdcage, clean and stainless, and stuffed it with a two sacks of fluff, one resembling a pillow and another resembling a mattress, and a tiny scrap of a weighted cloth. \"Now, my young charge, this is where you will be sleeping from now on. You may rest here and allow your weariness to pass until tonight's feast. I will personally introduce you to the Amazon high council and address your bond to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy groaned, not just tiredly but also worriedly. \"What if they don't like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will have mixed feelings about your arrival, for certain,\" Hippolyta answered, \"but they will come to love you in their own time. I cannot force the Amazons to love my children simply because they are the children of their Queen. It is up to them to decide whether they will accept you as one of our own or not.. and I do hope, dear child, they do not reject you simply for being the son of Man's World.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, my young charge, is a story for a different time.\" Hippolyta opened the cage door, tilted her palm so Timmy would step off into the interior, and reached inside to gently tuck him in for his afternoon slumber. \"Now get some rest, young one. If there is anything you need, I won't be far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Timmy finished with a cute yawn as he allowed the giantess to tuck him into his new bed. It wasn't like his bed back home, but it was certainly more comfortable. Hippolyta closed the door and watched as her new adopted son slept, smiling at how peaceful he looked despite the nightmares he had lived through. She laid down on her bed and looked out the window to the sea, cursing the wards surrounding the offshores of Themiscyra for putting the young child through so much pain. Her eyes fluttered to sleep, allowing Morpheus to take her into the world of dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Timmy and Hippolyta wake up for dinner with the Amazon high council.<br>\r\n2.) Someone sneaks into Hiipolyta's chambers and kidnaps Timmy in his sleep!<br>\r\n3.) The Olympian goddesses appear to test Timmy's size and courage!</span></div></div>",

The queen of the Amazons slowly sat up in her bed, rubbed her eyes, and turned to the owner of the voice which woke her up. It was a familiar dark-skinned woman, her pitch-black hair tied up in little braids, garbed in the finest Amazonian armor ever crafted by the blacksmith, Io.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phillipus,\" Hippolyta acknowledged her lover. \"Forgive me, I must have drifted deep in sleep. What time of the day is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo's sun has fallen to the east, my Queen, and the members of the high council have only barely arrived,\" Phillipus informed the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The high council?\" Hippolyta mumbled. She looked out to the horizon as the last glimmer of sunlight dimmed into darkness, turned her gaze to the birdcage set atop her nightstand, and suddenly remembered her plans for the night. \"Oh yes, of course, it is nearly time for our dinner, I have nearly forgotten. Please inform the high council that I will be with them in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once, my Queen,\" Phillipus said, bowing deeply before turning on her heel and marching out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta turned her attention to the birdcage on the nightstand, peeking at the tiny form of her newly adopted charge sleeping soundly inside. Timmy's sheets rose and dipped underneath the sheets with every little breath. Quietly, Hippolyta opened the cage's door and gently massaged her finger onto Timmy's shrunken form, shaking him awake. \"Timmy? Wake up, child, it is time for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaking managed to wake Timmy up, his mind clouded by the sudden awakening from his sleep. The shrunken eight year-old boy yawned, stretched, and then slumped his was onto the giantess's awaiting palm. Hippolyta lifted him up to his shoulder and tucked him underneath the shoulder strap of her gown, securing the tired tiny boy between the cloth and her skin. She smiled at Timmy's tiny frame, who returned her smile in kindness, shifted her hair to hide his form, and ventured out to another chamber of the palace where she would meet the members of Themyscira's high council. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta eventually arrived at the chamber, a round wooden table set with platters and golden goblets filled with wine, loaded with dishes among dishes of different foods, mostly consisting of meats, breads, fruits, and vegetables. Phillipus and Artemis, being two members of the High Council of Themyscira, were already seated, along with a few others: Nubia, another dark-skinned Amazon with shorter, dark hair, dressed in Amazonian armor; Castalia, a slightly tan and slightly older Amazon who wore a cloak around her head, concealing her hair color; and Areto, yet another dark-skinned Amazon, similar in age and grace as Hippolyta, her dark hair tied in braids, fixed into a bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Queen,\u201d came the collected chorus of Amazons acknowledging the presence of their monarch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sisters,\u201d Hippolyta greeted. \u201cPlease forgive my tardiness, I have retired to my chambers and lost track of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phillipus has already informed us about your retirement, my Queen,\" Areto said. \"The reason why someone as able as you retiring from their own throne is a mystery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, my sisters, allow me to explain in full,\" Hippolyta said as she sat down, helping herself to the dinner on the table. \"Earlier this day, a flying vessel from Man's World was struck by the gods' protective wards and crashed into the waters not more than two miles from our shores. As far as we know, there were no survivors in the wreckage... at least, that is what I had assumed as well until I came across a child who washed up on the shores, alone and orphaned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of the High Council of Themyscira murmured amongst themselves, worriedly while Hippolyta continued. \"The child is a son of Man's World who suffered this great tragedy more than any of you have ever known. He has no family that he knows of beyond our borders, no one to take him in, so I have allowed him to stay with me in exchange that I bound his servitude to me in accordance to Aphrodite's Law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen!\" Areto gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely, you cannot be serious, Hippolyta!\" Nubia argued. \"Men have failed to uphold their bondage with their Amazon mistresses in the past! Even if he is a child, you cannot expect him to serve you hand and foot for the comforts of our home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bite your tongue, Nubia! The Queen and the boy have already established the bond out of their free will!\" Phillipus barked back, standing up from her seat in fury. \"We cannot defy the laws passed down from Aphrodite now! The boy now swears his loyalty to her until he is released from his bondage by death or by the Queen's own volition!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the boy really has sworn his loyalty to the Queen, then he must stay by her side at all times as the law clearly states,\" Castalia pointed out, having wisdom of the law herself. \"And even if he did survive the terrible crash which has claimed the poor souls onboard that vessel to Hades, bless them, the boy must have found a method to bypass the sharks without ending up in their bellies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is the case, then where is this boy you speak of, Hippolyta?\" Areto questioned her Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta sighed as she reached for her shoulder where she deliberately obscured her shrunken charge from sight. She gently pulled him from underneath the straps, out of her silky ebony hair, and held her out for the High Council members to see. They immediately gasped in shock as they gathered around their Queen's outreached hand, questioning the tiny boy's stature while he took cover behind his adopted mother's massive fingers from their sudden movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Timmy Walker, the survivor of the demise that claimed his family and everyone else aboard the flying vessel,\" Hippolyta introduced her charge to the High Council. \"He has been shrunken down by the effects of the magical wards as he and his family flew through the storm. Somehow, he was able to escape this fate and the bellies of our sharks before he ended up on our shores. There was no way I could allow a child to suffer with no family and no one to comfort and care for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta tilted her hand downwards, and Timmy took it as a gesture to walk off the edge of her fingers and onto the table. Hippolyta broke off a small piece of meat big enough to fill her tiny charge's belly with ease and handed it to him. Timmy unquestionably took it from her graciously and sat down on the handle of the spoon placed next to the Queen's dishes, listening in on the conversations between him and his giant caretaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNubia scoffed. \"Look at our Queen. She takes in a shrunken son as her pet and feeds him like one too. I bet she already made him a glorified bed to suit his size in a glorified birdcage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cease this prattle, Nubia, we cannot go back on Aphrodite's Law now,\" Castalia snipped, turning to the boy, \"but I am curious as to how you managed to make it to our shores without being swallowed by the sea and its sharks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Amazons present turned their eyes to Timmy as well, making him shudder and hug his piece of meat against him like a Teddy bear. Hippolyta brought her hand behind him, cushioning his back with her palm's warm flesh, gently caressing his back with her thumb. Timmy looked at the giant queen's face and beheld her maternal gentleness and her reassuring smile. \u201cWell, child? Is there anything you can tell us about how you managed to reach the shores despite the odds being against you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy gulped nervously, shuddering as he recollected the last moments before he went into unconsciousness. \"I was... I was sucked out of the plane's window... and I fell into the sea...\" he recounted meekly, shivering as he remembered the frigid temperature of the sea. \"Then I tried to swim, but the waves brought me underwater. I tried to swim back up, but I kept getting pulled under. I tried, and I tried, and I tried, and then I became so tired, and I got sleepy... and then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy then remembered the last significant detail of what happened as he went into unconsciousness. \"I saw this lady in the water. I didn't see her face, but she was swimming towards me. Then I heard this woman tell me that it wasn't my time yet,\" he said, the Amazons above turning to each other with a collected range of mixed emotions, from shock and awe, to disbelief and worry. \"Then I fell asleep and when I woke up, I was on the beach.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"It cannot be...\" Areto gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is,\" Castalia answered. \"This child was delivered to us by the hand of Thetis, the daughter of Poseidon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this cannot be!\" Nubia grumbled, shooting to her feet. \"The boy is a son of Man's World, and not our daughter! In the past, Thetis has delivered daughters who have fallen in the sea to us, and only when she senses that the child is special! The boy is a son of Man's World, not our daughter! He cannot be one of us! He does not belong here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is enough, Nubia!\" Hippolyta barked, slamming her hand on the table, silencing the Amazons. \"Thetis would not have delivered my charge to these shores if she did not sense something special about him! To deny her will means to go against our nature as protectors and nurturers of our children, and I will never go against our nature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

When she looked, she saw little Timmy ducked away from her silverware, cowering frightfully. The Queen of the Amazons pieced together the reason for Timmy's sudden fear of her, and she sighed stressfully at it. Apparently, when she slammed her hand on her silverware outraged by Nubia's defiance, the hand slammed on the spoon Timmy was on but he managed to jump away before either her gigantic hand crushed him or he was launched by the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pitied look, Hippolyta quietly begged the scared shrunken boy to her hand, and Timmy reluctantly obeyed her. Guided by her other hand, Hippolyta gently scooped Timmy into her hands and gently shushed him while she ran her finger down his back to comfort the sobbing boy. \"Shh, Timmy, don't be afraid. I am sorry I almost hurt you, Timmy. I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta cradled her charge to her breast and allowed Timmy to release his fear through his sobbing. She turned to her fellow members of the Amazon high council with a disappointed glance and sighed. \"It seems I've made a mistake introducing my charge to the council. I had high hopes that adopting the son of Man's World as my charge would ease your fear of men, but it seems your fear and resentment has clouded your judgment towards their young sons, even ones who has suffered so much like my charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta gently secured Timmy onto her shoulder, underneath the straps of her fuchsia toga. The tiny boy quickly held onto her neck for security and comfort while the Queen hid his form with her hair and stood up from her seat. \"Until you have shed your resentment towards Man's World and their sons, I will be taking my meal in my chambers. Only when you have deemed yourself worthy of my forgiveness will I return to this table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta took her plate and her adopted son, and moved to her chambers. While on the way, she heard a tiny youthful sob within the entanglement of her raven black hair. She gently moved them away and saw Timmy sniffling against her neck, feeling his tears soak only a tiny fraction of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong, young Timmy?\" Hippolyta inquired, a pitied frown drooping on her beautiful visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" the tiny boy said, wiping his nose. \"I'm sorry I ruined your dinner, your majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Timmy, don't carry the blame of this incident on your shoulders,\" Hippoltya said, gently reaching her shoulder to comfort her shrunken charge perched on it. \"If anything, I am to blame for this. I should have known that the members of the council was not ready for you, yet you brought your fears to light before and I have not taken them seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Timmy asked, sobbing. \"Why don't you and those ladies want me here? Did I do something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Timmy you did nothing wrong,\" Hippolyta hastily answered. \"The Amazons has trust issues concerning men in the outside world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta came to a large vase in the hallway, decorated with images of people that were only in the vases of ancient Greek legends today. \"Timmy, you may be young, but I believe you deserve the answers you seek,\" the giant queen said, running her hand along the etchings on the vase. \"In an ancient past, many thousands of years ago, the Amazons were born from the soils of the Earth with the souls of ancient women slain by the men. I was the first Amazon born, and I have led my fellow sisters to build the city of Themyscira in Anatolia where the gods blessed us with many wondrous gifts, and we became warriors of peace for a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But one day, the vengeful God of War, Ares, sought to destroy us by sending the demi-god Heracles to our home,\" Hippolyta continued, her tone, Timmy noticed, dropping darkly. \"Attempts for peaceful negotiations failed when Heracles and his men attacked us, captured us, and caged us like animals. He and his men took advantage of me, of my sisters, in a bad way. We fought back, and as penance, the gods sent us to this island to guard an unspeakable evil which rests beneath our feet. We built a home here and renamed it Themyscira after our fallen city, and we have lived peacefully away from the World of Men for thousands of years since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that happened to you, your majesty,\" Timmy said, leaning against the Queen's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your sympathy, child, but such feelings were not common back then,\" Hippolyta said. \"Even now, my sisters cannot forget the scars Heracles and his men inflicted on us. Over time, such distrust has trickled down to sons your age. We Amazons have taught the ways of peace and love to our children, and to see them go back on their teachings on the children of men is hypocrisy. I cannot stand for anyone who would want to drive away the children of men for what their fathers and their forefathers did to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I never did anything to them,\" Timmy spoke up. \"It's just not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is why I cannot bear to let anyone, even my own sisters, berate the sons of Man's World,\" Hippolyta affirmed. \"To speak out against my decision to take you in under your servitude to me is a forgivable sin, but to judge someone's worth for being born a boy is another story entirely. I had hoped by helping raise Diana, she would be more lenient towards children as a whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Diana?\" Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is my daughter, born from the clay of this island and gifted at birth with the gods' strengths,\" Hippolyta answered, a proud, motherly smile suddenly creeping on her face. \"She went out to Men's World to return a man who landed on this island years ago. She's become a champion of justice and peace and known throughout the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I know who that is, your majesty,\" Timmy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do,\" the proud giantess said, casting a sideways smile to her son. \"You and the whole world knows her as Wonder Woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Timmy gasped, and all sadness he felt before was replaced with gladness. \"Really!? You're Wonder Woman's mommy!?\" he practically screeched, much to the amusement of the queen. \"I didn't know you're her mommy! Wait a minute, if you're like my mommy now, does that mean that Diana's my big sister!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a matter of speaking, yes,\" the Queen of the Amazons softly answered, stifling a chuckle at Timmy's excited reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! I have a big sister who's a superhero, and a mommy who's that superhero's mommy!\" Timmy screamed from the top of his lungs, all sense of grammar lost in the excitement. He nearly lost his balance when he threw his hands up excitingly, but Hippolyta quickly caught him before he fell of her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down, Timmy. I don't want you to hurt yourself,\" Hippolyta advised, no longer holding in her amused chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy quickly readjusted his security on the queen's shoulder and calmed down with a sigh. \"You're majesty, will you ever introduce me to Wonder Woman? I always dreamed of meeting a superhero, but I never thought you'd be Wonder Woman's mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, child, but Diana always returns when she is needed or when she feels the need to return home,\" Hippolyta answered. \"I imagine my adoption of you will come to her as a shock, but Diana is a gentle soul. She has a tender heart and always inspires the good in children your age. She will come to adore you as her little brother, I am sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy immediately clutched the side of Hippolyta's face, hugging her cheek in a grateful, lovingly embrace, much to her surprise. \"Thank you, your majesty. I was sad when I lost my mommy, and I was scared when I was shrunken down, but at least you were kind to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta smiled. She pulled Timmy from his secure perch on her shoulder, held him in her open palm, and brought him up to her pursed lips where she planted a motherly kiss on his body, the same kiss she used with Diana when she was younger. \"You are very welcome, Timmy. And if it pleases you, young one, you may call me 'mother' or anything similar. You are my charge, after all, and I want to love you as a mother would love her son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy smiled, sitting innocently in the palm of the royal giantess's palm. \"Okay, mama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta secured Timmy onto her shoulder and returned to her chambers. She felt a familiar sense of warmth inside her heart, like she was watching Diana when she was just a spirited child. Timmy had his family and his size taken from him while he was still young and innocent, but Hippolyta was willing to guide the child along his journey into a brave young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe promised she wouldn't replace Timmy's real mother, but she'd pick up where she left off, and that was her goal for the years to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Hippolyta and Timmy retire in her chambers for the evening; the next morning, Timmy begins his servitude.<br>\r\n2.) Hippolyta and Timmy retire in her chambers for the evening; she tells Timmy of the gods who watch over the island.<br>\r\n3.) Hippolyta and Timmy retire in her chambers for the evening; a shadowy figure watches and waits for them to fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On Themyscira, legions of Amazon soldiers would be sent to patrol the shores for any intruder or potential threat that dared invade their paradise. This particular legion, led by the Amazon's general, Phillipus, and their strongest warrior, Artemis of Bana-Mighdall, was ordered by Queen Hippolyta herself to patrol the shores in lieu of a recent event happening just a mile away from their shores within the mystic barriers. Their main priority was to search the perimeter of the island for any survivors who could possibly have bypassed the guarding megalodons and made it to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs per Aphrodite's Law, men were not allowed to set foot on the village, and this extended to male children as well, except for certain men who were permitted to enter the island by the Queen herself. Nonetheless, since Aphrodite's Law also governs the Amazons' lives through love, then they must accommodate them in their own fashion. The men would be taken to recover in the dungeons, while the women would recover in an Amazon's home. This was how it was on Paradise Island, and it was the soldiers' job to enforce this law unless the Queen has granted an exception under certain conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Timmy had wept, he picked up the hearing of someone striding the sands, accompanied by the slight tremors with each stride. Timmy broke away from his mourning and turned to the direction of the sound. The people were a group of armored giant women, all of them dressed in leather breastplates and metal bracelets on their wrists reaching just below her forearms. Around their waists, they all wore a belt with a scabbard sheathed with a sword, holding up a short beige skirt, and knee-high leather gladiator sandals worn on their feet. They were also armed, holding a large spear in one hand, a shield in the other, and a vigilant look on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy almost whimpered as the lead soldier, a giant black woman, marched towards his location. Her sandaled foot raised in the air to take another step, completely unaware that the tiny little boy was underneath its leather sole. The boy whimpered, curled up into a tight little ball, and cried right as the dark-skinned giantess planted her foot on top of its spot. Timmy tensed up, like he was expecting that moment when he would be squashed under the giant's foot like a little bug, but opened his eyes to face a set of five giant chocolate-colored toes inches away from his face. His eyes turned upwards towards the colossal figure of the woman who nearly squished him, looking and pointing out at the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, as the Queen said it would be,\" the ebony giantess leading the giant troop of female soldiers said, literally and figuratively pointing at the black smoke in the distant horizon. \"The aircraft has crashed a mile away from the shores, meaning there is a chance that a survivor may have swam to these shores along this side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a waste of our time,\u201d addressed the redheaded giantess, Artemis of the Bana-Mighdall. \u201cI have seen footages of airplanes in different parts of Man's World crashing before, and no one survives a crash like this. Even if someone did, there is no way they would make it to these shores without invoking the megalodon's hungry wrath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leading armored black woman and turned to the impatient Amazon. \u201cBe still your tongue and your impatience, Artemis,\u201d General Phillipus ordered firmly. \u201cOur orders are to bring in any survivor who has made it to these shores. Remember, there are men in this world who have survived greater disasters, including those who have crashed into our waters in similar crafts. Who is to say that anyone could have survived that disaster and has gone unnoticed by our megalodons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis scoffed. \"If it is so, then why do we not see any bodies in the water, or tracks leading from the waters and onto the shores?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no clear explanation for that yet, Artemis,\" Phillipus affirmed, turning towards her sister-in-arms. Unbeknownst to her, however, the simple act of shuffling her feet to face the redheaded warrior nearly caused her to step on Timmy at her feet down below. \"However, our bickering is only ensuring a step away from discovering any survivors, which goes against the Queen's orders. So unless you have anything else to add, I suggest we continue along the shoreline and search the areas between here and the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the legion of armored giantesses argued amongst themselves, Timmy watched and listened to it all down at their toes. He didn\u2019t understand what the giantesses would do to him if they ever found him, but it frightened him as much as the Brobdingnagian size difference between them did. His close call with the black giantess's foot nearly ground him into a little bloody smear in the sand. If that was only because they weren't aware of his presence at their feet, then he dreaded to think of what would happen to him if they were aware. They could easily stamp on him, press him underneath their rear ends, or even swallow him whole! Timmy shuddered at the thought, but he shook it away and quickly thought of what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Timmy runs and hides from the giant Amazon soldiers in fear for their potentially harmful treatment.<br>\r\n2.) Timmy screams, jumps, and waves at the giantesses to grab their attention. Maybe they could help him!<br>\r\n3.) Timmy grabs one of the giantess's sandals by the straps and hitches a dangerous ride at their feet.<br>\r\n4.) Before Timmy could do anything, one of the Amazons spots him at their feet.<br>\r\n5.) Before Timmy could do anything, the Amazons march away, leaving Timmy alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Timmy was unsure of himself about this decision, but he figured that this was the only way he could get to the queen of Themyscira. Without them spotting, the tiny boy made his way to the nearest pair of feet with leather sandals firmly strapped to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fierce redhead Amazon, Artemis was the closest one that Timmy could get to. At the moment, she was too busy bickering with the ebony giantess, Phillipus to even notice that a tiny son of Man's World was scuttling towards her heels. Timmy managed to reach the left foot of one of Themyscira's most formidable warriors without them noticing. Her sole emanated a certain scent of sweat mixed with something more pleasurable, the smell of a tropical fruit salad mixed with coconut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She must take special care of her feet while in the shower,</i> Timmy figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squadron! Move out!\" Phillipus barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy's timing couldn't have been more impeccable, because the moment the black giantess ordered the troops to move out, the tiny boy managed to get a tight hold of Artemis's sandal straps at the side of her smaller toes. He barely made the time when Artemis\u2019s left foot rose up and fell in a march. Each rise and fall was as scary as the last. It was like holding on the side of a roller coaster in motion. Timmy screamed each time he rose and fell, with his hands on the straps being the only harness restraint on this crazy ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis's footfalls boomed in the sand, spraying him with arising dust. After one certain turn to the right, Artemis unknowingly flung the one-inch boy with her foot. The fling loosened Timmy's grip on the sandal straps, so when the boy tried to reclaim his hold, his grip loosened further. While he did, Artemis's foot sunk into a small hill of sand, submerging the boy as quickly as he emerged with the rising foot. Except this time, he didn't stay harnessed against the strap, he was sliding with the sand into the sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy screamed as he slid down that leathery slope for only a second until he was wedged underneath the giantess's sole, pinned underneath the warm flesh in between two giant feminine toes. With it, Timmy was held tight between two of Artemis\u2019s goes and forcibly, unknowingly, and unwillingly carried along for the rough ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of fruit and coconut was stronger here. The power of Artemis\u2019s toes clenched the boy between the big toe and the index toe. Timmy screamed as he was subjected to an intensely scary front row seat to the rise and fall of Artemis\u2019s foot without anything else to safely strap himself in. The toes loosened slightly with every rise and then they clenched tightly with every fall. The impact knocked Timmy around a little, enough to disorient him and give him a dizzying headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Timmy wasn\u2019t the only one who felt he was knocking around with each footfall. Not long after her debate with Phillipus, Artemis was only several steps into the March when she felt something irritating her left foot. With each step, she felt something in between two of her clenching toes and opted to do something about it. She decided to wriggle her toes, manipulate her digits to push away the tiny obstruction between her foot and her sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her, she made a one-inch young boy suffer through it all. The tiny eight year old screamed as suddenly, midway throughout the walk from hell, the giantess wriggled her toes on top of him. The two toes that trapped him smothered Timmy\u2019s tiny body underneath the powerful digits. The five titanic toes squished him against the sandal\u2019s flat. With each little wriggle, Timmy ended up getting squishing him further and further down and deeper underneath the soft and scented sole. Out of desperation, the crying tiny boy beat against the skin of the foot and bit right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis suddenly grunted at the sharp pain underneath her foot. Perhaps she accidentally picked up a biting ant in her sandal? She wriggled the ball of her foot and pressed it harder against the obstruction in her sandal. It was really wriggling underneath her foot. It felt rather nice, if Artemis was being honest with herself, but it was getting in the way of her march. She stopped her march to loosen up her foot from her sandal and tapped the toe section to force the little bug out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending her discomfort, Philippus halted her company and turned to the high-ranking red-haired Amazon foolishly staying behind just to adjust her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere had better be a reason for you to be falling out of rank, Artemis,\u201d the general addressed her, to which Artemis replied...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.)  \u201cThere is something in my shoe. I need to check it out.\u201d (Artemis lifts her shoe and dumps the \"bug\" into her hand, revealing to be the tiny and traumatized Timmy.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) \u201cThere is something in my shoe. But it\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m sure.\u201d (Artemis doesn't check her shoe and she marches with her squadron, not realizing that Timmy is forced to endure a long march.)</span></div></div>",

I need to check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fierce and suspicious Artemis lifted her foot up and held it sideways. By squeezing the leather sandal, Artemis was able to create an opening between the flat and the underside of her foot so the little bug that bit her would roll out and into her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy, on the other hand, recently experienced neck-breaking vertigo when Artemis tapped her toe section, trying to force him out from under her foot. Thanks to the soft yet firm hold of Artemis\u2019s foot skin, the tiny eight year-old was kept from being thrown out into the sand and possibly stomped on by the giantess. In the midst of being battered, bruised, and disoriented by the ignorant giantess\u2019s feet, Timmy felt the urge to puke from the intense dizziness. Even that didn\u2019t stop him from feeling everything rise up and turn on its side. All of a sudden, the squeezing pressure between her foot and the sandal suddenly gaped open as Timmy felt himself sliding backwards then rolling from underneath the ball, the overbearing toes, and then into the soft, calloused hand of the giantess who unknowingly tormented him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy coughed and sputtered as the palm he crouched on was lifted to the level of the stern green eyes of the fierce Amazonian warrior. As soon as the tiny boy looked into those giant, seemingly hostile eyes, the boy screamed and curled in a fetal position, turning away from Artemis\u2019s gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d Timmy cried as the other gigantic Amazonian soldiers marched up to him and Artemis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArtemis, what is that in your hand?\u201d Philippus demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently, I found one of the survivors of the fallen flying vessel, but he is nothing more now than a bug that found its way into my shoe,\u201d Artemis answered, holding the scared one-inch boy out to Philippus and the other Amazons to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is an unusual development,\u201d the blonde Amazon, Persephone said. \u201cAll children shouldn\u2019t be so small, they\u2019d have to fit inside an Amazon\u2019s shoe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he truly is the son of Man\u2019s World, then we must report him to the queen at once,\u201d Philippus reminded her troops about the mission. She then extended her palm to the red-haired Amazon. \u201cArtemis, please give him to me so we can ensure him safe escort. Being trapped under your foot seems to have scared him to death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis didn\u2019t hesitate to answer. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d she said, dumping the suddenly surprised boy into Philippus\u2019s awaiting hand, \u201cbut only because I don\u2019t want him biting any part of my body again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy tumbled around the darker giantess\u2019s palm, barely having any time to get up as she gently curled her fingers and trapped him in her fist. \u201cForgive me, child, but the queen has ordered us to take you to her personally,\u201d Philippus said, reaching for a small drawstring sack on her belt, \u201cand this is the only way for me to safely escort you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippus moves the boy between her fingers, pinched his shirt between three of her fingers and her thumb, and dangled him over the opening of the sack. Timmy screamed and wriggled in the grip as the giant chocolate digits held him over the yawning abyss of the sack\u2019s opening; he was terrified of the dark. The screams got louder as Philippus powered him down into the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOOOO!!! Please don\u2019t put in there! I\u2019ll be good, I promise, just don\u2019t put me in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Philippus didn\u2019t listen. She gently inserted the tiny screaming boy into the sack, and by loosening her fingers, she felt the boy fall to the bottom. She then drew the drawstring close and tight, leaving the opening slightly ajar to let in air for her bite-sized prisoner. With a simple command, Philippus and her troops marched for the queen\u2019s palace in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the sack on Philippus\u2019s thigh, Timmy was once again subjected to motions of a giantess\u2019s march. It wasn\u2019t as bad as getting trapped underneath Artemis\u2019s scented feet in her sandal, but he was still getting motion sickness from this experience. What\u2019s worse is that now that he was discovered, he\u2019d be taken to the queen. She would probably keep him for a slave or a toy for torment! She\u2019d lock him in a cage somewhere dark and damp with very little light to reach him. At the very least, she\u2019d send him back to Man\u2019s World with nothing and no one to look after him. Whatever the queen decided, it would change his very life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Timmy stays in the sack and is brought before Queen Hippolyta. She will decide Timmy's destiny.<br>\r\n2.) Timmy is afraid of what will happen, so he rips a hole in the sack and escapes.</span></div></div>",

The opening of the drawstring sack was too high and too steep to reach, and the movements of his gigantic captor was making staying in one place difficult. Even if he did attempt an escape, Timmy would most likely be spotted by the giant Amazons and quickly be recaptured. As best as he could, he curled up in the bottom of the savor and felt the motions of Philippus\u2019s thigh rock him gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at last, after his giant captor finally stopped did Timmy feel a primal fear lodge in his throat. The small legion of giantesses finally made it into the palace. Timmy could only curl up and listen as the dark-skinned addressed the high royalty outside the sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy queen, we have found and brought the son of Man\u2019s World to you, as you ordered,\u201d Philippus reported to Queen Hippolyta, ruler of the Amazons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have brought me news of your capture, general, yet I do not see him with you,\u201d Queen Hippolyta observed. \u201cTell me, where have you taken the son of Man\u2019s World when I have specifically ordered you to bring him to me directly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Queen, there has been an... unexpected development.\u201d Timmy flinched as daylight broke into the bag the same instance the drawstring was loosened. He barely had time to adjust to the brightness, but from the light, a giant ebony hand with five imposing fingers curled up around him, enveloping him all around in soft flesh. Then he felt the hand lift him out of the confines of the sack, turn him over onto her palm, and felt the fingers loosen and spread out, revealing him to the outside world... to the regal, brunette giantess staring down at him from the throne with a bewildered look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is indeed unexpected,\u201d Hippolyta concurred. \u201cI would never expect a child from Man\u2019s World to be small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was like this when we found him, highness,\u201d Philippus reported. \u201cHe was like this battered and terrified after he endured much torment when he slipped inside of Artemis\u2019s shoe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippus turned her gaze to Artemis, who stood at attention and bowed her head. \u201cI beg your forgiveness, your highness. I nearly mistook him for a bug under my foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no need to apologize for what you have done, Artemis. I, too, would not have known this child from a bug if it had slipped into my shoe,\u201d Hippolyta said as she descended from her throne, turning to the tiny eight year-old shuddering in the palm of her general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now for the matter at hand, so to speak,\u201d Hippolyta addressed, approaching the fearful boy. You are a lost child, are you not? You are lost and terrified because the cruel hand of fate has shrunken you, hasn\u2019t it? There is no reason for you to fear because I promise no harm may come to youwhile under my charge. Do you understand, child?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy nodded, whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now then, can you please tell me your name?\u201d Hippolyta asked as though she was addressing her daughter when she was the boy\u2019s age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Timmy, your majesty. T-Timmy Walker,\u201d the bite-sized boy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Timmy Walker. I am Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons and ruler of Themyscira,\u201d the queen introduced herself. Hippolyta held her hand out, and Philippus gently ramped her hand to nudge Timmy to walk onto the awaiting palm. \u201cCan you tell me where you are from and how you came to be this way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled and stifled the urge to cry. \u201cI-I\u2019m from Florida, your majesty. I-I was flying with my family over the ocean to Italy when... when... when a scary storm hit the plane! I don\u2019t know what happened, but I shrunk to this size and I was sucked out of the plane! I fell into the water and I tried to swim but I was so tired, I couldn\u2019t swim anymore! Then I woke up on the beach all alone and... and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy couldn\u2019t hold back the urge to cry as he buried his face in his hands. \u201cThey\u2019re gone! They\u2019re gone and I can never see them again! I\u2019ll never see my big brothers again! I\u2019ll never see my daddy again! I\u2019ll never see my mommy again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Timmy wept in the queen\u2019s hand, keeling over letting tears flow from his eyes, Hippolyta couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for the poor boy. With her other hand, she gently stroked Timmy\u2019s back like a lost bird trapped in the rain and in need of shelter. \u201cI am sorry, little one. This is a fate you did not deserve to suffer from. I can never imagine the pain of your loss and the terror of being so small compared to the rest of the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled and choked. \u201cI miss them so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sure you do, child. I am so sorry...\" Hippolyta gently stroked Timmy's back, comforting him while his tears flowed like the waterfalls at the edge of the island. She cast her pitied gaze to her guards, Philippus seemingly impassive, but Artemis eyeing the boy sternly, but softer. \"This is a hard decision for myself, for us all. For as long as we lived, we have taken in daughters from Man's World who have survived Poseidon's waters and cared for them, but not sons. Because of our laws, we have never allowed man to set foot on our island, but they have been passive to their young when their needs were greater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is your decision, my Queen?\" Artemis questioned. \"Are you willing to take in a child in greater need, or are you willing to abide by our rules and send him back to Man's World?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not by himself,\" Philippus countered. \"The boy is an orphan, and he needs a mother more than anything else. One of us should take him in and bound him to us by Aphrodite's Law so he may stay among us as one of our own and not fear incurring the wrath of the gods. If not, then one of us should have the arduous task of taking him back to Man's World as his sole guardian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta slumped forward in deep contemplation. She held the boy in cupped hands, and he could see his tiny face etched in teary sadness. It broke her heart to see a child so broken by the death of his family, shrunken by the force of the gods' barrier around the island, and crushed under the feet of her guards. Young Timmy Walker needed someone to take him in, to love him and raise him, and Hippolyta knew who would do the job right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have made my decision...\u201d she addressed everyone in the room. \u201cFrom this day forth, young Timmy Walker of Florida...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) \"...shall be allowed to stay on the shores of Themyscira under my own guardianship and protection.\" (Hippolyta takes in Timmy.)<br>\r\n2.) \"...shall be allowed to stay on the shores of Themyscira under the guardianship and protection from one of our own.\" (Hippolyta tasks one of the other Amaozns to take him in.)<br>\r\n3.) \"...cannot remain on the shores of Themyscira, which is why I will volunteer my daughter to return with him to Man's World as his guardian.\" (Hippolyta tasks Wonder Woman to return with Timmy to Man's World as his adoptive mother.)<br>\r\n4.) \"...cannot remain on the shores of Themyscira, which is why I will volunteer myself to return with him to Man's World as his guardian.\" (Hippolyta returns with Timmy to Man's World as his adoptive mother.)<br>\r\n5.) \"...cannot remain on the shores of Themyscira, which is why I will volunteer one of the other Amazons to return with him to Man's World as his guardian.\" (Hippolyta tasks one of the other Amazons with Timmy to Man's World as his adoptive mother.)</span></div></div>",

They, and the tiny boy in her palm turned to her with collected shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut your highness, you cannot possibly mean this!\u201d Philippus immediately protested. \u201cThis is a direct violation of Aphrodite\u2019s Law! If you allow the son of man to walk on the same ground as the Amazons, then you will bring the wrath of the gods down upon us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but any man who sets foot on this island is to be confined and imprisoned immediately under the watchful eye of the Amazons,\u201d Hippolyta explained, holding out Timmy sitting in her cupped palms. \"Besides, the child is young and small, hardly posing any threat to anyone. With no one else to watch over him, we Amazons must perform our duties to nurture and encourage the growth of our children, even if they are a man or an Amazon. Therefore, I appoint myself to the protection and welfare for this child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut your majesty...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is enough, Philippus,\u201d Hippolyta interjected, raising her hand. \u201cI have made my decision. I will be in my chambers to accommodate and this child personally teach him the ways of our people. You have served me well in bringing the boy here to me, though under abnormal circumstances. You may return to your duties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, your majesty,\u201d Philippus said, bowing her head. She and her fellow Amazonian soldiers marched out of the throne room, Artemis being the last one to stay behind and give Timmy a sideways glare. Timmy retreated behind the queen\u2019s monolithic fingers, but he was immediately comforted by another set of giant fingers resting on top of his back. With it, Artemis turned and marched out of the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe woman with the red hair is scary,\u201d Timmy said meekly, making a Hippolyta chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is natural that she is intimidating. After all, she\u2019s the fiercest warrior among us now,\u201d she said, gently stroking her new charge\u2019s back as she walked back to her chambers. \u201cNow, Timmy, I want you to understand that as long as you are here, you are to become my personal servant and pet bound to me by law. I cannot guarantee that the tasks before you will be easy, but you must prove you are worthy of being under my charge to my sisters. Otherwise, by law, you will be forced off the island by way of the sea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very thought of drifting back in that dangerous, turbulent sea made Timmy\u2019s blood freeze. \u201cNo! I\u2019ll be good, your majesty! I\u2019ll do my best to do whatever you want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good,\u201d Hippolyta acknowledged as she entered her chambers and settled onto her bed, holding Timmy flat on her palm. \"Now hold out your fists to me.\" Timmy held out his fists, just as the queen ordered him to. \"Turn them over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy overturned his arms, showing the underside of his fists. Hippolyta gently laid her gigantic hand over Timmy's arms, and suddenly, her bracelet glowed as a little drop of light trickled onto his wrists. The light wrapped around the wrists and faded, giving Timmy a pair of metal bracelets just like the giantess said. \"Now you are bound to me, young Timmy Walker. As long as you are bound to me, no harm may come of you, nor shall any Amazon attempt to break it. When you are in distress, these bracelets will glow, indicating you are in trouble. In exchange, you will need to do as you are told, but the tasks I will assign you will accommodate your youth and size. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, your majesty,\" Timmy stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" Hippolyta nodded. \"Now, I fear this is sudden for you, but I propose we begin your basic training now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen of the Amazons then guided the boy to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.)...the floor. Hippolyta wants Timmy to massage her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.)...the nightstand with the bowl of fruit. Hippolyta wants Timmy to feed her the fruit from the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.)... her back.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNow then, Timmy, for your first task,\u201d she said, guiding the little boy in her hands to the floor, \u201cI want you to massage my feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta lowered the boy with cupped hands to the floor, tilting them to prompt Timmy to hop off and stand before the foot of the queen. To Timmy, the queen\u2019s imposing size made her look like a goddess, like the one he\u2019s seen statues of on the way. Like them, she stood tall like a monolith, dressed in a long, fuchsia-colored toga. Slipping from that elegant toga was a pair of giant, beautifully-maintained feet clad in leather sandals. She gently lowered them before her new young charge, but to Timmy, he could feel the tremor as she daintily slapped them on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy felt a certain overwhelming fear as he was presented his first task of massaging the queen\u2019s feet. The toes alone were just as big as him, almost a little bigger, but they were still threatening. He couldn\u2019t erase the traumatic moment when he was kicked around and crushed under Artemis\u2019s feet from his mind. Just being next to a giant foot gave him certain pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand your reluctance to carry out the task, little one,\u201d Hippolyta said, \u201cbut please know you will be seeing this a lot during your stay here at Themyscira. This is part of your training as my personal servant, so you must learn to face your fears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut... but I\u2019m scared of going inside your sandal,\u201d Timmy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere. Allow me to make it easier for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta lifted one leg up, unstrapped her sandal, and set it back down to the floor bare. She then proceeded to the same thing with the other foot. With both feet bare and touching the cool textile floor, Hippolyta lifted both feet up by the heel, scrunching her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere. This should make things easier to perform your tasks,\u201d the Queen of the Amazons said, setting her feet fully flat to the floor, \u201cbut remember this, little one: someday, you will have to unstrap my sandals yourself, but it will only happen if you are willing to continue your training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll try my hardest, your majesty,\u201d Timmy answered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I expect from you, my young charge,\u201d acknowledged Hippolyta, \u201cand speaking of expectations, I am still waiting for that massage I ordered a little while ago.\u201d Hippolyta slid her feet forwards towards Timmy, her toes slightly wriggling with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Timmy bent down and started to rub his hands on Hippolyta\u2019s giant toes, starting with the big toe. The giantess\u2019s digits wriggled at the ticklish sensation, making the tiny boy recoil a bit. Nevertheless, he had a moral obligation to fulfill his first duty and he had to do it. Bending gown into a squat, Timmy pressed his hands into the skin of the toe and gently squeezed into the soft, smooth flesh. He worked his squeezing grip around the smooth skin of the foot like he was kneading dough for bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, for this particular knead, Timmy wasn\u2019t making bread, though Hippolyta\u2019s feet smelled similar to bread. Gently, he maneuvered his massage around the perimeter of the big toe, not missing a single inch of skin to thoroughly massage it before he moved it lower to the underside of the giantess\u2019s digit. Sensing this, Hippolyta lifted up her toes, which allowed Timmy to easily reach the underside of her foot. The skin was softer and malleable than the rest of the foot. Timmy figured that this was where he was given a chance to show his skill as someone who watched his father give his mother a foot massage after a stressful day of work. He pressed his hands hard into the supple skin and squeezed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Hippolyta three her head back and sighed in blissful content. She didn\u2019t want to admit it, but despite the boy\u2019s tiny size and young age, his massages felt like Elysium. While the sensations tickled a little, she could feel her muscles in her feet relax around the areas she didn\u2019t realize where slightly stiff until Timmy worked his way around them. In her mind, she made the right choice in taking in the tiny boy as her own personal servant, technically confined to her by law, and encouraging him to fulfill his duties to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hippolyta enjoyed the feeling of her tiny charge work his way in between her toes, then eventually moving on to rubbing slow circles on the ball of her foot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) ...Hippolyta asks about Timmy's life prior to the plane crash.<br>\r\n2.) ...Hippolyta asks about Timmy's experience under Artemis's foot.<br>\r\n3.) ...Phillipus walks through the door.</span></div></div>",

She already loved this kid and his innocence. \u201cI can only imagine! The feet of my best warrior is more frightening than the warrior herself!\u201d she chuckled, suddenly finding herself clearing her throat and regaining her composure. \u201cIn all seriousness, child, I can\u2019t imagine how terrible it must have been when you were trapped in her shoe. Since you have faced your fear of being trampled underneath our giant feet, perhaps you can share what it was like being trapped under Artemis \u2018s feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny bite-sized boy swallowed a lump, nervous from even thinking about that traumatic experience. Eventually, he found his voice and the words that came out. \u201cIt was tight... and it hurt very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it was tight and painful. Please, do go on,\u201d Hippolyta insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe giant lady\u2019s foot squashed me against her sandal,\u201d Timmy continued. \u201cI couldn\u2019t move, I couldn\u2019t even breathe, and it felt like I was riding a really scary and really bumpy ride at the fair. I got dizzy and I felt like I was gonna throw up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, child, I\u2019m deeply sorry for your suffering,\u201d Hippolyta gave her sincerest condolence. \u201cNo child should have to suffer like this, especially on my own island. You are indeed brave if you went through such a horrible experience and live to tell the tale of your own plight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy looked away, downcast. \u201cI know...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no reason to fret over this now,\u201d the giant queen assured the tiny boy at her feet. \u201cYou are in safe, capable hands now. I won\u2019t let anyone willingly take advantage of your size so long as I watch over you the same way I watched over my daughter, Diana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-Thank you, your majesty,\u201d Timmy said, getting back to rubbing the ball of Hippolyta\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am curious, though, seeing as how you don\u2019t appear to be physically hurt,\u201d Hippolyta astutely observed from her throne, \u201cyou were suffering under the feet of Artemis, and I know for a fact that Artemis has the most powerful footsteps in Themyscira, yet when I look at you, I see no bruises nor bleeding. This must be because the magic that shrunk you down must have granted you with great physical endurance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I suppose,\" Timmy said, \"but it still hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot deny that. Tell me, what was Artemis\u2019s feet like to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy\u2019s face suddenly went beet red and turned his head away from embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Timmy, you can tell me anything that\u2019s on your mind,\u201d his giantess guardian said. \u201cI won\u2019t be offended if you tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inch-high boy felt like he could sweat bullets from his forehead. As embarrassing as it was to think about it, his mom always told him to be honest with his feelings, no matter how much he didn\u2019t want to say it. \u201cWell... when I was stuck in the scary lady\u2019s shoe, I didn't feel like I was squished like a bug. Her feet were so... soft...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was it that you said?\u201d Hippolyta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said it was... soft... like a pillow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike a pillow, you say?\" The Queen of the Amazons sported a playful grin as she bent forwards and supported her chin on the back of her hands, listening intently. \"I see, so despite Artemis having powerful footsteps and kicks, she keeps her feet soft. Please, tell me more about her feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy's face flushed with a red beet hue, practically steaming from the embarrassment. \"Well... they were soft... and they smelled like... like fruit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy\u2019s face went so red, he was practically steaming. \u201cThey were soft and... and they smelled like... fruit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta raised an eyebrow. \u201cFruit, you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes. Fruit and... and coconut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\" the giant queen mused, turning her eyes to the side, noting the tiny boy\u2019s astute sense of smell and the type of lotion Artemis rubbed on her feet. With a sly smile, she brought her foot closer to Timmy, who backed away as she gently revealed her immaculate toes to his face. \"Then tell me, Timmy, what does my feet smell like to you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy stopped for a moment, wondering if this was really happening, but didn't question the matter of his newfound loyalty to his giant adoptive mother. He gripped the toes and inhaled the sweet scent emanating from the giant foot flesh, smothered with a certain lotion that almost smelled like the flavor of yogurt his mom bought from the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt smells like... vanilla.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see...\u201d Hippolyta felt her tiny adopted son reach her heel, reaching every nook and cranny her foot had to offer. \u201cI believe you\u2019ve rubbed every spot on this foot, little one,\u201d she said, slapping her foot down and raising the other up by her heel. \u201cIt\u2019s time you started on this foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy immediately went to work with the other foot, starting with the toes, gently and thoroughly rubbing his tiny hands between the giant digits. Hippolyta dipped her head back and sighed, feeling that wondrous stimulating sensation of her shrunken charge's hands thoroughly working through the surfaces of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Hippolyta pins her foot down on Timmy; she's feeling playful.<br>\r\n2.) Hippolyta pins her foot down on Timmy; she wants to help him face his fears.<br>\r\n3.)

She gently and regally lifted up her foot, watching and feeling Timmy struggling between her mighty digits, feeling slightly tickled by his efforts to escape. Timmy, on the other hand, was far from having fun. He felt like his torso would snap between the pressure of the two titanic toes. The smell of vanilla became overpowering. Try as he could, Timmy couldn't break free from the hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty, what are you doing to me!?\" Timmy shrieked, struggling against the tightness of the toe's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta emitted an amused chuckle. \u201cI am merely toying with you, Timmy.

There are others outside this room who wish to crush you under their feet, so I am preparing you for the ones who do try.\u201d The giant queen of the Amazons gently clenched her toes, a satisfying smirk spread across her delicate features as she watched her tiny ward struggle between her beautiful digits. \u201cIn addition, I am receiving a lovely foot massage from my son, so you consider it a win-win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 but I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta lowered her foot, loosened her toes, and dropped Timmy back on the floor. While Timmy took a moment to recover, the giant queen moved her massive foot over his body, gently and firmly pinning him between her enormous sole and the floor. Hippolyta\u2019s immaculate toes blanketed Timmy\u2019s torso except for his arms and head while the poor boy cried, wriggled, and beat the giantess\u2019s toes. \u201cLet me go! Stop it, Your Majesty, please! You\u2019re hurting me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, Timmy,\" Hippolyta said, gently easing the pressure on the tiny boy, allowing him to break his arms free. \"There, now you can reach my toes better. I bet you can really smell that vanilla smell, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy felt like he was about to cry. The sensation of being planted by the giant queen's feet immediately brought him back to those short but traumatic moments when he was pinned underneath Artemis's foot when he was accidentally scooped into her sandal. It hurt then, and it still hurt now. The shrunken boy began to sob while he used his free arms to push and beat Hippolyta's toes, trying to free him from this claustrophobic sensation. Unfortunately, his beat felt like little massages to the queen, as she threw her head back and sighed contently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that feels good, Timmy,\" Queen Hippolyta said, wiggling her toes at the delightful feeling. \"Now don't forget to get in between the toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as much as he could, Timmy couldn't get free of his adoptive mother's giant toes. He cried, he begged, he beat, and he pushed, but the toes were too powerful for him to budge. Even if he did try, the giantess would perceive his beating and pushing on her feet as part of his frantic massage. He felt his breathing, heart rate, and anxiety race. He had to escape the foot. He had to escape this claustrophobic feeling. He had to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Timmy continued to massage Hippolyta's toes; she is satisfied.<br>\r\n2.) Timmy continued to massage Hippolyta's toes; she isn't satisfied.<br>\r\n3.) Timmy has a panic attack; Hippolyta comforts the boy.<br>\r\n4.) Timmy managed to escape Hippolyta's toes; she punishes him for his resistance.<br>\r\n5.) Timmy managed to escape Hippolyta's toes; he escapes before he faces punishment.</span></div></div>",

She gently and regally lifted up her foot, watching and feeling Timmy struggling between her mighty digits, feeling slightly tickled by his efforts to escape. Timmy, on the other hand, was far from having fun. He felt like his torso would snap between the pressure of the two titanic toes. The smell of vanilla became overpowering. Try as he could, Timmy couldn't break free from the hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty, what are you doing to me!?\" Timmy shrieked, struggling against the tightness of the toe's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta emitted an amused chuckle. \u201cI am merely toying with you, Timmy. Try as I might, I could not resist the urge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said you wouldn't take advantage of my size!\" Timmy cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is true I said that, but as much as I enjoy playing with small insects and animals scuttling about my toes, I am also helping face your fear of being small. There are others outside this room who wish to crush you under their feet, so I am preparing you for the ones who do try.\u201d The giant queen of the Amazons gently clenched her toes, a satisfying smirk spread across her delicate features as she watched her tiny ward struggle between her beautiful digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 but I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta lowered her foot, loosened her toes, and dropped Timmy back on the floor. While Timmy took a moment to recover, the giant queen moved her massive foot over his body, gently and firmly pinning him between her enormous sole and the floor. Hippolyta\u2019s immaculate toes blanketed Timmy\u2019s torso except for his arms and head while the poor boy cried, wriggled, and beat the giantess\u2019s toes. \u201cLet me go! Stop it, Your Majesty, please! You\u2019re hurting me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsider this a trial for you, child,\u201d Hippolyta stated regally, ignoring the tiny kid\u2019s pleas to free him. \u201cYou have been shrunken down in a cruel twist of fate, stranded here on our island, and battered against Artemis\u2019s feet. If you are to survive in your current size, then you must face your fear of the giants starting from the ground up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta wiggled her toes slightly, increasing the pressure on Timmy\u2019s diminished body further, making him scream in pain. \u201cTake heed, young Timmy Walker. There are those who will see you as an ant and therefore do not show mercy. However, there are certain ants in this world that have survived by falling creatures much larger than them with their tiny yet lethal sting. In order to break my foot\u2019s hold on you, you need to learn how to survive in your current size. If you can somehow escape my foot, then I will grant you an early day\u2019s rest to recover from your situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-Wh-What will happen if I don\u2019t?\u201d Timmy squeaked out the question over the pressure on his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you fail, then the punishment will be to continue your labors on my feet until you are done, adding to becoming insoles for my sandals for the rest of the night,\u201d Hippolyta informed the small boy, who shuddered at the thought of being inserted into a giantess\u2019s sandal again. \u201cTake note, Timmy. In Themyscira, an Amazon must steel themselves against their fears and adapt to their failures, even our children. That is what makes us the fearless warriors of this island, and that is what I will make of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-L-Like a soldier?\u201d Timmy inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, child. Fearless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy whimpered and beat against Hippolyta\u2019s mighty toes, but he couldn\u2019t even trigger a reflex. Perhaps his fists were too small to be felt beating against the giant toes? Too small, too soft, and too blunt. It was like earlier when he was trapped in Artemis\u2019s shoe and he was pinned under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when it occurred to him. He knew how to escape this situation, just like how he did with Artemis\u2019s foot! Timmy dug his nails and his bared teeth into the ridged tip of Hippolyta\u2019s big toe, and he did it hard for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened afterwards?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Hippolyta feels the bit; Timmy has passed the trial.<br>\r\n2.) Hippolyta feels nothing; Timmy has failed the trial.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNow then, Timmy, for your first task,\u201d Hippolyta said, guiding the little boy in her hands onto the nightstand, \u201cI want you to feed me the fruit in that bowl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta lowered the boy with cupped hands to the nightstand, tilting them to prompt Timmy to hop off and land on the surface of the small stand level to Hippolyta\u2019s chest. The tiny boy watched as Hippolyta bent towards to be at eye level with her new charge, getting a better look at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hippolyta, the tiny boy was so young, innocent, and adorable, but so helpless at his size. One more wrong step and he would become a stain on the bottom of an Amazon\u2019s shoe. To Timmy, Hippolyta was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, admittedly even more beautiful than his mom. She had the face of a caring mother about her and a lovely voice that could only be viewed as both motherly and commanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis task is quite simple,\u201d Hippolyta explained. \u201cYou will bring forward a grape for me to eat only one at a time, but be sure to not drop them anywhere except for my mouth. Given your size, I do not wish for you to strain yourself bringing two or more grapes for me. When you have finished feeding me the last grape and not drop one on the ground, you will have succeeded in your task, understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, your highness,\u201d Timmy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Hippolyta slumped down in her bed in her fullest graceful splendor, her head inclined on the bed\u2019s soft pillows. She placed her hands on her breasts, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy took a quick moment to observe the titanic Amazonian queen lying down in her bed, the way she folded her hands over her breasts, the posture she chose... he couldn\u2019t exactly describe the beauty behind it all. She looked like a true goddess, standing as tall as the stairs of said goddesses that Timmy noticed the statues of in the palace on the way. A goddess in need of an insignificant bug to serve on hand and foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? I am waiting, my young charge,\u201d Hippolyta said, snapping him out of his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh..! S-Sorry!\u201d Timmy squeaked as he ran to the fruit bowl, picking out a grape, holding with both hands like a giant beach ball, and returning to the edge of the nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy grabbed the grape so he could toss it into Hippolyta\u2019s mouth. As he approached the edge, however, he found himself pausing before a curious, yet dangerous sight. He ended up staring directly into the open maw of Queen Hippolyta herself. The inside of her open mouth looked like a deep, fleshy pit, framed by her lips, her ivory teeth, and her wriggling tongue lined with moist, spongy texture. Timmy looked deeper inside the giantess\u2019s maw and saw the back of her throat, the gateway to her esophagus, a dark squelching tunnel that led to the inside of her stomach, marked overhead by her bobbing uvula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy felt a shiver run through his body; he was old enough to know what happened when food was eaten and ends up in his stomach. Remembering his task, Timmy tossed down the first grape onto Hippolyta\u2019s tongue. The instant the grape hit her taste buds, Hippolyta quickly sealed her lips shut, bringing the grape to her molars and compressing it with a crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy watched with fascination as the giantess\u2019s jaws made quick work of the grape. He could hear every juicy crunch with each motion of her jaws, and her deep, nasally breathing to accompany the music of her mastication. After a few seconds, the giantess swallowed, her neck bobbing inward to send the crushed remains of the grape down to her stomach while her mouth opened for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next several grapes, Timmy repeated this routine, sending the fruit into Hippolyta\u2019s mouth to be chewed, swallowed, and digested without ever dropping one by accident. With a few more grapes left in the bunch, Timmy plucked another one to feed the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Timmy successfully completes the task.<br>\r\n2.) Timmy unsuccessfully completes the task.<br>\r\n3.) Timmy falls into her open mouth!<br>\r\n4.) They are interrupted by another Amazon!</span></div></div>",

He carried it over to the edge of the nightstand and looked over to aim the grape into the giantess\u2019s yawning maw. In that moment, Hippolyta breathed a deep sigh, sending hot breath in the boy\u2019s face that would eventually prove to be a major mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breath not only make Timmy grimace, but because the nightstand was made of smooth, polished marble, any hot breath would turn into moisture. The edge of the nightstand was moistened, making Timmy\u2019s footing unstable. He slipped on the edge, and he went screaming into the dark, fleshy pit, hurtling past the gaping lips, through two rows of white ivory teeth, and over the gargantuan tongue. His fall abruptly stopped when he was lodged into Queen Hippolyta\u2019s esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Hippolyta\u2019s windpipe was clogged up like a cork in a bottle. She threw herself into a sitting position as she choked and gagged on the wriggling tiny boy in the back of her throat. The gagging was so loud, it echoed out of the chambers and immediately drew attention from her guard. Philippus and her troop stormed into the chamber, watching with fright as their queen grasped her throat, turning blue in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness!\u201d Philippus exclaimed as she ran to the queen\u2019s side. \u201cQuick! Someone get her some water!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone instantly ran to fetch a jug of water and a glass for the choking queen. Philippus quickly went from behind and grabbed Hippolyta around the abdomen. She quickly constricted her arms in spurts to dislodge the obstruction suffocating her from the inside. Hippolyta\u2019s face was starting to turn purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, my queen! We\u2019ll get whatever\u2019s choking you out!\u201d Philippus tried to assure the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy stuck inside the back Hippolyta\u2019s throat wasn\u2019t faring much better. His legs were stuck inside the epiglottis where the flap separated the esophagus from the lungs. Hippolyta\u2019s vocal chords were so close in proximity, her constant coughing and gagging seemed like explosions in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jaws continuously jolted along with bright flickers of light pouring in from the opening of the mouth. The tongue was too moist and slippery for Timmy to grab ahold to pull himself up. His panicking overwhelmed him as he tried to claw out of the throat, but that only made it worse. The more he wriggled, the deeper he was pushed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, your majesty, don\u2019t eat me!\u201d Timmy begged for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt tiny bursts of air pushing him from deep inside the throat, pushing a little further up the tongue. Someone was giving her the Heimlich maneuver. They were trying to force him out of her windpipe. Timmy whimpered as he reached for the back of the tongue and tried to pull himself out of the epiglottis. Then after a few squeezes and a few pushes of the Heimlich...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) ...Hippolyta swallows Timmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) ...Hippolyta coughs up Timmy.</span></div></div>",

It was working because Hippolyta was beginning to breathe inward again, though less than outward. Her faithful general kept pushing on her lungs to rescue the boy from an unfortunate digestive fate. After this was over, Hippolyta knew that this was an unfortunate circumstance, but nonetheless, she had to administer her punishment to the boy because this counted as an automatic failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few pushes from Philippus, Timmy was pushed out of the epiglottis and launched onto the back of the tongue. Timmy laid flat on the rear bumps along the edge of Hippolyta\u2019s tongue, crying at the horrific trauma he endured. He got himself up to crawl over the tongue and out the mouth when his head his something moist from up above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the world inside of Hippolyta\u2019s mouth and throat as her gag reflex kicked in. Timmy\u2019s entire world jolted around him as the tongue suddenly bucked him to the back of the throat and a sudden booming gag blasted behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Hippolyta began to choke once more, frightening her guard. The tiny boy hit his head on his uvula, triggering her reflex which caused her tongue to buck the obstruction back into her throat. She held her hands to her throat to slow Timmy\u2019s accidental descent down her esophagus. No matter how much she tried, Hippolyta couldn\u2019t resist her reflex as they threatened to pull him down into her digestive tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith so much regret, Hippolyta couldn't hold on any longer, so she swallowed. Hippolyta grimaced as her esophagus squeezed the wriggling bulk inside, feeling him descend to plop into her stomach. Hippolyta quickly jumped on her feet and breathed normally, holding her belly with a shocked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness, are you alright?\u201d Philippus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. No, I\u2019m not,\u201d Hippolyta answered, her shock never leaving her face. \u201cI... I swallowed my charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Timmy had lived one of the worst experiences of his newly tiny life. He was so close to being coughed out of Hippolyta\u2019s throat when he accidentally caused her to choke again. The tongue sent him over the edge of her throat and his entire body was stuck inside. He felt the gentle, protective hands of the giantess trying to hold him from being swallowed down until he was pulled at the peristalsis by his legs and was forced deeper into the giantess's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a painful five seconds down the esophagus, Timmy was squeezed into the stomach, filled up with saliva, acid, and a single tiny boy. After splashing in that hot, shallow pool at the bottom of the fleshy cavern, the size of the inside of a minivan, Timmy began to panic. He quickly swam up to the stomach walls, screamed, and began to beat his fists against the malleable wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, your majesty, let me out!\u201d Timmy screamed. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be digested!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta felt the tiny beats in her stomach. She covered her belly with her hands while the other Amazon guards huddled around her to get a good listen. They could faintly hear the tiny screams of the boy coming from inside her belly. It sounded muffled, but it confirmed without a doubt that it was his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true,\u201d Artemis said. \u201cYou swallowed the son of man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could this happen?\u201d Persephone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe fell into my mouth while feeding me grapes as part of his own test,\u201d Hippolyta explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen he has failed the test,\u201d Artemis deduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would seem so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo keep him there,\u201d the redhead suggested. \u201cHe should not have failed at such an easy task, and yet, there he resides in the belly of our queen. Surely this is a mercy for arriving at these shores as small as a bug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I would rather have the boy alive and unspoiled than to suffer a fate worse than death,\u201d Philippus argued with the fierce Amazon. \u201cThe boy may be the son of man, but he is still a child. You would personally forsake the life of a young one for nutrition in our queen\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he can endure torture at our feet, what\u2019s makes you think he can\u2019t endure torture in our own bellies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Hippolyta said, turning her attention to the crying minuscule boy in her stomach. \u201cTimmy, it is I, Hippolyta. Are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Timmy yelled from inside the Hippolyta\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou just swallowed me, and it was so tight, I couldn\u2019t breath. Now I\u2019m stuck in your tummy and I can\u2019t climb out. It\u2019s dark and it\u2019s gross and it\u2019s stinky and it\u2019s wet and... and... I want my mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTimmy? Timmy, listen to my voice. Focus on my voice,\u201d Hippolyta said calmly. \u201cI need you to calm down. Panicking will only lead to disaster. I want you speak to me as calmly as you can. Are you hurt? Do you feel at least the slightest burn anywhere in your body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled. \u201cN-No. I\u2019m... I\u2019m just scared! Please, your majesty, I\u2019m sorry for falling into your mouth! I\u2019m sorry I almost choked you to death! Please let me out! I don\u2019t wanna die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty, please, you must allow the boy to take his punishment in your belly,\u201d Artemis insisted. \u201cHe has set foot on the shores of Themyscira, failed at a simple task of serving you, and nearly killed you by lodging himself in your throat. This is the punishment he deserves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he is only a child,\u201d Philippus countered. \u201cChildren his age make mistakes, but we would never want a child to die. Though he has failed in a simple task, your highness, allow us to give him the appropriate punishment that does not involve digestion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta stopped and thought this dilemma through. The young boy in her stomach did indeed set foot on Themyscira, but he was a lonely survivor of a fatal plane crash the size of a bug. He had already suffered so much, she didn't want him to suffer a grim fate inside her body... but then again, he survived Artemis\u2019s toes and doesn\u2019t feel pain of digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have made my decision,\u201d Hippolyta said, turning to her stomach and rubbing it gently in circles. \u201cTimmy, what recently transpired was an accident, but you have nonetheless failed your own training. Therefore, as punishment, you will remain inside my stomach until the next morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? Nooooo!\u201d Timmy furiously pounded against the stomach walls, trying to get his giantess captor nauseatingly suck. Unfortunately, to Hippolyta, the tiny boy\u2019s punches were ticklish at best, and she placed her hand on her belly in response. \u201cPlease, your majesty, let me out of here! I don\u2019t wanna stay in your tummy! I don\u2019t wanna die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, child, but rest assured that you will not die by my own stomach,\u201d Hippolyta said, patting her belly gently. \u201cWhatever force has shrunken you has left you with high endurance, meaning if you survived under Artemis\u2019s foot, you will survive inside my belly. Trust me, child, this is the best place for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna stay in here! It\u2019s dark... and stinky... and wet... and-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will do well to take the queen\u2019s punishment, boy. This is what you deserve for nearly choking her to death,\u201d Artemis scolded the young tiny captive, making him jump from stern tone, which Hippolyta felt with a little shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Artemis,\u201d she rebuked the red-haired warrior, turning to her belly. \u201cTimmy, even though it was an accident that you nearly choked me, you nevertheless failed your training and you are now facing the consequences for your actions. Think of your time in my stomach as a gentle reminder of those actions. With each failure in your training, your time inside my body will be extended, or I will administer a more appropriate punishment. You are young, so use your time in my stomach wisely to reflect on your mistakes and how you can better avoid the consequences.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I... I...\u201d Timmy felt all Hope slip away as he slipped against Hippolyta\u2019s stomach wall into a slump, feeling a new wave of tears leak from his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean for you to choke because of me! I promise I\u2019ll do better! I promise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you will, Timmy. I believe you.\u201d Hippolyta rubbed her belly in circles, gently massaging the inch-high boy slumping against the inside walls of her stomach. \u201cIn the meantime, you\u2019ll have to remain inside my stomach until tomorrow morning. If you need anything, just tap on the walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Will I have to stay in here during supper time?\u201d Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d the giant queen of the Amazons ruefully answered. \u201cThis is part of the punishment. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be sure to take special care to provide you food so it does not appear physically repulsive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d Timmy shuffled in his slump so he was laying against the stomach walls like he would in a bathtub, filled with digestive acids that didn\u2019t sting or tingle his body, previously masticated food, and whatever else the giantess consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Timmy\u2019s new life now: servant or slave to the queen of the Amazons who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to step on him like a bug or swallow him whole as part of her punishment. No matter how much he wanted it, he couldn't escape it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Skip to the afternoon with Hippolyta riding her horse.<br>\r\n2.) Skip to the evening with Hippolyta attending dinner.<br>\r\n3.) Skip to nighttime with Hippolyta fast asleep.<br>\r\n4.) Skip to the next morning when Hippolyta lets Timmy out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Timmy soaked woefully in the fleshy, warm tub of green digestive juices and mushed food within Hippolyta's stomach. He could hear everything that went on inside the Amazon Queen's body. Her heartbeats, her breathing, even her stomach's gurgling. It didn't help that he was trapped inside this stinking, dark prison until morning over an accident, even if it was within his adopted mother's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother part Timmy didn't like was how he felt Hippolyta move around from the inside, sloshing him and her meal around her stomach. This was evident when he felt the stomach jostle as Hippolyta rose up from her bed. \u201cI will be taking my horse out for a stroll. I will be back soon,\u201d Hippolyta addressed her guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the entire stomach jiggled and swayed with the rhythm of her footsteps, with Timmy being swished from left to right and back. It was difficult for the tiny eight year-old boy to lie down in the same position when Hippolyta continued to walk outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire stomach jostled with every step Queen Hippolyta took. Inside, Timmy and all of the other masticated mush soaked in saliva and digestive fluids were sloshed around within the green smelly pool from one stomach lining to the other. It felt like a ship caught in the terrible tropical storm. The bubbling growling and groaning didn\u2019t help one bit either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, that storm turned violent when Timmy felt the stomach suddenly lift up like an elevator ride and suddenly crash. In that crash, Timmy was bounced upwards and then down into the pool of acids, soaking him from head to toe. He resurfaced from the acids, coughing and sputtering that disgusting fluid. Some of it already splashed into his mouth and it tasted like throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies, Timmy,\u201d the Queen\u2019s voice boomed up above as she gently rubbed her belly from the outside, gently patting it to give off gentle jostles to the child inside, \u201cI was merely mounting my horse. I had not known how the motions would affect the insides of my stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Where are you going?\u201d Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will be heading towards a ridge overlooking the sea,\u201d Hippolyta said. \u201cIt\u2019s where I like to go and gather my thoughts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long will the trip take?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot too long, Timmy, perhaps ten minutes,\u201d Hippolyta answered. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Timmy, I\u2019ll tell you when we\u2019re there so you may better grace yourself for when I dismount.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the inside of the queen\u2019s belly, Timmy felt the gentle jostling of not Hippolyta\u2019s strolls, but the hoof steps of her mounted horse making way through the Amazon city. With nothing to do, Timmy curled up in a fetal position against the stomach walls and waited while the digestive safe gurgled and growled, slowly breaking down its other meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the sad fate for the tiny boy trapped within the Amazon Queen\u2019s stomach. Though Queen Hippolyta intended to release him from her belly the next morning, the fact remained was that Timmy was stuck in a smelly, fleshy, repulsive cage within the giant queen\u2019s body. His tiny stature became soaked with digestive fluids and a thin layer of saliva. The stomach acids began to dissolve the masticated food, but his clothes and body didn\u2019t feel a tingle or sizzle. Supposedly, it was a blessing and a curse to be this tiny and immune to physical harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes passed and shortly after, Timmy felt the stomach stop jostling. \u201cWe are here,\u201d Hippolyta informed Timmy. \u201cBrace yourself, Timmy, I am about to dismount.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy gripped the stomach lining tight. As Hippolyta dismounted, her entire stomach fell with her, feeling like the drop of a watery thrill ride which made Timmy yelp as he felt the brief sense of vertigo followed by the splash of hot acids. The boy coughed and choked that disgusting throw-up flavor out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, Timmy?\u201d Hippolyta asked the boy in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Timmy answered back, \u201cI got some If your throw-up in my mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies for that,\u201d the queen said sincerely and lightly, \u201cbut it is fortunate for you that I don\u2019t intend to move for a while. I spend many hours on a calm day sitting on the ledge, looking into the horizon with deep thought. Though you are inside of me, you are actually the first person in a long time to join me in contemplation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I wish that counted as joining you,\u201d Timmy said. \u201cI can\u2019t see the horizon from inside here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is quite unfortunate indeed.\u201d Queen Hippolyta rubbed her stomach as she stared into the open see, the sun\u2019s reflection shining off the glistening surface of the water. \u201cFate has not been kind to you this day, young Timmy. You have been shrunk in a terrible disaster that has claimed your family, you drifted to our shores alone, suffered under the foot of my guards, and now you are caged within my stomach over an accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the last one was your decision,\u201d Timmy pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven so, I would never wish such a terrible fate upon you,\u201d Hippolyta said. \u201cYou have already suffered so much in such little time. If there were any way for me to reverse your situation, then I would have done so right about now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there?\u201d the tiny boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am afraid not,\u201d Hippolyta said sadly. \u201cThere are few mystics on this island with magicks capable of rivaling those of the gods, but even so, there is no spell which is capable of restoring you to full size. I may ask them to research a growth spell, and the closest they come to is a spell to better grow our crops before the harvest moon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy slumped against the interior of Hippolyta\u2019s stomach, stifling a sniffle. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. I lost my family in the plane crash, I lost my size, and now I\u2019m stuck in your stinky, smelly, wet tummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there is one thing you are overlooking, young Timmy,\u201d the queen assured the bite-sized boy. \u201cYou are safe with me, within me. I have already decreed that I would be your guardian and protector and I already intend to with the love and firmness of both mother and father. I may not be the mother you lost, child, nor will I replace the hole they left in your heart, but I will do my best to pick up where she left off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy felt a certain warmth from the way the giant queen vowed to watch over him. Standing up and wobbling against the malleable floor, Timmy leaned forward and hugged the stomach wall. Hippolyta flinched at the sensation of the boy hugging and nuzzling the stomach wall. She responded by gently clasping her hand at the area where Timmy was hugging her from the inside. She felt the warmth of Timmy\u2019s newfound love for her, but there was something else... something different... something pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Your Majesty!\u201d Timmy screamed gleefully. \u201cThank you, thank you! I promise I won\u2019t let you down, mama!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two suddenly shared an awkward pause amongst themselves. Timmy couldn\u2019t help but slip and fall back into the pool of stomach fluids out of embarrassment and clasp his face with his hands. \u201cOh no! I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean...!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle chuckle from Hippolyta eased the tension. \u201cIt is alright, child. I am not unfamiliar with the title of mother. After all, I am a mother myself, and I have more than enough experience with raising rambunctious children into maturity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mommy always told me I was an energetic little boy,\u201d Timmy told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you are, young Timmy,\u201d Hippolyta concurred. \u201cThat you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gentle pat of her stomach, Hippolyta continued to stare out into the sea, feeling the young tiny bulk in her belly settle down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Hippolyta feels the desire to keep Timmy insider her stomach and tells him the story of Cronus and Zeus.<br>\r\n2.) Hippolyta sees a woman drifting to the shores of Themyscira.<br>\r\n3.) Hippolyta hears the gong ringing; it's time for dinner!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hippolyta stared long and hard at the horizon beyond the sea. She placed her hand over her belly where her young, shrunken charge shifted and tickled the inside of her stomach. It was a strange sensation, feeling the tiny Timmy run around inside her, hugging the walls of her belly. It felt... pleasant. Like the tickles of his tiny footsteps and hands inside her body felt so pleasant, it sent a strange current through her nerves, through her heart, and into her loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt wrong, but... strangely, feeling the young boy in her belly was starting to turn her on. Her immaculate hand reached her belly and then moved downwards towards her groin area, and subconsciously, she started to rub that area. Her breathing became deep and pleasurable, her heart rate increased, and her mind was drifting to euphoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a pleasurable feeling, to be dominant over a tiny son of man... her new son of man... by trapping him inside her body, and he wouldn\u2019t be harmed physically. She didn\u2019t want this feeling to go away for some time. In fact, she didn\u2019t want this to stop. At that moment, Timmy asked, \u201cWhat\u2019cha thinkin\u2019 about, mama?\u201d and forced her to return to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking, Timmy, of an ancient legend of the gods eons ago,\" Hippolyta answered. \"Tell me, child, have you heard the legends of Zeus and his pantheon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" came Timmy's reply from inside her body. \"I don't know who Zeus is, or what a pan... pant...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pantheon. It means 'many gods' in an old language,\" Hippolyta clarified. \"There are many countries who have worshipped many gods in the dawn of mankind, and the gods of old in Ancient Greek legend is well-known throughout the entire world, and Zeus, the god of thunder, is the one who rules over them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I don't know those legends, mama,\" said Timmy. \"My mommy and I used to read Bible stories together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So you and your family worshipped the One God, then,\" the Queen of the Amazons understood, rubbing her belly reassuringly. \"I suppose I cannot make you change which god you may worship, young Timmy, but since you will be living among us, you will learn the legends of the Greek gods, and the story I am about to tell you is of how Zeus defeated the Titans and he and his brothers and sisters ascended to godhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta felt the tiny boy shift around inside her stomach, which, in reality, was Timmy repositioning himself to listen to the story. \"Long ago, at the dawn of mankind, fearsome giants known as the Titans ruled the world, children of the sky god, Uranus, and the earth mother, Gaea. Out of all the Titans, Cronus was the most feared and he ruled the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day, Cronus received a prophecy from Gaea, telling him that one of his own children will rise against him and defeat the Titans,\" Hippolyta continued. \"So Cronus devoured his infant children like little morsels, all of them who would grow inside his belly and become the gods we worship on this island. Rhea, the wife of Cronus, secretly sired Zeus in Crete, a city in Greece, and hid him away in a cave while he tricked Cronus into devouring a stone believing it was his son in swaddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeus was raised in secrecy, and grew into an adult age where he rose against his father. The nymph who raised him, Adamanthea, gifted him a plant which would make Cronus throw up his sons and daughters he had consumed. Zeus and his brothers, Poseidon and Hades, and his sisters, Hera, Hestia, and Demeter, overthrew Cronus and the other Titans, becoming the gods who ruled the ancient world. Zeus became the ruler of the gods and helped forge the world we Amazons knew from ancient times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that Cronus sounds like a real jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta couldn't help but laugh at Timmy's simple, but relevant comment. The laughter caused the stomach all around Timmy to surge each time Hippolyta's lungs rapidly ventilated with each laugh. \"I suppose you are correct there, young Timmy,\" she chuckled, \"Cronus was indeed a tyrant, and he needed to be imprisoned with his fellow Titans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad that Zeus wasn't eaten by his mommy,\" Timmy mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Hippolyta asked. \"And why is that, do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because mommies are supposed to be pretty and kind, and Zeus's mommy was a Titan, right?\" Timmy inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she was, child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said the Titans were giants, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, maybe if Zeus's mommy swallowed him like you did to me, then maybe he'd be safer inside of her tummy, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden chill ran through Hippolyta's body. The boy wasn't wrong; in fact, it seemed to have triggered a stimulating response throughout her very essence. Her cheeks flushed vermillion, her heart began to race faster, and she felt her breathing become slightly labored. \"Actually, that is exactly it,\" the Queen of the Amazons, said, holding her hand against her belly tighter. \"In fact, that's why I told you that story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama?\" Timmy inquired, confused by the last verse she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is because the way you move around the inside of my body, the way you shift yourself around inside my stomach... there is this feeling that I have never felt before,\" Hippolyta said, lightly patting her belly, jostling her adopted son inside with her digested mush. \"Since you, a child shrunken by our own mystical barriers was accidentally swallowed and trapped within my belly, I cannot help but wonder what Cronus felt when he swallowed his children, when he imprisoned them in his belly while they grew into adulthood, knowing there was no way out for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama, what are you talking about?\" Timmy asked, confused by her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot explain this feeling in words, but perhaps this is what it feels like as a mother to carry her own child around in her body months before she is due,\" Hippolyta wondered aloud, rubbing circles around her torso. She gently reached under her robes and felt around the smooth skin on her belly at the spot where she felt Timmy from the inside. \"So small, residing inside a mother's body while she protects their little one from any danger on the outside. Perhaps... perhaps this is what this feeling is. The desire to protect you from the dangers of the outside world by keeping you safe inside of my stomach, never to let you out, never to let the feeling of you moving inside of me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Timmy pushed against the stomach walls. \"Mama, no, don't say that! Don't say I wanna stay in here! I wanna come out like we promised!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the tiny boy pushed from the inside of Hippolyta's stomach, it sent a certain stimulation that felt almost pleasurable to her, almost like a sexual stimulation. \"Yes, like that, Timmy. Every time you touch the surface of my stomach walls like that, every time you move, it makes me feel so different, but in a good sense of the way. It makes me want to keep you inside me, sealed away inside of my body so I can relish your tickling scuttling inside me forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama, please!\" the boy begged, pushing against the stomach with all his might. On the outside, Hippolyta felt a little lump form from the outside of her torso. She gently pushed it back in, knocking Timmy back into the digestive acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to keep you inside of me, young Timmy, as my own personal internal servant,\" Hippolyta said. \"I want to feel you moving inside of me, safe from the dangerous world at your current size. In exchange, you will have a place to rest, you will eat what I eat, and drink what I drink. It will require some adjustments first so you may better accommodate your surroundings, but I would feel safe knowing you would be home, inside the stomach of a giant who serves her entire body for your wellbeing and protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy was speechless at this point. He knew begging wouldn't help him escape, and any attempt to nauseate the Queen from the inside only aroused her further. He slumped against the stomach walls and brushed his cheek against the mucus-coated, fleshy surface. He felt her stomach walls curled up around him, twitching, and jostling. \"If I did want to stay in your tummy, would you let me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would depend on the matter of when you want to exit my body and how you exit it,\" came the Queen's response from above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Timmy's answer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Timmy doesn't want to stay inside Hippolyta's stomach; Hippolyta reluctantly agrees.<br>\r\n2.) Timmy doesn't want to stay inside Hippolyta's stomach; Hippolyta keeps him imprisoned.<br>\r\n3.) Timmy wants to stay inside Hippolyta's stomach, but under certain conditions.<br>\r\n4.) Timmy wants to stay inside Hippolyta's stomach forever.</span></div></div>",

Because of their constant exposure to STAR Labs technology and chemicals, Aiden was born with a birth defect which rendered him tiny-sized.

Aiden was born to Dr. Jason and Sandra Jones, two of the top scientific minds of STAR Labs who met on the job, fell in love, got married, and conceived their son. However, Aiden was born small as a result of his parents\u2019 repeated exposure from radiation and chemicals in STAR Labs. Aiden\u2019s birth made national headlines, and the tiny baby was made an instant celebrity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this opened up so many possibilities for the world\u2019s villains to target little Aiden for kidnapping and ransom. Fearful for their baby son\u2019s life, the Joneses tightened their security for their penthouse home where the only people who had access there was themselves and their nanny, a beautiful woman who was tasked for caring the penthouse and their baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one route, the Joneses hired a female superhero as their nanny hoping to make a few extra bucks spare time and keep a vigilant eye of the tiny-born Aiden. In another route, the Joneses unknowingly hired a female supervillain who passed herself as their nanny hoping to hold Aiden captive in exchange for their experimental prototype. In either route, the nanny raises Aiden and along the way, discovers the metahuman powers that compensated for the boy's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiden, though while born the size of a pinkie finger, displays heightened endurance and resistance to harm and physical injury. This happens on occasion with Aiden, when he is accidentally stepped on by a giant woman or swallowed alive, showing no signs of burns or physical harm after he was released from the giant woman's digestive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is, is the nanny a superhero or a supervillain?</span></div></div>",

With so many break-ins, robberies, and experiments gone horribly wrong involving STAR Labs and its faithful employees, the Joneses were convinced that Aiden would be in danger of being kidnapped and held for ransom. After all, since Aiden was conceived at the size of an adult pinkie finger, he would be easy pickings for any villain who wants to use him as leverage for their dastardly schemes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Joneses ultimately decided to hire a nanny to watch over Aiden, to protect him and nurture him while they were away at work or some other important business. Since the exploits of Aiden's tiny size made the national headlines and made the baby an instant Internet celebrity, it made sense that they'd hire a female superhero(es) to watch over him and protect him from anyone trying to take advantage of his size to use as a bargaining chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the superhero was first introduced to baby Aiden in his tiny form, she felt a certain maternal instinct kick in, since the baby was so adorable and innocent. Several months had passed, and the hero spent her free non-working hours to watch over Aiden, playing with him and attending to his needs. In case of any emergency, the hero would call upon another female superhero and gave her specific instructions to follow to fulfill the tiny baby's specific needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next several years, the hero raised Aiden like her own son. With the help of the other female superheroes, the nanny discovered Aiden\u2019s meta-gene ability of high physical endurance against pressure and digestion to compensate his tiny size.

With so many break-ins, robberies, and experiments gone horribly wrong involving STAR Labs and its faithful employees, the Joneses were convinced that Aiden would be in danger of being kidnapped and held for ransom. After all, since Aiden was conceived at the size of an adult pinkie finger, he would be easy pickings for any villain who wants to use him as leverage for their dastardly schemes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Joneses ultimately decided to hire a nanny to watch over Aiden, to protect him and nurture him while they were away at work or some other important business. That was their first and biggest mistake, because the nanny the Joneses hired was actually an infamous villainess in disguise with the intention of kidnapping them, holding them hostage to steal their latest prototype in STAR Labs and then killing them afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the villainess was first introduced to baby Aiden in his tiny form, she felt a certain maternal instinct kick in, since the baby was so adorable and innocent. She bade her time from undergoing her plans by winning the Joneses' trust and given access to the passcodes inside of their penthouse suit. Several months had passed, and the villainess decided it was time for her to undergo her plan. It was relatively simple: Use her passcode to sneak into the penthouse, pluck Aiden from his bedroom, and disappear into the night while leaving behind no trace evidence. She transferred her earnings as a nanny to a private bank account, wiped all traces of it, and took Aiden under her wicked wing and waited until the heat cooled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next several years, the villainous vixen raised the tiny boy as her own son. With the help of other villainesses, the kidnapper discovered Aiden\u2019s meta-gene ability of high physical endurance against pressure and digestion to compensate his tiny size. They experimented on it by squishing him under their feet, planting him under their enormous seats, and even swallowing them to see if he survived their digestive system. Aiden, in return, worked for his \u201cmommas\u201d and \u201caunties\u201d, becoming a slave to their every whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepending on the story routes, Aiden\u2019s life as a tiny bug boy under his giant maternal figure's watch is either happy, loving, and na\u00efve, or is torturous, sad, and miserable.

In addition, the shrunken targets are also granted physical endurance and invincibility. The female size manipulator is either a hero, a villain, or an anti-hero; either way, she likes to have the boy tag along with her in her misadventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSon of the World's Tiniest Mutant: The boy is the son of the shrunken mutant, Shortpack, and the shape-shifting mutant, Raven Darkholme/Mystique, nine months after a brief one-night stand during their downtime from their field operation. Shortpack's mutant genes were passed down to his son, instantly shrinking him to the size of a #2 pencil eraser, small enough that only Jean Grey noticed his presence in Mystique's womb.

The boy is often visited by his mother and her female X-Men friends until he was old enough to join attend Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSizing the Fourth Wall: The boy is a real world Marvel Comics teen fanatic who\u2019s into most of the female characters but doesn\u2019t like certain female characters such as the plus-sized heroine Big Bertha, or the fourth wall-breaking heroine, Gwenpool. Due to her ability to break the fourth wall, Gwenpool heard about the boy dissing her, so she grabs the boy and literally throws him into a comic panel where he appears tinier than the female characters he ogles.

In the second route, a young street thief steals a container full of Pym Particles but is permanently shrunk.

One day, the brother takes the bullying too far, and in desperation, the sister sends a written letter addressed to Janet, asking her and Nadia to deal with her problem. After an arrangement with the bullying brother's female family members, the boy is shrunken down by a malfunctioning Pym Disk and is taught a lesson in humility, either through the Wasp, their friends, or his female family members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pym Particle Plunderer: The boy steals a container of Pym Particles with the promise of payment by Monica Rappaccini, the current lead scientist of the Advanced Idea Mechanics (or A.I.M. for short) for her latest plan. During his heist, the boy is accidentally exposed to the Pym Particles, causing him to permanently shrink to the size of an ant.

As a child, Tommy was doted on by his loving sister, Brianna, and initially volunteered to be the guinea pig for her experiments. As Tommy grew older, however, he realized that the side effects of Brianna's experiments have often humiliated him, thus making him cautious and distant from her. His cautious behavior has also turned hostile towards his brilliant sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Angela \"Mama Angie\" Bennett<br>\r\n<b>Age: </b>40 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Black<br>\r\n<b>Hair: </b>Black<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5' 10\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 182 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity: </b>White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory: </b>Angela Bennett is a lead stripper in the XXX Bombshells strip club in the red light district. A veteran stripper and dancer, she earned the moniker \"Mama\" after teaching and nurturing the younger dancers. Her thick assets, her D-cup breasts, and her luscious lips arouse her customers' fantasies. After her shifted ended at midnight, Angela would discover a certain baby boy, abandoned on the sidewalk, born the size of her thumb. She'd soon find another meaning to her stripper name \"Mama Angie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) The following is a list of simple rules that must be followed.<br>\r\nNo giant males<br>\r\nNo tiny females (but normal-sized women interacting with giantesses is encouraged)<br>\r\nNo gore<br>\r\nNo digestion (but possible reformation is encouraged)<br>\r\nNo scat or piss content (but full tour is encouraged)<br>\r\nNo sex<br>\r\nNo unbirth<br>\r\nNo futanari/hermaphrodites<br>\r\nNo killing the main characters (but possible reformation is encouraged)<br>\r\nThe maximum age for the boy characters must be 15 years or younger (if this is the case, make sure the lead character's age somehow regresses below 15 years).<br>\r\nThe minimum age for the girl characters must be 3 years or older (on that note, keep the interactions with young girl/loli characters 9 years or younger at a minimum)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Be sure to write in complete sentences, write with good grammar, and write each chapter in a minimum of three sentences. The only exception to this rule is if you are adding a chapter with multiple options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) Do not end the story unless you're intending to looping the storyline into a different, preexisting chapter canon to the story route (This guideline was inspired by the looping storylines by Kooplan's Fire Emblem SW where the chapters labeled with <b>(END)</b> links to another preexisting chapter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.)
