The procedure is either a test of that relative's shrinking device, or a test of a microscopic submarine designed to fly into other people's bodies. The boy might have also accidentally activated said shrinking device and burns out, leaving him permanently shrunken in his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExposure to Virus, Sickness, or Chemical: The boy is shrunk down by an unknown agent. Whether a virus, sickness, or chemical, the exposure leaves him and possibly other boys his age an inch tall. He will have no one to rely on but his female relatives or any woman working where he contracted the shrinking agent, including his school or the hospital he's staying at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysical Genetic Disorder: The boy is born with \"reversal pituitary glands\" which shrinks his physical body as he grows older, including his muscles, organs, and skeleton. The boy will be shrunken down to the minimal size of 1 centimeter, but his glands will also be triggered by early stages of puberty and arousal, which is bad since some of his female relatives are either flirtatious or revealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagical Spells: The boy is shrunken down by a magical spell. In one route, he is shrunken by a stage magician during one of her magic tricks and intends to keep him that way. In another route, the boy is the victim of an occult ritual overseen by his female relatives. In another route, he is cursed by a black magic gypsy that he accidentally angered. In another route, the boy finds a magic spellbook stashed away in his family's attic and read the Latin texts, shrinking him down.</span></div></div>",

As a child, Tommy was doted on by his loving sister, Brianna, and initially volunteered to be the guinea pig for her experiments. As Tommy grew older, however, he realized that the side effects of Brianna's experiments have often humiliated him, thus making him cautious and distant from her. His cautious behavior has also turned hostile towards his brilliant sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Brianna Winslow<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 16 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes: </b>Blue<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5' 6\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 132 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Brianna Winslow is the second daughter of Kelly Winslow, the younger sister of Lindsey, and the older sister of Tommy and Wendy. Born with a gifted intelligence, Brianna consistently performed a variety of scientific experiments which some believed were years ahead of our time. Brianna constantly babies Tommy for being adorable and has often used him as the perfect guinea pig for her experiments. Her latest work with shrinking technology could open new avenues for the evolution of medical science. Most of her scientific experiments happen in the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Kelly Winslow<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 42 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Light brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 6' 3\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 187 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Kelly Winslow is the mother of her daughters, Lindsey, Brianna, and Wendy, and her only son, Tommy. After a messy divorce following the discovery of her husband's cheating with his co-worker several years, Kelly acquired her children and the house and has long forgotten the incident. She loves and supports her children, but she is firm when it comes to the house rules. She works full-time at an office weekdays and returns home later in the afternoon, sometimes later on Friday evenings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Lindsey Winslow<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 21 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Light brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5' 9\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 172 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Lindsey Winslow is the eldest daughter of Kelly Winslow and the elder sister of Brianna, Tommy, and Wendy. As the eldest daughter, Lindsey sometimes takes command of the household while her mother is out working her catering business and is strict about the household rules. She goes to a nearby college where she's studying law practice and currently works part-time as a morning floor person at a pharamcy/convenience store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Wendy Winslow<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 9 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Curly brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 3' 8\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 105 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Wendy is the youngest daughter of Kelly Winslow  and the youngest sister of Lindsey, Brianna, and Tommy. The baby of the family, Wendy often pouts at the mention of being the little sister and often wishes to become bigger. Despite this, she loves her mom and her siblings dearly, especially Tommy since he often takes time out of his schedule to play with her. At her young age, Wendy is often curious and loves tiny creepy crawlies like ants, caterpillars, and spiders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b><br>\r\nBeing born the only boy in a household consisting of three sisters and a divorced mother is hard work for ten year-old Tommy Winslow. Being the little brother of a sixteen year-old sister with a high IQ and a genius scientific mindset is even harder work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was always the subject of his sister, Brianna 's scientific experiments ever since he was six years old. Initially, Tommy enjoyed being the guinea pig to test out Brianna\u2019s scientific prototypes that seemed like his own personal toys, like an artificially intelligent bed which spoke in their mother\u2019s simulated voice, or a bubble wand which was designed for him to blow any bubbles in different shapes, sizes, and dimensions, apart from their typical spherical shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grew older, however, Tommy noticed how annoying Brianna was with her constant babying towards him and how dangerous her experiments had become. Experiments, such as an invisibility cloaking device that turned Tommy and his clothes invisible and a tonic to help increase his mental capacity, ended up having embarrassing flukes. The cloaking device ended up shortening and Tommy was visible again, but the cloaking device also ended up turning his clothes permanently invisible. The tonic ended up turning his skin a variety of wavy rainbow colors with brightly colored polka dots. In both instances, Tommy was exposed in front of his peers and was consistently laughed at, thereby labeling him the class outcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that moment on, Tommy did all he could to avoid Brianna and her experiments. He often found protection in the form of his forty-three year-old mother, Kelly and his twenty-two year-old oldest sister, Lindsey, who forbade Brianna from further experimenting on him. Tommy\u2019s nine year-old sister, Wendy even promised to hate Brianna forever if she ever did something so mean to him again. Yet, despite Tommy\u2019s best efforts to avoid his scientifically-obsessed sister and Brianna\u2019s word that she wouldn\u2019t experiment on him without consent, she always found a way to get him to become the subject of her experiments. The last time she did, she slipped an orange powder inside Tommy\u2019s orange juice designed to give him super speed, and it ended up energizing his speed to the point where he had no control over it for twelve hours. Brianna received a well-deserved scolding and punishment, but she privately vowed never to give up on her pursuit of scientific knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time around, Brianna knew that she would make Tommy an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, after Tommy returned from school, he became vigilant of his surroundings, wary of her presence lingering around the house. As he stepped inside, he was suddenly tackled by a massive weight and crushed in Brianna\u2019s signature overbearing bear hug. \u201cWelcome home, little brother! Did you learn anything new and exciting today?\u201d she asked in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrianna! Let go of me!\u201d Tommy screamed as he tried to break free from his tormentor\u2019s grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooo, I don\u2019t wanna let you go! I wanna give you my signature big sister hugs n\u2019 kisses!\u201d Brianna nuzzled her cheek against Tommy\u2019s cheek and gave him a big, wet smooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEwww, get off of me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy broke his arms free and pushed his overbearing sister away from him. He then hopped on his toes and held his fists up like a sports boxer, straining the meanest look his facial muscles could produce, but that only made Brianna fawn over him even more. \u201cAwww, look at you. You\u2019re surrounded by girls who wanna kiss you and hug you, and you\u2019re pushing them away and acting like a big strong man.\u201d Brianna wiped a tear away and sniffled. \u201cMy little brother is becoming a man already. I\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave me alone, Brianna!\u201d Tommy shouted. \u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to do and it\u2019s not working! I\u2019m not letting you experiment on me again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, but testing my experiments has always been a fundamental part of our relationship,\u201d Brianna whined, \u201cand speaking of which, I have a new experiment that I\u2019ve been working on as a personal pet project.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo away, I don\u2019t wanna hear about it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Tommy, hear me out at least!\u201d Brianna begged the boy. \u201cIt\u2019s a revolutionary invention that\u2019ll solve the world\u2019s hunger project and possibly medical science! It\u2019s a shrinking radiation that I\u2019ve been perfecting the past couple of weeks that allows anyone exposed to the radiation to safely shrink to the size of the bug, and it\u2019s worked so far! I\u2019ve been able to shrink organic fruit, my laboratory rats, and any nonorganic object that doesn\u2019t hold any value, and nothing\u2019s gone wrong so far! I only need a test subject to realize its success and I instantly thought of you, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m not going to get shrunken for your stupid brain!\u201d Tommy screamed. \u201cWhy would I even want to test it out for you!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s for the upcoming science exposition,\u201d Brianna answered. \u201cPlus, if you promise to help me out on this project, I\u2019ll never bother you with my \u2018loving big sister act\u2019 again. I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer seemed shady, but the trade-off was just too tempting to pass up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Tommy\u2019s answer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Tommy reluctantly, but willingly volunteers with the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Tommy harshly rejects Brianna's offer, prompting her to forcibly drag him to her laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Tommy harshly rejects Brianna's offer, but Brianna sends him down to the laboratory to retrieve something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No!\" Tommy snapped, breaking away from Brianna's iron-tight embrace and staring her down with righteous fury in his eyes. \"I said I don't want to be part of your stupid experiments again, but you don't listen! I'm sick of being your guinea pig, and I'm sick of you treating me like a little kid! No one wants to be friends with me because of your stupid experiments making me look like an idiot, and I'm sick of it! Stay away from me, Brianna! I hate your experiments, and I hate you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Brianna looked physically hurt from her younger brother's rant, her heart broken, shattered, and stamped on. \"I... I can't believe you just said that, Tommy. How could you say that, after all that we've been through together?\" A tear ran down her cheek and her lips quivered from the internal hurt. All of a sudden, something snapped inside her, her quivering lips stretched and hardened into a growling frown, her brows furrowed deep. \"You know what!? Fine! I tried being nice to you, Tommy, but forget it! You've really crossed the line here, Tommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy figured that he had let his temper go too far this time, but he figured too late as suddenly, his wrist was clamped in a tight, feminine fist, prompting him to yelp and squirm in her grasp. \u201cOW! OW! OW! Brianna, what are you doing!? Let me go!\" Tommy screamed, even louder as Brianna squeezed his wrist tighter. \"Okay, okay, Brianna, I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna yanked Tommy closer to her, held him against her, and pressed her face into his to showcase her furious outrage towards him. \"Shut up and listen, you little brat! I've had it up to here with your recent attitude towards me and my experiments! We used to be closer when we were younger, but now you're avoiding me and I don't appreciate it as much as I appreciate your contempt towards me and my experiments! If you really hate me that much, then forget being the loving big sister you need! Starting right now, I'll be the worst sister you'll ever have! I'll put you through the worst time of your life and then you'll be sorry you ever talked to me the way you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Brianna did to prove her point was drag her little brother by the wrist, pulling him with so much force, it put him through physical agony. Tommy wriggled and squirmed in his sister's surprisingly strong grasp. There were tears leaking from his eyes as he tried to pry away her fingers tightly clamping his hand. \"Brianna, please, let me go!\" he begged and pleaded, which fell on deaf ears. \"I'm sorry, okay!? Please stop tugging me like that! You're... you're hurting me...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna kicked open the basement door and with her weaponized signature iron embrace, she hoisted the screaming, squirming ten year-old down the basement stairs. Tommy tried to kick her with his heels, but Brianna ignored those kicks, even as she threw him on the floor and dragged him further into the deeper area of her basement laboratory. The screaming and crying was eventually muffled by the insulation in the basement walls, so not even anyone who just arrived at the house could hear him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laboratory was like any typical science lab, with white, sterilized floors and walls, chemistry sets with the stereotypical chemistry kit and distilleries, and scientific inventions that were years ahead of anyone else at Brianna's current teen years. Up ahead in a particular area was a special cylindrical chamber, outfitted on the inside with radiation-emitting lights, and a metallic bed with the leather straps on the railings. This was Brianna's latest experiment, and what better way of testing it now than using it to punish her defiant little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angered genius sister punched in a keycode, and the doors opened. Then she forced Tommy into the chamber, threw him onto the floor, and quickly hit the button to close the doors just as Tommy quickly recovered and bolted towards the closing door. \"Brianna! Open this door!\" Tommy shrieked, crying and slamming the thick glass with his palms desperately. \"Please, Brianna, I'm sorry! I'll be a better brother, I promise! I'll take back everything I said, I'll volunteer as a guinea pig for your experiments, I'll do anything you want me to do! I promise I'll do whatever it is you want! Anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of her entering a code within the keypad, Brianna suddenly stopped and turned to her poor, desperate brother with a deep loathing glare. \"Really? You'll do anything I want? Even if what I want is disgusting, deplorable, and degrading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... yes, I'll do anything you want me to do! Please!\" Tommy's face spread with a na\u00efve grin, hoping that his negotiations would set him free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then here's the first thing I want you to do...\" Brianna pushed a red button, and the chamber whirred to life. \"...start screaming, and try not to move around too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's panic rose as the chamber's whirring grew louder and the radiation-emitting lights in the walls and under his feet flickered on. He could already fell the heat and the electricity running through his body, along with a new sense of fear. Suddenly, he found himself pounding the glass even harder and screaming even louder. \"BRIANNA, OPEN THIS DOOR!\" Tommy screamed bloody murder. \"BRIANNA! LET ME OUT! HELP! MOMMY! WENDY! LINDSEY! SOMEONE HELP ME! DON'T LET BRIANNA DO THIS TO MEEEEEeeeeeee....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's pleas for help was drowned out as the machine's whirring reached their full volume, and then came a sudden blinding, flickering flash from within the glass. Then the chamber's mechanisms calmed down as the lights within flickered off, their function complete. Thick clouds of steam and smoke built up from within the chamber, obscuring Brianna's view of her test results. She immediately recalled, Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, a famous thought experiment and paradox where a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive sources and a flask of poison. The experiment dictated that the cat would be simultaneously dead and alive, but after opening the lid of the box, the cat would either be dead or alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna didn't know if Tommy was dead, alive, or already felt the effects of her chamber inside. The most critical moment of this experiment came down to the push of the button. Brianna pushed the button and opened the chamber and released all the pent-up steam inside, either quickly dissipating or being ventilated to the outside via the ventilation system. Brianna stuck her head in, carefully observed the interior of the chamber, and found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Tommy had shrunken to the size of a grain of rice.<br>\r\n2.) Tommy became a human/fly hybrid after a young housefly flew inside the chamber with him.<br>\r\n3.) Tommy hasn't felt the effects of the scientific chamber (but will steadily shrink throughout the afternoon).<br>\r\n4.) Tommy hasn't felt the effects of the scientific chamber (but will steadily shrink throughout the night).</span></div></div>",

The boy will be found on the doorstep by a normal-sized woman living there, so she takes him in and adopts him. The woman who adopts him is a single mother with two daughters, so he will become the brother the two girls always wanted.

The boy will be found in a box with a note telling whoever finds him to give him a good home. The female character who finds him is either a cougar-aged stripper recently off the clock, an immigrant police officer on midnight patrol, a runaway teenager looking for a safe place to sleep, a party girl returning home from celebrating her night out with her friends, or a drug addict looking for their next rush. Despite their questionable positions and the neighborhood they live in, one of these ladies will take the boy in as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn All-Girls Orphanage: The tiny boy is dropped off at the Sunshine Smile Orphanage for Girls, an orphanage which only accommodates girls. Although, in recent years, the orphanage has accommodated another tiny boy who was sent there by Social Services because they felt a mixed orphanage or an all-boys orphanage would be considered dangerous for his tiny size.

Despite this, the following maternal figures will never give him up unless they had no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b><br>\r\nIt was just after midnight, when there were hardly anyone roaming the city streets after dark, except for the streetwalkers, the partygoers, and seedy individuals lurking in the shadows like predatory nocturnal animals. In one particular street at around this time, a suspicious vehicle pulled up to the side of the street, stopping near the opening to an alleyway with the squeak of the breaks. A dark figure stepped out of the car and carefully placed a small box big enough to fit a coffee mug near the opening of the alleyway, right before returning to the vehicle and beating a hasty retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the vehicle's tires squealed away into the distance, violating the city's speeding law in the process, the sound of a baby's cries echoed through the streets. It turned out that the contents in this box was a little baby boy the size of a female adult's thumb. The boy slept in a bed of cotton, a scrap of a soft silk blanket, and a little beanbag for a pillow. Taped on the outside of the box was a folded letter which read: <i>\u201cThis is Benny. He was born this way. Please give to a good home.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular street was seldom active at midnight, save for certain individuals who would pass by this street and discover the small box, containing a tiny-born baby who would grow up to grow curly black hair and a curious personality, but abandoned by his birth parents who abandoned him not long after his arrival on planet Earth. The only question is, who on this street will discover little Benny at this time of night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Angela \"Mama Angie\" Bennett: A veteran stripper at the XXX Bombshells Club who recently clocked out of her shift.<br>\r\n2.) Police Officer Carmen Diaz: A Hispanic police officer patrolling the streets during her midnight shift.<br>\r\n3.) Elizabeth Harper: A runaway in her late teens who was sleeping in the alleyway.<br>\r\n4.) Rachel Addison: A drunk party girl who was returning to her apartment after a night out clubbing.<br>\r\n5.)

After her shifted ended at midnight, Angela would discover a certain baby boy, abandoned on the sidewalk, born the size of her thumb. She'd soon find another meaning to her stripper name \"Mama Angie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Sayori Tanaka<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 67 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Brown<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b> Black<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5' 5\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 169 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> Asian/Japanese<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Sayori Tanaka is an elderly Japanese immigrant who moved with her family to the United States from the Kanto region of Japan in the late 1960's/early 1970's. Ms. Tanaka lived a difficult life in the poorer backstreets of the city and being the target of discrimination, but she became happy later with her husband and her daughter until he passed away from a fatal heart attack. Since then, Ms. Tanaka's become cold, bitter, and often hostile towards her tenants... that is until she inevitably discovers Angela Bennett's adopted tiny-born son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b><br>\r\nIt was around midnight when Angela walked back home after a long night. Her D cup-sized breasts and her assets large enough to fit inside a large salad bowl jiggled with every click of her black heels. Her bulging belly stretched her lingerie to her buttons. Her great, pink lips parted as her mouth opened wide to let out a roaring yawn. She flipped her dark, pitch-black hair over her shoulder, the bangs cut across where her eyebrows should have been. It was a hell of a night, Angela figured, and she made plenty of money for a pole dance and a few lap dances. Those rolls of cash in her purse was evident enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela was a stripper who worked at the XXX Bombshells Strip Club in the back streets of the city. She had a reputation for living up to the strip club\u2019s name because she was an absolute bombshell of a woman for her age and figure. At the same time, she also had a reputation for being welcoming, motherly, and arousing. She was pretty much the great leader of the other girls in the club even though her manager was the one calling the shots. If there was one thing that any girl wanting to strip off their clothes and dance around the pole would want, it was to be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angela turned down the street to her apartment at the far end, she passed by the alleyways when she heard a baby's wailing. She stopped and tracked the noise where it came from, case in point, inside a little box. She spotted the note taped to the outside of the box, unfolded it, and read the letter. A sick feeling ran through her gut as she carefully uncovered the box and gasped. There she saw the little baby, laying in a makeshift bed, crying and reaching his tiny little hands up to the opening of the box. Angela felt her heart break from the mere sight alone; who could've abandoned such a beautiful baby in a dangerous place like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou poor baby, come here,\u201d Angela cooed as she gently scooped up the box and cupped it to her breasts. She gently shushed the baby, rocking the box back and forth and bobbing in place to soothe Benny's crying. If there was one true perk to her nickname \"Mama Angie\" aside from her being the maternal figure to her younger strippers at the club, it was how she used a soothing, sultry voice to melt the customer's nerves and feel like putty in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere there, it\u2019s okay, little one. There\u2019s no reason to be afraid,\u201d Angela continued to soother the distressed baby. \"Mama Angie's here. Mama Angie will take care of you. She won't let anything bad happen to you, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby eventually stopped crying. Benny opened up one eye, and the first thing he saw was the gigantic face of a mature giantess smiling down on him the same way a mother would her child. The baby's instincts immediately imprinted itself onto the mature stripper, seeing her as his new mother unlike his biological mother who callously dropped him off in this dark place. He burbled and giggled, reaching his stubby hands towards the giantess. Angela responded by dipping her giant finger into the box, close enough for Benny to grasp both hands on the ridged edge of her finger alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling tired and fatigued after being left by his real mommy and being acquainted with his new mommy, Benny yawned and fell into a warm sleep. Angela's heart melted to see the baby sleep happily in the box, but she was also worried about where she was and where she found him. \u201cPoor baby, he shouldn\u2019t even be here,\u201d Angela told herself as she gently closed the box. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get you out of here, Benny. Whoever put you here obviously hasn\u2019t realized we\u2019re next to a bad neighborhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the box under her other arm, Angela quickly hugged the box against the top of her breasts and quickly strode down the street and away from the alleyways, the movement of her footsteps and the rocking of her D-cup boobs rocking the baby deeper into slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the end of the street, to a slightly run-down apartment building, occupied only by her and her cranky older landlady of Asian descent. She unlocked the front door and carefully walked in, hoping that her landlady, Ms. Tanaka was totally fixated on her international soap operas and nothing else. As she closed the door behind her, what happened next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Angela returned to her apartment without incident.<br>\r\n2.) Angela encounters Ms. Tanaka, her strict and cranky landlady.</span></div></div>",

At the age of six, Olivia perished in an accident, leaving the orphaned Oliver to be taken by Social Services to an orphanage that accommodated girls under the impression that he would receive motherly and/or sisterly love there.

When Social Services notified her about the arrival of the tiny Oliver Martin, Valerie was genuinely surprised, but she was nonetheless willing to accommodate the orphaned tiny. Valerie is as loving as a mother and as firm as a father who dutifully has the girls learn to routinely do their chores and doles out fair punishment for any misdemeanor. She takes especially good care not to let any of the girls take Oliver during Adoption Day, despite how close he is to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver Martin was the only boy to stay at the Sunshine Smile Orphanage for Girls, an all-girls orphanage, mostly due to his three-inch height. Social Services thought this would be a better recourse on account of how wild the boys orphanages were and feared for his safety. For the first couple of months he was sent there, Oliver felt out of place, despite how friendly he was with the girls residing at the orphanage. Often times, he'd become so friendly, the girls would try to sneak him out, but Valerie, the head caretaker would catch them before they'd take him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery quarter year, the orphanage hosts an Adoption Day, where the girls are adopted by a single parent or a couple, and then they would be taken away to a new, better life. Poor little Oliver was left alone, having nobody considering adopting him. All he wanted was a family, someone to love him like how Olivia, his late mother did before the car accident claimed her life. Every day, he prayed for a new mother, a big sister, heck, even a grandmother who would love him, comfort him, raise him into a better child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever Oliver felt down, the head caretaker, Valerie, always comforted him and did her best to soothe his troubled soul. She'd gently clutch his tiny body to gently embrace him in her pudgy fingers, massage his back with her thumb. She would then indulge him by allowing him to sleep on her fat belly or in between her massive breasts. Despite everything she did to comfort him, she could never replace the hole his mother left behind in his heart. Even so, she was happy to see Oliver getting along with the girls, except for when they'd take things too far by displaying their power over his tiny size. She would protect him like any mother would, and that was a fact the girls had to learn on the first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of these routes will follow each of these characters?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The storm also sent out strange electromagnetic pulses, which activated the boy's meta-gene, shrinking him down to the size of one-inch right before the lightning struck the plane. The lightning also struck the window of his seat, sucking the boy out into the sea as the plane crashed down into the sea.

Born tiny because of his parents' continued exposure to the radiation of STAR Labs technology and the fumes of the experimental chemicals, the boy made the national headlines for his abnormal size. The STAR Labs scientists hired a nanny to watch over the boy, not knowing that the nanny in question was an infamous villainess who kidnapped him in his sleep and raised him.

During spring break, the Walker family decided they were going to fly from their hometown in Florida to Italy for the week. Unfortunately, their flight path takes them through the Bermuda Triangle, an area infamous for the disappearances of different airplanes and ships, and is protected by a mystical lightning storm. This lightning storm will not only change Timmy's fate, but also his small size as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main Story:</b><br>\r\nThe Walker family was ready to board the flight to their overseas destination to Italy. Michelle Walker, the matriarch of the Walker family, was taking her husband and her three sons to Italy for their spring break. Michelle and her husband was excited to explore the beautiful Italian countryside to see the beautiful sights and tourist attractions. The older two brothers were excited to explore the pretty girls of Italy and vainly attempt to swoon them with their fake Italian accents. Eight year-old Timmy, the youngest member of the family, was excited to try out the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy was the youngest and the most energetic member of his family, having a strong penchant for food at his age. Where Where China had been the country to invent noodles, Italy was the place where they perfected it into all kinds of pastas, pizzas, and soups, and Timmy couldn't wait to try them all out. Their flight path went from Florida to an international airport in Italy, directly over the Atlantic Ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they would find over a certain area was certain doom, because the flight paths went over the Bermuda Tringle, an area off the coast of Florida where strong electromagnetic fields conjured up strong lightning storms and made any magnetic instrument go haywire. The worst part were the mysterious disappearances of different ships and aircrafts reported over the years. Then again, in recent years, those reports of disappearing transports diminished, and the dangers of the Bermuda Triangle were mostly forgotten and scrubbed away. No one could ever predict what would happen to Flight 407 to Italy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened two hours after the airplane took off the runway. The flight was relatively peaceful, people conversing with each other, kids squirming in their seats or preoccupied with their handheld game consoles. In Timmy's case, he was the only kid on the plane playing his Nintendo 3DS, sitting in the window seat while his mother and father took the middle and aisle seats respectively. He was totally engrossed in his game, and the only things that would normally snap him out of his reverie were refreshments, a bathroom break, a movie, and when his DS's battery ran out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway through this ill-fated flight, a strong pounding sensation, a consistent shuddering, and flickering lights snapped Timmy out of it, scaring him and all the other passengers onboard. Timmy turned to the window and saw nothing but dark clouds and the strobing flashes of lightning. Suddenly, he felt his body tingle all over, like every muscle in his body fell asleep and was accompanied with the prickly nerve sensation. He whimpered as he quickly diminished in his seat, he and his clothes shrinking in his seat, loosening the seatbelt. Michelle gasped at the sight of her son shrinking before her eyes... and Timmy could only look up to his now-giant mother for salvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a bolt of lightning struck his window, shattering it and causing the air pressure to get sucked out and everything else small enough to fit along with it. Timmy screamed as he tried to hold on to his seatbelt. Before Michelle could reach him, Timmy's grip on the leather slipped and he was sucked into the open air, falling miles above the Atlantic just as another lightning bolt struck the plane's engines. The plane went down with one of the engines blazing like an apocalyptic fireball, crashing into the ocean the same time Timmy merely plunked into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy quickly surfaced into the turbulent ocean waters and watched helplessly as the plane sunk into the ocean, taking everyone inside with it. Timmy cried for his mommy just as a wave dragged him under the surface, pulling him down with the pressure. Between his tiny size and the ocean's heavy pressure, all Timmy could do was try to swim back up to the surface, but he was too weak against everything else. His struggles led to physical soreness, then to mental fatigue, and then finally, loss of consciousness. Before he blacked out, he vaguely saw giant feminine shapes in the water swimming towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do not fear child. It is not your time, yet,</i> a soothing motherly voice gently spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Timmy knew, he was hacking up saltwater from his lungs. After he hacked up the last of the seawater, Timmy looked around and saw only a beach, but appearing more gigantic to his shrunken size. He stood up in the sand, feeling the sand's grit stronger grit against his feet, and looked out into the ocean. He stared out into the vast ocean waters underneath the bright, blue, and partly cloudy skies and fell into a fetal position. Then everything came crashing down on him as he began to cry, wailing for the death of his family, for the death of his mommy, and for the traumatic event he was forced to endure. He was alone and stranded on this island, and he could never get his family back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the noise of someone striding the sands, accompanied by the slight tremors with each stride. Timmy broke away from his mourning and turned to the direction of the sound. The person (or people) approaching his area was a giant woman by his size! This giantess was none other than...</span></div></div>",

On Paradise Island, there was hardly any corruption or war, but Diana felt there was something for her outside the forbidden mystic barriers surrounding the island with never ending storm clouds. She could feel it stirring deep within her very essence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat feeling came to light when she spotted what looked like a giant metal bird crashing into the oceans far off the shores of Themyscira. It fell like any bird would fall when pierced with an arrow mid-air, except one of its wings was burning alight Icarus's wings before the blazing sun. It fell into Poseidon's wrathful waters with a mighty splash. Her mother, Queen Hippolyta, would often tell Diana of tales when she returned to Man's World to aid in a bloody worldwide war, and one of those tales was of giant metal birds transporting anyone within its belly into the air and across the waters of the world. Diana couldn't help but bow her head and say a little prayer to the gods to deliver their souls into peace while their bodies were fed to the guarding megalodons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Diana witnessed the bird being slowly claimed by the sea, her peripheral vision caught something unusual crawling from the crashing waters on the shores. Gifted with the eyes of Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt and the Moon, Diana squinted her eyes and got a better look. On the shores was the tiny shape of a person laying in the sands in the position of a baby's fetus. The person was small... perhaps it was a child? From what she could see based on the child's shuddering, he was crying. Perhaps the small child was the only survivor of the metal bird\u2019s demise, and traversed through Poseidon\u2019s waters only to wash up on the shores of Themyscira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat Hera. He's all alone,\u201d Diana whispered as she quickly strode over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Timmy had wept, he picked up the hearing of someone striding the sands, accompanied by the slight tremors with each stride. Timmy broke away from his mourning and turned to the direction of the sound. The person approaching his area was a giant woman by his size! This giantess was a beautiful woman with creamy skin, and hair as black as night pulled into a single braided ponytail. She wore a leather breastplate and metal bracelets on her wrists reaching just below her forearms. Around her waist, she wore a belt with a scabbard sheathed with a sword, holding up a short beige skirt, and knee-high leather gladiator sandals worn on her immaculate feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy watched the giantess approach his location. He saw her eyes meeting his tiny stature, he saw how she towered over him, and he began to panic. He quickly got up on his feet and ran as fast as his aching muscles could take him, screaming all the way. <i>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of me,\u201d</i> Diana deduced as she began to pursue him, her strides quickly making up ground. \u201cLittle one, wait! Do not be afraid! I have not come to harm you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the tiny panicking boy wouldn\u2019t listen. Driven by his flight response, Timmy ran as fast as his tiny legs would let him. The booming vibrations of the giantess\u2019s feet behind him began to grow bigger and more powerful as she quickly caught up with him. Then all of a sudden, a sandaled foot crashed at his heel, creating a shocking tremor that knocked him off his feet and land face-first into the sand. Before he could quickly recover, a pair of giant ivory hands gently scooped him up along with a handful of sand beneath him and lifted him up to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy whimpered and scrambled as the sand beneath him drained from the cracks between the cracks of the giantess\u2019s palms and fingers. Past the waist, the belly, and the breasts, Timmy was lifted to the giantess\u2019s beautiful face. Her blue eyes stared down on him like a goddess, judging his every action leading up to now. Timmy felt the fear overwhelm him and he began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t hurt me! I don\u2019t wanna die!\u201d Timmy begged, which made the giantess pout pitifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, little one, I\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d Diana assured as she gently brought her other hand to comfort the boy. Timmy whimpered and curled in her palm, preparing for the inevitable moment when she might crush him. Instead, he felt the giantess\u2019s fingers gently stroke him on the back, the same way his mother used to when he needed her comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is okay, little one. There is no need to cry, I would never harm a child,\u201d Diana cooed, gently stroking the tiny child\u2019s back. She could feel him shivering like he was cold from the water, except he was shuddering out of fear. \u201cMy name is Diana. I am the princess of the Amazons of Themyscira, to which you have washed upon its shores. What is your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy sniffed and choked, wiping his wet nose with his arm. \u201cM-M-My name is T-T-Timmy, M-Miss Giant. Timmy W-Walker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you, Timmy. And please, call me Diana,\u201d the giantess said softly and gently the same way her mother used to talk to her when she was his age. \u201cTimmy, I know this may be painful for you to talk about, but were you one of the people who survived the demise of that giant metal bird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giant... metal bird...?\" Timmy turned to the oceans, and he knew what the giantess, Diana referred to. \"Yes. My family and I were... were flying all the way from Florida to Italy for a family vacation. W-We were flying, and then we flew into the storm, and then... and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories of that traumatic even came flooding back in flashes, the mental images of his miniaturization and what happened afterwards making him cry harder. \u201cTh-th-the plane started rumbling, and I somehow got smaller and smaller! Then the light hit my window and I got sucked out of the plane! Then when I was fuh-fuh-falling, th-the plane was hit by the lightning again, and it went down into the ocean! I tried to swim, but I was pulled down underwater and... and...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy remembered what he saw next, the images of the plane crashing into the ocean with a flaming wing as clear as crystal, taking his family with him into the depths of Davy Jones' Locker. The shrunken boy screamed and wailed at the fates of his family, and fell into the soft comfort of Diana's palm. \"Oh, Timmy, I am so sorry for your loss and for your predicament,\u201d Diana consoled the boy, \"but do not worry, young one, because you are not alone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I am alone!\u201d Timmy wailed. \u201cI lost my mommy! I lost my brothers! I don\u2019t have a family anymore! I\u2019ll never get to see them again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana gently shushed the boy as she clenched her fist gently and held him close to her chest. With her thumb, she gently ruffled his hair, massaging his scalp as he released his inner turmoil into her bosom. Such a cruel fate for a child, Diana figures, to be shrunken down by the same mystical barrier used to protect this island and to lose his family all at once. This boy was small enough to be stepped on or eaten like a little morsel. He needed guidance, and he needed a mother. Unfortunately, Aphrodite's Law dictated that no man should set foot on this island, and this son of Man's World was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she thought of something on the spot, but it was going to be risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Diana takes him back to her secret hiding area in the grotto.<br>\r\n2.) Diana takes him to her mother, Queen Hippolyta, for guidance.</span></div></div>",

For many millennia, Hippolyta has watched over Paradise Island, risen from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean by the Greek gods and protected with a powerful ward from any outside forces. She was the one who crafted her daughter, Diana, from a clay baby and brought to life by the blessings of the gods. She was the one who taught her most of life's most valuable lessons, but was reluctant to teach her the arts of fighting and war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was until the male soldier, Steven Rockwell Trevor, crashed his aircraft on the shores of Themyscira, and then everything changed. The man was to be escorted back into Man's World, and only the winner of the fated tournament she arranged would be the one to do it. Against her mother's wishes, Diana won the tournament and was tasked with the burden to take Steve back into Man's World where they revered her as the iconic heroine she is today. This memory was sparked as Hippolyta witnessed the fiery crash of Flight 407 within the perimeter of the powerful storm wards. Dressed in her finest fuchsia robes, Hippolyta quickly raced to the shores and watched the carrier plane sink into Poseidon's cruel waters, and dipped her head in prayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O Hades, god of the underworld, please allow Charon to ferry the poor souls aboard that flying vessel across the River Styx, and let them be at peace within the heavenly fields of Elysium,\" Hippolyta whispered, a tear shed for each man, woman, and even child aboard the crashed flight. It didn't take much to know that no one could have survived that crash, nor could they avoid the jaws of the megalodons guarding the waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Hippolyta spent a moment of silence for those who suffered an unfortunate fate, she heard a sniffle... a whimper of a youth. It was very faint, almost like the squeaking of a mouse. She followed her ears to that sound and beheld a saddened sight. It appeared to a child, curled up into a fetal position, grieving for whoever he lost in that vessel. The voice alone confirmed that the child was the son of Man's World. Curiously and surprisingly, the boy was as small as a little seashell! Hippolyta knew the fear of his shrunken size also factored in his weeping. She needed to do something, and she needed to be quick about it, for not only were the beasts of the island would be large enough to gobble him up and the Amazons to accidentally crush him where they stepped, but he was violating Aprohidte's Law upon her people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting her staff down, Hippolyta quickly strode towards the shrunken boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Timmy had wept, he picked up the hearing of someone striding the sands, accompanied by the slight tremors with each stride. Timmy broke away from his mourning and turned to the direction of the sound. The person approaching his area was a giant woman by his size! This giantess was a beautiful woman with creamy skin, and hair as black as night curled like campfire smoke, some of the longer strands curled up in a ponytail. She wore fuchsia robes which bore the size and flow of a theater curtain, and was adorned in a gold belt, and old accessories on her ears and around her neck. Gladiator sandal-clad feet poked from underneath the robes, headed right for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy's panic and flight instincts took over as he screamed and ran away from the approaching giantess. \"Wait! Little one, wait!\" the giantess implored the young shrinkee. \"Do not be afraid, little one! I am not trying to harm you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the tiny panicking boy wouldn\u2019t listen. Driven by his flight response, Timmy ran as fast as his tiny legs would let him. The booming vibrations of the giantess\u2019s feet behind him began to grow bigger and more powerful as she quickly caught up with him. Then all of a sudden, a shadow loomed over him as the giantess's left sandaled foot stepped over his tiny frame, landing a ways ahead of him with a boom, enveloping him in fuchsia shadow. On his right, the giantess's right foot stopped shortly ahead of him. Timmy screamed as he was trapped in the shadow underneath the giantess, unable to see, unable to find his way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo additional quakes rocked him from within the darkness. Then a doorway in the darkness lifted into light, and a giant feminine hand adorned in a metallic bracelet reached in, quickly curling a set of five fingers around his tiny frame. Timmy's panic upgraded into hysterics as the giantess held him in her fist and brought him out into the light, lifting him up to her worried face. Hippolyta frowned at the sight of the panicking tiny boy in her palm, stricken by Phobos and overwhelmed with grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Miss Giant, don't hurt me!\" Timmy begged, curling up his body and turning to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, child, be at peace. I do not have the desire to harm the son of Man's World, even if he is quite small,\" Hippolyta gently assured the boy. She gently pet her fingers against Timmy's body, who flinched at the touch at first, but settled under it. \"You were aboard the vessel, were you not, child? You were somehow shrunken in the process and ended up on the shores of Themyscira. The fates have not been so kind to you, child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled into his sleeve, and sat up in the middle of Hippolyta's giant palm. He built enough courage to stare into the giant queen's eyes, who looked down on him with pity and sympathy. \"It is alright, child. I promise no harm will come to you on Themyscira,\" Hippolyta gently assured, using the same assuring voice she used when Diana was the boy's age. \"I am Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons and of this island you were washed upon. Can you tell me where you are from and how you came to be this way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy nodded, whimpering. \u201cT-Timmy, your majesty. T-Timmy Walker,\u201d the bite-sized boy answered. \"I-I was flying with my family over the ocean to Italy when... when... when a scary storm hit the plane! I don\u2019t know what happened, but I shrunk to this size and I was sucked out of the plane! I fell into the water and I tried to swim but I was so tired, I couldn\u2019t swim anymore! Then I woke up on the beach all alone and... and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy couldn\u2019t hold back the urge to cry as he buried his face in his hands. \u201cThey\u2019re gone! They\u2019re gone and I can never see them again! I\u2019ll never see my big brothers again! I\u2019ll never see my daddy again! I\u2019ll never see my mommy again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Timmy wept in the queen\u2019s hand, keeling over letting tears flow from his eyes, Hippolyta couldn\u2019t help but feel heartbroken for the poor boy. With her other hand, she gently stroked Timmy\u2019s back, cradling him in her gentle grasp. \u201cI am sorry, little one. This is a fate you did not deserve to suffer from. I can never imagine the pain of your loss and the terror of being so small compared to the rest of the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled and choked. \u201cI miss them so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, young one. Your grief speaks of it in volumes,\" Hippolyta answered. She could only watch as the boy poured out his devastations in the palm of her hand, feeling as if he needed someone else in his life, someone who needed a mother more than anything else in the world. \"Timmy, I know this may sound so sudden now, but your presence here on this island goes against our rules stating that no men is to enter these shores. Even though you are a child, Timmy, you are still a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy continued to weep, his head drooped down in sorrow. A giant gentle index finger lifted his chin and met with Hippolyta's gentle eyes. \"But there is still a way for me to bypass this law,\" the gentle giantess said softly. \"If any man is willing to remain on this island, then the man must be bound to an Amazon in servitude. The man will serve the Amazon well, but in accordance to Aphrodite's Law, we must also provide them food, shelter, and comfort in the name of love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what does that mean?\" Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means, child, that since you have no family to turn to on Themyscira, you will be living here with me,\" Hippolyta clarified. \"You will have to do what I ask of you in exchange for food and a place to live, but I am sure they will be simple for you, given your current size. I cannot in good conscience ask of you got me to replace the mother you lost, but all I ask is you let me take care of you, nurture you, and encourage your journey to growing into a man. Do you accept this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled, wiping his wet nose again, and nodding his head. \"Mm-hmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Now hold out your fists to me.\" Timmy held out his fists, just as the queen ordered him to. \"Turn them over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy overturned his arms, showing the underside of his fists. Hippolyta gently laid her gigantic hand over Timmy's arms, and suddenly, her bracelet glowed as a little drop of light trickled onto his wrists. The light wrapped around the wrists and faded, giving Timmy a pair of metal bracelets just like the giantess said. \"Now you are bound to me, young Timmy Walker. As long as you are bound to me, no harm may come of you, nor shall any Amazon attempt to break it. When you are in distress, these bracelets will glow, indicating you are in trouble. In exchange, you will need to do as you are told, but the tasks I will assign you will accommodate your youth and size. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, your majesty,\" Timmy stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" Hippolyta nodded. \"Come, let us retire. You must be weary from your struggles and you must rest. Allow me to carry you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Hippolyta reached dress, and gently inserted Timmy into her cleavage. After securing him in her breasts, the Queen of the Amazons took her staff and marched towards the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Timmy and Hippolyta reaches the palace without incident and they retire for the afternoon.<br>\r\n2.) Timmy and Hippolyta reaches the city, but Timmy slips out of her cleavage and lands somewhere in the streets.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Queen Hippolyta marched through the city, her newly-appointed young charge hidden between her breasts. Timmy's face burned bright red as his new giant caretaker strolled through the ivory streets of the Themysciran city, embarrassed by the fact he was restrained between his adopted mother's breasts which bobbed and bounced with each new taken step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was obscured behind the hem of Hippolyta's fuchsia gown, keeping him hidden from the eyes of the Amazon Queen's fellow sisters. Hippolyta knew they'd frown upon the idea of allowing a man to stay on Paradise Island, no matter how young he was, and they would frown deeper upon learning that their queen had bound him to her service. Hippolyta would have to explain it later once she reached the palace, feeling the tiny bulk of his frame held in her cleavage, keeping him tightly close to her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the hem of the gown, Timmy peeked and observed the city filled with women, all of them around his late mother's age. They were all dressed in similar robes, gowns, and togas, and every one of them engaged in their mundane routine and minding their business. He was quite surprised to see how the women stopped and revered at the sight of their Queen passing them, exclaiming their courteous greetings to her, and the Queen herself returned those courtesies with a smile and a nod. A few Amazons approached her like a good friend and asked her for her review on botanical arrangements, hunting, fishing, and the arts. Each time, Hippolyta gently replied she would review their questions for another time and excused herself to retire for the afternoon. With every step she took, Hippolyta's breasts bounced, rocking the tiny Timmy between them to Morpheus's slumbering bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta reached her castle and ascended her stairs, guarded at the bottom and the top by her finest soldiers. As soon as she strolled inside the entrance, she was greeted by two of her most trusted soldiers and friends: Phillipus, a dark-skinned Amazon and general of the Amazonian army, and Artemis, the fierce red-haired warrior of the Amazons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen,\" the two Amazons bowed to Hippolyta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sisters,\" Hippolyta addressed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything to report to the high council regarding the flying vessel beyond our shores?\" Phillipus inquired, to which the Queen sadly shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nay, Phillipus, the aircraft has been struck down by the protective wards and has been claimed by the sea,\" Hippolyta said regretfully. \"To my knowledge, no one would have survived this horrific accident... no one, save for this...\" Hippolyta reached into her chest, gently pinched the tiny carrier in her cleavage up, and brought a curled fist to her most trusted allies. She uncurled her fingers, and in the center of the palm laid the miniscule figure of Timmy Walker, curled up as he slept some of his physical exhaustion off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen, what is this?\" Artemis asked, clearly surprised by the revelation along with Phillipus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the son of Man's World who only survived because of the protective ward's effect on him,\" Hippolyta explained. \"I do not know exactly what has become of his family who was aboard the craft or how he bypassed the megalodons, but young Timmy Walker here has been shrunken to his current size, washed up on the shores of Themyscira alone, and is in dire need of a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen, Aphrodite's Law clearly states that no man is to set foot on the island, even one so young such as him!\" the ebony Amazon pointed out. \"To allow any man on the island is to defy the will of the gods! He cannot be allowed to longer, you know this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, Phillipus, and your concern is duly noted,\" Hippolyta replied, \"however, there is another part of the law to which you have also forgotten. Should any man wish to remain on this island, they would be bound to serve an Amazon. Though he is quite young, the boy has no one else to turn to, and I have already establish his bond of servitude to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillipus and Artemis looked closer, and they saw the same metal bracelets the Amazons were bound to on his wrists as well. \"The boy is now bound to his servitude to me, which means his life belongs to me as well,\" Hippolyta continued. \"He may be a man, but he is still a child, and it is the Amazon's nature to encourage the growth of children and to protect them out of love, much like how we raised Diana into the finest warrior in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, my Queen...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is enough, Phillipus,\u201d Hippolyta interjected, raising her hand. \u201cI have made my decision. I will be in my chambers to accommodate the boy to my chambers. The trauma he has endured today has drained him of his energy, so I will allow him to rest until the morning when his service to me officially starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motions and the noise were enough to stir Timmy awake in his spot within the giant queen's palm. He rubbed his eyes, heaved a mighty, and sat up in the middle of the warm, leathery platform. He fluttered his eyes open, and was immediately frightened by the sight of two giant fierce-looking women beyond his caretaker's semi-truck-sized fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" Timmy screamed, curling up instinctively. \"Please don't hurt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be at peace, child, they will not harm you,\" Hippolyta gently cooed, daintily rubbing Timmy's shuddering frame with her free fingers. The fearful shaking eventually stopped under the giantess's gentle strokes, and Timmy felt compelled to crawl to the edge of her fingers and get a better look at the women who scared him. \"These are my most loyal soldiers and sisters, Phillipus and Artemis. Do not let the way they look at you frighten you, young Timmy; you will come to see they have a tender heart beneath their fierce demeanor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That remains to be seen,\" Artemis grumbled, giving Timmy a slight glare, which made him hide behind the queen's monolithic fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen, I only hope you know what you are doing with this child,\" Phillipus asked, fearful of the gods' wrath that would be inflicted upon the island, and concerned for the well-being of her Queen and her decision. \"The boy must prove his worth of being under our personal charge. If he cannot prove himself, then by the laws bestowed onto us, we would have to force him off the island by way of the sea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, Phillipus,\" Hippolyta confirmed, stroking Timmy's back gently like a baby bird, \"but you mustn't fear, because we will show him the ways of the Amazon and encourage him to follow on the righteous path, and I will count on you and Artemis to help discipline him should he falter in his tasks.\" Hippolyta brought her forehead against Phillipus's forehead and looked into each other's eyes intimately. \"Please trust me, Phillipus, when I say there is no worse fate for this orphaned child than to send him back to Man's World alone at his current size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do trust you, my Queen,\" Phillipus said with a low volume, \"but I pray that the boy does not end up like all the other men who have failed in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we will make it an effort to make sure it never happens. You and Artemis are dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bow, the two giantesses turned and exited the palace, leaving Hippolyta and Timmy alone as they were headed for the Queen's chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lady with the red hair scares me,\" Timmy said meekly, making a Hippolyta chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is natural that she is intimidating. After all, she\u2019s the fiercest warrior among us now,\u201d she said, gently stroking her new charge\u2019s back as she entered the chambers and placed him on the nightstand. \"Now, Timmy, I want you to understand that what you heard between me and Phillipus is the truth. I cannot guarantee all of the tasks will be easy given your youth, stature, and inexperience, but every task is to help the betterment of your maturity. If you want to stay among the Amazons, you must complete these tasks and you will earn your place among the Amazons, even as a persona servant or pet. Do you understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" Timmy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Hippolyta retrieved a birdcage, clean and stainless, and stuffed it with a two sacks of fluff, one resembling a pillow and another resembling a mattress, and a tiny scrap of a weighted cloth. \"Now, my young charge, this is where you will be sleeping from now on. You may rest here and allow your weariness to pass until tonight's feast. I will personally introduce you to the Amazon high council and address your bondage to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy groaned, not just tiredly but also worriedly. \"What if they don't like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will have mixed feelings about your arrival, for certain,\" Hippolyta answered, \"but they will come to love you in their own time. I cannot force the Amazons to love my children simply because they are the children of their Queen. It is up to them to decide whether they will accept you as one of our own or not.. and I do hope, dear child, they do not reject you simply for being the son of Man's World.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, my young charge, is a story for a different time.\" Hippolyta opened the cage door, tilted her palm so Timmy would step off into the interior, and reached inside to gently tuck him in for his afternoon slumber. \"Now get some rest, young one. If there is anything you need, I won't be far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Timmy finished it with a cute yawn as he allowed the giantess to tuck him into his new bed. It wasn't like his bed back home, but it was certainly more comfortable. Hippolyta closed the door and watched as her new adopted son slept, smiling at how peaceful he looked despite the nightmares he had lived through. She laid down on her bed and looked out the window to the sea, cursing the wards surrounding the offshores of Themiscyra for putting the young child through so much pain. Her eyes fluttered to sleep, allowing Morpheus to take her into the world of dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Timmy and Hippolyta wake up for dinner with the Amazon high council.<br>\r\n2.) Someone sneaks into the chambers and kidnaps Timmy while he and Hippolyta sleep!</span></div></div>",

This particular legion, led by the Amazon's general, Phillipus, and their strongest warrior, Artemis of Bana-Mighdall, was ordered by Queen Hippolyta herself to patrol the shores in lieu of a recent event happening just a mile away from their shores within the mystic barriers. Their main priority was to search the perimeter of the island for any survivors who could possibly have bypassed the guarding megalodons and made it to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs per Aphrodite's Law, men were not allowed to set foot on the village, and this extended to male children as well, except for certain men who were permitted to enter the island by the Queen herself. Nonetheless, since Aphrodite's Law also governs the Amazons' lives through love, then they must accommodate them in their own fashion. The men would be taken to recover in the dungeons, while the women would recover in an Amazon's home. This was how it was on Paradise Island, and it was the soldiers' job to enforce this law unless the Queen has granted an exception under certain conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Timmy had wept, he picked up the hearing of someone striding the sands, accompanied by the slight tremors with each stride. Timmy broke away from his mourning and turned to the direction of the sound. The people were a group of armored giant women, all of them dressed in leather breastplates and metal bracelets on their wrists reaching just below her forearms. Around their waists, they all wore a belt with a scabbard sheathed with a sword, holding up a short beige skirt, and knee-high leather gladiator sandals worn on their feet. They were also armed, holding a large spear in one hand, a shield in the other, and a vigilant look on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy almost whimpered as the lead soldier, a giant black woman, marched towards his location. Her sandaled foot raised in the air to take another step, completely unaware that the tiny little boy was underneath its leather sole. The boy whimpered, curled up into a tight little ball, and cried right as the dark-skinned giantess planted her foot on top of its spot. Timmy tensed up, like he was expecting that moment when he would be squashed under the giant's foot like a little bug, but opened his eyes to face a set of five giant chocolate-colored toes inches away from his face. His eyes turned upwards towards the colossal figure of the woman who nearly squished him, looking and pointing out at the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, as the Queen said it would be,\" the ebony giantess leading the giant troop of female soldiers said, literally and figuratively pointing at the black smoke in the distant horizon. \"The aircraft has crashed a mile away from the shores, meaning there is a chance that a survivor may have swam to these shores along this side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a waste of our time,\u201d addressed the redheaded giantess, Artemis of the Bana-Mighdall. \u201cI have seen footages of airplanes in different parts of Man's World crashing before, and no one survives a crash like this. Even if someone did, there is no way they would make it to these shores without invoking the megalodon's hungry wrath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leading armored black woman and turned to the impatient Amazon. \u201cBe still your tongue and your impatience, Artemis,\u201d General Phillipus ordered firmly. \u201cOur orders are to bring in any survivor who has made it to these shores. Remember, there are men in this world who have survived greater disasters, including those who have crashed into our waters in similar crafts. Who is to say that anyone could have survived that disaster and has gone unnoticed by our megalodons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis scoffed. \"If it is so, then why do we not see any bodies in the water, or tracks leading from the waters and onto the shores?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no clear explanation for that yet, Artemis,\" Phillipus affirmed, turning towards her sister-in-arms. Unbeknownst to her, however, the simple act of shuffling her feet to face the redheaded warrior nearly caused her to step on Timmy at her feet down below. \"However, our bickering is only ensuring a step away from discovering any survivors, which goes against the Queen's orders. So unless you have anything else to add, I suggest we continue along the shoreline and search the areas between here and the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the legion of armored giantesses argued amongst themselves, Timmy watched and listened to it all down at their toes. He didn\u2019t understand what the giantesses would do to him if they ever found him, but it frightened him as much as the Brobdingnagian size difference between them did. His close call with the black giantess's foot nearly ground him into a little bloody smear in the sand. If that was only because they weren't aware of his presence at their feet, then he dreaded to think of what would happen to him if they were aware. They could easily stamp on him, press him underneath their rear ends, or even swallow him whole! Timmy shuddered at the thought, but he shook it away and quickly thought of what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Timmy runs and hides from the giant Amazon soldiers in fear for their potentially harmful treatment.<br>\r\n2.) Timmy screams, jumps, and waves at the giantesses to grab their attention. Maybe they could help him!<br>\r\n3.) Timmy grabs one of the giantess's sandals by the straps and hitches a dangerous ride at their feet.<br>\r\n4.) Before Timmy could do anything, one of the Amazons spots him at their feet.<br>\r\n5.) Before Timmy could do anything, the Amazons march away, leaving Timmy alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shortpack's mutant genes were passed down to his son, instantly shrinking him to the size of a #2 pencil eraser, small enough that only Jean Grey noticed his presence in Mystique's womb. After he was born, he was placed into the care Mystique's lover, Irene Adler/Destiny. The boy is often visited by his mother and her female X-Men friends until he was old enough to join attend Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSizing the Fourth Wall: The boy is a real world Marvel Comics teen fanatic who\u2019s into most of the female characters but doesn\u2019t like certain female characters such as the plus-sized heroine Big Bertha, or the fourth wall-breaking heroine, Gwenpool. Due to her ability to break the fourth wall, Gwenpool heard about the boy dissing her, so she grabs the boy and literally throws him into a comic panel where he appears tinier than the female characters he ogles. Either that or he is normal-sized and Gwen manipulates the comic\u2019s perspectives so that the female characters appear as literal giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Problem with Pym Particles: In this route, well introduce a few story routes involving Pym Particles, the experimental subatomic particles which could alter the size and mass of objects or other living beings. In one route, a bullying brother is give his comeuppance by his little sister who enlists the help of the Wasp. In the second route, a young street thief steals a container full of Pym Particles but is permanently shrunk. In the third route, one of Marvel\u2019s terrorist organizations uses the Pym Particles to not only drastically alter the size of the female populace to become bigger than the male populace, but also their personalities so they have a sense of dominance over the male characters.</span></div></div>",

One day, the brother takes the bullying too far, and in desperation, the sister sends a written letter addressed to Janet, asking her and Nadia to deal with her problem. After an arrangement with the bullying brother's female family members, the boy is shrunken down by a malfunctioning Pym Disk and is taught a lesson in humility, either through the Wasp, their friends, or his female family members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pym Particle Plunderer: The boy steals a container of Pym Particles with the promise of payment by Monica Rappaccini, the current lead scientist of the Advanced Idea Mechanics (or A.I.M. for short) for her latest plan. During his heist, the boy is accidentally exposed to the Pym Particles, causing him to permanently shrink to the size of an ant. He is either caught and at the mercy of the giant female members of the Avengers (such as Wasp, She-Hulk, and Tigra), or he escapes but is sought by the giant villainesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pym Particle Plague: Monica Rappaccini successfully acquires the Pym Particles from the boy in the second route and genetically modifies it with the Mandrill\u2019s mind-controlling pheromones so that it will affect the entire female population of Earth, including the heroes and villains. The male populace will shrink or the female heroes and villains will grow into giants. Either way, the females affected will establish a sense of dominance over the male populace. Follow a boy as he tries to survive the outbreak of the modified Pym Particles plague on the world.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Re-written with permission by cosmicdonut a.k.a. ButterBazooka, the original author.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a young boy, who is either shrunken by various circumstances, born tiny, or born normal-sized, all cases surrounded by giantesses of every kind. As either an original character from all different reaches of visual media, you either explore the route as a small boy as he goes through his life with giantesses involved in his life, or you explore the route as the giantess who interacts with said small boys. The giantesses can be either playful, maternal, oblivious, or cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are free to add anything to the storyline, so long as you follow these guidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GUIDELINES:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) At the beginning of the story routes, when you're introducing an original character to your story route, make sure you add in this short bio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:<br>\r\nAge:<br>\r\nEyes:<br>\r\nHair:<br>\r\nHeight:<br>\r\nWeight:<br>\r\nEthnicity:<br>\r\nBackstory:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FOR EXAMPLE:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Tommy Winslow<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b> 10 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Green<br>\r\n<b>Hair: </b>Brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 3' 9\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight: </b>116 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity:</b> White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory:</b> Tommy Winslow is the only son of Kelly Winslow, the younger brother of Lindsey and Brianna, and the older brother of Wendy. As a child, Tommy was doted on by his loving sister, Brianna, and initially volunteered to be the guinea pig for her experiments. As Tommy grew older, however, he realized that the side effects of Brianna's experiments have often humiliated him, thus making him cautious and distant from her. His cautious behavior has also turned hostile towards his brilliant sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name:</b> Angela \"Mama Angie\" Bennett<br>\r\n<b>Age: </b>40 years old<br>\r\n<b>Eyes:</b> Black<br>\r\n<b>Hair: </b>Black<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5' 10\"<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 182 lbs.<br>\r\n<b>Ethnicity: </b>White/Caucasian<br>\r\n<b>Backstory: </b>Angela Bennett is a lead stripper in the XXX Bombshells strip club in the red light district. A veteran stripper and dancer, she earned the moniker \"Mama\" after teaching and nurturing the younger dancers. Her thick assets, her D-cup breasts, and her luscious lips arouse her customers' fantasies. After her shifted ended at midnight, Angela would discover a certain baby boy, abandoned on the sidewalk, born the size of her thumb. She'd soon find another meaning to her stripper name \"Mama Angie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) The following is a list of simple rules that must be followed.<br>\r\nNo giant males<br>\r\nNo tiny females (but normal-sized women interacting with giantesses is encouraged)<br>\r\nNo gore<br>\r\nNo digestion (but possible reformation is encouraged)<br>\r\nNo scat or piss content (but full tour is encouraged)<br>\r\nNo sex<br>\r\nNo unbirth<br>\r\nNo futanari/hermaphrodites<br>\r\nNo killing the main characters<br>\r\nThe maximum age for the boy characters must be 15 years or younger (if this is the case, make sure the lead character's age somehow regresses below 15 years).<br>\r\nThe minimum age for the girl characters must be 3 years or older (on that note, keep the interactions with young girl/loli characters 9 years or younger at a minimum)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Be sure to write in complete sentences, write with good grammar, and write each chapter in a minimum of three sentences. The only exception to this rule is if you are adding a chapter with multiple options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) Do not end the story unless you're intending to looping the storyline into a different, preexisting chapter canon to the story route (This guideline was inspired by the looping storylines by Kooplan's Fire Emblem SW where the chapters labeled with <b>(END)</b> links to another preexisting chapter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) Above all else, have fun!!!</td>",
