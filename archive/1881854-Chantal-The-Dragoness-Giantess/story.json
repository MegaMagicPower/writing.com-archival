She had just graduated from high school with top grades in science. She was waiting for the manager of the factory for her first day. She was sitting nervously in the waiting room when the secretary called her name. \"Chantal!\" \"Oh, here.\" \"The manager will see you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal got up and walked into the other room to see an unattractive looking man wearing an eyepatch. \"Hello Chantal, and welcome to White Oak.\" Chantal smiles and shakes hands with the manager. \"Thank you Mr. Winters.\" Winters smiles at Chantal. \"Come with me. So, how are you when it comes with chemicals.\" \"I know my way around the beaker,\" says Chantal with a laugh. \"But I don't know why you asked if I could create a formula to create a dragon.\" Chantal takes out a strange beaker with a fuming liquid even though the bottle is still corked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinters then opens a door and Chantal sees a strange and horrific sight. There were all sorts of giant tubes with huge monsters inside, like a futuristic plastic zoo. \"Oh my!\" Winters gives an evil look. \"This is where our true work begins.\" \"What?\" \"The future. This is how wars will be won. Our company is creating giant monsters to confront the enemy. Let me show you a few of our finest creations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal shivers as she is unaware of what she is in for. The first tube contains a giant wasp with two stingers that was frantically trying to break out. \"This hear is Death Jacket, the ultimate in air assault weapons.\" The wasp buzzes angrily and Chantal lets out a scream. \"Don't worry Chantal. He can't get you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next tube Winters showed Chantal contained a giant blob like creature that looked like it was made of snow. It formed into a humanoid shape as it let out a muffled growl. \"This is Frostblite, designed to camouflage with the snow for arctic assaults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third tube was a giant fish tank that housed a giant fangtooth fish that looked like it had wings and four legs. Winters snaps his fingers as a cow into the tank. The cow moos loudly and tries to swim away only to be messily devoured as Chantal covers her eyes. \"Fishlizard is one fish that's dangerous both in land and in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal begins to sweat and even bite her nails as she sees the next monster. This monster was a giant white grasshopper with psychotic eyes that set itself on fire as it let out a hiss. Chantal screams as Winters puts his hands on his shoulder. \"Don't be afraid of Blasthopper. He's actually a real sweetie when you get past that fire of his and now to show you my favorite beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one was the most terrifying. It was a giant humanoid toad creature with a the face and breasts of a human girl with long black hair. This creature had sticky yellow green sacks of goos sprouting from all over her body like warts. She had an angry look in her eyes at Winters.  She even shoots her tongue at him and Chantal by the glass protects them as Chantal lets out a scream. \"Meet Amphiba. Unlike the rest of these beasts, this beauty used to be human. We needed a creature with a brain.\" \"Laugh now Winters,\" says Amphiba. \"You can't hold us forever.\" Chantal bites her nails as Winters takes her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mr. Winters, is this even humane.\" Winters lets out a scoff. \"Think about it Chantal. \"These monsters are the one line between our world and destruction. Can you imagine how quickly these monsters could end a war.\" Chantal gives a concerned look and even takes out her dragon formula. \"I'm starting to regret making this.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the alarm goes off. \"What's going on?\" asks Winters. \"Mr. Winters!\" yells a worker. \"One of the monsters got loose!\" \"What? Which one?\" Chantal twitches and then there's a loud noise and everyone turns to see that the escapee is...</span></div></div>",

To make matters worse, Frostblithe's ice freezes the holding tanks making them brittle enough for his fellow monsters to break free and exit out of the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" yells Winters in shock. \"What's happening? Frostblithe is still mutating? He's not ready to.\" Frostblithe then pounds his snowy fists on the ground as he lets out another muffled scream.

Ah!\" Frostblithe steps on Winters, absorbing him and trapping him inside of his snowy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Frostblithe swings his arms up and down, Chantal begins to twitch. \"Oh no.\" She says.

She then grows huge leathery wings like that of a gargoyle, a huge tail, clawed fingers and toes and spikes all over her back. Her lab coat and pants are destroy but she keeps the bikini underneath as she begins to expand. Soon, Chantal is 200ft tall. She looks around and sees her reflection in a giant piece of ice as she screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at her new form and lets out a scared roar. \"What happened? What have I become? I, I'm a dragon.\" Frostblithe then shrieks and runs at Chantal but Chantal screams and flaps her wings, pushing back her foe and making him shed some of his snow. But Frostblithe doesn't quit and shoots an icy wind. Chantal screams and inadvertently fires a stream of flames from her mouth that blow away the wind and strike Frostblithe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrostblithe screams and begins to melt. In the process Winters is freed from his icy prison as he lets out a grunt and hits the ground. Winters gets up and looks in awe at Chantal who is coughing and holding her neck from what she had just done. \"Success,\" said Winters. \"Chantal. \"Your dragon formula was a success.\" \"You mean you wanted me to do this to myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to talk!

Not only does his body fully regenerate, but it begins to change. \"What's going on?!\" yells Chantal. \"Oh no.\" Says Winters. \"He's mutating again.\" Frostblithe then transforms into a new form. His snowy body turns into solid jagged ice and his hands turn into frozen claws. Chantal lets out a scream as Frostblithe lets out a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrostblithe then shoots an ice beam and Chantal jumps back as her elbow is partially frozen. Chantal begins to whimper and step back. Frostblithe shoots an icicle stream and Chantal ducks to evade the spikes, but one of them hits Winters through the abdomen as he yells loudly. \"Mr. Winters!\" yells Chantal. \"Ah!\" Frostblithe then swings his claws and strikes Chantal. Chantal lets out a roar and swings one of her own claws to scratch at Frostblithe's icy body before swinging her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Frostblithe grabs the tail and pulls Chantal forward. But Chantal swings her large butt in Frostblithe's face before punching him and driving a hole through his chest. However, Frostblithe survives and shoots an icicle stream at Chantal forcing her to use her wings as a shield. The stream keeps coming and Chantal can barely hold back the ice.

As Frostblithe tries to deliver the final blow Chantal inhales and shoots a stream of flames from her mouth that completely engulfs the ice giant and makes him deliver a final muffled scream as he dissolves into water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Frostblithe has completely melted, Chantal spews flames at the water and burns it into vapor, finishing Frostblithe off once and for all. Chantal gives a sigh and then she hears moaning and turns to Winters. \"Mr. Winters!\" Winters groans with the ice spike impaling him and Chantal removes the ice. \"Don't worry Mr. Winters. You'll be alright soon.\" Winters lets out a cough. \"Who are you kidding Chantal. I'm finished. And since I was the head of this facility, I kinda deserve it. Frostblithe has been destroyed, but there are 99 more monsters out there as big as you and they're angry and hungry. You were right. Use the dragon formula. Destroy all monsters. Maybe they'll get to chew me up in the fire... in the fire...\" With that, Winters passes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Chantal burns Winters's body to cinders with her breath, she is met with by the army. One muscular man with white hair in a buzz cut and metal bolts on the side of his face is the one who speaks with her. \"Are you the Chantal woman the company president told us about?\" he asks. Chantal shutters and nods her head. The general gives a stern look. \"I am General Gustav Gribble. To be honest, I was against this project. Giant monsters, such as the one you are now, would only make things worse and from the looks of it, I was right.\" Chantal lets out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But be that as it may, we need you more than ever. Our armies cannot handle the 99 monsters that have been unleashed into the world. We need you Chantal.\" Chantal lets out a groan. \"I was only applying for a factory job. Now I have to fight giant monster. Oh alright. I'm in.\" \"Good girl. Now these monsters have already spread over the world. We'll built a machine to detect them and have identified all 99 of them.

There we have detected a horrible monster that is devouring the populous of Miami. Snallygator, a large alligator with a slight mouth and giant hard scales. This creature has no conscience, but it has more teeth than all alligators in the world combined. Be very careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind, Chantal nods her head and continues to fly off. Meanwhile, at Miami beach, there are surfers and sailors oblivious to the monster nearby. As everyone goes into shore, one surfer takes his board and continues to ride a giant wave, big enough to envelop the entire beach. Little does this fool know that this tsunami is unnatural. As he laughs it up, Snallygator strikes and snaps him in his enormous jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone screams at the sight, for Snallygator's mouth extended beyond his head into his body, with his eyes below his lower jaw and huge crystal shards covering his back. There is mass panic and everyone runs to shore in pure fear. But Snallygator is still hungry and snaps his jaws as he comes forward to the beach, eating boats that still remain in the water.

The skyscraper tottered at a wild angle, but it was as safe as anywhere else. 'Not very.' Below, clouds of ash blew in enormous waves past heaps of slag and incinerated brick. The city appeared to have literally melted into the ground. Cars were dull grey bumps vaguely reminiscent of trilobites. The mightiest skyscrapers were in various stages of destruction, from piles of bricks to only missing a few chunks of wall. Sometimes Scott would sit in shadowed alcoves and remember his city as it used to be. These memories could last for hours, and coming back to the real world was always so much harder each time. He had a gun in his grey backpack, strapped on over grey clothes covering his ashen skin. Even his eyes seemed to have turned grey. In Scott's world, color would often lead to death. The gun, however, was not for him. It wouldn't help if she came for him, but his fellow men were another story. But he had reasons other than self-pity for being up here today. It wouldn't do to linger in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The old skyscrapers almost never had good food or water in them, but scavenging for silver and other metals here had never left him without coin. This was the third building he'd been to today, and had a good store of stuff gathered up. His client had asked for a nice set of silver and some ornate candles, and Scott had managed to deliver this time. The silver didn't match and the wax in the candles had turned to dust as he'd touched it, but most people would be happy to have them. Scott figured he could head home now. A distant roar hastened his steps down the stairs. His thoughts drifted to home as he went down the dusty stairs on autopilot. A year ago it had been a decent apartments not too far from this building. Now it was a dank room off an abandoned subway station. Scott had gotten a desk and a chair as well as a bed. A small potted plant and a UV light marked him as a successful scavenger. Most days he wasn't too bitter. But when he was, he had a nice strong bottle of something he'd grabbed off an airdrop before that became suicide. When that ran out, he didn't know what he'd do. Maybe he'd finally use his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The next roar was much closer, and Scott came back to reality. He rapidly descended two more floors, and remembered the staircase he was on was blocked off five floors from the lobby. Cursing silently, he found an exit door. The floor beyond was the sad corpse of some office. Faded cubicles and chairs, blackened walls, and shattered windows formed this silent tomb. Scott stepped forward slowly, making sure to keep something between himself and the windows. He didn't think Chantal was nearby, but too many had paid for that mistake for him to be so careless. And this time caution paid off. He caught the sound of flapping leathery wings just in time to throw himself flat. Many had wondered how a 200 foot dragon was so silent. Those same people usually didn't live long enough afterwards to get answers. But seconds later a huge form began to circle the building. Scott almost began to panic, but calmed himself before he did something stupid. She often checked these buildings for stray people. But he was well camoflagued, and far enough from the windows to be detectable. Nonetheless, when he heard her land on his side of the building and felt the place shake as massive claws sunk into the concrete and metal his heart almost stopped. He heard her menacing breathing, a slow and heavy sound. Almost more disturbing were the faint giggles moments later. A particularly strong gust of breath swept throug, and blew down a large portion of the cubicle walls. The one he sheltered behind blew away in a cloud of dust. Scott laid perfectly still. He was as gaunt as any of the skeletons or blackened corpses laying in the office. She would leave in a second. And just as he had predicted, she took wing a moment later. Breathing a sigh of relief, Scott waited twenty minutes before moving on to the eastern stairwell. He made it back to the lobby without further incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You find anything this time?\" Larry asked. Scott and Larry had worked together since the beginning, bringing necessary items down to the tunnels and communicating with those still braving the surface world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yup, got what we came for. Now let's get the Hell out of here my friend,\" Scott said, grinning. \"Where we're you when she...?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     \"In the bathrooms. I don't go anywhere with windows anymore. Not since Jeff...\" Jeff had been the third member of their group, and his wife Cindy the fourth. Both had been unfortunately close to a window when the dragon came gliding by. Thankfully the fires had been hot enough to kill them quickly, and she hadn't taken them with her as she did some of her prey. After this solemn moment the pair gathered up anything else they had left. \"By the way, Saul got dragged off to go pay some gambling debt while manning the basement door. Locked from the inside, we'll have to go down a manhole instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Dammit, why did you give him door? Why did you take him on at all? He's a lazy deadbeat. He couldn't carry a box down a hallway right,\" Scott fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Cousin's son, and we were as close as siblings. Don't know why they raised him that way but, there we have it. I'll talk to him when we get back,\" Larry replied, pulling a map from his pocket and looking it over. \"We could walk over to Main Street and get back in twenty minutes. Then tomorrow we'll go out and give this guy his stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"No, she could still be here. We'll go down the one right outside. One more hour walk, but I like being alive.\" That ended their conversation. The pair walked out into the streets after scanning in all directions for signs of Chantal. The manhole cover was ten feet from the door. Scott ran out and slid over a melted pile of Volkswagen and rolled up to it. He had always been a bit of a show off. Larry followed, striding forward confidently. In a few seconds the cover was moved. They tossed their packs down first, and grinned at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"After you!\" Scott said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n      \"No, no, please. I insist.\" Larry replied, all smiles. Scott stepped forward and put his foot on the first rung of the ladder down. Then a winged shadow blotted out the sun. His veins turned to ice, and he looked back up at Larry. The other man smiled weakly. \"Guess this is it then. Next time, we go to Main Street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Then the dragon landed. It was an earthshaking event, and knocked Larry to the ground. Scott stood paralyzed. As a human, Chantal had been beautiful. She still was, in a strange, scaly sort of way. She stared at the two from halfway down the block. On all fours she lumbered forward. Scales began to drop off, revealing normal skin beneath. By the time she had returned to \"human\" form, she stood on two legs at two hundred feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I wondered when you two would get careless. I won't say I won't enjoy eating you two more than most others. You're just too good at what you do most times. But monologuing is the downfall of many villains,\" Chantal said as if Larry and Scott were old friends. \"And I am most certaintly a villain.\" With a predatory grin befitting her carnivorous nature she grabbed Larry and showed him a row of pointy teeth before dropping him in. Scott mourned his friend as he watched her chew him to a pulp. It was not a quick thing, and Scott wished for his gun. It wouldn't kill her, but it would have done for him and Larry. \"And now your turn my little friend!\" Scales reformed over her skin, and the dragon chuckled as she bathed the manhole in deadly fire. Scott screamed louder than Larry as the heat washed over him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chantal had made her home in the charred ruins of the city's one major mall. It was the only building large enough to fit her large form comfortably. In addition, it was also the only place that had enough extra rooms to contain the items she'd hoarded during her time as a dragoness. Apparently stories of dragon's hoards were true. As soon as she'd stopped growing and found herself covered in scales, Chantal found a sudden urge to find gold and put it in safe piles. Seeing as gold was not as prolific in her town as it had been in these stories, she had resorted to hoarding other things. There were rooms of airdrops, rooms of large caliber weapons, rooms filled with military vehicles, and her trophy room. When she had just started terrorizing the city, Chantal had been able to feast all day, and almost every night got to face another dragon hunter. Most didn't know what they were doing and died in seconds. The ones who have her a challenge got to have their weapons and skeletons stored in a hollowed out OfficeMart, forever reclining in office chair thrones. But that had stopped soon enough once people realized she was nigh on impossible to kill. Now they hid in sewers and tunnels like rats, and Chantal was lucky to find two or three a day. She was very happy today, she had finally killed two of her greatest enemies. The pair had stood in defiance of her, mocking her power by coming into her realm every day and returning to the underworld alive. And with a bit of professional respect, Chantal had to admit they were good at what they did. But her job was much easier, and she was better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Chantal's victory made today a special day. She would do something different today. Something to celebrate. She turned her head to look into the shadows behind her. And there huddled three shapes, today's retinue of slaves. She had found out early on that a dozen or so slaves helped keep her stockpiles in order. They could do things she couldn't at her size, including...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Bring me two from the pit. Today is special my slaves, and I wish to celebrate!\" The dragoness purred sweetly, smoke curling from between pointy teeth. Most times she stayed in her dragon form. She found it slightly more amusing than merely being herself at 200 feet. With bowed heads, the slaves shuffled off. They returned a few minutes later with two of the captives she had kept in the basements. On slow days she would bring one up for her amusement. Today she had three. \"Have you really fallen so far as to forget how to count? This is three, I asked for two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said today was special, so we thought you would enjoy-\" Chantal charred him to a cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think, it will never end well,\" she said, laying back against a wall. These three slaves had been reliable for quite a while. It was a little disappointing to have to dispose of them over something so foolish. She skewered another on a long claw, and brough him still kicking up to her mouth. She closed her mouth around her finger and pulled the wounded man off her finger with her teeth before swallowing him whole. The last one simply got the sole of her foot. She was already disgusted by the three standing in front of her. They had gotten her favorite slaves killed. She burned them to ashes to remove them from her sight. This whole city had come to make her sick. She knew what had to happen next. Already, three more slaves lurked in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring down the rest, I want everyone assembled in here right now. It is time for a meeting.\" Ten minutes later, her entire contingent of slaves stood before her. \"From here on out, I will no longer be residing here,\" Chantal informed them. They took it in silence, as they took everything. At first a few had struggled and raged, but painful and public ends had made the survivors silent as tombs. It got very boring sometimes. \"Seeing as you cannot fly with me, I release you from my service,\" the giantess concluded. A few looked at each other hopefully. But different people have different definitions of release. That afternoon Chantal feasted. As she finished the last one, who had crawled into a corner and tried to ward her off with an upraised hand, she thought she ought to have fed them better. They were a little too stringy for her taste. But now feeling content, Chantal spread her wings and flew skywards. Watching the city grow smaller beneath her still brought on a rush, even after all this time. There was nothing about her new body quite as fascinating as flying. Being able to swallow men whole, crushing cars beneath her feet, bathing crowds in fire, these were all exciting and fun. But just flying beat them all. She was incredibly agile in the air despite her size, and the mutation had further enhanced her lightning fast reflexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA different thrill filled her chest now though. She was moving on from the city of bones onto a new one, full to brimming with life and vitality. It would be like it was in the beginning again. She had decided on a specific type of city this time. A few minutes of flying brought her to the coast. Chantal angled downwards and folded her wings against her scaly back. Far below, her target didn't even suspect her presence. All she had to do was open her mouth. She hit the canoe like a bolt of lightning. The occupants had no idea she was there until the jaws closed around them, and by then it was too late. Chantal floated along the seabed, content to feel the insignificant struggles in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at the immense depths she now swam at, Chantal was not cold. She burned with an inner heat that made her skin hot to the touch, even when she was human. And she could turn it up if she wanted. It had taken a while to discover, but now she had it down pat. For now, she was fine with just not freezing. She let her tail stretch out behind her, and folded her limbs as tightly against her body as possible. She knew there were dragons who could live in the water, so why not make the most versatile dragon possible? She moved through the seas like a sea snake. Chantal swam and swam, gills emerging on her neck to help her breathe. As soon as she had access to air they would disappear. She swam for hours before detecting the presence of humanity. One moment, the water was pure and clear. The next, it seemed slightly tinged by something foul. Chantal slowed down, and peered through the water to locate land. Altering her course slightly, she moved forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn shore, the city went about its usual business. Shipping came and went, people worked at their various jobs, and its streets teemed with traffic. Occasional news could still be heard of the Other City, the one claimed by a tyrannical dragon. But for the most part that was side news after so long. The dragoness had made no further moves, and was not presenting any threat to these people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today, something was going on out in the harbor. The waters had started steaming and bubbling, like something was making it boil. Along nearby beaches people left the water as it got too hot to be comfortable. One particular spot seemed to pop and fizz most fearsomely, and drew all the attention. The churned violently. Then, they slowed and stopped. Everything became unnaturally still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, the surface of the bay erupted. A column of water almost two hundred feet tall spurted into the air, then cascaded down. The falling waters revealed a massive titan, steam rising from her red scales. Two large wings unfolded from her back, and a tail whipped back and forth restlessly. She began to walk forward, towards the docks. Boats scrambled to get out of her way. One small dinghy just barely missed her foot, only to have her tail smash it under the waves a moment later. A large container ship stood between Chantal and the harbor wall. A scaly, clawed foot rose from the water and slammed down in the middle, sending huge containers and crew flying. The ship began to sink as the giantess walked through the wreck to clamber out onto dry land. Her tail grabbed up a fleeing sailor and crushed him, dropping the red mass onto the deck. She knocked aside a crane standing in her way, and stood still for a moment. Rivulets of water still ran down her hair, forming small streams coursing down her angellic face and onto her chest. They ran down along her perfect breasts, covered by scales, and into her cleavage. The water poured onto the ground below. Looking at the panic beneath her feet, Chantal laughed. She leaned back and roared, gouts of fire rocketing into the sky. She had found her new home.</span></div></div>",

Any second now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of the city panicked as she kept up the assult and ran for the one place they could escape the flames: the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal laughed, fear and panic was always the easy way to a meal.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chantal drank in the wonderful scene before her. The city would have been the world's largest playground, if the entire world wasn't already her playground. She almost didn't know where to start. The dragon part of her demanded she find a lair, some place to begin hoarding gold and other precious metals. On the other claw, nothing was more welcoming than a huge dinner for a new guest. Perhaps she would see that she received all the hospitality she was due? Shaking her head, Chantal decided they didn't need to do that right now. And an ominous lair could wait. She wanted to make herself right at home. She allowed some of the scales to fall away, revealing her enormous breasts barely restrained by her swimsuit. Her beautiful legs slowly bared themselves as the red scales fell off in a wave, and soon she was completely human aside from a few scales around her temples and hairline. She decided to keep her tail and wings for now, they would be very amusing. The giantess deemed herself ready and set off into the heart of the city. For a moment she didn't make and overtly violent actions, she just took gigantic strides through downtown. If a few people were too slow to move out of the way, then that was their problem. Two steps took her from the docksides and into the trench of skyscrapers. She gazed into the windows at face level. The various workers gathered around them to stare at her. She remembered how the inhabitants of her original city had been curious at first. A small smile tugged at her lips, and wisps of smoke escaped. That had ended fairly quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal's moment of peace was broken as something *pinged* off the scales bordering her forehead. Her good mood evaporated in a second. Why did some dumbass always try and shoot her? Not a civillian rifle was made that could touch her, and even the military had a hard time getting stuff that could. Nonetheless the dragoness found it annoying. She twirled around angrily, looking for the shooter. Her tail lashed back and forth launching cars and people, and smashing into the crowded windows. Chantal didn't care, she just wanted to fool shooting her. Thankfully he was stupid enough to shoot her again. She saw the flash from the roof of a skyscraper a few blocks away. Her strides got longer and jerkier as her temper flared. As she walked through one intersection her legs tangled around some metal construct, and she found herself plummeting forward. She cried out for a second before hitting the ground. People who had been slowly drifting out of the way suddenly broke into hyper speed, but it was still too slow. The giantess's soft human flesh came down, but the weight behind it was enough to smash man and machine flat. Now she was really angry. Her scales returned involuntarily, and small flickers of flames came out of her nose with every breath. Normally the people didn't start to use snares for a couple of days. Was it really going to be this hard right from the start? But when she looked backs she saw she had merely walked into the train lines. One was currently split in half by her legs. Chantal clawed her way up, gouging holes in the sides of the buildings and spilling their occupants out into the air. Her tail grabbed the rear cars of the train and thrashed them around violently. When it deemed it suitably destroyed she went after the other half. This one Chantal actually paid attention to, and brought it before her face. The three cars were ensnared in the coils of her red tail. She could make out tiny figures clinging onto the seats as the cars were moved around. Chantal bathed them in fire, and didn't let up until molten steel dripped through her tail. Then she turned her attention back to the gunman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still hadn't moved, which angered her even more. A few more shots bounced off her armored skin before she was directly beneath his building. It was taller than she was, so she sunk her hands into the side and began to climb. Her wings began to flap madly, taking the brunt of her weight. The man saw her begin to climb and moved away from the edge. Chantal pulled herself a little higher and sunk a foot into the side of the structure. Soon the glass shattered from her body temperature and fell away in deadly showers. Some of the closer gawkers received severe burns and papers spontaneously combusted. The dragoness paused and took a deep breath, calming herself. She didn't want to incinerate the man before she punished him. That would be too easy. When burning people ceased throwing themselves out into space Chantal placed one hand a little higher and pulled herself eye-level with the roof. The man was initially nowhere to be found, so Chantal melted the only doorway she saw down into the building. Then a shot glanced off her eyebrows. Her head whirled, and there he was. She lunged for him, her breasts knocking away some of the building and smearing some unfortunate employees. Her scaly fist closed around him and kept going, knocking several metal boxes from the roof. Chantal jumped off the roof and landed on the ground with a *thud*. The ground cracked beneath her feet, along with some cars and a living body. When Chantal opened her fist she was relieved to find she had not accidentally killed the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what you've done? Dammit, why did you have to be such a moron! Why? Why did you think you could kill something as powerful as me?\" Chantal angrily demanded, her breath waves of dry heat. To demonstrate said power, her tail wrapped around a bus. When she was sure he was looking at it, she coiled the muscle as tight as she could and the bus collapsed in a shriek of abused metal and tortured flesh. The man whimpered and tried to scamper off the edge of her palm. One claw through his pant leg stopped him, and his screams indicated that she might have caught some leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can do that to a steel vehicle, imagine what I could do to you! I could step on a dozen of you, and barely notice it! My palm could slowly close around your body until your intestines came bubbling out your eyes!\" Chantal hollered. She began to close her fist around his chest, and upped the heat a little. Her anger had passed, but the prisoner didn't need to know that. His terror was part of the fun. She only broke a couple ribs before she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that would be just too easy! You had to destroy the peace, and get all these thousands of people killed!\" The dragoness spread her claws to indicate the rest of the city. \"I think that a crime of that level needs a similar punishment! And only the powers of whatever Hell you believe in could be worse than I can!\" Chantal concluded, her eyes glinting maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she went any further in her tirade the Earth began trembling. The intersection she had tripped in split and cracked, the pavement caving in around a massive hole. The ground beneath glowed an angry red, the heaved upwards and exploded. Out rose a demon from Hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" She asked, mischief glinting in her eyes. \"I believe someone requested my help.\"</span></div></div>",

She stood on the edge of the hole she'd emerged from. The light seeping up from below burned an evil, unearthly red. The screams of the damned rose up from within. The demoness casually swept up several workers standing too close to a window and crouched over the pit. She sprinkled the humans in, whispering down into the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry my dears, I'll be back soon. Now be good souls, and close up for me,\" The other monster said in a singson voice. The hole rumbled closed, leaving only scorched earth to mark its existence. Chantal watched her lithe form rise and return her gaze to her. They spent a moment sizing each other up. They were both giantesses, and Chantal judged them to be within two feet of each other's height. The other giantess seemed to stare into her very soul. Her eyes were deep pools of molten gold, shifting and running with each change of the light. Her pupils resembled a cat's. The demoness's thick brown hair was cut to just above her ears, partially concealing a pair of black horns. Her skin was a burnished red, similar to that emanating from the pit. It seemed to cast its own light on the surrounding glass, and glinted of Chantal's own blood red scales. The dragoness's eyes shifted lower. The other giantess was very curvy, and her leather bra seemed to reveal and enhance her breasts more than conceal them. Her privates were concealed by steel-banded panties. They had a hard time concealing her sizable rear end, leaving little to the imagination. She wore a grin on her face, revealing a mouth of pointy teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! I'm Tara!\" The demoness said cheerfully in her melodic voice. \"You must be Chantal. We've heard so much about you! From the souls. Me and Satan. Or whatever you call him. Or them. He's a lot of things to different people. I see you're still a little uneasy. Would you like me to take a different form?\" Tara asked. Chantal was shocked, honored, and concerned that she had gained such a following in Hell. But her new acquaintance looked like she was waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's me. The one and only dragon! And I'm flattered, I didn't know Hell liked me so much!\" Chantal replied, smiling. \"I have to wonder, why'd you bother coming up here though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness was all smiles and charms. \"I got tired of torturing souls for stories of you. I wanted to meet you face to face, see if you were as fun as these guys said. Also, it's been almost 600 years since I've gotten out. Believe me, I love my job more than anything. But there's only so many times you can crush someone flat inches at a time, keeping them alive all the while before it gets a little repetitive. And I figured you'd be a fun...person? Dragon? To hang out with. The boss told me to keep the body count down this time, too. No making plagues that eradicate millions. No offense, but I think it would be hard for you to wipe out 2/3 of Europe.\" Both giantesses grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a challenge to me,\" Chantal said. Both laughed, small wisps of smoke coming from Chantal's mouth. The survivors still in the area didn't like the way this was going. The began to slink away from the two giantesses, whose love of wanton destruction was making them fast friends. A large number decided to set off at once. The movement caught Tara's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me for a sec,\" she said as she brushed past Chantal towards the fleeing crowd. Chantal turned to watch her new friend's attack. The demoness fell on the people like a hammer. Of around twenty people, the majority died under the first footfall. The rest were rapidly ensnared by Tara's grasping fingers. She rose with six tinies clustered in her palm. They hadn't even made it half a block. Tara walked back, eating two of the struggling people. She licked her lips for stray droplets of blood, the second one had been a bit messy. Tara crammed the other four between her cleavage. The bra held her boobs very closely together, so it was not the most comfortable spot. Chantal gave the demon girl a curious look. \"Saving them for later. Might get bored sometime.\" The demoness picked at her teeth, dislodging a stray bone. She made a contented noise as she swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some things you get to missing without a definite form. I always love going somewhere I have actual form. No taste buds for me in Hell. Also, can't eat souls. All sorts of legal problems. But up here, people are everywhere. Can't even outrun me! This should be lots of fun!\" Tara flounced around a little more. She jumped up and down a few times, pounding stalled and parked cars into tinfoil and enjoying feeling the ground shake beneath her. Her enormous breasts bounced together, and with various cracks and snaps crushed the tiny people being held there. Tara didn't even notice until the began seeping out from beneath her bra. When she did, she and Chantal both laughed for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Chantal. Care to show me how to have a good time up here?\" Tara asked mischievously. Chantal was more than happy to oblige. They set off deeper into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ __________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in a place where darkness had reigned for too long lit was returning. Within hours of Chantal's disappearance the military had flooded into her burned city. Food, medicine, clean water, and warm clothes arrived by any means possible. People dying of infections received treatments, or at least had their suffering eased. Residents trapped underground for months emerged into the light without fear of being roasted. And in one small alcove, a squad of scouts found something. They brought it to the surface and called for a medivac. They didn't think he would survive for much longer. He begged for death, beseeched the sergeant to end the pain for him. And the sergeant almost did. Part of his face was singed black. His body was laced with festering burns. He constantly whimpered in agony. But when the chinook arrived, and hope gleamed on the horizon the burned man gained his second wind. He went through things no sane people would. All the painful treatments and surgeries for his infected burns he took without second thoughts. When the grim reaper came to claim him, he held him at bay. In the few moments he had a grasp on him, Death knew what this man was. He had seen many like him. He had lost everything, and now he had a chance to do something about it. A second chance at life. But life held no interest for Scott. The only thing he wanted was vengeance. He and Death understood each other. Scott would most likely end up like the dragon hunters before him. But if he succeeded, he would not fear Death. When he knocked on the door again, Scott would invite him in for coffee. And then they would go off together. So long as he had this one chance. Scott pulled through using his sheer force of will. Each body bag zipped up next to him strengthened his resolve. He would find the one who had done this to him. And he would kill Chantal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wind gusted past the dragoness's face as she soared above the city. Chantal flew in a lazy circle above the city, her sharp eyes pointed downwards. On the streets below huge crowds of people milled around. She and Tara had stirred up quite a bit of chaos before beginning. Now the streets were nearly impassible with all the residents trying to escape their fun. One street looked like it could reveal a lead to her quarry. A convoy of some form had been traveling along. Now most of the vehicles were destroyed and personel killed. The vague outlines of footsteps revealed the cause of their demise. Chantal followed the trail of wreckage with her eyes. And sure enough, at the end was the other giantess. Chantal wouldn't have noticed if not for a burning oil truck. Tara was very sneaky for a 200 foot tall demon from Hell. But Chantal was a dragon, and her keen senses had yet to fail her. She dove, tucking her wings against her sides. Tara must have seen her shadow approaching and lurched to her feet just as Chantal had thought she would. She tackled her head on, and they both went flying backwards through a high rise. As the glass and concrete exploded around them Chantal opened her eyes. Time seemed to flow in slow-motion as she fell. Tara flew before her, causing ripples in the floor that erupted into shattered concrete. People stared on in horror, trying to get out of the way. Their reflexes were much slower, and they barely even made a step before one of the giantesses crushed them. One unfortunate was sent flying by a flailing arm, and sailed right past Chantal's face. She snapped forward and closed her mouth around the man. He was in her stomach before he even knew what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they were through the building. Tara landed with a thud, Chantal on top of her. They rolled apart and lay on the ground gasping. With a roaring crash, the gutted building gave out and crumbled. Most of the rubble fell towards the two. Chantal only giggled as chunks of concrete and metal bounced off her scaly hide. Tara, as usual, didn't seem to feel any pain when the rubble fell on her. Chantal raised herself to her feet and dusted herself off. Clouds of dust and scales fell from her, along with the occasional body. When she deemed herself clean enough she allowed the scales to come creeping back. She looked down at Tara, who was still sprawled in the middle of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're it,\" Chantal said. The demoness raised herself to a standing position. She had a pair of wriggling legs protruding from her lips. She glanced at then in annoyance. Her mouth worked, and after a couple crunches they were still. She sucked them into her mouth and swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you see I was in the middle of something?\" she said in mock annoyance, gesturing to the numerous people who Chantal had crushed against her when she tackled her. Tara pried her breasts apart and looked inside. \"You got all of them, even my backups!\" she cried indignantly. Chantal snatched a pair of runners from the ground with her tail, and presented one to the other giantess. The other soon discovered what the inside of a dragon looked like. Tara tucked hers away somewhere. Chantal almost felt sorry for the ones who didn't get crushed straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm shocked the humans don't have some kind of armed forces to defend themselves or something. You'd think they'd have some way of stopping people from breaking the law,\" Tara complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they do. Here's one,\" Tara stuck out her tongue to reveal the tattered remains of a police uniform. She pointed to half a dozen others stuck to various regions of her body, and then to the cluster of cars that had gathered around the pair's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How adorable!\" Tara purred, crushing a squad car beneath the ball of her foot. Chantal was much more direct. She bent over and blew flames across the assembled cars. The paint evaporated at the heat, and the frames began to sag. Mere humans were scorched to a crisp. Those who had taken cover received only moderate burns. Chantal plucked up one such victim and popped him in her mouth. She chewed contemplatively for a moment before reaching a judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done.\" The dragon pronounced, grabbing a few more. She reclined against a building to finish her snack. The glass buckled and cracked, but held. Tara eagerly snatched up and devoured anyone she could get her hands on. A SWAT van rumbled around the corner, but the demoness grabbed that too. She pried the doors open and began munching on soldiers like potato chips. Chantal much rather enjoyed feeling her food kick for a few hours after eating, but she wouldn't tell the other giantess how to eat. When both had finished their meals they sat down and planned what to do. Unfortunately, the city's dwellers had a different idea on what should happen to the giantesses.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Night was falling, and the pair wanted to get in one more activity before falling asleep for the night. Sadly for them, the residents who would take part in these activities wanted a say in what they should be. Thousands and thousands marched down city streets, wielding lights, guns, spears, family weapons, driving trucks with weapons hastily attached to the back, and anything they thought would hurt Chantal and Tara. They came up two of the streets to their intersection, hoping to force the giantesses back towards the docks and into the sea. The pair looked at each other. Tara looked amused at this display of strength. Chantal loved these kinds of attacks when she was in her first city, but this was much bigger than those attacks. She was still confident she could handle a few thousand angry citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take this group,\" Chantal said, gesturing down one road. Tara stood on her toes for a moment, looking at both columns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, take the one with more of them!\" She said, mock angry. With a laugh both giantesses set off down their roads. The rioters were still several blocks away from Chantal, but that distance closed very quickly. The bullets started hitting her when she closed to half a block. They petered off when it was apparent they weren't doing any damage. Chantal let the tiny crowd below her drink her in for a moment. Her tail lashed out, crushing dozens and catching a couple others in its scaly embrace. They fell from her tail into her mouth a few seconds later. The dragoness noted someone had a huge floodlight, and kept it pointed on the hostages the whole time. It only helped to better her performance. She painfully killed one of her morsels, allowing the screams to reach the crowd below. The second one tried climbing out of her mouth, and almost made it. Then she pierced him with a long, pointy tooth. He was disemboweled rather quickly. By now the crowd was deathly silent. For a moment Chantal thought they would run. But then two or three would-be dragonslayers charged forward, and the rest followed. Nothing was ever that easy, Chantal thought. She roared her most intimidating roar, letting fire pour from her mouth and nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first wave broke in a loose circle around her feet. They used whatever weapons they had to try and hack at the scales. A few smarter ones tried prying off scales or stabbing between the layers of them. Others climbed onto her feet and tried to advance up her ankle. Chantal let them go for a few seconds before responding. She lifted one scaly foot, sending climbers flying and the people right next to her foot were shoved to the ground by those behind them pushing forward. Then it descended. She moaned in pleasure as she felt a dozen pops beneath her sole. She hadn't felt that many for a long time. She really started to lay into the mob. Her feet crashed everywhere, her clawed hands raked savage paths through the fighters, and her tail whipped back and forth in a fatal arc. Behind her were footsteps filled with disgusting puddles of pulped bodies. Her legs up to her ankles were drenched with blood. Her hands carried terrified rioters up to staggering heights and precipitated them to the asphalt below. And then she started incinerating hundreds at a time. The smell of cooked meat filled the air. Chantal was invincible. Bullets sparked against her armor, and the crude homemade weapons were useless against her feet. A truck with a .50 caliber machine gun annoyed her from a block away. She slid through the crowd on her belly, leaving a trail of ground meat in her wake. The gunner tried to scramble away as the driver tried to reverse, but Chantal had them gripped in her hand before they could blink. The truck was transformed into a dripping red tinfoil ball in less than a second, and then sent bouncing away through the mob. Some still stood their ground, but other ran in sheer panic. Chantal picked herself off the blood soaked ground and threw herself skywards. She flew to the back of her horde and landed squarely on the first to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, I don't like cowards at all. Don't make a daring attack and not follow through with it! I'll even give you a chance!\" Chantal said cheerily. She grabbed one random from the crowd. A jacketed man with a mask, holding a crowbar. \"I also don't like masks, let's see who this masked hero really is!\" Chantal tried to pull the fabric off, but the whole head came away with it. She laughed and tossed the body aside. \"New volunteer, one without a mask.\" She put a bloody claw to her chin, thinking. \"You'll do!\" she said, and grabbed the next fighter. He had a spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, take a stab. Anywhere! Tell me where you want to go,\" Chantal said. The man gestured to her heart. She pressed him against her soft, scaly breast. \"Go ahead, I'll tell you if I feel anything!\" She did feel him climbing up her breast, carefully treading over the flattened corpses plastered to her skin. And there were lots of them. Finally he found a suitable spot and tried to plunge his spear in. It snapped against the scales. Chantal laughed wickedly. She grabbed him up again, and looked down at him. \"I guess it's my turn to try and take a shot at you now!\" He wriggled madly. \"Don't fight, I'll only make it slower if you do. So, how do you die? Oh I know! The same place you tried to kill me!\" She said happily. The man found himself stuck between two massive breasts. The trench between them was filled with bodies of his fellow city-dwellers. Some of them he'd known. But then the distance between the two massive mounds of flesh closed and all he knew was darkness.</span></div></div>",

It's time for humans to get our revenge.\" He said, before taking note of the rest of the plan one last time, than deleting the file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Chantal know, she had willingly opened herself to be infected. Inside the spear head, was a robotized infection the Man had planted on there, which would reduce all of her capabilities by at least 90%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Back with Chantal and Tara</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal was scorching some humans for her to eat, but when she placed the crispy corpse on a stick, going for the next one, she blew her fire on it, but it didn't scorch the human at all. \"What?\" Chantal said, but shook it off, and tried to claw the human to pieces, but that didn't even dent the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara. Somethings' wrong.\" Chantal said, looking around her body. \"What is it buddy? Here, help me crush this tank.\" Tara said, placing the tank inbetween her breasts, and hugging Chantal as hard as possible. But it was like Tara was the only one doing it, because it barely made a dent it the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" Tara said, getting weaker and weaker, as by hugging Chantal, she had been exposed to the infection too. \"It's a little something us humans call revenge.\" the Man from earlier said through a intercom which echoed through the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How could humans stand up to us?\" Chantal panted. \"Why, are our bodies getting so heavy?\" Tara slowly panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chantal, remember that spear, it had been specially infected with a virus to weaken every ability you possibly have. And Tara, even if you weren't openly stabbed with the spear, you were still infected when you hugged Chantal.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Simon, and I have one thing to say.\" Simon said. \"What is it?\" Chantal and Tara asked, falling to the ground. \"FIRE THE MISSILES MEN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelicopters from neighboring countries like Japan and Asia appeared in the sky, and missiles and grenades were what dropped. They all landed on Chantal and Tara, genuinely hurting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't die. Not like this, not by the hand of humans.\" Chantal weeped, having holes from the bombs scattered across her body. \"Who knew, a demon like me. Would experience such a painful death.\" Tara weeped, also having holes in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon finally came up to the surface, and stood in front of them. \"Poor girls. You're lucky you won't die.\" Simon said. \"What?\" They gasped, then they realized they had begun to shrink, and lose all the things they loved about themselves. All the captive humans in Chantals' chest dropped as she shrank to human size. And the same for Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reverted to normal humans, and were in nothing but torn drapes of the clothes they were wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemaining Police Officers and Scientists locked them into tubes, which filled with water, which would make them pass out.</span></div></div>",

The attack was routed, and people streamed between her feet hoping she wouldn't bring them down on top of them. This was just too easy. Usually there were more technicals, and occasionally an armored vehicle or two. But for now it stayed only rag-tag militia. Chantal didn't complain though, she would enjoy herself either way. A block or two over Tara picked up a bus, armored with sheets of metal and boasting all sorts of weapons. It had chainsaws along windowslits, presumably to prevent such a move by the giantess. Tara didn't even notice them, and the vehicle made a journey to her cleavage. After toying with it for a moment Tara pushed her titanic mounds together and crushed the middle as flat as a sheet of paper. The husk fell to the ground where she buried it beneath her hellish soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the rest of the world was not standing idly by while a demon and an experiment gone wrong wrecked a city. Chantal's sharp eyes were drawn by four dots rapidly swelling from the sky. They flew overhead noiselessly, but then sonic booms shattered the air behind them. In addition missiles peeled off the jets, and bathed the dragoness in a fire that easily matched her own. She stumbled back a few paces into a skyscraper. It groaned under the strain and caved inward a little, but it held long enough for Chantal to return to her feet. She didn't bother taking off, she would never be able to match the fighters in speed. She watched them anxiously, scraping off patches of dead scales destroyed by the missiles. They made another pass, this time at Tara. She was sent spinning through the air by the explosions, laughing as she tumbled through rioters and buildings. She nimbly bounced to her feet on her third rotation and resumed her fun a few blocks over. Out of missiles, the jets arced away. Replacing them came the sound of the only aerial vehicle Chantal could regularly chase down. A squadron of attack helicopters flew above the skyline, locked firmly on Tara who appeared to be the less armored target. Their main armaments did seem to drive her back, and missiles put a severe dent in her fun. For larger armaments, she even had to throw up her arms to protect her face from harm. When she lowered them her eyes blazed red, and a demonic black mist swirled around her in an angry cloud. Skeletal wings sent her skyward towards the attacking helicopters. Being highly trained pilots, they easily dodged the rushed attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal glanced away from Tara's fight for a second and back to her own vicinity. The stream through her legs seemed to be moving a little less urgently, so she crushed a few people to get them back up to panic speed. But off a few blocks over the giantess noticed more helicopters. These were larger, bulkier transport choppers guarded by gunships. She naturally wanted to go over and wreck them, but the gunships might conceivably do her lasting harm. Chantal only needed a moment, and she strode off towards the unloading transports.</span></div></div>",

Not one to let such useful mobs go to waste, the giantess strode to the head of the horde. She stood behind one of the skyscrapers next to the route and heaved with all her inhuman strength. It fell with a rumbling crash on top of dozens of people. The rest tried to climb over it, but this was not at all what Chantal wanted. She took a deep breath and incinerated those climbing over, superheating the crumbled steel and concrete as well as starting several fires. Now that this way was impassable, the hordes streamed off in the correct direction, towards the dragoness's partner in chaos Tara. Repeating the process a few times, Chantal left no available route but towards the other giantess. What the demon was now engaged in was immoral, illegal, and unmentionable even by Hell's standards. Grinning, Chantal turned back towards her original target, leaving the screams of tinies and Tara's moans behind. She spread her wings and took to the air. The huge transport helicopters still hovered around, occasionally dropping things off or extracting clumps of people who had escaped the destructive pair. The enormous dragon approached at startling speed, but the gunships didn't try to stop her. In fact, Chantal was a little worried. Shouldn't they be trying everything to stop her? But these thoughts fell to the back as she charged closer. She never heard the incoming jets or the missiles until they were long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal awoke amid the wreckage of a short, squat apartment block. The sky was ashen gray, and Tara hovered over her. Everything hurt. It felt as if every part of her had been peeled off, stretched out, then reattached and stapled together. The slightest twitch brought indescribable pain. Forcing open one eyelid, Chantal surveyed the damage to herself. She choked back a scream, knowing it would only make everything worse. Her skin was roasted to a charred black, and in large swaths the skin had been completely destroyed and singed muscle was visible. There were a few patches where her scales persisted, but they were cracked and blackened and as they fell off, she found they concealed the most grievous wounds. When she had calmed down, she looked back up at Tara. The other giantess held a fistful of humas, and she selected one to chew over thoughtfully as she surveyed Chantal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you'd wake up. I tried to do what I could, but my specialty isn't really in healing and almost never for the living. But I've taken enough souls in that the sheer power behind my clumsy attempts was enough to keep you alive. The rest you should be able to do yourself. It's actually a little scary how quickly you heal. When I was done, some of the deeper wounds went straight down to the bone. I think you just might need a little strength and time,\" Tara said with as much concern as could be expected from a demon. Chantal grunted in response. She was immensely grateful for her new friend's actions, but she now realized she was distractingly hungry. More hungry than she'd been in a very long time. Tara must have seen the way she looked at the last few people held in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry? I would be too after almost a week. Thankfully, I've had almost a week to prepare. I went out into the rest of the city and some larger suburbs. I brought enough of the population back so we have enough food and entertainment for as long as we want. But I'd guess you probably want to eat, so let me help you with that.\" The titaness reached somewhere behind Chantal and fiddled with something. Then she gently pushed the dragoness's head backwards, and opened her mouth. Above her was a dull metal platform split down the middle. Tara flicked a switch, and the two metal flaps fell, dropping hundreds of terrified humans down onto her open mouth. Most just bounced off and either fell to their deaths or rolled along Chantal's injured body, eliciting small stings and jabs of pain. But enough fell into her mouth and eventually into her gullet to satisfy the gigantic hunger. With this pressing matter addressed, the pain rose up and forced unconsciousness back upon her.</span></div></div>",

The military had been excellent at quietly inserting him into the city in the midst of the evacuation. Despite everyone's strong misgivings about using people as live bait, the plan had been pulled off. It would have gone better if a demoness hadn't arrived to help the injured dragoness. Now Scott had to actually stay and fight the giant mistake. He made his lair where he had before, in the cool, damp sewers. This time though, he had his pick of weapons, armor, and material. He was focused entirely on killing a giantess. But things were different here too. Slipping into the body armor he'd been provided, Scott selected an excellently made machete along with a silenced handgun for tonight's excursion. Loud noises like gunshots drew one of the titanesses in record time. The key was stealth. Like a ghost, the embittered man slipped through a manhole cover and onto the hostile streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA host of things were different in Scott's new city. He didn't have to worry about roving bands of thugs, the demoness had done an excellent job of cleaning them up. But that wasn't much different, the brazen ones had been the first to be devoured by the dragoness back home. Instead, the few free survivors had to worry about demonic death squads. They used brutal medieval weaponry that left something inside cuts that allowed Tara to track your location. Scott had seen a pretty grisly scene of a group of humans triumphing over a group of demons only to be suddenly crushed beneath the bottom of the purely evil woman. So Scott made it his personal side mission to kill demons until he found a way to get close to the injured dragon. Then, all he had to do was slip a specially honed blade into her scaly hide and permanently silence her malicious heart. Lost in these ruminations, Scott almost passed the subway stop he had been advancing towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour figures wrestled by the entrance. One was a terrified human, a girl of about twenty. The other three were demons, horribly disfigured in mind and body. Scott knew exactly what the demons had planned for the girl, a long and drawn out torture followed by a brutal feast on her flesh. The leader looked particularly excited as he forced her down. His final expression was quite amusing as the heavy machete blade sliced through tough sinew and brittle Satanic bone. The other two drew weapons, but the attacker had already melted back into the shadows. One backed up against a stout tree, ensuring the ghost had to advance from directly in front of him. Silently, the tree unfolded its black-clad arms and sliced his throat. Dropping the body, it advanced on the final panicked demon. It quaked in fear as the figure, black as the shadows it hid in, advanced. It's blade dripped with the gore of his companions and the beast could almost hear it cry for his blood. The figure's head gained color as an awful row of pale teeth revealed themselves in a grim mockery of a smile. It guestured down the subway entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon dove down the stairs, crying for its companions. Scott approached the petrified woman. She almost broke when she saw his horrible scarred face, thinking that an even worse apparition had come for her. Instead, the man roughly shoved a map in her hands and stood above the entrance to the train station. Torches lit up the night moments later as twelve more of the demons tried to pour out of the station. Their howls of bloodlust drained to cries of fear and dismay, and finally silence as the automatic pistol made short work of the beasts. Then the figure melted back into the night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tara was displeased. And bad things happened when she was displeased. As her general staff for the excursion into the realm of the living had just discovered to their displeasure. When the head of operations had reported the loss of another squad, Tara had slammed her fist down on him in frustration, smattering chunks of Hellish gore everywhere. The servants that came to wipe the mess up found themselves backhanded across the enormous table. Tara leaned back in her chair, made from the skeleton of a fallen skyscraper and Other various debris. The table was made from one of the few species of trees that grew in Hell. Various other officers in charge of different aspects of the attack had places at the table. Most of these were on raised sections created so the lesser demons might seem slightly more important to the colossal titaness seated at the head. However, the aged and dried ichor that had seeped into the woodwork showed a certain intolerance for failure. The current general staff had seen numerous executions for failure, but never had their leader killed someone so high ranking, and then idly killed two servants as well. She casually flicked off a bit of the blood, sprinkling the logistics officer with his commander's remains. Tara seemed placated for a moment, her face losing the murderous shadow for a moment. Then she directed a gout of purple flame at the farthest office, smiling wickedly as the three representatives shrieked horribly while burning to death. Her flattened palm flattened the hapless logistics officer. Several other officers of posts not particularly important to Tara fell into her gaping mouth, and were ground to dust by angry molars. The military postmaster she violently seized, breaking several bones in the process. The giantess squeezed him tighter, savoring his looks of silent pain, as he was only capable of communicating through writing. Finally, he burst like a huge boil of pus. The rest remained dutifully still as they were slaughtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily and covered in the remains of her commanders, Tara glared about the setting for someone else to take her anger out on. Just up a few streets were the human detention camps, and the jail for her own troops caught in some infraction was even closer. But her friend was injured and would need many of the humans to recover, and she had just pardoned a large number of her prisoners. Finally her gaze fell upon the final living being in the vicinity. A smaller demon dressed in a white suit attempted to make himself very small while not appearing tone hiding from the raging giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you lead an army better than these failures did?\" Tara said slightly menacingly, her massive body towering over the demon, which barely topped five feet. It quaked helplessly, and croaked out a few words too quiet for Tara to hear. She leaned closer, her enormous breasts threatening to crush the hapless servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louder, if you don't mind.\" The temperature in her voice dropped a few degrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was designated a servant, I know nothing of leading military operations,\" it said, hoping the fact she hadn't instantly pulverized him meant something positive. It didn't. Tara grabbed him, screaming about the utter I effectiveness of all her minions, and the only responses to problems being excuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to die a very slow and painful death. But first you will wish you had never come into existence. When I finally finish you, you will thank me,\" the giantess said, the tiny demon clutched in her hands shaking despite the tight grip. It already wished that it hadn't been born, or at least been allowed to die painfully in battle. After having to clean up several of the demoness's victims, he was fully aware of what was in store for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was blind with rage, rage at everything. Unfortunately, this tiny insignificant speck of a being was the only thing she could take her anger out on. This was usually the mood in which she surfaced in some realm and annhiliated entire cities. But sadly for her hapless victim, he would be the sole recipient. But then the giantess noticed something. Being from the underworld, and controlling an amount of power that certainly put her in the running for most powerful thing there, she could see quite a bit about another being at first glance. The whelp of a demon in her hand did not die anytime soon. Which must mean something must placate her in the next few seconds. And indeed, it did. Tara was placated enough to place the demon back amid the mutilated corpses of her generals, apologize, and follow up on an idea she had had.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There is no way that he could have recuperated this fast without some physical enhancement.  And I know for sure that WE did not administer one to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps he just had a drive to survive.  If he is able to survive that burning hell blast, then he might be anxious to go for Round 2 with Chantal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott swam back to consciousness against a torrential pain.  He felt itchiness everywhere on his body.  As he opened his eye, the first thing he observed was the surgical spotlights over his apparently flat body.  He tried to move his arms and legs, but they were strapped down to an operating table.  A husky voice emerged from his throat, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo men walked into the light from the shadowed parts of the room.  \u201cMr. Scott Cross?  I am General Thornsides.  I am responsible for the rescue aid and evacuation process that is now is occurring in the Los Angeles city area.  This gentleman here is Sir Geon, the chief weapons engineer of the East Coast Branch of the C.O.D.F.I.S.H. Inc.  We want to offer you a proposition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?  The last things I remember were the screams of my venturing partner, the heat of the flames and falling backwards into a dark tunnel.  There was a vague image of the appearance of some guys, and buzzed conversations where Death and Christ argued over my soul.\u201d  Scott tried to roll his head, but he felt cushions holding his head still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Geon, with head bowed, stepped forward.  He answered, \u201cYou were found in the Los Angeles subway lines.  The medivac brought you to San Diego, and you have been receiving treatment for nearly 2 days, to try and remove the burnt tissue from your body.  However, it appears that we have complications where the burns went through the skin and muscle, right down to your bone structure in certain places.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, I need to see what happened to me,\u201d Scott muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.  We have been trying to restore as much as possible.  Please forgive us,\u201d Sir Geon murmured an apology as he pulled a remote from his lab coat pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA TV screen lit up, situated right in front of Scott\u2019s vision.  He was a burned out skeleton.  His face was crusted black, with no nose or lips, and a white gloss where the skull broke through the burns.  His arms and legs were blackened with third degree burns, on three-quarters of the surface; the rest of the limb was blistered red, from the indirect heat of Chantal\u2019s furnace blast.  His chest was striped in black skin, exposed red muscle tissues, and white rib bones.  The scene of horror was completed with needles and tubing protruding from various cavities in Scott\u2019s scarred body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott screamed, \u201cAHHHGH.  She did this, she did this to me.  AHHGH.  It hurts all over; even my back itches.\u201d  Scott squirmed on his back, trying to rub the itch away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, your back received only slight 3nd degree burns from the blistering heat, rather than black charring.  Whatever surface you were attacked on, it protected you from total damage.  As the situation stands, you should be dead from the lack of treatment and time delay to get on the surgical tables.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott processed the medical diagnosis.  He answered in a raspy voice, \u201cWait, if I am in a hospital, then you could approach with outside medical help.  Chantal cut off the city for two years.  We haven\u2019t had a hospital, even a triage, since this April, when she started hunting the airdrop supplies.  WHERE is Chantal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe left,\u201d the general announced.  He turned the TV to a news channel, showing balls of fire, collapsing buildings, and two colossal creatures grabbing at the humans on the streets.  \u201cShe vanished for nearly 24 hours, and suddenly appeared in the harbor outside of San Francisco.  Chantal seems to have started to terrorize that city.  Even worse, she has a new friend.  Another 200 foot creature, with red skin and leather clothes, appeared right out of the ground in the city, and joined up with her.  The evacuations were not fast enough, and she has already penned in the city.  At the rate she is going, Chantal and the new creature, which is called Tara by inside news reports, could demolish San Francisco within a year, moving on to another city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore a fireball smashed near the camera crew, Sir Geon turned off the television.  He looked down at Scott.  He whined, \u201cGeneral, sir, I still think that this is a poorly thought out idea.  Mr. Cross has been put through too much physical damage.  Sending him anywhere would be to commit murder, and just a waste of technology or chemicals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott groaned, \u201cWhat are you talking about?  Send me where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon, we need to ask you a favor.  Of the remaining survivor accounts gathered in the past days, your name, and those of your associates, has popped up in stories all over the Los Angeles city.  It seems that you were Chantal\u2019s number one thorn.  You know the dragon girl better than anyone alive.  We want to send you into San Francisco, with the intent to kill Chantal and her friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t screw with me.\u201d  Scott looked at both gentlemen.  \u201cYou\u2019re serious?  You want to send a dead man to do your dirty work?  Don\u2019t make me laugh,\u201d Scott shut his eyes and guided a laugh through his burnt throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Geon sighed, \u201cSee there, sir?  He\u2019s been through enough.  He suffered through his own hell, and won\u2019t partake of your suicide mission.  We would be better off trying to find one of the colleagues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d  Scott grunted, and counted on his blackened fingers, \u201cJeff and Cindy can be found in a cinders pile, burnt in a building together.  If the time is long enough, Larry will be in a pile of dragon guano, somewhere in San Francisco; I saw him get mulched and swallowed.  As for the last member of my team, Saul might be dead, but not from the dragoness.  He had gambling issues that forced me into the predicament that you see before you.  Stupid deadbeat won\u2019t last a minute against her; he was our doorman, nothing more.\u201d  Scott darted his eyes between the two men.  \u201cIf you want that dragoness hide, I am your best shot.  But she won\u2019t twiddle her thumbs and wait for me to recuperate, or for me to pass my Intel on to some of your flunkies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general placed his hand on the sterile strap on the surgery table.  \u201cBoy, you got spunk.  I had wanted to send you in, but the good doctor here wanted to make sure that we were not forcing this on you.\u201d   General Thornsides waved Sir Geon over, and pointed into the darkness that still rimmed the surgical room\u2019s edges.  Sir Geon stepped away from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are two ways that we can expedite your recovery.  Of the two, we would appreciate if you could choose one of them, and we will suit you up for a war with the gargantuan monster women in San Francisco.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Geon rolled up a gurney table, with a small vial and a sponge.  He lectured, \u201cThe first option is a biological solution.  We were able to harvest some of the chemical solution that Chantal was soaked in.  This could allow you to become a dragon-human-warrior.  You will receive a controlled and small dose of liquid, applied to your skin.  This will give you some, not all, of her traits.  The chemical will allow you skills such as armored scales for protection against her fires, regenerative powers to heal your own tissue, dragon wings for flight, and the dragon tail for special ops.  However, there are a number of factors that the scientists confirm will not happen.  She grew to such large proportions because of the irregularly high, yet unmeasured, dosage.  There also may be a chance to alter the application to give you not simply fire, but other elements, but we can discuss that in more detail later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Thornsides motioned into the dark, and two more people rolled in a mechanical suit.  He pointed at the suit and spoke, \u201cThis is your other option, son.  We will outfit you with some high tech equipment, also produced by C.O.D.F.I.S.H. Inc.\u201d  The general, Scott noticed, rolled his eyes at that statement.  He continued, \u201cThe lab people will have to give you some exoskeleton enhancements, seeing as your body went through so much damage.  However, that support comes with a lot of fun armament and tools to play with.  The major highlight is this: PHASE tech.  When activated, the whole suit, you included, will be able to walk into walls, through the solid material, and reappear on the other side.  The PHASE tech also allows for bullets, knives, and even flames to pass through you unhindered.  I personally witnessed the first field experiments.  You become a ghost.  However, there is a potential for failure: organic material testing.  These field experiments were done before Chantal appeared on the scene.  We don\u2019t know if a PHASE is possible through the dragon scales, or if you will even be able to slip through her skin if she tries to smash you with a fist of flesh and bones.  If you accept, we can offer a few simple work-out tests, to give you the chance to figure out the entire tech beforehand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott\u2019s silence lingered in the room, as he contemplated his choices.  Both gave him tremendous advantages over a mere human to challenge Chantal.  He looked to the two gentlemen, and in his husky whisper, he replied \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sir Geon nodded his head, accepting Scott\u2019s choice.  \u201cVery well, you should rest now for a few hours.  After all, you just finished two days of intense reconstructive surgery.  We can start your transformation in the morning, followed by a few days of study and examination for scientific purposes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRest, nothing.  We don\u2019t have time.  Those girls will smash San Francisco building by building, and by the time you finish testing me, they could be long gone \u2013 either hiding out or destroying even more lives.  Doc, give me that serum now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, Sir Geon glared at Scott\u2019s body.  \u201cABSOLUTELY NOT.  You need your rest.  You barely survived the surgeries; you should be in more surgeries and recuperation therapy for six months, AT LEAST!  Now, you are scheduled to test an unstable and rather dangerous serum that may kill you, kill everyone around you, or dement your personality that you may join up with Chantal against the rest of humanity.  Besides, there are details for the testing and application process that need to be worked out, and your rest period will allow for all the arrangements to be made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe General nodded his head and agreed, \u201cThe doctor is correct, son.  You should lie still for a few hours, rest, and allow your body to stabilize itself, especially from all the pain killers we used for the grafting surgeries.  Besides, the study part may come in handy for duplication, to give you backup commandos, or even to use for wounded veteran surgeries and limb regeneration \u2013much, much later.  Rest up son, and we can continue in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Scott could make another objection, both officials slipped away from the table.  The surgical light turned off, plunging the room into darkness.  Scott shifted about trying to find a comfortable position to rest in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*&amp;*&amp;*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Scott woke up to the movement of his hospital bed, as some orderlies pushed the bed out of the hospital complex, aboard an ambulance, and drove to an airport on the far side of the base.  There was much organized chaos on the tarmac, as the scientific teams of Sir Geon were finishing the set up of their scientific, observational and recording equipment inside of an emptied plane hangar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the orderlies rolled Scott out of the ambulance and into the perimeter area, General Thornsides greeted Scott.  He barked out, \u201cFinish setting up those cameras and securing the perimeter.  There are to be no civilians within one half mile of the test area.\u201d  Looking at Scott, he explained, \u201cIn your condition, and with the tight time table of this crisis, we wanted to use the open space, in case you did develop an unexpected growth spurt.  We found a closed roof environment with the space to allow growth and flight room.  The airport here is open, close to the hospital, but open to prying eyes, both curious and unfriendly types.  Also, we had to clear out the excess vehicles and equipment to make room for the science stuff.  Come; let us get you set for your part in this endeavor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling up to the testing area, Scott observed how the scientists had prepared a medical crash cart, slightly out of sight behind the observing areas.  He gulped to himself, hoping that the cart wouldn\u2019t be necessary.  The male nurses loosened the straps for Scott, and stepped away behind the observation barriers.  Sir Geon approached at a crisp pace, pushing a medical supply cart.  The two men greeted each other, and Scott tried to raise himself into a sitting position.  Sir Geon stopped him, explaining, \u201cWe want you as relaxed as possible; I need to attach some monitors and we\u2019ll begin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying back down, Scott waited as the scientists finished the preparations.  The monitor pads felt extra sticky on the raw muscle when application to the burnt skin failed.  When the cameras were all set up, Sir Geon gazed at Scott and ordered, \u201cBegin camera recordings.\u201d  He waited a moment, and announced, \u201cBegin medical recording of subject Draco Man\u2019s vitals.  I apologize about the nickname, but eventually all military projects pick one.  This is Scott Cross, resident of former Los Angeles.  His body is covered by third degree burns on over three-quarters of his skin.  We will begin with a sponging application of Experimental Substance 619.  This is believed to be the substance that produced Chantal the Dragon Giantess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Geon donned surgical gloves, and turned his back to Scott.  \u201cWe will begin with application on the lower left arm.  Once we have seen a reaction, we will determine whether to continue the application on the other limbs.\u201d  A dripping noise caught Scott\u2019s ear, and Scott licked his lips in anticipation.  Sir Geon turned back to Scott, holding a small tray with a red glowing sponge.  The glow of the liquid reflected on the camera lenses and off the tray.  The doctor inhaled through his surgical mask, and instructed Scott to hold out his arm.  \u201cFor the sake of a violent reaction, we will need to strap the left arm down.  I will apply from the wrist to the elbow.\u201d  An orderly came up and belted the left arm to the gurney.  \u201cI am applying the ES-619 now.\u201d  The doctor took the sponge in hand, and lowered it towards the blackened skin.  Heaving a sigh, he rubbed the skin with surgical strokes from Scott\u2019s wrist to the crook of the elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, nothing happened. While the cameraman took a few moments to zoom in on the application site, the scientists began to realize that his skin was peeling.  In bits and pieces, the burnt skin started shedding, leaving raw muscle.  Then, Scott screamed.  The doctor stepped back, as dragon scales breached in rows of armored peaks.  Then, like falling dominoes, the scales topped the fresh flesh, from elbow to wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that finished, the process repeated itself.  The crispy flesh on the hands began to flake, while strips of new tissue began to appear on the upper left arm.  When scales pierced the fresh muscles, Scott screamed in fresh agony.  After 5 minutes of rippled waves of pain and anguish, Scott\u2019s whole left arm was covered in transparent scales, showing the muscles and nerves growing and mending under the new reptilian skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Geon breathed a sigh of relief.  He approached Scott, and pointed at the arm.  He announced for the cameras, \u201cThe transforming scales of ES-619 have covered the whole left arm, from fingers and hand, through the lower arm\u2019s application site, and up to the shoulder and armpit.  The scales are clear; underneath the new scaly armor, the muscles are still repairing themselves.  For the next step, we will apply the formula to Scott\u2019s other limbs.  Strap them down, gentlemen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orderlies followed his instructions.  The doctor applied the sponge in careful strokes, one limb at a time.  The process took nearly a quarter hour.  Cameras recorded the skin\u2019s changes.  Monitors recorded accelerated heart responses.  Audio mikes recorded vocal agony.  By the time the changes subsided, Scott\u2019s limbs were covered in bands of reptilian armor, and most of the burn damage was repaired.  The muscles showed new signs of bundled strength, and the bones were thicker to support the weight of the new muscle and scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor stood watching, as did the general, scientists, and all the rest.  Sir Geon approached once more.  The red sponge dipped down toward the chest and smeared a straight line from sternum to pelvis.  The scales flowed outward to the left and right, making rows of miniscule triangles facing down towards the legs.  When the scales of the chest reached the limbs, they interlinked into a seamless pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Geon looked up, and faced the cameras.  He explained, \u201cThe scales now cover all four limbs, the lower and upper chest.  The only flawed areas seem to be the facial area and the backside.  Now, to reach the back, we will need to get you unstrapped from the table and flip you over, Scott.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orderlies moved forward and loosened the straps on the gurney bed.  Scott started to lift himself onto his elbows, and rolled onto his side.  The burn scars on his back stood red and blistered compared to the clear, front side scales.  The arms and legs were completely encircled in scales; the chest scales made a jagged boundary short of the back side.  Scott lay down on his chest, exposing his back to the cameras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow to give the final application.\u201d  The crowd held their breath.  The sponge was rubbed around Scott\u2019s blistered spine.  Scott hissed in repressed pain as the skin started to peel and scales started to appear.  Within two minutes, the back side was completely covered, completing the body armor.  Internal restoration of muscle tissue seemed to continue under the transparent, thick scales.  Sir Geon leaned over Scott, and inquired, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott flexed his fingers and toes, stretched his arms, and moved his legs.  \u201cEverything seems to be connected and working properly.\u201d  He rolled his shoulders, and tried to sit up.  He showed no signs of pain, and the muscles rippled with his movements.  Some of the cameramen walked around, recording his repairing tissue and his body movements.  Scott strained and announced, \u201cI don\u2019t feel any tail or wings.  Are they there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking his back, Sir Geon noted, \u201cThere are muscle and bone bulges on your shoulders and at the base of the spine.  They have not broken the scales yet, but they are swelling exponentially.  Perhaps the elemental exposure will be the catalyst to initiate the dragon limb developments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott cocked his head.  \u201cElement what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe believe that the lab explosions that Chantal was exposed to during her accidental application of the dragon serum resulted in her development of fierce fire breath and explosive projectile usage.  From the items here in the airport hanger, you should be able to choose a few elements.  Your first exposure to the item should influence your powers as a dragon-man.  You may be able to choose two, but it may not work that well.  At this point we are unsure of the pairing abilities. So\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Peering into one corner, he saw something that intrigued him.  \u201cWhat about the chopper blades?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked to the corner where Scott was staring.  A half-torn chopper, salvaged from Los Angeles, was in disrepair along the wall.  The tail rotor blades were loaded on an army truck to be salvaged for scraps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think those rotors would make for some cool dragon wings,\u201d Scott hoisted himself into a sitting position on the gurney.  He dangled his legs off to the side, and was about to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!  What are you doing?\u201d  Sir Geon screamed at Scott Cross.  A bunch of orderlies prepared to rush forward and suppress the patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott tensed up.  He held up his hands in a surrender pose and replied calmly, \u201cI was going to walk over to the rotor blades.  That way, you could get footage of my recovery before and after being exposed to stuff.  Plus, I wanted to test my leg strength with the scales, bones and new muscle mass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor looked to the general, who nodded in acknowledgment of Scott\u2019s plan.  The general ordered the cameras to keep rolling, and the doctor ordered the orderlies to give Scott space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping off the medical gurney, Scott wobbled slightly on his new legs.  He kept his arms out, balancing as on a tight-wire.  He whispered to himself, \u2018I am not going to become a stupid dragon with gurney powers.  Stay strong, stay focused.\u2019  With wobbly steps, he moved forward towards the wreckage of the helicopter.  The crowd watched, as the scaly human moved to the edge of the area, coming close to pass by the medical monitoring equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA power cord tripped Scott.  He could not lift his foot over the cords powering the heart monitors.  Zap!  In a flash of white light, Scott was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d screamed General Thornsides, \u201cWhat in the flames of hell just happened?  You never said that he could vanish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor stared astonished at the power cord where Scott had just stood.  \u201cSir, I don\u2019t know \u2026 but I don\u2019t think he vanished on purpose.\u201d  Sir Geon walked over to the cables and knelt down by the cables. Waving over one of the maintenance men, he asked, \u201cWas this cord frayed earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sir!  All of the equipment was perfect earlier.  The wires should be fine.\u201d  Leaning down, the worker shook his head, and swore.  \u201cSir, this wire looks like someone took a knife to it.  But if it was live, they should have been knocked out of their boots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr have the lightning of God Almighty put into their bones,\u201d Sir Geon mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrackling and flickering, Scott\u2019s face replaced the digital screens on the monitors.  \u201cWhoa, where am I?\u201d  His voice came out of the speakers, spooking nearly everyone, \u201cThe last thing I remember was stepping on the cables of the equipment.  It tingled.  I know that sounds stupid, but it tingled, and then I was here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Geon rushed over to one of the cameras, and then man-handled it to look at him.  \u201cScott, the evidence shows that you grew claws, and your claws sliced into an electric wire.  Your body\u2019s new dragon DNA accepted the shock as your first power.  Now, at this point I am hypothesizing, but you can now control the electrical devices you inhabit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott blinked on screen, \u201cThat \u2026 is \u2026 AWESOME! Hang on, let me try something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flicker appeared on screen, and the digital monitors came back to life.  Another second passed, and the lights in the whole hanger started flashing on and off in quick succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a \u2026 SOS signal?\u201d  General Thornsides asked before a buzz saw in the mechanic\u2019s corner of  the hanger whirred to life.  Some of the camera operators whipped their recording devices to that corner.  The saw buzzed on and off to the tune of \u2018Shave and a Haircut\u2019: Buzz, Buzz, Buuzz, Buzz, Buzz, Buzz \u2026 Buzz, Buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver by the mangled helicopter, a flash of yellow and white light caught everyone\u2019s attention.  Standing by the wall socket was a bright yellow creature.  It took everyone a few seconds to react; the reactions ranged from doctors jumping in surprise to guards attempting to defend the science group.  Only Sir Geon and the General were able to bring the people in the hanger back under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold fire!  Do NOT shoot!  That\u2019s our test subject!\u201d yelled the General at his soldiers and guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep rolling!  Don\u2019t let him out of your sight!  That\u2019s our test subject!\u201d  Sir Geon directed his medical group and the camera crews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott\u2019s appearance had changed from his exposure.  His scales had taken on a mixture of colors from gold to neon yellow.  His muscles had finished growing and mending, for the final appearance of a body builder athlete.  His legs were lithe, but coiled with power.  His arms bulged, ready for action, whether lifting a truck or punching holes in sheet metal.  All of this was visible under the translucent yellow scales, giving an appearance of yellow aviator glasses.  A tail had appeared: a thin black cord started just above his pelvis back and pooled in a pile of coils behind his feet.  The end of the tail flicked, showing prongs that reminded everyone of a living power extension cord.  Claw nails had grown on both the hands and feet with a jagged lightning bolt shape and solid golden color.  Only his face had remained human and unchanged.  The burnt tissue of his cheeks and nearly missing nose killed the magnificence of his transformation.  The glint in his eyes showed his survival intelligence and the thirst for revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott finished admiring his new appearance and walked over to the rotor blade in the truck bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait please!\u201d Sir Geon cried out, \u201cWe still want to test you at this stage and understand your new developing abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I messed with the lights and appliances\u2014to test my powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least may we extract some scales to see what the serum has done to your body at this point?\u201d  The doctor pleaded with his draconic patient across the hanger floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his head, Scott scraped his clawed fingers up his arm, pulling back rows of yellow scales and carving out a sliced sample of his new skin.  After he pulled the sample free, Scott flung the sliced skin to the floor.  Before he took another step, Scott\u2019s scales and skin had grown again, repairing the arm\u2019s damage.  Rushing over, one of the orderlies picked up the sample bits from the floor and put them in a medical Petri dish for examination later.  Ignoring the underling, Scott asked the doctor if that was enough samples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Geon had approached by then, towing both the camera people and some of the other scientists.  \u201cThat is plenty.  Please continue and we\u2019ll record anymore transformations.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Please continue and we\u2019ll record anymore transformations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott reached out to the rotor blade.  His claws touched the metal first, carving divots in the metal as he moved his hand in closer.  Once the palm of his hand touched the metal, the dragon reaction occurred.  The metal liquefied, encircling his hand, wrist, and arm in a metallic cocoon.  In a rush, the metal seemed to encase Scott\u2019s arms, chest, and neck in thin metal waves.  Leaving no trace of the original rotor blades, all of the metal was being absorbed into the dragon scales on the body.  The molten metal began to climb up his neck and to swiftly encase Scott\u2019s head.  Too shocked by this development, no one approached him to see if he needed help.  Congealing to the shape of his disfigured face, the metal took on a final form.  The spherical crown of his head glistened with a smooth sheen.  Two lenses emerged out of the metal: half moon shapes with the straight edge downward, tinted in an aviator\u2019s yellow shade.  Scott could see the hanger with a tinted golden light.  He blinked, and witnessed an image of thermals perspective; blinking again, he saw skeletal images familiar with X-ray, and a third blink returned his vision to normal.  \u201cDoc, I think the lenses let me see stuff in thermal and X-ray vision.  This is wicked cool.\u201d  By this time, the metal helmet had finished molding a lower jaw, resembling the snout of a dragon.  The helmet stayed free on the bottom, allowing Scott to talk naturally and without hindrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCircling around Scott, a cameraman noticed the twitching bulges on Scott\u2019s back.  In a single movement, the pair of wings emerged from the scaled hide and protective metal jacket on Scott\u2019s back.  Gaping in awe, the scientists gawked and marveled at their shape and design.  They were not conventional dragon wings.  Instead, the wings looked like helicopter rotor blades.  There were two large blades, one embedded near each shoulder blade.  Two slits appeared on the back, parallel to the spine, but traveling about a third of the ribcage\u2019s length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so cool,\u201d Scott exclaimed, as he took a step forward to balance himself.  The bladed wings blurred\u2014briefly\u2014helping Scott right himself.  When finished, the new wings folded downward, visually disappearing along the slits in Scott\u2019s back.  \u201cDid my wings just go inside me?  So gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Geon reexamined some footage presented by the primary camera operator.  He announced, \u201cThe wings folded down your back, covering and sealing up your back slits.  I can see from the slow-motion on the footage that your wings are traveling up and down the slits, somehow.  Why don\u2019t you step into the center of the room, and we can test your wings a bit, along with any other skills you want to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott nodded, and started to teeter-totter out of the mechanic corner of the hanger and back to the medical tests set up area.  The extra weight of the metal-morphing scales, the wing blades and the power-cord tail altered his original center of balance.  Not only that, his body was still recovering from the intense surgeries that got him this far.  He made it back to the gurney in the room\u2019s center.  \u201cHey Doc, can I lie down?  I think that exhaustion thing you talked about just caught up,\u201d Scott wheezed as he collapsed onto the gurney, face-planting the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gurney bowed from the heavy mass of the new Draco Man, but it did not break.  Soon, the sound of snoring rose from Scott\u2019s resting body.<br>\r\nThe General pointed at Scott Cross.  \u201cThis man is an asset to the future of our military might and our medical advancements.  Strap him to the gurney and continue to monitor his body\u2019s developments.  Take tissue samples, scale samples, body measurements, wing measurements, tail measurements, and whatever else you can think of to measure, weigh, or analyze,\u201d the General ordered the doctor.  He growled, \u201cIf the man grows so much as a foot in his sleep, I want to know.  Hell, if he grows 6 inches, I want to know so we can contain him before we have another Chantal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general looked around to the guards.  He barked new orders, \u201cThe perimeter is now locked down.  No intruders and no departures.  Double check all identification.  Anyone who objects or resists is to be detained in complete isolation or shot, whichever maintains this secret best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Geon objected in shock, \u201cThat is too extreme, General Thornsides!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it is NOT!  This project is a national secret.  We cannot have a media leak, for Chantal might get wind of it.  If she kills him, or captures him, or coerces his support, we have lost our best and fastest shot at knocking her out.\u201d  He started walking to the open hanger doors, giving the final orders, \u201cClose these doors, and secure the perimeter.  And Sir Geon, keep monitoring the Draco Man through the night.  We can continue testing his new skills and abilities either later this evening, or first thing tomorrow, if he sleeps really deep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards separated into groups: two started the automated closing of the hanger doors, a group started a sweep to check identification badges, and a group split off to secure the exits and reinforce the perimeter of the hanger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Geon sighed and made his own set of announcements.  He instructed everyone, \u201cPlease comply with this set of security measures.  Get your IDs checked and get back to work.  Camera crews, continue recording our friend, Mr. Scott, but also make sure your cameras are fully charged and operational.  Analysts, please log the morning\u2019s recordings, and begin analyzing the footage and biological readings.  Orderlies, we have samples to collect.  Secure the patient, gather your supplies, and one of the doctors will direct your sample collecting duties.  Doctors, please come together over by the monitoring machines so I can give you your assignments.\"</span></div></div>",

It was a chemical company that was trying to find a way to create a dragon. They believed dragons once existed for real and were trying to recreate one of these powerful beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, something terrible happened that would create the dismal future that is now. Chantal was carrying the tank containing the ooze that would become the dragon. There was an Earthquake and Chantal dropped the tank, spilling the dragon formula all over herself. It changed her from an 18 year old girl into a giant fire breathing immortal monster. She enjoyed her new form a little too much and soon, took over the entire city. No one else from the White Oak building is alive to this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chantal reaches into the remains of the building, she has an evil thought in her head. She would create an army of dragon women to dominate the world. An army she would rule over with a fist of pure iron. She knew that even if the building had been abandoned, there were still tanks left containing the dragon formula that she could easily recreate with her scientific knowledge. As she moves her hands through broken metal and charred skeletons, Chantal feels something. She gives an evil look as she takes out a tank of the very same ooze that turned her into what she is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to expand my territory.\" She says as she breathes out a stream of fire and then spreads her wings to fly beyond the city, beyond the country.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They got to stare at the freakish monsters on the islands, orphaned by the corporate and military projects that spawned them. A lot were just dumb beasts, victims robbed of their humanity by equally inhuman and monstrous beings who drove profit and security from formless, nonexistent threats before all else. Chantal usually just used the time to sleep. At most, the visitors got a view of her gorgeous body. She was a little self-conscious at first, but had grown impervious to the hungry stares of the people who came to gawk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal was caged in a rather small pen for the week, so she could be marketed to the public in the world's largest freak show. Guard towers ringed her encampment, guns trained on her at all times. Chantal quietly doubted they could hurt her but kept it quiet. That might let her escape one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step right over here folks and come see the dragon lady!\" A carnival announcer voice called. Chantal cursed herself for not keeping track of time. She should have appeared asleep, now she had to deal with the people telling her to show off. The announcer droned on about her size and abilities while people took pictures of her. Chantal did like the attention a little, but only as the acknowledgement of her power. The man said something about fire breathing, and Chantal smirked. She had never once let anyone look closely enough at her anatomy to determine how she did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now to demonstrate her voracious appetite, we release a herd of cows into the pen. Watch how quickly they'll be gone!\" He called. Chantal fought down revulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now they want me acting like a stage animal!' she thought in outrage. Maybe they recognized her power in a way they know a lion is dangerous, but not while safely contained. Something inside her snapped. She stepped through the herd towards the gate, feeling the animals crunch under her feet. The herd mooed in terror and fled from her. Soon, the tiny people that kept her locked up would sympathize with the trapped animals. The gasps of horror from the crowd were audible like music to her ears. Standing next to the gate, flanked by two guard towers, Chantal turned and faced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a show? I'll give you a damn show!\" She yelled. Then she looked down on one of the towers, which came up to about her shoulder. Opening her mouth, she poured fire onto the structure. In seconds it had melted down to ashes from the intense heat. Behind her, she heard even more screaming. Other towers were rushing to become combat ready. She waved her tail, which had sprouted from her lower back, and cut the tower neatly in half. It plummeted to the ground where she stepped on it, turning it to a pile of matchsticks. Another tower was set on fire, but allowed to slowly burn. The last three had opened fire on her. A harpoon sprang from one and cut into her skin. It stung, but angered her more. She looked at the men holding the weapon and yanked her harpooned arm. The gun, firmly rooted to the observation deck, didn't budge. The tower as a whole however, tilted erratically and plunged earthwards. Chantal walked to the final two towers. From both .50 caliber machine guns chattered harmlessly away. They hurt a little, but for the sake of the show Chantal hid it. From one, the giantess grabbed all four occupants in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've decided I will no longer be eating cows, my visitors. These are much more fitting a meal for a creature such as myself!\" she declared, dangling one man over her open jaws. They were all screaming now, none more so than him. A deep chuckle resonated from her throat, sending wisps of smoke writhing around his body. All of a sudden, he felt himself falling downwards, past fiery eyes, gleaming teeth, and pink tongue. He landed at the back of the throat and quickly fell down into the stomach. Chantal rubbed her stomach and moaned. Still holding three captives, she struck a pose. Looking down at her audience she blew them a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a picture now guys!\" she called. Turning back to the morsels in her palm, she breathed a brief spurt of fire. The soldiers burst into flames but didn't die instantly. Their screams continued until Chantal messily devoured them, blood and gore dripping down her perfect mouth to stain her alabaster skin red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess its time I head out. Thanks for being a great audience!\" Chantal said sweetly. Bending over, she tore the final tower out by the roots. A gunner plunged over the side, bouncing off her soft breasts and plummeted to the ground. He might have been alive but Chantal couldn't tell. He certainly wasn't after her foot landed on his body, squishing it into the soft earth. Most of the cows had been trampled underfoot, turning the ground into a soft and sticky swamp. It squelched between her toes with each step. Chantal stepped right up to the glass observation window, giving the tourists a full view of her right up against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out!\" Chantal hurled toe tower into the concrete wall. It smashed through the containment structure and the observation windows. She strode through the wreckage humming pleasantly, pausing to cruch a survivor under her big toe.</span></div></div>",

Many of the most dangerous things on Earth were kept here to be further experimented on and refined into more deadly creatures. Most were just dumb beasts, like the cows she'd eaten, but with bigger claws. Chantal was disappointed at the fight the humans had put up. The adrenaline had come only from her absolute power over them. This would be fun, but the novelty would probably wear off someday. She would need adrenaline from killing something that would be a danger to her. Having to fight their nightmares would toughen up her former species fast enough. And if they didn't, maybe some of the monsters would be a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness lifted herself into the air with her massive wings. Gusts of warm air buffeted the ground and stirred up clouds of dust from the rubble. Already, Humvees and emergency vehicles were arriving to clean up the scene. They drove in a single-file convoy up the narrow dirt road leading to her enclosure. Chantal gave them a long breath of fire as she flew over the group. Most vehicles were set ablaze and reduced to molten slag. A few at the back managed to dodge off the road before she could bake them to a crisp. She laughed and let them live. Mankind would need those with quick reactions. In the distance, she could see the installation that ran the island. One building held the controls for every pen on the island. It was long and slender, reaching up 500 feet into the air. The bulbous too floor seemed to be balanced on a needlepoint. The entire structure resembled a drop of oil falling upwards. The giantess flew faster and the city rapidly grew larger. At the sight of her, air raid sirens blared. Various guards far below shot upwards at her. Chantal wasn't worried they'd hit her. She would accomplish her task soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal angled her wings backwards, forcing herself higher. When she was right over the center structure she folded her wings against her back. Her feet became more dragon like, scaling over and growing huge claws. She plunged downwards towards the city. Her feet tore into the command center, which wasn't very strong. Iron and glass shattered against armored scales. Technicians, computers, and architecture fell downward and were crushed by the soles of her feet. The single strand of metal anchoring the bulb to earth was barely wider than one of her feet and broke just as easily as the top. Seconds later, she hit the ground with a *thud* and sending minor earthquakes through the island. Kneeling in the rubble Chantal noted the silence for a moment. Then various alien cries began to rise into the air. Slowly she stood and began to laugh. As more creatures joined in her laughter increased in volume. After a moment Chantal was laughing at the top of her lungs, deafening all those too close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be free my children!\" She cried between laughs as the cries of strange creatures turned into human screams.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Who in blood-soaked Hell thought spiders were a good idea?\" A frantic civillian chattered. Sam was clustered in a small lab building with the civillian, a guard, and his two research partners. They had seen their creations boil over the fences holding them in and decimate the crowds viewing them. While the spiders, vibrant shades of orange and yellow with hairless exoskeletons and slender legs, had been distracted feasting on the humans, Sam had slipped inside the hut. He quickly turned off the lights and barricaded the door to the connecting lab. A few others had slipped in seconds after. When the screams and shooting had died down, some had assumed the fight was over and it was safe to exit. Twenty dwindled down to four, and everything was silent. A few minutes later, the guard cut a path through the giant spiders while they fed on the lab's recent occupants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the fuck did giant spiders seem like a brilliant idea?\" The man asked again, too loudly. Something clicked across the roof overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\" the guard hissed. He didn't look like any normal paramilitary man. The face seemed to round and plump, and the wire glasses didn't fit with the body armor splashed in spider blood. The civillian turned to him, eyes panicked, and shook madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get out of here!\" he gasped. The guard looked down at him, trying to silence him with abrupt hand motions. It sounded like more spiders had joined the one on the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll bring them in here. Stop talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're going to suck out our insides man! Like juice!\" his voice began to raise in volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't quiet down, I'll make you.\" The obvious threat went over the man's head. He was more terrified of the monsters outside the small lab than the mere man sitting next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck that! I'm getting out of here!\" he fairly screamed. He shifted to go for the door, but the guard grabbed him faster than seemed possible. With a hand over his mouth, he whispered to the man reassuringly as his eyes glazed over. In a moment all his struggles ceased. Gently, the body was lowered to the floor. Sam looked at the guard with a look half question half fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not dead, unconscious\" the guard mouthed back. Sam nodded, not sure whether it would have been kinder to the guest to kill him before the spiders reached him. They were currently battering on the roof. It sounded like the lab next door, but he was prepared to see eight cold eyes peek in from a sudden hole in the ceiling. But the sound of splintering wood and metal came from the next lab over. Someone had been alive over there, as a chorus of shouts and screams picked up. There was a disgusting crunch, and something let out an inhuman squeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH!\" someone screamed, and hit the animal again. Then a heavy thud as the spider must have died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted watch out!\" another voice called. Then Ted was screaming, and there was a huge commotion next door. At least three other people were fighting with him, but Sam knew there were more than three spiders in the area. He could hear them on the roof and outside. Then the door on the other side was destroyed, and two more beasts came charging in. The fight was brutal, and the three seemed to still be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should help them!\" Sam's partner said, clutching a long knife in his hands. His other partner nodded, checking the saftey on her handgun. The guard looked at them with his cold, lifeless eyes.</span></div></div>",

Let's get this over with,\" he finished grimly, pulling out a combat knife. They quickly unblocked the door. As soon as the last obstacle was moved, they exploded through the door and into the chaos. Tim was pinned under a dead spider, eyes gazing straight ahead and frothing at the lips. Two other people were backed into a corner, bashing away at the monsters with metal pipes. The third was struggling to keep the spider crouched over him from biting him. With a roar, the guard charged up to the spider and stabbed its armored carapace. With a squeal, it reared up and tore its back open as the knife was held still. The man on the floor struggled to his feet and finished it off with a short chop from a machete. The immediate threat dealt with, they turned to the two still in the corner. They watched as a fourth spider charged over the backs of the other three and sank its fangs into one person's chest. He barely had time to scream before the venom paralyzed him and he was dragged out through the ceiling. The other three also beat a hasty retreat as the humans began to outnumber them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is anyone bit or bleeding?\" The guard asked. Everyone checked themselves, but they were still standing which spoke for a lack of bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're good. Well, most of us. Tim's in bad shape. Who even are you people?\" The surviving woman from the other room asked. Sam introduced himself, as did Christina and Frank his lab partners. The guard muttered Sergei before stalking around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kelly and this is Bill. We were from the lab over the hill, studying interdimensional phenomenon. When the power died, we were over here watching these things. Everyone else on our team was back at the lab,\" Kelly said. Sergei seemed uninterested until he suddenly walked up to her and began an interrogation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many are you? Would it still be safe there? Did you drive here? Do you have any firearms? Was there an emergency phone line or radio there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not sure. We took a bus over here, the equipment was being quiet so we thought we wouldn't miss anything. We had five guards, and they were all armed. There's nothing there to get out when the power failed but...\" she suddenly trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not safe there. We should probably try somewhere else. Somewhere far away from here!\" Bill added, glancing around nervously. He looked about to say something when the sounds of engines was heard. They gradually moved closer, and soon after bursts of automatic weapons. Shouted orders followed by more gunfire moved closer to the labs. Sergei waited until they could hear booted feet running nearby, then slowly opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! OVER HERE!\" He called. A squad of armored, masked troopers turned their direction. They scanned the rooftops, trying to keep 360 degrees of vision as they approached the survivors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with us, we're evacuating the island. Do any of you have any injuries?\" One man called through his mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two people injured, one bitten. In the shack. Where are we going?\" Sergei replied. Two of the troopers ignored him and pushed into the small buildings. They emerged a second later, each lugging an unconscious person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow them, we're taking you to the harbor,\" the soldier said. The small group ran across the corpse and web-strewn ground. Other groups of soldiers were finishing off whatever spiders still lurked around. An enormous olive-drab truck loomed up from the faint fog, and Sam was quickly herded inside. Kelly and Frank followed him in, but the rest were herded into a more empty vehicle up ahead. Then they rumbled off away from the ruined exhibit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two miles up the road lay the interdimensional research lab. It was little more than a bus stop and a door into the hillside. But within was himanity's best window into other worlds. When the window was turned into a door and something came through, it was kept behind the firmest doors and highest voltage containment possible. But when the electronic locks and preventative electricity failed, it popped the twenty tons of solid steel off its hinges as easily as opening a can of chips. The lab had quickly become a slaughterhouse. Bodies were scattered haphazardly in horrible positions, wherever they'd been flung or left after it was done with them. Walls were coated in streaks of blood and strange signs written in the same liquid. At the end of the hallway, right next to the door to the surface, the visitor sat atop the lab's last inhabitant. The solitary guard tried to force the horrible monster off of him, but it merely held him down with one hand. When her pleasure had ended with a cry of ecstasy and a series of powerful spasms that battered her prey, she casually ripped through the kevlar armor and consumed the terrified guard. After the bulk of the good meat was gone, she flung the corpse over her shoulder where it splattered against a console. She found a labcoat and pants that almost suited her proportions. Finally, using a keycard that no one else would need, she stepped out into Earth's daylight and waved to a conveniently passing convoy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam gazed at the convoy behind him. After a brief detour to pick up a survivor from some underground complex that Kelly identified as hers, their truck had taken the lead. Behind them was the medical Humvee that had picked up the blood soaked scientist. Kelly still wasn't talking about what was being held in the lab. But if someone had made it out, then it must have been under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had heard tales of a dragon being kept on the island. If that thing was flying around somewhere, they might have problems. An ancient monster should present no problem to modern weapons, but it might take out a truck before being shot down. Sam very much appreciated being alive. So much so that when Frank inhaled sharply at something going on behind them, Sam too looked with a sinking feeling of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Humvee was rocking wildly back and forth, threatening to flip over. The canvas roof bulged and rippled, distorting the red cross into all sorts of hideous shapes. Sam could make out someone in the passenger's seat stick his head through the sheet separating the front from the back, and then get pulled in. Two shots were fired, and then the cab was soaked with blood. The rocking subsided as the truck began to slow. Their driver was unaware of this or didn't want to be involved, and drove on. The several soldiers in the back glanced fearfully backwards. The hired guns had no more interest in dying than anyone else, they said nothing. Then the truck turned a corner and the view behind them was obscured by a thick forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith had fully expected to have to fight her way through every human on the island after emerging from her hole in the ground. But whatever had deactivated the defenses that kept her in also affected the rest of the island, and a full scale evacuation was underway. The medics had taken her into their vehicle readily enough once they saw the blood. After being laid down on a cot, they mostly ignored her. Several other people were lying around, their injuries either more serious or more likely to be treatable than hers. She had no idea how much blood a human held, but what coated her would have been a lot for anything. They had driven at least fifteen minutes before one of the medics had drifted over to her. He wore a suit of body armor she had found on the guards earlier, as well as a face mask and some plastic gloves. He spoke something in a language she didn't understand. She cursed herself for never bothering to learn whatever the natives spoke. It didn't matter too much now, the doctor had some idea of what he was doing. When he found no immediate sources of bleeding, he began to take off the shirt and do a more thorough examination. Five deep rips through the fabric left very little covered, but no wounds underneath. The man's brow creased, and Lilith began to worry. Maybe they wouldn't get as far as she had hoped. Then he grabbed her wrist to check her pulse, and she was a tad too slow to pull it away. When he saw her claws, he let out a scream of fear understandable in any language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, she leapt on him and tore him apart. A few of the more conscious wounded tried to move or call for help. She went bed to bed, messily devouring them as quickly as she could. Since her captors had stopped sending \"food\" by deliveryman, she hadn't tasted fresh meat. It left her drained and irate, totally incapable of performing the acts her race needed to survive. When the tiny remains of six people lay scattered about the back, she felt much better. The energy that sustained her beyond her normal dimension burned with a new intensity. She may not have been up to full power, but it was close enough. She withdrew into herself, letting it flow to every point on her. And as the magic rippled through her skin like waves of freezing water, she began to grow. Her weight soon increased so that her rhythmic swaying rocked the vehicle on its axles. Her borrowed clothes were finished, and they only loosely draped over her body. Soon her back rubbed against the itchy roof, and the medical truck rocked wildly. Surely someone would notice! And sure enough, the other medic leaned in from between a curtain screening her from the driver. With a short burst of energy, she overwhelmed his body and caused him to explode. When this small outburst accidentally popped the driver as well, she laughed. The power would take some readjustment. Over the noise of the dying engine, she heard shouts and the tramp of boots as the vehicle was surrounded. Before one of the humans did something stupid, she accelerated her growth to its maximum rate. With a short gasp of pleasure and pain, she burst through the truck. Looking down from 200 feet at the wreck beneath her and the shocked humans next to her feet, she felt normal again. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In her former world, Lilith had not been anything important. Her powers qualified her for a standard, uninteresting job for the duration of her life. She had begun to give up hope of anything exciting ever happening to her. She would work until she was old and weak, then die, and be forgotten. But when the wormhole had opened and sucked her through to wherever she was now, she relished the opportunity to break the monotony. The pitiful life forms here had no use of magic. They vaguely resembled her kind, size and several other differences aside. She still felt no remorse slaughtering them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow restored to her normal form, she had the chance to marvel at herself. Her straight hair was midnight blue, falling just to her jawline. Her small mouth housed rows of razor sharp teeth, and molten gold eyes stared out on the realm beneath her. Her skin was a shade of orange that appeared to be eternally smoldering. Her curves were astounding on any world. Suddenly aware of her nudity, she wanted to clothe herself. Instead of the boring suit or skirt she would normally wear, she summoned scant coverings of gold and rubies that twisted ornately about her body. They left much of her revealed, teasing the small people staring dumbly up at her. The metal was cool against her warm flesh, biting into it and exaggerating every part of her. Finally, a beautiful tail sprouted just above her hips and slowly wound to the ground. Eyeing it playfully, she lovingly cooed \"I missed you\" to it. Looking maliciously at the soldiers on the ground, she set about destroying them. One of her feet smashed forward, obliterating two of her rescuers and sending the rest rolling. A quick burst of power erased the rest in front of her. Whirling around, she pulled those behind her to face level. One by one, her tongue snaked out and grabbed them in its embrace. She was coming to savor these beings as much as any she had eaten at home. When she accidentally bit down on one of their weapons, she laughed. They hadn't even gotten to fire their weapons. She looked back on the convoy, realizing that only one truckload had confronted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith stepped forward, feeling the weak metal of the transport crunch under her. In the same stride she crushed the next one too. She heard the tiny screams from inside right before her sole flattened everything. From the rearmost trucks, all their troopers had deployed. She braced as their guns flashed, but the small caliber bullets only stung her lightly. She fell to her knees in front of them, catching one or two under her wonderfully sculpted thighs. They still fired helplessly, confused as to what else to do. Meanwhile, her legs began to move together. When they saw the walls of flesh beginning to cut them off, the soldiers panicked and tried to flee. For most it was too late, her limbs bulldozed the road and crushed the truck and people without pause. Lilith stood, wiping stains and dirt from her legs. The final truck was trying to pull away, survivors piling onto it. With a laugh she turned her back on it. Her tail whipped out at it, slicing it nearly in half. It continued to flail savagely. It eviscerated everyone nearby, leaving only cleanly sliced parts instead of full corpses. It also dealt with those who tried to flee into the jungle. As it coiled around them Lillith moaned at their feeble struggles. But then the muscle would curl tighter, and the weaker beings popped. She was fairly certain only a few escaped. Just before she began to tear out the forest looking for them, she felt something. Something living, comparable to herself. And heading towards her.</span></div></div>",

She has the legs of a spider, the claws as hands, a huge scorpion tail on her back, a horn on her head near her hair, and even 2 gigantic falcon wings for flight. She is 140ft tall, and her bikini is white, and her name is Lola, or known as Lola: The Mix Monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other one has brown hair, is 10 years old like Lola, except this one was a Godzilla like creature, (head is human just like Lola and Chantal) with her huge tail and even gigantic dragon wings on her back. She was wearing a pink bikini, but her skin isn't cover in scales, and it looks mostly like this.(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&amp;section=&amp;global=1&amp;q=Giantess#/d3g11lt\" target=\"_blank\">http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&amp;sectio...</a>) her head is pale skin though. She was 140ft tall like her sister, and both of the girls let out vicious roars, and even Chantal joins in as well. Her name is Gohiza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... I am Chantal, and you are?\" Chantal ask, greeting the 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lola, and this is Gohiza!\" Lola said as she points out her sister. \"Say... I was thinking about?\" Chantal said to do something fun with the 2.</span></div></div>",

Chantal's scales are red while Marvel's scales are bright blue. Then the sisters sprout reptilian tails and wings along with razor sharp teeth. When everything has stopped, the girls are titanic dragon girls. Chantal lets out a gasp and breathes out fire at Marvel by accident. Marvel grunts and then sprays a breath of ice in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal dodges the ice and then she looks at her sister. \"I can't believe this,\" she says. \"The formula works on humans? Oh this is...\" \"Terrific,\" says Marvel interrupting her sister. \"So this is power.\" Marvel lets out an evil laugh that scares Chantal. \"Marvel?\" \"Catch you later braniac. It's like they say, everybody wants to rule the world.\" Marvel then flaps off and flies away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the present Chantal is looking around the world to find her evil sister. \"Who knows what harm she'll do?\" asks Chantal. \"This is so bad. I've got to find her at once.\" Chantal sees the frozen sea and realizes she is getting closer to her ice dragon sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is Marvel now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even through the haze of madness slowly engulfing her mind, Chantal remembered vaguely how she came to find herself in her current position. All around her, fires raged. Thousands were dead on the streets and even more would join them soon. Pillars of black smoke reached up, as if trying to choke out the sun itself. Chantal was broken, bleeding, and battered. Her tough scales were shattered, their lustrous red faded to a dull bronze. And now, her sister stood over her prepared to deliver the killing blow and claim dominion over all life. Sighing one final, ragged breath and breathing in the scent of charred flesh and ash, Chantal looked as far back as her tattered mind would let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Chantal, I heard you were working in the weapons department now. How will the almighty goddess choose to end the world this week? Will it be a supervirus? Shall some mutant race replace all humanity? Will some new atomic weapon send the earth off its orbit and into the sun?\" Chantal's sister said tauntingly, poking fun at her sister. Chantal tolerated it, if only our of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you have no idea. This could be the biggest development in genetics since the field began!\" Chantal replied, babbling excitedly. Her sister's eyebrows raised, actually interested. Instantly trying to quell this look, she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might the all-powerful one enlighten her sister Katrina as to what she is talking about?\" she asked, flashing a smile. Chantal looked around the crowded dining hall, trying to determine whether anyone was eavesdropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the terrible present, Chantal choked back a scream. That moment, if simply erased from time, would have prevented so much. The being tried to hold off the flood of memories that entered her damaged mind, but there was no stopping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal raised a vial filled with blue liquid up in front of her sister's eyes. Katrina stared back, unsure of what exactly was being shown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This substance contains a special type of living machine. It enters the body by any possible means, pores, eyes, mouth, blood, and begins its work. It completely rewrites a person's DNA from the ground up. It will keep as much of the host's genetic information as possible, enough to retain a recognizable look, and then splice in the new information. If this works, the possibilities are endless!\" Chantal gasped. Katrina looked amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why is this part of the military department instead of a medical department of some kind? This seems much more helpful in curing genetic diseases or irregularities than killing people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because of what the DNA in this vial will do to a person,\" Chantal said. Katrina signaled curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina's brow fell into a look of confusion. \"And how does that make any sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this enters a person's body, they will gain the ability to become a dragon! The mightiest beast in the world!\" Chantal said, her excitement brining her voice to new levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I guess you just wrote genetic coding for a dragon yourself then, sister?\" Katrina asked, still disbelieving. Chantal nodded yes. \"Really? And the proof?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There-I haven't tried it yet. This is the only vial in existence. This was a prototype, supposed to be put on a sample of tissue disconnected from a body and then used to demonstrate that it works. The schematics for the machines and the DNA are all on the computers in this room.\" Katrina looked around the room at the mammoth computers stationed by the delicate-looking lab equipment.<br>\r\n\"It would be too dangerous to put this information on a network, so all of these computers are isolated from the outside world. No data can leave or enter,\" Chantal's voice faded to a somber whisper. Katrina picked up the shift and looked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter with you? This is Nobel prize material here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They cancelled it. The project. As soon as the prototype was finished, the company ordered this be destroyed. I just wanted to show you so you wouldn't think I was crazy later.\" Chantal said, crestfallen. Katrina, surprised at the company forfeiting such a weapon, sprung forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are coming to destroy all this?\" She asked, her voice gaining an icy edge. Chantal nodded glumly, turning away from her twin to survey the lab. Katrina eyed the vial. \"And this is the only place this exists? Outside this room, there are no records of this substance?\" Again, a glum nod. Chantal turned back, and then cringed back at the hardened look in her twin's eyes.<br>\r\n\"Then we have to use it. If they won't let us use this power, we must do it on our own. Think of it, we'll become gods! We could do almost anything we wanted! This vial contains our DESTINY Chantal. To give up this chance would be to forsake the life meant for you!\" Katrina hissed quietly, getting in her sister's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think this is a good idea, this is just a prototype and things could go wrong-\"<br>\r\n\"Then we'll fix them! We need to hurry and do this! When was the company going to destroy this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" Chantal murmured, stunned at her sister's outburst. Just then, there was the unmistakable sound of boots on floor coming up the hallway. Into the lab entered four security guards and two lab technicians. At least one guard had been briefed on the subject matter, as when he saw Chantal holding the Gail he reached for his pistol. He pulled it out and aimed for the scientist. At the last second, Katrina slammed into her twin. The shot rang out and the vial exploded. Katrina stood in Chantal's place while Chantal lay on the floor. The blue liquid had splashed all over Katrina, coating her face. Chantal found droplets on herself, droplets rapidly being absorbed into her skin. Then to her horror, she saw a splash of red blood on her white lab coat. Quickly patting herself down she determined it wasn't her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But that means its-'<br>\r\nLooking up, Chantal saw her sister holding a gaping hole in her stomach. Katrina's eyes glazed over, and she fell to her knees. Chantal caught her limo sister before she keeled over completely, and cried out in anguish. The six men by the doorway looked equally as surprised. Chantal sobbed into her dead sister's body, feeling the tears run down her face and fall onto the body. But then the room went deathly silent. Except for one sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina's laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman whom had just had a hole blown through her stomach laughed. Her head rising from its slump, she let forth an unearthly expression of amusement not meant for mortal ears. Her hands quickly tore open her lab coat and shirt, both stained crimson with her blood. Beneath was a hideous wound from the .45 magnum, still oozing blood. But before all, the wound began to stitch itself closed. Muscle grew over the whole, and pale skin stretched over this layer. Minutes later, it was as if Katrina had never been shot. She looked up at her shooter with eyes of a dangerous predator and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she ascended.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a sound like an underwater explosion, Katrina's skin erupted in a white flash. Chantal cried out as it seared her eyes, and she heard the other people in the room make similar noises. And above it all Katrina was still laughing. Shielding her eyes with her hand, Chantal tried to look back at her sister. Her body still radiated light, but it had died down enough to catch a glimpse of the figure within. Katrina was perfectly silhouetted, her gorgeous body reduced to its basic shadow. And to Chantal's horror, she was getting bigger. Having started out at about 5'9, she had been average-sized. But now she stood closer to seven feet. Chantal picked herself off the ground and tried to move closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katrina! What are you doing?\" Chantal shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, but it's amazing! I feel like a god!\" Katrina almost moaned. She turned to face her sister, her eyes visible as two pinpoints of light inside the darker shadow. They squinted in concentration, and the light seemed to dull even more, pulling itself into her body. In a few seconds, the unnatural light was mostly gone. Her twin was now pushing at least nine feet, and her skin shone unnaturally bright. All traces of her clothing was gone, replaced by wisps of matter that resembled clouds shrouding her sensitive areas. She stepped towards Chantal, gently placing her hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't thank you enough for doing this to me. I only wish you could experience this too, dear sister,\" Katrina said softly. \"But now I suggest you get as far away from here as possible. This transformation isn't done, I've only slowed it. I'm afraid the rest will completely destroy everything here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get you to a hospital or something, I need to fix this! Katrina, this could KILL you!\" Chantal said with a tinge of desperation. Looking at the security guards and other scientists, she said \"Help me get her out of here!\" One of the scientists stood from behind his cover and walked forward. Katrina looked at him disdainfully, but he took no notice and reached for her arm. As soon as he seized it, bolts of lightning shot from Katrina into the unfortunate man. Incapable of moving his hand, the electricity fried him. Chantal gasped when he fell to the ground, dead. Katrina's skin glowed brighter, the light beginning to seep out of her again. The security guards drew their weapons and moved to surround her. The remaining scientist had conveniently disappeared among the equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a monster Katrina, let me help you!\" Chantal pleaded. Katrina only smiled down at the shorter girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet I'm not.\" Whirling on the guards, she shot bolts of electricity at the security. They jerked wildly as huge amounts of electricity flowed through them, destroying their nervous system. Chantal scrabbled away in sheer terror as white light blasted the room again. Ducking down behind a table, Chantal listened as her sister assumed her new form. Crashing equipment and shattering glass made her think she was getting even larger. Thankfully, the room used to be a storage warehouse which gave her plenty of room to expand. Midway through Katrina began moaning in ecstasy as untold power filled her body. After almost five minutes, the light again went out. Peeking over the desk, Chantal saw what her sister had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina's hair was still the pale blond it had always been. Her eyes were shards of emerald and her mouth a beautiful shade of red. Her perfectly sculpted breasts, an ample D cup, we're shrouded by dark thunderclouds that sparked with lightning. Down her perfectly toned stomach to find her womanhood covered by e same storm clouds. Her feet were planted over what had been the data terminal housing the schematics for the nano virus, and were joined to her supple hips by two perfect legs. Katrina herself admired her new form for a moment, although it hadn't changed much. Virtually the only thing that had been altered was her size. Chantal guessed from the way she had to crouch over she much be close to 200 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chantal, your potion worked beautifully. I am truly perfect in every sense of the word! Now, I believe there was one more person around here somewhere...\" Katrina said, an edge of mischief crawling into her voice. Trying to stand a little straighter, she bender her head on the roof. She grimaced In annoyance, but then smiled. \"There you are!\" An enormous arm shot out right over Chantal's hiding place and grabbed something right behind the next row of desks. The frightened shouts of the other man rang out as Katrina lifted him up to her face. In an attempt to free himself, he stabbed the giantess with a knife found inside one of the desks. The blade failed to penetrate Katrina's skin, and she squeezed him until a rib snapped and he dropped the blade. He gasped in agony and Katrina eased her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna fight me then, little man? Okay. I had planned on letting you go, but I guess I'll test out the dragon part of this new body now,\" Katrina said. The scientist resorted to beating her clenched fist. But scales grew over it and nails elongated into claws. But then he looked up at Katrina's face and panicked.<br>\r\n\"What, you don't like my new teeth?\"<br>\r\nChantal cringed as the crunching and snapping stopped, signaling the end of the team sent to destroy her research. Katrina rubbed her scaled stomach and burped. Giggling slightly, she remarked on the flavor of her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sister, I did warn you to get away. I fear that will get a little harder now. I won't intentionally kill you, but outside things might get a little hectic. Maybe here is the safest place to stay. In any case, I need to go alert mankind to their new goddess. Farewell!\" Katrina called. Thunderous footsteps and breaking equipment signaled her departure. But Chantal was caught up in other things. She remembered her sister being shot, and how the liquid had sprayed everywhere. Even onto her. The lesser amount must have meant her transformation would take a little longer. But now it had arrived.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In some isolated part of the lab facility, the watchful eyes of the security cameras kept track of every development in the lab. That is, until Katrina's final evolution knocked out all the electronics in the room. Not wanting such a valuable development to escape, the company ordered all the security in the building to converge on Chantal's enormous lab, armed to the teeth. The sizable force, about 75 men suited in riot gear with assault rifles, marched into the weapons wing of the lab. On the way over, some strange shudderings and vibrations had been felt but nothing that would stop the men. Some personel had gotten word of some runaway experiment one way or another, and tried to leave the building in a hasty manner. This caused a general panic, and as a result the facility was locked down. The air of the inhabitants was edgy to say the least, as all knew something had gone horribly wrong but no one knew exactly how wrong.<br>\r\nThe contingent arrived at the doorway to Chantal's workspace but encountered a small problem. Instead of a wooden door with a couple windows, they now confronted a solid wall of red plating. Puzzled but then annoyed, the team leader paced anxiously. His bosses wanted whatever was in this room, but this experience was a little too far out of his comfort zone. He believed in risks, but facing something this strange in the weaponry department of a science facility? That was closer to suicide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has there been a problem lieutenant?\" A stern voice squawked over the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, there's something blocking the door,\" the man responded, staring suspiciously at the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then move it. You have your orders, there is a subject in that room who has stolen valuable company assets. We want them back, and as head of security it is your job to secure them. Am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, but this stuff didn't budge-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a battering ram with you, use it! I am tired of your excuses and incompetence.\" The voice cut out, leaving the lieutenant angered and frustrated. Gesturing towards a grey-armored guard, he motioned for the ram. It was a 4-foot oblong pipe filled with a very dense, heavy material. Two men swung it repeatedly against the blockage. A strange groan was elicited, causing the two to pause for the slightest moment. At a nervous signal, the two resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal opened her eyes. Her first thought was of the ceiling, and how close it was to her face. Her next one had to do with a sensation of being tapped midway down her back. Groaning loudly, she began to roll over. Then she noticed her surroundings. The entire lab was spread below her, a miniature representation of everything she'd been hiding under during her sister's transformation. Chantal then realized she must have changed too, which explained her new size. This didn't shock her or turn her world upside down. She simply accepted is as a fact of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I bet the nanites adapted my feelings to be more at home in this form' Chantal thought, examining her newly enlarged arms. What really shocked her was how strongly she resembled a dragon. The red scales were nothing like what her sister had demonstrated, but then she had stopped looking when she ate-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knocking had gotten harder and slightly annoying. Chantal thought of the security cameras and bet it was backup to the other guard team. With a slight fear of death, she assumed that they would probably think the giant dragoness responsible for the deaths of their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe if I looked more human...' Chantal thought. As if in response, her scales began to sink back into her skin. In moment Chantal looked human again. With a final thought to her decency, she glanced down at her once big, nor enormous chest. A liquid resembling molten lava ebbed and flowed over her breasts, seeming to cool and heat as it glowed and dimmed to different shades of orange. An identical covering existed over her other parts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant, something's happening!\" one of the men at the ram called. The LT glanced over and gasped out loud. The red scaling was sinking down and being absorbed by...pale rubber?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell is that stuff?\" he muttered, walking closer. As the last scale disappeared into it, he made either the worst or best decision of his life. Reaching out a gloved hand, he seized hold of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skin?\" He muttered in shock. Suddenly, the wall rolled away from the door at terrific speed with his hand still latched on to it. As he rode the entity, he got a glimpse of what had been blocking the door. It was a girl of gigantic size! Easily 180 feet tall, she was as gorgeous as any other he'd seen. Though he got only a brief glimpse of black hair sewn with smoldering embers and a cute face it was seared forever in his mind. Thankfully his hand had gone limp and released the woman's back. The patch of flesh he'd been holding rolled under her while he continued flying another ten feet. Instead of being flattened under this mysterious giantess, he got to live to admire her another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he heard shouting from among his men, and realized they must have thought he was crushed. He tried to call out, but shots were fired and the giantess suddenly grew scaly again. He ducked down behind a nearby work station and tried to radio his squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal's first glimpse of the troops was one of raised guns. By instinct, her scales returned a moment before they opened fire. Chantal also blamed her instinct for her own reaction, but knew that wasn't true. She opened her mouth, now full of razor sharp teeth perfect for ripping and tearing, and blew out as hard as she could. An endless stream of fire poured out at the guards trying to shoot her. The hallway seemed to ignite as it filled with flame. Chantal kept going until the horrendous screaming stopped. Flickering fires still burned cheerily on singed corpses and other flammable material nearby. Something vital inside her had changed. The tiny people shooting at her hadn't been people scared of this titanic monster that had suddenly appeared, they'd appeared as targets to be dealt with or prey to sustain her. And Chantal was not overly concerned. She did feel a burning inside her. A deep rage at all those smaller than her, and weaker, that made her feel this godly. Most of all, she hated her sister for speaking the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lieutenant had hightailed it from the lab as fast as possible. He ran through a gaping hole in the wall out into the fresh air. The outside was cool and breezy. The sun shined brightly, and there was barely a cloud in the sky. But no birds sang in the various trees and bushes planted on the grounds. The LT didn't consider any of this, but ran as fast as he could towards the rocky hills near the edge of the lab grounds. Quickly scaling the wire fence, he looked behind to make sure he wasn't being chased. Suddenly, a geyser of fire erupted from a part of the complex. Quickly thanking any number or deities, the man saw it was about as far from him as could be. He then sprinted to the highest cave he could see and laid down. Over the next hour, he saw his workplace of three years be systematically set ablaze piece by piece. After the giantess had stood to her full height and bathed a small barracks in hellfire, the guard heard the sound behind him like a sail whipping in the breeze. A heavy thud launched him off the ground a little. Looking behind him, he saw another dragon bigger than the one now panting heavily amid her own fires. It grinned down at the little morsel now conveniently between her front claws. The Lieutenant gazed upwards frozen in horror. This was it. Her radiant white scales peeled away and drifted into the wind like delicate lotus petals, revealing a spectacularly human body beneath. She slowly lay down, pinning the man in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A beautiful sight, is it not?\" The giantess said. When the tiny man failed to respond, she laughed and continued \"I meant my sister you fool. I should eat you for thinking of your overlord so basely.\" Just then, Chantal did something unexpected. She turned towards the spire in the center of the complex. Raising her hands over her head, she slammed them into the earth. The spire exploded and cracks radiated out in all directions. Magma seeped to the surface as Chantal and the facility sunk downwards.</span></div></div>",

She could still feel the tiny man squirming between her breasts, but disregarded him. Lunch would have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well my little treat, you'll have to live to satisfy me another day,\" she said as she lifted her form off him. He immediately sprinted for the cave's imagined saftey. Once again, she considered killing him just to prove she could but decided against it. Her sister was the more pressing issue. Regaining her dragon wings, she flew towards the magma. She circled lazily, buoyed upwards by the drafts of warm air. She could see veins of lava within the pool heat to white hot almost in the shape of another human. Katrina dearly hoped her sister wasn't being cooked alive, it would be difficult to go through life without a confidant she didn't consider a snack. But then again, she would probably have to kill her sister anyway to maintain her own dominance over the world. Instead of deciding what she wanted to happen in the lava, she just sat back and watched. Her patience paid off. After an hour of watching the roiling surface, something began to emerge from the pool. Lava obscured its specifics, but it looked to be her twin. She rose until her feet were on the surface of the lava, and then walked mechanically to the edge of the lake. Lava still ran off, singing paths of burnt overgrowth into the hillside before solidifying. The dragoness also noticed the cave in which the guard had hidden was on the opposite side of the lake. This small bit of concern for another's life irked her. Next time, she would just eat her victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal looked comatose and entirely human. She wasn't dripping lava, but heat still radiated off her in visible waves. Katrina circled down, landing beside her sister. Nothing she did elicited a response from the other giantess. Gently, Katrina pulled her sister to her feet. Her skin was hot to the touch. With some small satisfaction Katrina noticed she was about 20 feet taller than her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, sister, and let me show you what I've done for us,\" she whispered softly into Chantal's ear. Pulling her to the ridge of the hill, Katrina let her see the city of men laid out beneath them. The only barrier was about 500 feet of grass and a fence. <br>\r\n\"This is the first place we will reveal ourselves to. Then we will rule the world and all will fear us. Let me show you the power we hold.\" She walked her over the open ground. Stepped over the fence, which was about ankle high. Onto solid concrete, which bubbled and buckled under their weight and Chantal's heat. People gathered in their windows and on the street. The news helicopters had observed Katrina circling the fire pit, but had wisely stayed away. Katrina's sunny disposition towards the smaller people was still unknown. Katrina waited until a sizable crowd had assembled below.<br>\r\n\"Feel this,\" she whispered, lifting Chantal's leg. She set it down on top of a still-puzzled audience, crushing at least a dozen into her sister's sole. A flash of emotion passed behind her sister's eye. Katrina smiled. She ran her hand through the crowd, grabbing some unfortunate gawkers. She lifted Chantal's head back and opened her mouth. Pouring the victims in, she murmured more assurances of their power. She gently worked her jaws as the cries from inside died down. As the lump of flesh worked its way down her throat, consciousness crept into Chantal's eyes. Katrina smiled down at her sister, awaiting her response. All that worked out of her throat was a sound of primal rage. The giantess flung herself at Katrina, knocking her into an apartment block. They fell in a heap, small fires erupting and lightning bolts raining down from a suddenly cloudy sky. People ran in panic as two giant bodies flailed in the wreckage.</span></div></div>",

Katrina quickly jumped up and rained lightning down on her sister's location. She didn't know what would kill her and didn't really care. Maybe she would have to dispose of the other before schedule. Power was already creating problems, and she hadn't even been able to do anything with it yet. Life just wasn't fair. Katrina noticed several burns on her arms from where her sister had touched her. She called down a rainstorm to soothe her skin and her temper. Looking at her situation from an unemotional standpoint, she realized she would have to kill her sister. The planet just couldn't support two beings of their size and stature, and if her sister decided to play by pathetic human morals she could potentially kill her. Katrina allowed her arms to scale over and turn to claws. She walked across the destroyed street to her sister's smoldering body. Katrina grabbed hold of her hair and lifted her head. She stretched three fingers across her throat, taking a moment to grin at the surviving news helicopters. When she was done here, she'd give the reporters a one on one interview with her teeth. Katrina realized she hadn't actually eaten a person yet. She was behind her sister in something, which was unacceptable. She quickly jerked her hand across Chantal's throat, waiting to feel the blood gush from severed arteries and veins. Instead, her fingers scraped against thick dragon scales. Katrina grinned. Her sister's transformation was complete. She didn't want to kill her just now, it would make her seem weak for the cameras. Maybe morality had a tiny bit of substance to it when dealing between goddesses. Katrina would go somewhere else and reign terror. Her sister would come around eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina fanned out her wings and took to the air. The helicopters tried to dart away, but they were no match for her superior maneuverability. She snapped one out of the air with her jaws and swallowed it in an instant. Her wings beat another to the ground. The third and final one was downed by an electrical storm. Katrina flew off, her job done. She would leave the storm as a reminder to Chantal. She would come for Katrina. But in the time between, Katrina could go level another city or three. She glanced sadly down at the one she was leaving. It would have been so much fun to level this one.</span></div></div>",

Time to get out and earn your keep, ya giant freak!\" A man in a flame-retardant suit called down to a giant sleeping form in the darkness below. Shadows shifted as something truly massive awoke from its slumber. Two blazing eyes sprung open, and directly below them glaringly white teeth stretched into a grin. Then the being rose to its full height. She stared eye-to-eye with the man on the catwalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too Jerry! I'm fairly certain your healthcare doesn't cover eaten by giant dragons, did you develop suicidal tendencies over the weekend?\" The giantess replied good naturedly. Behind the mask, Jerry grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a glorified zookeeper, my medical plan is this suit. Anyway, they want you upstairs again. Some unfortunate villagers in some 3rd world country need to get fried again. Apparently they couldn't just send a tank, a stronger message must be sent this time. Just like last time. And the time before that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the one in charge of the deadliest weapon in human history, you're very anti-war. How did that come to be?\" Chantal jabbed back, beginning to stroll towards the elevator at the other end of the cavern. As the lighting improved away from her sleeping area more of her form came into view. Her skin at the moment was a pattern of reddish-bronze scales. She was wearing a black bikini to cover her nipples. Two large batwings grew from her shoulders, and a tail sprouted from her lower back. Her body was as full as anyone could want, with a pair of supple breasts and full hips. Her face was surprisingly attractive, razor teeth and all. Her long black hair seemed to be scattered with orange embers. Jerry jogged, trying to keep up with the giantess. When she reached the enormous elevator, he turned and gave her a salute before activating the platform. Laughing, she returned the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal structure raised the 200-foot tall giantess out from her comfortable cave and into the open air. Crowds of cheering people surrounded the structure housing the elevator, wonderfully supportive of the giant killing machine. Waving right back, Chantal spread her wings as wide as she could. With an ear-shattering roar, she took to the air amid the crowd's tumult. A squadron of F-16s flew with her out over the ocean.</span></div></div>",

She waved her wings, making her whole body bob up and down while she waved hello. The flight leader waggled his wings back as they flew out over the ocean. She dove towards the sea, feeling the spray frm the water whip against her face. Regardless of how she came to be the way she was, she was happy it had happened. Her new form had brought on things she could never have imagined as a normal human. Between scorn for humanity's weakness and resentment for their power over her, Chantal occasionally felt bad they would never experience flying outside a plane. She flapped her wings again, sending up great plumes of water. She laughed, and spun away just in time to avoid smashing a small sailboat with her breasts. Eyeing the fighters, she began to angle herself upwards. Maybe they'd have time for a practice dogfight before getting to the carrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had eyed the first fighter, preparing to make her pass. Gently, she pushed herself forward to get within range of a low-heat burst of flame. All of a sudden, the jet kicked in afterburners and shot away from the giantess. Two more streaked by right over her head. They usually let her 'shoot down' one of them before reacting. But then she heard a strange keening in the air behind her. She whirled just as a giant, steel-gray circle whirled past faster than the jets. She watched a turret on its top track one of the fighters as it tried to come around for a pass at the machine. The cannons recoiled, causing a visible sonic blast as the shells tore through the air. One of the two shots went wide, the other tore the back half of the plane off. Chantal thought she saw a form shoot out, but there was no chute. She dove after the ejected pilot, trying to find someone through the wreckage. All of a sudden something flew into her mouth and caught in her throat. She jerked to a stop and coughed it up. Then she tried juggling the pilot's chair as it hurtled from between rows of razor-sharp teeth. With brief jokes and reassurances, she gently held the man in her claws and flew back towards the craft. It hovered in midair, looking for more targets. Three of the surviving fighters descended from the direction opposite the cannon. It spun around at their approach, but too slow. A small swarm of missiles swam through the air towards the craft. Most were destroyed by onboard Gatling cannons but three made it through the hail of lead. Two detonated harmlessly against armor plating, but the third caused an eruption of black smoke. The machine began to climb skyward, firing after the fighters. A shell shredded another plane, and the shrapnel from the disentigrated craft badly damaged the others. They broke off and headed towards the carrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal had almost reached the ship by the time it noticed her. She was under the cannon's angle of depression, and easily managed to land heavily on the outer hull. One of the automated defense turrets looked up at her, spinning up. She smashed the weapon, easily tearing the barrels out. She began to pound on the hull trying to find a weak point. Everything seemed too solid even for her immense strength. She breathed fire as hot as possible, and the hull began to heat to an angry red. But before lasting harm could be done, her breath sputtered and died. Looking around, she saw how thin the atmosphere was getting. Her pilot cargo had an oxygen tank, but she was far too exposed. A being her size needed lots of oxygen too. With a final blow, her vision going dark, she leapt off into the air. When she could take in enough air to stay conscious, she headed off in the direction the damaged planes had flown. She picked up another of the pilots, this one ejected after the plane had given out from damage. Ten minutes later she set foot on the ship's deck</span></div></div>",

The crew of the ISS watched their graceful flight through space. Even the best human ships couldn't match a third of these aliens' capabilities. Even though they were slower in the atmosphere, their armor and weapons more than compensated for their bulkiness. When they began to reach rooftop height and hover, guns descended and fired randomly at the streets below. France surrendered instantly as the Eiffel Tower was destroyed by a stray cannon shot. Raptors streaked through skies above Washington D.C., Chicago, and New York to defend the civilians in the streets below. A few saucers were badly damaged before the defenders were struck down. Clumsily, they set down in parks and wide streets. They sat there, steaming, like brooding predators. As their still-flying counterparts ravaged the world, they silently prepared for the next step. After local police had been eliminated or isolated, the few grounded craft opened massive ramps. Legions of soldiers marched out of the craft in perfect lockstep, wielding deadly, futuristic-looking weapons and clad in armor as black as the void they descended from.</span></div></div>",

Nuclear powered and fully submersible, it could hide in the depths of the seas for months and emerge anywhere to rain destruction. Its contingent of planes ranged from strategic nuclear bombers to a large number of drones. Occasionally, it even added a dragon to its contingent of flying vehicles. And today was one such day. Chantal flew over the sunken carrier's location a few times, awaiting the vessel's surfacing. Minutes later a huge shadow rocketed up from the depths. Gallons of water cascaded off the decks, and Chantal gently glided in for a landing. The water hissed and steamed where ever she stepped as the huge amounts of heat radiating from her body evaporated the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the conning tower a group of three men in dark suits emerged. They walked over to the dragoness's feet, seeming little more than insects next to Chantal. They shouted some form of orders up at her face, struggling to be heard over the whine of the ship's pumps ridding it of water. Thankfully, a small communication device implanted in Chantal's ear allowed her to hear the commander's orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A small group of well-armed militiamen have seized control of some towns in (Insert Middleeastern or African nation here). As usual, go in and clear the towns of hostiles. Preferrably, we'd like a few to talk to this time.\" The man ordered, his imperious town coming in tinny and hollow through the receiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any civilians in the area? if so, to what extent should casualties be prevented?\" Chantal replied. She did not make a habit of killing civilians, but when there were crowds of them in the way and you were a 200 foot tall fire-breathing giantess, some inevitably got crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All except the soldiers accompanying you are to be considered enemy combatants. We've given you the locations of the insurrections, any more questions can be answered on the way.\" Having no more questions, Chantal spread her wings and returned to the air.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The small, sandblasted village appeared to all who viewed it, deserted. It existed around a small well, surrounded on all sides by a desert trying its best to grind the patch of life from existence. All the buildings, from squat, one-story hovels to a large 4-story hotel were the same shade of dusty tan. The cars were old and rusty, and the only ones currently in motion were the dozen or so pick-ups with machine guns hastily welded to the bed. These were the only outward signs of life easily visible. To one equipped with advanced surveillance techniques, they would see well-camoflagued sharpshooters, a few cars suspiciously weighted down, civilians whose robes concealed more than their decency, and more than the standard amount of people inhabiting the dwellings. Pvt. Jenkins was equipped with these surveillance techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay under a camo-mat next to a tiny bush. Slowly panning his binoculars across the horizon, careful not to let sunlight reflect off the lens, he took in all the defenses the militants had thrown together. He was impressed. For a group of farmers to so rapidly assemble a formidable arsenal such as this took skill. Their weapons, while not top of the line, we're certainly comparable to even his own assault rifle. The explosive-laden cars would make most tankers think twice about charging in head-on. Those few who didn't would find themselves without a tank in short order. Stealthily, he slipped off the ridge and back to camp. It was a small group of tents sheltering a mechanized regiment charged with restoring order to the area. Making his report to the colonel, Jenkins described everything he had seen and his assessment of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry son, by night we'll have this thing under wraps and we can go home. Just talked to command, and we're getting the works on this one. Some kinda heavy unit. Should be here any second,\" The Colonel said, his drawl indicating heritage from somewhere in the Southern U.S. Suddenly, the group was startled by a loud thud and a small tremor that shook the frail tent. A gust of wind sent the tent flaps fluttering, and voices outside picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hell?\" The Colonel said questioningly. Grabbing his sidearm, he stepped outside. He almost destroyed his pants, but then realized his mistake. Laughing uproariously, he strode towards the giant dragoness perched among his tanks, making them look like toys next to her colossal form. He noticed a number of soldiers rushing forwards, weapons raised against the new threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry boys, I think it's on our side!\" he called. Addressing Chantal, he said \"You are, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, 'It' prefers to be referred to by 'she', 'Chantal', or wordless screaming. And if I wasn't, you'd know,\" the drain replied. \"But anyways, I'm here to solve your problems with the insubordinate villagers. I'm taking the closest one first. Wait an hour, then start heading over. Don't try and come in while I'm still busy, it will end unfortunately for all involved. Well, excepting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Chantal spread her wings and lifted off, sending storms of dust flying everywhere. The Colonel put his hands on his hips, muttering after her \"I'll be damned\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe target below Chantal was pitiful. Why she'd been called in was beyond her. Regardless, it was a day our. Orbiting at several hundred feet, the giant woman assessed the threats and decided on her plan of attack. As usual, nothing that overly concerned her. So she went for the brute force approach. Three enemy technicals were on patrol together through the center of town. Folding her wings back, Chantal dove towards them with terrifying speed. The air blowing past her scaly face and the adrenalin rising in her blood got her as excited as always just before she started her work. The enemies barely saw what hit them. One caught a glimpse of the growing shadow and started to raise his gun, but an enormous clawed foot came down one his truck. Chantal almost left a crater as she evicerated the two outer vehicles with her feet. The middle one found itself grasped in her powerful talons. Chantal eyed the gunner, clinging for life onto his weapon, and bit down. The gunner, his gun, and part of the truck found themselves inside the dragoness's mouth. They were quickly reduced to smaller, swalloable mixtures as her vicious teeth set to work. The driver tried exiting, only to fall about fifty feet and die. Chantal roared, sending ice through the blood of every soldiers and militaman present. So they attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBullets pinged off Chantal's scaly hide. This always made her laugh, as it almost never worked. Another technical roared around the corner a block away from her. It's gunner fired wildly, thrown off by the sheer size of his target. In response, the giantess blew forth a jet of fire. It washed over the truck, burning flesh, paint and metal. In moments, the vehicle was a heap of slag. Chantal then slowly washed her fire over the nearby building. The brick blackened and cracked under the heat, and nothing alive inside had a chance to survive. When the building was baked to a cinder and the gunfire hadn't slackened, the dragoness realized it hadn't been staffed with troops doing their hardest to try and kill her. Signing it off as collateral damage, she carried on.</span></div></div>",

One or two towers came almost up to her chest, and the intrepid sharpshooters there tried shooting at the giantess's eyes. When one nearly hit his mark, Chantal tired of them. She walked the few blocks over to the tower, crushing a cluster of sheet-metal huts on the way. Correctly assuming it was too late to run, the sniper kept shooting at the oncoming giantess. Chantal laughed at his bravery. When she was right on top of the tower she parted her enormous breasts, enveloping the tower. Then she allowed them to come crashing back together, raining shattered masonry on the streets below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn RPG arced out from the roof of a building at her feet. It missed by a mile, but Chantal had to discourage such bravery when she could. She tried to grab the shooter in her jaws, but he dove through a door on the roof too quickly. Instead, the dragoness placed her mouth over the entrance and blew fire down the staircase. The windows exploded outward as gouts of flame poured from every opening in the building. The titaness kept flaming the building until the superheated stone cracked and melted and the screaming died down. Finding this method effective, Chantal repeated this process on several other buildings. When the soldiers discovered they were too vulnerable inside, the began pouring outside in huge amounts. She could hardly believe this many men were crammed into such a small town. However, none of them had yet to run. Chantal sighed in frustration. Instead of causing a panic and then killing the bad guys as they ran, she'd probably have to level the entire town. Almost a quarter was already in flames. But if she had to focus on one block at a time, some of her targets might escape. Her superiors might tolerate the needless slaughter of civilians, but not the continued survival of one enemy. So the enormous being spread her wings and took to the skies. Chantal circled the town, setting the entire outskirts on fire. Already a group had started to run for the hills and escaped her ring of fire. Keeping an eye on them, Chantal finished her job and then lazily glided over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe refugees were climbing a small hill when a shadow fell over them. Moments later, a shockwave knocked them down as the giant dragon tormenting their village knocked them over. A scaly arm shot out, snatching up several terrified people. They quickly disappeared down the giant being's mouth accompanied by screams and horrifying crunching sounds. A scaly foot landed on another clump of unfortunate refugees, crushing them into the sand or sharp talons slicing the rest to ribbons. The last handful were roasted alive by the giantess's fire breath. Laughing,Chantal took off again. Maybe is wouldn't be so bad.</span></div></div>",

The higher-ups did want prisoners this time, but there <i>was</i> more than one town on her hit list. She could wipe out at least one of them without getting chewed out. And in any case, she had an audience! And to give them a show like this, with no big finale? It was just criminal! Smirking hugely, a few stray drops of blood falling from her fangs, she made her way back into the burning town...making sure to swing her hips with every step, to give the soldiers watching a good show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantel walked through her own ring of fire, flaring out her wings just as she entered the town. \"Might as well go for dramatic effect,\" Chantel mused. With a sweep of her tail, she demolished an entire block of tin-sheet houses, creating a flying wall of debris that cut through a pick-up truck that had somehow gone unnoticed in her intitial rampage. The vehicle was cut clean in half, sending the cabin flying away from the bed and the unfortunate rear gunner sprawling in the sand. The man feebly tried to drag himself away, only to be crushed into a red paste under a scaly foot as Chantel strode over to the other half of the truck, still swinging her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's not good,\" the dragoness taunted as she bent over to snatch up the truck's cabin in her claws, trapping the driver inside. \"I don't think your insurance will cover that, fella.\" Smiling, she ripped the driver's side door off, and held the wreck up to her eye, getting a good look at the terrified man inside. Chantel laughed, making sure to show the man her blood-stained fangs. \"Huh. For a black guy, you look awfully pale right now!\" She tilted her head back and opened her mouth wide, dangling the truck cabin over her gaping jaw. \"Well, time to meet the rest of your shithead friends!\" she announces jovially, shaking the wrecked truck. The poor driver was knocked loose and fell screaming onto her tongue. Chantel resisted the urge to chew, enjoying his flavor for a moment before she closed her mouth and swallowed him whole, tracing his path down her throat with a finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, he's a real fighter--squirming up a storm,\" Chantel noted. She crushed the truck cabin in her hand and threw it at a larger building like a baseball. It smashed through the facade like an oversized bullet, and knocked through a support beam. The entire building imploded three seconds later, sending forth a cloud of dust and plaster in all directions. Chantel smiled so wide it hurt; she'd almost forgotten how fun this could be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlaring her wings out once more, Chantel pumped a fist into the air and let out her best roar. \"I <b>FUCKING LOVE THIS JOB!!</b>\" She exulted, and geared up to srpay fire into the air....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she felt bullets impact square on her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the ineffectiveness of the attack, Chantel actually <i>yelped</i> at the feeling of lead striking her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon or otherwise, getting shot in the ass was <i>embarrassing as all hell</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling with righteous indignation, she looked behind her, at the cluster of scrap-metal shacks. A small cluster of gunmen were running like merry hell out of them, firing sporadically into the air as they tried to flee the gargantuan dragon-girl that had descended on the town like a nightmare from hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut \"nightmare from hell\" was an inadequate title for Chantel at that moment. For now, she was not simply enjoying her mission, getting rid of some two-bit band of thugs. Now, she was a woman who had been embarrassed in front of her comrades. And as Shakespeare said, '<i>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!</i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why Chantel decided that these jackasses deserved something <i>special.</i> A fate that went beyond what everyone else in this run-down excuse for a village had suffered. Besides, she'd secretly wanted to do this ever since she'd gotten huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling devilishly, Chantel took quick steps back and to the side, keeping an eye on the fleeing gunmen. When she was sure her aim was right, she bent her knees and leaned back, laughing into the air as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fleeing men looked up just in time to see sixty metric tons worth of bikini-clad scaly <i>Gluteus Maximus</i> crash down onto them. It was actually a good view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantel wriggled her rear, making sure the men were good and dead. Satisfied, she stood back up and nonchalantly stomped the last few buildings to rubble. She flapped her wings to extinguish the ring of fire that still encircled the town, and casually strolled back over to the camp over the ridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the soldiers had seen the while spectacle, and were appropriately gobsmacked. One of them produced a notepad and pen, and struggled to ask her for an autograph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well boys, that's one town accounted for. You can move in!\" She announced cheerfully.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Giantesses can have many forms when it comes down to monster mutations. Godzilla look alikes, robots, etc\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but now I think it is time we try a Dragon (if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already tried before, then sorry then) and this time, why not we make it with a human face, 200ft tall, and a 18 year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl is Chantal, and she is one sexy bitch. 18 years old, pale skin, long black hair with the middle part cut to show a split, cute face of a 10-12 year old girl, red eyes, huge F cup breasts, etc\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 just a dream girl I want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she graduated from high school, she got a job as a researcher for a Biological Weapon Experiment company in Los Angeles (her home), and she was a good enough person to get such a job when it comes down to creating giant monsters, etc. One day\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 an accident happened when they were making a Dragoness Weapon that would make anyone into a 200ft giantess with dragon wings, tails, and red scales (except their faces), and gives them powers and a horrible look as a result, somehow\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the experiment substance was slipped and in came into contact with Chantal, and do you want to know what happened\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. She turned into a 200ft humanoid like dragoness. Red scales all over her body (except her cute and now monstrous face), her fingernails and toenails where turned into claws and fangs, her eyes become darker, her scream turned into a roar, her teeth got sharper, she grew a black tail that she can control, and soon her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal also soon learn some abilities that she can use from her new form, like she is able to breath fire like all other dragonesses, use her tail to grab stuff, fire small fire rockets, meteor blasts, blow her wings to rip off buildings, etc\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but she has one unique ability that makes her really special. She can return back to her normal form at any time, while still having the giantess size of 200ft tall. She even has a mix form, where her dragon wings, and tail are present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was of course terrified at first, and thankfully she was wearing a bikini at the time when it happened so she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had any nudity when her mutation happened, but then there was a secret to her new form that made her both glad she had her beauty, and terrified at the same time, she cannot age any further than 18 in terms of looks as the mutation infected her growing gene, so she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grow any further then her 18 year old age, but she does have quick health regeneration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the government and her city adjustes to her, ba,ba,ba... why should I care here on that explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChantal might be a sexy devil of a beast, but you decide her route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: While this is a 18+ interactive, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go overboard with the sexual stuff, it just makes me feel unpleasant when it happens every other chapter, at least keep some balance intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: There are to be no nudity, she has to at least wear something as I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want a bunch of perverts looking her nude even in her dragon form, etc. A bikini will be good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: No male giants<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4: No gay or lesbians, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support that shit at all, and I vow in my life\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that if I catch anyone breaking this rule, your chapter will be removed immediately upon reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5: Vore will only be in the Evil Route, sorry\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but other routes aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good for it, but Evil works the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6: They can be more than one giantess in the story, but the same rules apply to them as well, no overload sex, no nudity, no lesbian, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7: Free adds and GP will be awarded for good additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8: Depending on the route, people can support her, or be in fear of her, so be respectful for which route you choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9: Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. No scat, I just had a negative experience with it, and it just digustes me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso: Make sure to check out my friend Redhurricane's interactives Monster Arms and Monster Shores<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1927548-Monster-Shores\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1927548-Monster-Shores</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1897471-Monster-Arms\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1897471-Monster-Arms</a></td>",
