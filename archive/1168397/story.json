Stay.. calm.\" Jack meditated on as he sat on the couch of his home, staring at the television which held a constant beep as the signal error played across the screen.  Jack hand his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands as he rustled his fingers through his hair.<br>\r\nJack rose his head again and looked outside his window, seeing the setting sun and the night approaching.  The smoke and ash which filled the sky made the sun nothing but a blur on the horizon, the night not darkening some areas of the city as they were lit by huge fires and the like.<br>\r\nJack lived in a relitively rural area of town, the night bringing darkness as the street outside was lit by a buzzing street light.  The giant glow outside was that of the plagued Raccoon City, lit up like a christmas ornament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack calmed himself down, hoping to hear the comforting sounds of police sirens yet none came immediately.  He figured all police force must be concentrated in the city itself and not the outskirts like where his one-story home was.<br>\r\nJack wiped his face once more as if something were on it, then standing and walking to the bathroom and looking into the mirror clamped onto the medicine cabinet.<br>\r\nAfter a while of meditating on his image, Jack ran the tap on the sink, a hissing sound made as only little spurts of water came out.<br>\r\nJack turned the tap back off and walked back to his couch, looking out the window again, hoping he was just imagining the whole thing.  He wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack decides that he needs to..</span></div></div>",

From either lack of food and water or something else may happen to him, Jack was still in the dark about the situation.  Jack only knew that the scnario that was playing out was a horrible one.<br>\r\nJack went to the coffee table near the front door of his home, and grabbed his car keys.<br>\r\nThe jingling of the keys made him feel a bit better, as though he were a child and were entertained by the noise.<br>\r\nThe noise reminded Jack as if it were a normal day, and he was going out for groceries and not to escape.  A fierce howl in the distance soon brought him back to reality.<br>\r\nJack stepped out into the cold air of night, the grass on his lawn still green and lucious, this also gave Jack some peace at mind.  Jack went around the right corner of his house, stepping cautiously as he peeked around the corner, he wasn't sure what could be around the corner.  It could be the boogey man for all he cared, he just knew he woke up one afternoon on the couch and the city was a war zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack saw his car underneath the metal tent he had installed to keep leaves from a nearby tree from blowing into his car's hood and coming through the air conditioning system.<br>\r\nJack made a fair amount of money, his vehicle showed it, it was a sporty car; black, with a convertable roof.<br>\r\nJack stepped towards his car when he stopped, noticing..</span></div></div>",

He turned around slowly, hesitant to look at whatever it was, Jack was greeted by a lumbering man limping towards him.  Jack let a sigh of relief as he figured it was just one of his neighbors, coming to ask what was going on.  Jack soon lost his state of comfort when the man's upper body came into light of the newly risen moon, visible more clearly now.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god..\" Jack whispered to himself, looking at the man skulking towards him, the man's mouth was pasted with red, dripping with yellow fluid.  The man's eyes were disturbing and dry, fixed on him.  The ghastly being's shoulder also was bare, the crusted clothing around it had been torn, and the flesh on his shoulder had been tore out into a dark mess, flesh hanging and red gore dripping from the man's shoulder yet spastic movements noted that he had not lost control of the arm.<br>\r\nThe limping beast froze Jack in his tracks, just staring as the creature limped ever closer before Jack..</span></div></div>",

Jack started the car, turning the key hard as the engine roared into animation.  Jack took a deep breath and said a silent prair as he held the breaks on his front wheels and got his back wheels warming up, spinning them as the noise confused the lumbering creature as it let out a echoing moan.  Jack's heart skipped a beat as he heard the moan, he also dazzled himself into thinking it was right next to him as he let go of the break as the car jumped into movement..<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\nJack broke through the gate of alluminum and was tearing through his back lawn, quickly collecting himself and turning a sharp left to head onto the road.  The baffled creature stood there, watching the car speed away as it returned to it's moaning song of agony.  Jack was in a cold sweat, he made it onto the road with a bump from coming off the side walk.  Jack slid onto the right lane, and sped towards the intimidating city as it glew a dim orange.<br>\r\n\" I have to get help.. \" Jack thought to himself, fantasies of a well-armed police force ready to welcome Jack into their protection brought him hope.

The small girl no older than eight holds her remaining arm up in protest before the front of Jack's car slams into her. Jack is blinded as the airbag deploys into his face. The sound of screeching tires come to an abrupt stop as the car slams into the bed of a pickup truck.<br>\r\n\"Ugggghhhhh\" Jack blurts out pushing the bag down gaining his perception of the situation. The sound of silence is soon objected to with the beating of the little girl hand. She groans slamming her fist down onto the hood swaying side to side. Her body's fluid's mix with the antifreeze causing a slurry of red and green with run onto the ground. The girls screaming grows louder and Jack Pushes onto his door. Lucky it only gives slight resistance, and he steps out onto the street.<br>\r\nLooking around Jack sees a cluster of buildings most of them abandoned or without  of business signs in the windows. The sight of a convenience store causes an aching in Jack's belly that has him taking steps towards the store without thinking. The unmistakable sound of groaning off in an alley way in front of him stops Jacks walking. Jack sees a man,  in his mid 30's with his back turned to Jack, gnawing on a carcass and seems to have not noticed Jack yet. Looking forward to Jack can see that the door to the convenience store has been pushed open. If he can just sneak by the man, he can get in the store and close the door behind him.</span></div></div>",

You decide to reach forward from your car and try to remove the half-body from your window. As you reach forward the body's eyes snap open, and it starts thrashing and biting at you, the arms reaching forward and the fingers grasping onto your shirt. It yanks on you, throwing you slightly off balance, and pulling you closer, as it pulls itself forward. You reach into your back pocket and pull out a knife case. You yank the knife from the case and thrust it forward, driving the blade deep into it's arm actually noticing the blade break through to the other side. You drag the blade further down it's arm, cutting through the skin and bone. You frown as the beast still keeps thrashing and grasping and at the fact there is no blood seeping from the fresh wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to pull out the knife from its arm and realize it's stuck....<br>\r\nDo you</span></div></div>",

All its struggles stop the instant it penetrates the skull, and you breathe a sigh of relief. You drag the slab of meat off your car, but when you turn around you see two Asians staring at you. You freak out and almost lunge for them, but realize they both are weeping. There is a younger girl, and an old man dressed in a Japanese army uniform. He puts out a hand and yells \"Stop! We are not demons! I recognize these creatures from experiments I have seen and from movies. They are turning more people into demons by biting them and spreading the sickness,\" at this he took a deep breath and rolled  up his bloody sleeve. \"I have been bitten, but have slayed many! I do not wish to die as a beast. I will still see Hell's light, but I shall greet the a man. Please...take care of my Akika for me. She is all this foolish old man has left.\" The tears rolled down this old man's wrinkled cheeks. The girl, Akika, sobbed uncontrollably. He murmured something reassuring to her in Japanese. She nodded, still weeping.<br>\r\n     \"Please assist me in Seppuku. I will stab myself in my stomach, you must remove my head.\" You paled, and began to refuse but his eyes grew steely. He handed you a gleaming, bloody, sword. The soldier took a dagger from a scabbard. Quickly, he jabbed it deep inside his stomach. In his last moments, he gazed at you imploringly, the life draining from his eyes. Sterling yourself, you swung the sword and neatly removed his head. The girl sobbed as you led her to the car.</span></div></div>",

Further down the road were more zombies wandering about along with several burning buildings. He knew a gun would be vital if he wanted to survive long so he headed towards the nearest gun store, which was located inside a mall about 7 miles away. Jack made a sharp turn and narrowly avoided a group of zombies that were wandering across the road. He was fairly close now, only 3 miles left.

George had been back from vacation for about two days before everything started going to shit, so his fridge was pretty stocked. I looked through all the kitchen drawers trying to find grocery bags, garbage bags, anything i can use to carry the food over. I continue looking and then freeze to a thumping sound  in the hallway by the living room. I put everything down and reach for the revolver tucked in my pants. I pop it it open to make sure that it's loaded,\"It's got five shots,\" i think to myself. I make my way to the threshold of the kitchen to the hallway but not passing it. I'm scared. Do i really want to know what's around the corner. I slowly, hesitantly, shift my head towards the corner and I peek around the corner. Nothing. I let out a sigh of relief and BAM! i here it again. There is something in the closet. I walk towards the closet and there's blood on the doorknob, a bloody hand print slightly to the left and a big splotch a little lower than my shoulders and a trail of blood on the floor leading toward the living room where George was, dead. George closed this door. George forced something into his closet and then proceeded to killing himself. The note.

She's not one of the kids at her school more interested in popularity and fashion, and she's not one of the slower kids she just has a hard time understanding and that has reflected in her recent grades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkika walks down the lit street, glancing at her watch, 10:06. The bus will be here in 9 minutes. Her hair swaying from side to side as she walks, a slight hunch from the weight of the books in her backpack, making her 5'2 stance look even shorter. The wind is making the mid May night feel unusually cold for a school kilt but she wears it well. Akika comes to the bus stop at 10:13 hoping that the bus hasn't passed early. She has been getting in these late night study sessions lately and the bus driver, Mr. Kent has been nice enough to wait for her 2-3 minutes the few times she's arrived late. 10:17... Maybe he's late tonight, Akika takes a seat in the bus shed and pulls out a chemistry book while she waits. The book seems so big in her lap. 10:34, she got so caught up in her reading that she didn't realize that not only was Mr. Kent really late tonight, but the bus that was scheduled to come after him was late aswell. \"What the hell is going on?\" Akika packs up her bag and prepares for a 12 block walk to her apartment. She considered calling her roommate for a ride at first but 10:30, her roommate was either out on a date right now, or at home having sex again. It was like a routine for her so Akika decided to let it be and began her walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11:46, only 4 blocks to go. Akika's feet were killing her. She would just sleep when she got home, maybe well into tomarrow and just forget about her classes. As she walked by an alley she could see the shadow of two people, one on top of the other. \"Even homeless people need love I guess\" she said to herself as she shuddered a little bit, but a shrilling moan from one of the people stopped Akika in her tracks. As she turned around she seen the man crawling out from the alley covered in blood. Barely able to pull himself he locked eyes with her and stretched out a hand to her. Akika's immediate reaction was to jump back and begin a run, but she stopped and looked back again, not knowing what she could do to help him, but not wanting to leave him there.</span></div></div>",

Even an old preacher, still holding a partially obscured bible in the front pocket of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all descend upon her and, with relish, begin to feast.  They seem to be drawn, like lightning to a lightning rod to her head.  They quickly begin pounding and clawing at the remains of Akika\u2019s sweet face tearing apart her bony skull in search of their prize deep inside.  With the sound of splitting flesh and cracking bone, they finally reach their treasure, her brain.  It is quickly consumed, and they begin working on the rest of her body.  Within an hour, Akika is barely recognizable as a human, let alone a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours after her death she has been completely consumed. Neither bone, flesh, nor hair had escaped the feast.

The dagger itself was beautiful, a sharpened 6-inch blade with a golden handle, and a gold-laced steel sheath to go with it. It was the only protection she could muster from her luggage, and the only item she felt she needed, as it was handed down from her family for generations. She would not leave it. She kept it hooked the belt of her jeans, for now.<br>\r\nAs they entered the elevator and descended, Laura sternly asked again the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's this disease, infection or something going around town,\" Cameron started. \"People are... well, they're not themselves anymore.

Well, hop in and I'll get you to an exit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gazed through the back window at this man. He was looking at his feet with his head down.

Going to school is hard work! That last college took forever and you almost fell asleep in class. All those things about law and psychology, I mean, come on, who cares! Thomas opens a can of beer and takes a sip. Its 19.30 right now, according the hourwork above the diner table. You have to hurry actually. On 21.00 you have a date with a \"very voluptuous woman\" and you still need to make dinner and go to the store. Not to mention, the place is a serious mess. No woman would be willing to set a foot in this apartment right now. Still, Thomas feels too tired to get off the couch right now. Time to order a delivery pizza again and you hope that your roommate will clean the mess again. He's a good guy and after a little of \"persuasion\", you have no doubt he will do it. Guess you will have to use your natural born charms to persuade her to spend the night at her place. But for now, the only thing you want to do is rest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's 20.13 as you look at the hourwork again. Oww, you totally forgot to order a take away pizza. Guess you will have to do that right now. But the telephone is out of your reach right now. If you want to use the telephone, you will need to stand up. Hmm, not now... Just one more beer, then you will get into action. It's not that you are lazy or anything, Thomas Rhelk is an amazing athlete actually. You are an outstanding goalkeeper. Ohh, how you love to play football outside. And you mean real football, European, Australian, Asian, African, South American football... You like any sport with a ball or something like that. As long it doesn't look or feels like work. Work is an unnecessary evil which people can avoid. Well, you can... People call you lazy. You aren't in your opinion. You just don't see the need to do some things other people do. So in essence, you just don't agree with most people, but doesn't that just make you special? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's 20.41 as you take the last sip of your beer. You finally decide to stand up and order a big pizza. It will take at least 15 minutes to deliver the pizza! Maybe you should have order the pizza sooner... No problem, no problem, you've had these situations before. In these 15 minutes, you can prepare for your date already. You hastely put on some new flashy cloths your parents bought for you. You couldn't do without them, since you don't make money yourself. You spray some expensive looking parfum on you and brush your teeth. As you leave the bathroom, you put some chewing gum in your pocket. Can't do without. You try to clean some of the worst mess, but it's hopeless. There's no way you can clean it up in time, but you try to be as effecient as possible. As you are busy to dump all of the trash on the sink into a big plastic bag, the bell rings. It's 20.57. Would it be the delivery pizza or did your date arrive? You look in the mirror for the last time and nod to see everything is good. \"It's game time.\"</span></div></div>",

Not only to make a good first impression, but to avoid curious looks in your apartment. It won't do any good if she will see the mess. \"Hello hotness.\" You look at her with a seductive gaze and use your best English accent. You were right. She has a body to die for. And she is smiling at you. Another one, down for the count. Right, time to reveal the fact that you still have to eat. But you will do it nice and smooth... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry by the way? Just in case, I ordered us a big and nice pizza, cause I am a good host. I couldn't stand to see such a cute face hungry.\" \"Well, I just ate, but I'm always willing to dine with such a gentleman.\" She winks at you! That means she fell for it; Damn you ARE good. Right, now you will have to convince her to leave this place. No problem at all. She's cute, but she's not the brightest one around, you can tell. \"What is your name beautiful?\" \"Jenny Stamford and you?\" Hmm, seems she is a bit shy. This is getting easier by the minute. \"Thomas Rhelk, at your service.\" You try to flirt with her, but she turns her head away after a few seconds. She is blushing. \"I, I'm sorry Thomas, it's not you, it's me! I never went on <br>\r\n<br>\r\na date before!\" You try to comfort her. \"Its nothing dear, everyone has to start once right?\" \"Yes, you are right, I'm sorry.\" \"Don't worry Jenny dear, I, Thomas Rhelk, promise that you won't need to feel uncomfortable the rest of the evening. Just ease up a litte, listen to me and go with the flow and let the good times roll.\" She nods in approval. This is great, just play it cool and you will end up in Jenny's bed tonight. Right around then, a delivery boy appears. You pay him and take Jenny's hand. Care to join me for a walk? There's a beautiful place in the park nearby where we can eat, chat and maybe a little more...</span></div></div>",

She doesn't do more but to nod in approval. You lay her hand on her legs and kiss her on the forehead. Remember, start slow but keep your eyes on the price. That's exactly what you do. Those breasts, that ass, that face, how could this be her first date? Has everyone gone blind? You move your hand up a little more, but no reaction from Jenny. It seems she doesn't even notice yet. The two of you talk a bit more. It seems she had very strict parents; No boyfriends, no relations, nothing of the sort yet. Her parents were acting very conservative, strict and protective. She just moved to Raccoon City on her own to find out about life herself. \"You are a very good listener Thomas. I'm glad I've met you.\" Truth to be told, you already forgot half of it. It doesn't matter, she won't notice anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, it starts to get dark. Jenny turns her head to you. \"Ohh it's getting dark already. I have to go back, I'm having college again tomorrow!\" You on the other hand, couldn't care less. There's no way you let her go right now. \"But Jenny, hon, don't you have fun right now? You look at her with your \"disappointed puppy face\". She immediatly turns red again. \"Ohh no, Thomas, it's not that, it's just... It's getting late and...\" You grab her hands and look her in the eyes. \"I promised you to give you the evening of your life right?\" She nods. You stand up and look her in the eyes again. \"Let me tell you a secret.\" You give her a serious look. \"I actually have no experience with girls also. \"No way...\" She looks at you happily. \"We are actualy like soulmates right?! <i> Riiight</i> \"Yes we are my lovely lady. Listen Jenny, I have a proposal, listen carefully.\" She nods again. \"Let's go into town and experience things together!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you stand up and walk outside the park, hand in hand. \"Where are we going Thomas?\" \"I heard a roommate of me tell about a great place to hang out. Let's check it out.\" \"Sure.\" In the meantime, you got your hands closer to the jackpot again. \"Say hon...\" \"Yes Thomas?\" \"Have you ever tried something called like alcohol?\" As you both walk into town, night has fallen over Raccoon City. The night can bring a lot of surprises, but the events that are about to happen will change the rest of your whole life... </span></div></div>",

The two walk down the side walk, being as big a city that Raccoon City is, many lights and places are still alive with people and the like.  Across the street Thomas noted a man running in a panic up to a group of other people and tell them something, he couldn't make a word of it out due to all the noise in the middle of the city streets but after he got done telling whatever it was he was telling them, the whole group turned away from what they were just doing and followed the worried looking man away around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas shrugged it off, grinning at Jenny again as she seemed to not respond, or even acknowledge his expression as she stared forwards as they strode down the sidewalk until they came up to a neon lit entrance way with blackened windows from the outside.<br>\r\n\"Here we are babe!\"  Thomas said, really laying on the accent in that as he brought Jenny a bit closer and then pointed with a free hand to a bright green lighted sign, <i><b>The Brass</b></i>, it was a jazz club which was very noticeable as the two walked in and were greeted with very low paced and soft saxophone playing from a live artist on a stage across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny seemed to like the place, her face lit up a bit as they walked in and the two got seated near a window that faced the street and sidewalks.  \"So, what do you think?  Pretty nice eh?\"  Thomas said as he gave a quick wink to Jenny who seemed more engrossed in the sounds and atmosphere as she then looked over to Thomas with a grin.  \"This place really is great!\" Jenny smiled as she just seemed to be enjoying being in the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then a waiter came up, a young girl in a violet apron and black formal skirt with a white button up tucked tight in her dress.  \"What can I get you two?\" The girl said as she whipped out an order pad and pen, Thomas gave another sly grin to Jenny and then looked back to the waitress.  \"I'll have a martini, basic, dry.  How about you Jen?\"  Thomas said without looking over to her, the waitress piddled something down and then looked over to Jenny as she quickly snapped out of the trance she had herself in and blurted out, \"Oh!  Water.. just water please!\"  Thomas looked disappointed now as he had hoped Jenny would be ordering something strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat in relative silence for the bit, the music was relaxing but quickly broken as several police cars sped down the street with their sirens and lights going all out.  Thomas looked out the window with a look of worry.  Jenny seemed relatively calm, not paying much attention to the armada of police engines that just sped by, of course until she heard them all stop relatively close and the opening of closing of doors was in repetition.  Even the jazz player stopped in concern, everyone in the club looked out at the window as the room was intruded by the lights of the police cars. </span></div></div>",

Only \"3 Love Potions of Thomas\" and you already got her wasted. And since you are such a great gentlemen, you promised to take her home safely. Now you both got to her apartment. It's a typical student living apartment. Well, at least she has her own place to stay. Now she will be dependent on you. She stumbles in and crashes on the floor while you close the door behind you. You shake your head and try to collect her from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing Jenny?\" \"Fi-fine, fine Thomasss\". She keeps clinging on you though. You have no choice but to hold her, since she can't stand on her own legs anymore.

You are here to stay... Ofcourse, she is willing to kill you tomorrow. Or the opposite, she is in love with you. But that's the least of your worries right now. You are gonna get fucked tonight and that's all that counts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Jenny?\", you say to her with a seductive voice. \"Yes, hon?\" She just stares at her ceiling right now with her arms spread all over the bed. This is perfect, she won't be able to put up some resistance at all right now. \"Did you liked how we used to experience all the time tonight?\" \"Yes, ofcourse honey, I will never forget it, ever!\" She turns her head at you and smiles. \"Well, if you really liked it, then maybe we can do something else tonight...\", you say. \"Ohh, what Thomas, what? I can't wait!\" You grin and start to strip off your cloths while you walk over to the bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome minutes later, you and Jenny start to make love on the bed. She seems a little surprised and held back at first, but right now, you make her moan with pleasure. You too, have the time of your life. This is a night to remember! Right around then, some idiot starts to bang on the door. Distracted for a little while, you stop your business and look to the door of her apartment. Screams are coming from outside. Again, you can hear someone bang on the door. \"Let me in, let me in!\", you hear. Under you, Jenny only noticed that you stopped. She looks at you with a begging and confused look in her eyes. \"Ahh what the heck...\" Your not in the mood to play games with drunken idiots right now. You are tempted to scream something like \"Fuck off, i'm busy right now\", but that would only ruin the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile more screams come from outside, you resume what you were doing. Outside the screams take an even more desperate tone, but you couldn't care less. There's this wonderfull woman below you and...

She will probably have one hell of a hangover tomorrow and maybe get angry with you. No big deal, you've dealt with this before. A bit of acting and some flattery will get you anywhere. Although it is 4 o clock already, you can't get to sleep right now. You decide to stand up and pour yourself a glass of scotch. As you put some ice cubes in the glass and pour the liquid into the glass, you take a look over your shoulder. Jenny is sleeping in your bed with a satisfied smile on her face. You heave your glass and take a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers babe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly remember something vague about screams coming from the front door. You put some comfy cloths on and decide to take a look, just out of curiousity. It wouldn't be the first time you would find some drunken student on the other side of that door. The people in this neighbourhood also have the reputation to like drugs. The other day, Dave, a friend of yours, told you he managed to take some dried mushrooms with him, from his little trip to Amsterdam... Maybe some poor bastard had a bad trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to open the door something blocks the door from opening. O yeah, the key. Where did you leave it? You take a quick look around. It's on the chair where you left some of your cloths from last night. You try again and unlock the door. You stare outside. That's strange. Usually, you can see all the lights coming from the center of town. Neon commercials, streetlights, light coming from houses and other appartements... Nothing of the sort. Compared to the usual night in Raccoon City, it's completely dark. You can hear some faint screams and the sound of cars a bit further away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you notice that your socks are all wet. Strange, it hasn't rained the past few days. You take a look to the ground to you that you stand in a puddle of red liquid! Blood?! You take a look at the door. A pair of bloodprints are on your front door! By the shape, you can tell the prints were made by human hands. Ohh wait, that's what it is. You had a bit of a fight with the folks three doors to the left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny guys, very funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you notice the traces on the ground. They are made of blood and lead to the stairs... What the hell is going on here?</span></div></div>",

Lets hope you can she won't make a big fuss when she wakes up and lets hope you can dump her as soon as possible. For now, you have other things to worry about. You take a look outside again, ignoring the blood or fake blood for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts awfully quiet. Usually, you can see and hear a lot of activity, even around 4 o clock in the morning. This is a city that never sleeps. Its probably nothing and if you go to bed again and wake up, all you have to worry about is a probably pissed off girl. It is starting to get cold, so you jump over the puddle, pull out your socks and throw them in the sink. There are still red stains on the bottomside of your feet. Meh, it will dry soon enough. Tomorrow morning, you will see where the footsteps will lead you. If it leads to the guys 3 doors to the left, they will be in for a rough time... Just in case, you lock the door and put a chair in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk to your bed again, for all you want to do is sleep now. Inside your bed, Jenny is still fast asleep. She is still cute, even when she sleeps, but its against your policy to date or sleep with the same girl twice... Tomorrow, you will deal with everything, but right now, nothing else can bother you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, you crawl under your sheets again next to Jenny.

There was a few dim figures now at the top of the hill where the two women just came from, though they weren't running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what that was all about?\" Thomas said as if to make it out to be a joke until a police car came around the corner with his sirens blaring as he parked right up on the sidewalk next to Thomas and Jenny who were viewing the park from a distance.  A young, well cut police officer jumped out of the car and pulled his handgun instantly which made Thomas jump back a bit, letting go of Jenny and even putting her between him and what he thought was a psychotic cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police officer looked at the two and then to the hill with a sweat dripping down his brow, \"You two need to leave this area now!\"  The police officer said with a demanding voice as he turned and to Thomas and Jenny's surprise shot off two rounds at the hill, one of the advancing silhouettes dropped over and rolled down the hill a distance.

The sickening moans and the screams aren't dieing down any time soon.  The nightmare is just beginning, and it doesn't plan on ending.  You must survive, at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacter Choices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Conway (Age: 30) : A real \"Average Joe\" who works out of the home.  He is well built, as he exercises daily for health reasons.  He stays calm in most situations, but the current dilema has him breathing heavy.  He is very good at improvising and thinking on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkika Tsugi (Age: 19) : A student at the local all-japanese school.  She isn't as up to par as the other students, she isn't a slacker she just has trouble understanding the material half the time.  She is a bit cowardly, and self-serving, but she has a caring side and she can come through in the most dire times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn Barl (Age: 42) : A biological engineer for Umbrella Co.  He is still at the laboratory while the epidemic is going on at full swing.  He has eye problems so he wears fairly thick glasses, he is incredibly genius, and he has a great understanding of the mutations, though not the creatures it has spawned.  He is incredibly selfish and greedy.  A real \"Get in get out\" attitude with no time for side distractions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura Brady (Age: 23) : Just getting out of college, Laura is your typical modern college graduate.  She tries to keep herself healthy with a good diet and regular exercise.  She recently has just bought an apartment in the middle of the city and still hasn't unpacked all her things.  She is a fast thinker but her will to take orders from others, even though they may be for the better is a bit lacking.  Laura is a real leader, though she lacks in the \"team\" concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas Rhelk (Age: 22) : Didn't have the best grades in school, was a real \"Lady's Man\".  Tom always liked to slack off and pal around with his friends.  Tom tried college but quit after four months, a dislike for the atmosphere having him aspire to be a police officer, though before he was off to the trials of the academy the epidemic stopped him.  He can act tough but he is a coward at heart, the situation has him in a panic.<br>\r\n___________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: Weapons such as guns are scarce, and more so is the ammunition for them.<br>\r\nThe object is to survive, not to kill everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nCharacters can meet.<br>\r\nCharacters can die.<br>\r\nCharacters can escape.<br>\r\n(None of this needs to happen soon in the story.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEscaping should only happen after about 70+ chapters of a pathway for a character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep things realistic, these people are in a hellish scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will reply to all additions made to the best of my ability, plus I will be adding on myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******I have noticed 200+ views.. and less than 50 entries.. though this is completely your choice, I'd really like some additions made.********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****I am on Writing.com EVERY week, usually EVERY day for a bit, I WILL see your chapter as I have this turned on to send me an email when additions are made.*****</td>",
